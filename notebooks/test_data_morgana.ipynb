      "Question: What is the new evidence about when humans first lived in North America?\n",
      "Answer: A recent study has dated stone artifacts to 16-20,000 years ago, which pushes back the timeline of the first human inhabitants of North America by at least 2,500 years before the Clovis period. These artifacts were found at the Gault Site in Central Texas and show a previously unknown, early projectile point technology that was unrelated to Clovis.\n",
      "Context: ['Gault site research pushes back date of earliest North Americans\\nJuly 20, 2018 (Reno, NV) – For decades, researchers believed the Western Hemisphere was settled by humans roughly 13,500 years ago, a theory based largely upon the widespread distribution of Clovis artifacts dated to that time. Clovis artifacts are distinctive prehistoric stone tools so named because they were initially found near Clovis, New Mexico, in the 1920s but have since been identified throughout North and South America.\\nIn recent years, though, archaeological evidence has increasingly called into question the idea of \"Clovis First.\" Now, a study published by a team including DRI\\'s Kathleen Rodrigues, Ph.D. student, and Amanda Keen-Zebert, Ph.D., associate research professor, has dated a significant assemblage of stone artifacts to 16-20,000 years of age, pushing back the timeline of the first human inhabitants of North America before Clovis by at least 2,500 years.\\nSignificantly, this research identifies a previously unknown, early projectile point technology unrelated to Clovis, which suggests that Clovis technology spread across an already well-established, indigenous population.\\n\"These projectile points are unique. We haven\\'t found anything else like them,\" said Tom Williams, Ph.D., Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Anthropology at Texas State University and lead author of the study. \"Combine that with the ages and the fact that it underlies a Clovis component, and the Gault site provides a fantastic opportunity to study the earliest human occupants in the Americas.\"\\nThe research team identified the artifacts at the Gault Site in Central Texas, an extensive archaeological site with evidence of continuous human occupation. The presence of Clovis technology at the site is well-documented, but excavations below the deposits containing Clovis artifacts revealed well-stratified sediments containing artifacts distinctly different from Clovis.\\nTo determine the ages of these artifacts, Rodrigues, Keen-Zebert, and colleagues used a process called optically simulated luminescence (OSL) dating to the ages of the surrounding sedimentary material. In OSL, researchers expose minerals that have long been buried under sediment layers to light or heat, which causes the minerals to release trapped potassium, uranium, and thorium electrons that have accumulated over time due to ambient, naturally occurring radiation. When the trapped electrons are released, they emit light which can be measured to determine the amount of time that has elapsed since the materials were last exposed to heat or sunlight.\\n\"The fluvial nature of the sediments deposited at the Gault Site have created a poor environment for preservation of organic materials, so radiocarbon dating has not been a useful technique to apply in this region,\" said Kathleen Rodrigues, graduate research assistant in DRI\\'s Division of Earth and Ecosystem Sciences. \"This made luminescence dating a natural choice for dating the archaeological materials here. We are really pleased with the quality of the results that we have achieved.\"\\nThe study was published on July 11th in the journal Science Advances and is available here: http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/7/eaar5954.\\nFor more information on DRI\\'s optically stimulated luminescence dating capabilities, visit http://www.dri.edu/luminescence-lab.\\nJayme Blaschke of the Texas State University Office of Media Relations contributed to this release.\\nThe Desert Research Institute (DRI) is a recognized world leader in investigating the effects of natural and human-induced environmental change and advancing technologies aimed at assessing a changing planet.

         "Anti-AMA1-C1 antibody responses were dose dependent and observed following each vaccination, with mean antibody levels 2-3 fold higher in the 20 μg group compared to the 5 μg group at most time points.",
         "['A Phase 1 trial was conducted in malaria-na?ve adults to judge the recombinant proteins vaccine apical membrane antigen 1 C Mixture 1 (AMA1-C1) developed in Montanide? ISA 720 (SEPPIC, France), a water-in-oil adjuvant. experienced quality one or two 2 regional reactions. All related systemic reactogenicity was quality one or two 2, except 1 example of quality 3 malaise. Anti-AMA1-C1 antibody reactions IC-83 had been dosage noticed and reliant pursuing each vaccination, with mean antibody amounts 2-3 collapse higher in the 20 g group set alongside the 5 g group for the most part time factors. growth-inhibitory activity was a function from the anti-AMA1 antibody titer. AMA1-C1 developed in ISA 720 can be immunogenic in IC-83 malaria-na?ve Australian adults. It is tolerated reasonably, while some transient, serious, and late regional reactions have emerged. 1. Intro Malaria continues to be an initial reason behind mortality and morbidity in kids, with around 881,000 malaria fatalities in 2006, the majority of that have been in sub-Saharan Africa . A vaccine that decreases both mortality and morbidity supplementary to infection will be a beneficial new source in the fight this disease. Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1), a surface area protein expressed through the asexual and sporozoite phases of development inhibition activity against homologous parasites was up to 96% in a few malaria-naive adult volunteers [9,10]. Nevertheless, CPG 7909 can be a book adjuvant which has not really been examined in babies and small children, the seek out other effective adjuvants and formulations is warranted thus. IC-83 Montanide? ISA 720 (ISA 720) can be a water-in-oil adjuvant [11,12] that induces high antibody titers in a number of animal species, most likely due to development of the depot in the shot IC-83 site that hypothetically produces the immunogen as time passes. The maker, Seppic, Inc. recommends formulations having a droplet size of just one 1 m while optimal for stability and immunogenicity approximately. It’s been shown how the addition of glycine or glycylglycine aids in preventing antigen changes and a droplet size of just one 1 m could be reliably attained with a homogenization approach to formulation . ISA 720 isn’t an element of any accepted individual vaccine but continues to be found in many prior trials of applicant malaria vaccines [14-25]. Worries about serious and delayed regional reactions, linked to particular formulations perhaps, antigen dosage, and shorter dosing intervals, possess slowed development. This scholarly study may be the first Phase 1 trial of AMA1-C1 formulated in Montanide? ISA 720 (AMA1-C1/ISA 720). The trial was prepared for 12 volunteers in each of three dosage groupings primarily, 5, 20 and 80 g, to get three vaccinations at research times 0, 84, and 168. An audit unrelated to the study was executed during the trial and elevated concerns about documentation of procedures at the site where formulation occurred. For this reason, the trial was halted by the sponsor after the 5 and 20 g groups had received 2 vaccinations and only 4 subjects had received the first vaccination with the 80 g formulation. This documentation issue did not affect stability or potency of the vaccines, which were shown to be stable and potent in assays IC-83 conducted every six months through the course of vaccinations. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1 Study Design This study was conducted by Q-Pharm Pty at the Queensland Institute for Medical Research/Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital in Brisbane, Australia, and was an open-label Phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of AMA1-C1/ISA 720 in healthy malaria-na?ve adults. Eligible volunteers were sequentially recruited and vaccinated in 3 dose cohorts of 12 volunteers each, with vaccinations planned to be given at Day 0, Day 84 and Day 168. In both the 20 and 80 g dose groups, a subgroup of 4 volunteers were planned to be vaccinated two weeks before the remainder of the group to add an extra margin of safety. The study was conducted under a protocol reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), the Western IRB, and by the Queensland Institute of Medical Research-Human Research Ethics Committee. The study protocol was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for review within Investigational New Medication (IND) program BB-IND#13381 with Clinical Studies Notification towards the Australian Healing Goods Administration, relative to local regulations.

         "Catalyst substrates can be made from materials including cordierite, silicon carbide, metallic foils, alumina sponges, porous glasses, and mixtures of these materials. These materials must be able to operate at temperatures up to 1,000°C, withstand exposure to various gases like hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, and have sufficient surface area and structural integrity to support the catalyst.",
         "[\"This disclosure relates to a method of manufacturing a catalytic converter.\\nCatalytic converters are typically employed for the oxidation of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and the reduction of oxides of nitrogen in automobile exhaust gas streams. A catalyst disposed on a frangible substrate is supported within the catalytic converter to facilitate the oxidation and reduction process of the exhaust gas stream. During operation, the exhaust gases pass over the substrate and contact the catalyst where the amount of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen are reduced. The temperature of the catalyst is typically between 750° C. and 950° C. and may be higher depending upon the location of the catalytic converter relative to the engine of the automobile. To lessen the effects of this high temperature, a support material cushions and insulates the catalyst material from a housing in which the substrate and catalyst are mounted.\\nThere are several common conventional methods for making catalytic converters; the “clamshell” method, the “tourniquet” method, and the “stuffed” method. In the clamshell method, the internal end-cones and insulative material are cut to conform with each clam shell half, and the halves of the shell are assembled together by a welding process. The catalytic converters made by this method have reduced durability due to the poor control of the mat support material density.\\nThe “tourniquet” method comprises wrapping the shell around the catalyst substrate and support mat assembly. The shell is formed by welding the edges while the assembly is squeezed at rated pressures calculated to optimize the support mat density. The end-cones are then welded to the shell assembly to form the catalytic converter. Although this method also has the disadvantages of increased cost due to the number of components that have to be processed and also the added cost of welding wires and gases, it claims improved mat density control.\\nThe “stuffed”(with welded end-cone assemblies) method comprises wrapping the catalyst substrate in the insulative support material and stuffing it, under pressure, into a preformed round shell. The end-cone assemblies with the insulating material are fitted and welded to the shell assembly to form the catalytic converter. Conventional welding techniques have been commonly used to form these catalytic converters.\\nConventional welding techniques involve the application of heat to localized areas of two metallic workpieces, which results in a uniting of the two workpieces. This type of welding may or may not be performed with the application of pressure, and may or may not include the use of a filler material. The drawbacks of conventional welding techniques include the creation of a high amount of heat that risks damage to the parts being welded. Another drawback is that dissimilar metals and workpieces of different gauge thicknesses cannot be joined, thereby limiting the materials used in forming catalytic converters. Lastly, these conventional techniques are expensive since they require a welding process that consumes welding wires and costly welding gases.\\nAccordingly, there remains a need in the art for a method for manufacturing a catalytic converter that is easily welded and cost effective.\\nThe deficiencies of the prior art are overcome or alleviated by the method of producing a catalytic converter.\\nA method for manufacturing a catalytic converter comprising disposing a first end around a second end and disposing an induction coil around the first end. Discharging a current through the induction coil and forming eddy currents on the outer surface of the first end.

Discharging a current through the induction coil and forming eddy currents on the surface of the first end. Magnetic impulse welding the first end and the second end together such that the first end disposed around the second end comprises an endplate end disposed around an end of a shell or wherein the first end disposed around the second end comprises the shell end disposed around the endplate end.\\nReferring now to the figures, which are meant to be exemplary, not limiting, and wherein like elements are numbered alike in several figures, in which:\\nFIG. 1 is cross sectional side view of an exemplary catalytic converter.\\nFIG. 2 is a partial side view of an exemplary catalytic converter with a pipe.\\nFIG. 3 is a cross sectional view of an exemplary catalytic converter, taken along lines 3-3 of FIG. 2.\\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\\nFIG. 4 is a cross sectional view of an exemplary catalytic converter, taken along lines 3-3 of FIG. 2.\\nA catalytic converter, for use in an engine emissions control system, generally has a catalyst substrate with a catalyst that can be concentrically disposed within a shell. A mat support or insulating material can be disposed concentrically around the catalyst substrate adjacent to the shell. For “stuffed” catalytic converters, the catalyst substrate is wrapped in the insulative support material and stuffed under pressure into a preformed, typically round, shell. The end cone assemblies, endplate, exhaust manifold, or the like, with the insulating material, are fitted and welded to the shell assembly to form the catalytic converter.\\nReferring to FIG. 1, the catalytic converter 10 contains a catalyst support material (or substratum, or substrate) 12 disposed within a mat support (or insulating material) 14 and further disposed within a shell 16. Two endpieces (end cones, exhaust manifolds, or endplates) 18, 19 are attached to the shell 16 on either end of the catalytic converter 10.\\nThe catalyst substrate 12 can comprise any material designed for use in a spark ignition or diesel engine environment and have the following characteristics: (1) capable of operating at temperatures up to about 1,000° C.; (2) capable of withstanding exposure to hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and/or sulfur; and (3) having sufficient surface area and structural integrity to support the desired catalyst. Some possible catalyst substrate materials include cordierite, silicon carbide, metallic foils, alumina sponges, porous glasses, and the like, and mixtures comprising at least one of the foregoing materials.\\nAlthough the catalyst substrate 12 can have any size or geometry, the size and geometry are preferably chosen to optimize the surface area in the given converter design parameters. Typically, the catalyst substrate has a honeycomb geometry, with the combs being any multi-sided or rounded shape, with substantially square, hexagonal, octagonal or similar geometries preferred due to the ease of manufacturing and increased surface area. Furthermore, the catalyst substrate can comprise various overall, rounded or multi-sided cross-sectional geometries such as round, elliptical, hexagonal, octagonal, and the like. Catalyst substrates may also have various peaks and valley surface features.\\nThe catalyst substrate 12 will preferably have the greatest number of cells that is structurally feasible so that the inner surface area of catalyst substrate is maximized. The surface area of catalyst substrate should also be sufficient to support a sufficient amount of catalyst(s) to effectively catalyze exhaust gas streams flowing therethrough, with the surface area being a function of the surface design of gas passages, the volume of the substrate, and the effective density of the substrate. These parameters may be adjusted according to the design needs, taking into account both the desired shape of the catalytic converter and optimal paths for exhaust gas flow.\\nDisposed on and/or throughout the catalyst substrate 12 is a catalyst for converting exhaust gases to acceptable emission levels as is known in the art. The catalyst material can be applied over the entire surface area or selected portions depending upon the several factors, including the structure of the catalyst substrate, the catalyst's properties, cost, catalyzing reaction conditions, gas passageway flow conditions, and the like. The catalyst may comprise one or more catalyst materials that are wash coated, imbibed, impregnated, physisorbed, chemisorbed, precipitated, or otherwise applied to the catalyst substrate. Possible catalyst materials include metals, such as platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, ruthenium, tantalum, zirconium, yttrium, cerium, nickel, copper, and the like, as well as mixtures, oxides, and alloys comprising at least one of the foregoing catalyst materials, and other conventional catalysts. Disposed around and concentric with catalyst substrate 12 is a mat support material 14 that provides support to the catalyst substrate 12 during operation of the catalytic converter 10 and thermal insulation for the shell 16. The mat support material may be any material capable of insulating the catalyst substrate and preferably capable of holding the catalyst substrate in the desired location while being inserted into a shell. The mat support material can be a formed fibrous material containing vermiculite, refractory ceramic fibers, organic binders, and other conventional materials, as well as combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing materials. The mat support material can either be a simple non-expanding ceramic material, or an intumescent material, e.g., one which contains a vermiculite component that expands with heating to maintain firm compression when the outer steel expands outward from the catalyst substrate, as well as material which include a combination of both.\\nThe thickness of mat support material 14 will be dependent upon the temperature of the exhaust gas and the catalytic converter's application. For instance, the catalytic converter for a spark ignition environment will require a mat support material having a thickness that differs from the catalytic converter operating in a diesel environment. As the exhaust gas temperature range increases, the thickness of mat support material 14 typically increases accordingly to meet customer skin temperature requirements. Generally, the mat support material thickness is about 2 millimeters (mm) to about 12 mm preferred for most automotive applications. Additionally, the peripheral dimensions of each catalyst substrate and customer skin temperature requirements will determine the preferred length and width of the mat support material.\\nThe mat support material 14 is disposed concentrically within the shell 16. Suitable materials for the shell can comprise any material that is capable of resisting under-car salt, temperature and corrosion. Some ferritic materials, such as, stainless steels including the 400 series, e.g., grades SS-409, SS-439, and SS-441, are generally preferred. The choice of material depends upon the type of exhaust gas, the maximum temperature of the gas and catalyst substrate, and the like.\\nReferring now to FIG. 2, a portion of a catalytic converter 10 is illustrated. The shell 16 comprises an end 20 that can be joined with a first portion 15 of endplate 18. The shell 16 can be joined with the endplate 18 at weld joint(s) 22, such that the end 20 can be disposed around, about, surround, or encompass the first portion 15 of endplate 18. An alternative embodiment includes having an endplate disposed around, about, surrounding, or encompassing a shell. A second portion 17 of endplate 18 can further connect with a pipe, cylinder, conduit, duct, or tube 30. Tube 30 can be disposed around (as shown in FIG. 2) or within the second portion 17 of endplate 18. The joining of these items can be achieved by any conventional welding practice, as well as by magnetic impulse (or pulse) welding.\\nMagnetic impulse welding is based on the use of the interaction of magnetic fields produced by an inductor through which an impulse of high intensity current is passed. The parts to be welded are positioned in spaced relation to one another. This method can be used for obtaining overlapping welded joints of thin-walled parts having different thicknesses and made from different materials without melting.\\nIn the process of magnetic impulse welding, the surfaces of metals approach each other and collide with high relative velocity. To magnetic impulse weld a catalytic converter, a magnetic impulse welding apparatus including a capacitor bank, an inductor, and a high current switching device can be used. Referring to FIG. 3, a cross sectional view of a catalytic converter 10 and a tube 30, taken along lines 3-3 of FIG. 2, within an inductor or induction coil 40 is provided. The tube 30 is positioned around the endplate 18, such that the tube 30 has a larger diameter than endplate 18. In the alternative, the endplate 18 can be placed around the tube 30, such that the endplate 18 has a larger diameter than the tube 30. During welding, a current can be discharged through the induction coil 40 to create eddy currents on the surface of the tube 30. The magnetic force collapses the tube 30 at a speed sufficient to collapse the tube 30 onto the endplate 18, creating a weld. Multiple welds can be completed on the same workpiece. For example, the endplate 18 can be welded to the shell 16, as illustrated in FIG. 2 at the weld joint 22 or in the alternative, the endplate 18 can be welded around shell 16.\\nThis method requires a current created in the induction coil of greater than about 750,000 amperes, with up to about 1,000,000 amperes preferred. Generally, the time to weld using this method is less than about 50 microseconds. This method can be used to join two workpieces made of steel, however it may also be used to join dissimilar materials, such as steel to aluminum.\\nThis method of magnetic impulse welding can also be used to size the shell onto the mat support material surrounding the catalyst substrate to produce a desired mat density within the catalytic converter. As illustrated in FIG. 4, the catalytic converter 10 is placed into an induction coil 40. A current is discharged through the induction coil 40 to create eddy currents on the surface of shell 16. The magnetic field will shrink or collapse the shell 16 about the mat support material. This process removes the problems associated with mechanical sizing, for example, tool wear, part contamination, measuring problems or expense.\\nThis method employs a current created in the induction coil of greater than about 200,000 amperes, with up to about 300,000 amperes preferred. Generally, the force created is sufficient to shrink the shell about the mat support material. The time to size a workpiece using this method is less than about 50 microseconds. This method of producing a catalytic converter will solve the problems of costly and time consuming manufacturing processes. This process is high precision allowing for greater control (repeatability). It can also be used to join round objects or dissimilar metals. Magnetic impulse welding creates a strong attachment between materials and springback is minimal since there is a permanent deformation of the materials. This process requires no filler materials and takes much less time to complete than the conventional welding process, while generating little or no heat. Use of magnetic impulse welding also provides the benefit of welding and sizing of the catalytic converter at the same station.\\nWhile preferred embodiments have been shown and described, various modifications and substitutions may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the apparatus and method have been described by way of illustration only, and such illustrations and embodiments as have been disclosed herein are not to be construed as limiting to the claims.\"]",

He also serves as senior public health advisor to the Secretary. At the Office of Public Health and Science, he leads an array of interdisciplinary programs relating to disease prevention, health promotion, the reduction of health disparities, women’s and minority health, HIV/AIDS, vaccine programs, physical fitness and sports, bioethics, population affairs, blood supply, research integrity and human research protections. In these various roles, he is dedicated to the mission of creating better public health systems for prevention and care so that all people can reach their highest attainable standard of health.\\nDr. Koh previously served as the Harvey V. Fineberg Professor of the Practice of Public Health, Associate Dean for Public Health Practice, and Director of the Division of Public Health Practice at the Harvard School of Public Health. At Harvard, he also served as the principal investigator of multiple research grants related to community-based participatory research, cancer disparities affecting underserved and minority populations, tobacco control and emergency preparedness. He was also Director of the Harvard School of Public Health Center for Public Health Preparedness, which promotes education about bioterrorism, pandemic influenza, and other emerging health threats. He has published over 200 articles in the medical and public health literature.\\nDr. Koh served as Commissioner of Public Health for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1997–2003) after being appointed by Governor William Weld. As Commissioner, Dr. Koh led the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, which included a wide range of health services, four hospitals, and a staff of more than 3,000 professionals. In this capacity, he emphasized the power of prevention and strengthened the state’s commitment to eliminating health disparities. During his service, the state saw advances in areas such as tobacco control, cancer screening, bioterrorism response after the September 11 attacks in 2001 and anthrax, health issues of the homeless, newborn screening, organ donation, suicide prevention and international public health partnerships.\\nDr. Koh graduated from Yale College (where he was President of the Yale Glee Club) and the Yale University School of Medicine. He completed postgraduate training at Boston City Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, serving as chief resident in both hospitals. He has earned board certification in four medical fields: internal medicine, hematology, medical oncology, and dermatology, as well as a Master of Public Health degree from Boston University. At Boston University Schools of Medicine and Public Health, he was Professor of Dermatology, Medicine and Public Health as well as Director of Cancer Prevention and Control.\\nHe has earned numerous awards and honors for interdisciplinary accomplishments in medicine and public health, including the Distinguished Service Award from the American Cancer Society, the Drs. Jack E. White/LaSalle D. Leffall Cancer Prevention Award from the American Association for Cancer Research and the Intercultural Cancer Council, and the Dr. Harold P. Freeman Lectureship Award. He is an elected member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. President Bill Clinton appointed Dr. Koh as a member of the National Cancer Advisory Board (2000–2002). A past Chair of the Massachusetts Coalition for a Health Future (the group that pushed for the Commonwealth’s groundbreaking tobacco control initiative), Dr. Koh was named by the New England Division of the American Cancer Society as “one of the most influential persons in the fight against tobacco during the last 25 years”. Other awards include being named to the K100 (the 100 leading Korean Americans in the first century of Korean immigration to the United States), the Boston University School of Public Health Distinguished Alumni Award (the highest award of the School) and an honorary degree from Merrimack College. In recognition of his national contributions to the field of early detection and prevention of melanoma, the Boston Red Sox designated him a “Medical All Star” (2003) which included the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park.\\n- M.P.H., 1995, Boston University School of Public Health\\n- M.D., 1977, Yale University School of Medicine\\n- B.A., 1973, Yale College\\n- \"Assistant Secretary for Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\".

         "Marcel Duchamp perfected the concept when he made a series of ready-mades - completely unaltered everyday objects selected by him and designated as art.",
         "['A large number of artists in the Landfillart project have incorporated found objects in their artworks to make statements about re-cycling. Some of the especially interesting examples in the Landfillart Collection can be seen in the post from May 24.\\n“The use of ‘found objects’ has been incorporated into fine art since the early 1900s — long may it continue. Maybe this great project will educate the world in general about recycling, re-use and a way of seeing these ‘useless objects’ consigned to the trash bins.” Mary Bridget Cooke, Cork, Ireland\\nAll That Glitters Isn’t Gold\\nby Mary Bridget Cooke, from the LandfillArt Collection\\nPart of a fascinating tradition in modern art…\\nOriginally coming from the French term objet trouvé, found object describes art created from undisguised, but often modified, objects or products, not normally considered art.\\nBefore the 20th century unusual objects were collected in cabinets of curiosities, but it was only in the early 20th century that found objects came to be appreciated as works of art in their own right. In fact Picasso was the first publicly to use the idea when he pasted a printed image of chair caning onto his painting titled Still Life with Chair Caning (1912).\\nIt is generally accepted that Marcel Duchamp perfected the concept several years later when he made a series of ready-mades — completely unaltered everyday objects selected by him and designated as art.\\nObjets trouvés are often used as raw material in assemblages, and Antoni Gaudí, for example, used broken pieces of pottery to cover exterior surfaces in the Park Güell buildings (1900–14) in Barcelona.\\nThe Development of Collage in Cubism also saw more use of found objects\\nPicasso and Braque, in particular, used real items in their paintings and constructions as a way of commenting on the relationship between reality, representation and illusion.\\nJoseph Cornell’s mysterious and highly personal box constructions, which consisted largely of objets trouvés, were first presented in the context of Surrealism at MOMA in New York.\\nThe use of found objects was quickly taken up by the Dada movement, being used by Man Ray and Francis Picabia who combined it with traditional art.\\nArtists associated with Dada, especially Hans Arp and Kurt Schwitters, used damaged and reclaimed materials as a strong image of the futility of World War I. Schwitters, in particular, wanted to redeem the beauty and history of everyday items.\\nA Popular Tradition Today\\nSo using found objects, or objets trouvés in the creation of art is part of a popular tradition today and connects with the desire to recycle materials from landfills and dumps.\\nThe resurgence of interest in using found objects is taking many forms — some recycling and using reclaimed rubbish, relying on expendable materials, and in assemblages. However, as an art form, there is usually some degree of modification of the found object, although not always to the extent that it cannot be recognized.\\nMany modern and contemporary artists are well known for using found objects in their art. Some of the most important incloude Arman, Joseph Beuys, Traey Emin Damien Hirst, Tony Cragg, and Nam June Paik.\\n“Recycling and reusing materials in artwork has been an ongoing process and philosophy for me in my work for years…Using found objects gives me, as an artist, the opportunity to challenge my viewers to think about the world around them and how our actions affect our environment…” Neal Bociek\\nPropulsion Of The Nympho\\nby Neal Bociek, from the LandfillArt Collection']",
