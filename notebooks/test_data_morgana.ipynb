Bio-organic acids are gaining significance because of their renewability and eco-friendly nature, making them an attractive replacement for conventional organic acids in the production of polymers, food, coatings, lubricating oils, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, solvents, and other materials.\n",

These include: 1) Antibodies to or antagonists of IL-6R, such as Sant7, MRA (ACTEMBRA 200), ERBA, and NRI/Tocilizumab; 2) Antibodies to IL-6, including mouse monoclonal antibody BE-8 and chimeric antibody CNTO 328; 3) Inhibitors of IL-6 trans-signaling, such as sgp130-Fc; 4) Inhibitors of gp130, including gp130-targeting peptides; and 5) Small-molecule inhibitors, such as Atiprimod. Some of these treatments are currently being tested in clinical trials.\n"
