The Commission reported over the years 1907 to 1911, with its major recommendations embodied in the new Coal Mines Act 0f 1911. That Act mandated the establishment of mine rescue stations within 10 miles of any mine employing more than 100 persons. (A previous Royal Commission had made similar recommendations for rescue stations some 25 years previously.) The response to the Act was rapid, and within 7 years 47 stations had been set up in Britain, ten of which, besides training mineworkers in safety and rescue, had permanent full time rescue teams attached.(1)\\nWith the rapid growth of coalmining in Australia, it was not surprising that similar developments followed there. In 1909 the Queensland Department of Mines arranged to have a Mine Rescue organisation established to train men in mines rescue. In 1910 a Committee was appointed to establish a Mines Rescue Brigade in conjunction with the existing Ambulance Services and the Inspectors of Mines. The group was based at North Ipswich (2), and members of the Brigade were coalminers and current members of the Ambulance Service.\\nIn 1915 the Queensland Mining Act was amended to make provision for a Mines Rescue organisation and a Rescue Station was erected in that same year at North Ipswich, on property occupied by the Queensland Ambulance Brigade. It was not until the 1970-80 period that fully equipped Rescue Stations were erected in the developing coal mining centres in the State.\\nIn NSW, explosions occurred in 1887 and 1902 in the Bulli and Mount Kembla collieries, and in 1923 an explosion and fire occurred at the Bellbird colliery in Newcastle. Each of these incidents resulted in mine workers losing their lives, and in the absence of any form of organised rescue system, a number of well-intentioned persons lost their lives in attempting rescues. This state of affairs highlighted the urgent need to establish a Mines Rescue organisation in NSW.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1.0\n",

The optics of a CPV system are like a magnifying glass, collecting light and optically projecting it onto a small, highly efficient solar cell. These systems integrate a solar cell that in the case of Solar Junction, deliver efficiencies over 40 percent, resulting in system efficiencies of 28 percent or higher. CPV systems are being deployed due to their ability to produce energy at the lowest cost of energy in regions of high solar resource. Additionally, CPV provides the following benefits compared to other photovoltaic technologies:\\n- Maximum energy harvesting during peak power demand\\n- Systems provide maximum efficiency, yielding the most efficient land use\\n- Regions of high solar resource are typically areas of high average temperatures\\nBy comparison flat panel modules, including silicon and thin films, vary in efficiency, but are based upon the cell technology that ranging from less than 10 percent to an absolute maximum of 22%. Best available cells, in a panel provide approximately 17% efficiency.\\nHigh-Efficiency Solar Cells\\nCPV can harvest more energy and become a leading power-generating technology in regions of high solar resource. At the heart of a CPV system is a high-efficiency, multi-junction solar cell. These cells were originally developed to power satellites in space and more recently modified for terrestrial applications. The efficiency of a multi-junction solar cell provides CPV module manufactures the ability to generate the highest possible energy with the reliability needed for long term projects. CPV’s path to grid parity and beyond (equivalent cost of energy versus existing fossil fuel sources) is driven by constant improvement in cell efficiencies.\\nSolar Junction - Enabling Solutions\\nSolar Junction is commercializing our proprietary Adjustable Spectrum Lattice Matched (A-SLAM™) multi-junction solar cell architecture. The A-SLAM™ architecture provides material bandgap tunability – particularly from 0.8 to 1.42 eV - to maximize the absorbed sunlight within CPV modules, thereby increasing the efficiency and energy harvested. This unique and proprietary adjustable spectrum technology is the basis of our performance leadership throughout the next decade of increasingly efficient and industry leading cells. Our technology’s capability to adapt to customer’s optics and deployment location ensures the most efficient CPV systems are installed around the world.    1.0\n",

The beauty of solar power is that it is a renewable energy source and thus provides a win win situation concerning a sensible power alternative.\\nIf you already have solar panels installed at your property or are considering a solar power energy system then the wise move is to contact the solar professionals here at Kunini. The efficiency of a domestic solar power system is dependant on many factors and our experienced team can give valuable advice how to get the most out of your system.\\nThe Factors to Bear in Mind Concerning Efficiency\\nThe efficiency of solar panels depends on many factors, and one of the most important factors is how the system was installed. It is not just a matter of throwing up a number of solar panels on your roof, you have to bear in mind the following:-\\nHow much sunlight the panel gets.\\nThe angle of the solar panel.\\nWhether parts of the system are in the shade.\\nHow clean the panels are.\\nThe amount of electricity that can be harnessed from a panel can vary as much as one kWh/m2/day or as much as eight kWh/m2/day.\\nWhat You Can Do to Help\\nIf you have not got a maintenance agreement from the solar panel installation company you should really consider one. Here at Kunini not only can we design and install your solar panel system we can also maintain it, so it runs as efficiently as possible.\\nKeeping Panels Clean – It is essential that your solar panels are kept clean and free from dust. That way they absorb sunlight much better and are able to produce better output.\\nMake sure the panels are fixed on the most sunny parts of your property, with no trees or other buildings giving shade. Just a slight bit of shading can really affect the panel’s output.\\nTilt the panels to get the best exposure to the sun. Just like positioning your body when sunbathing to feel the greatest warmth from the sun, your panels also need to be arranged so that they are capturing as many of the sun’s rays as possible.\\nSolar Tracker – There is a device that can be fitted called a solar-tracker that moves your panels as the sun moved across the sky. This device will add to the cost of the initial installation but it helps the panels to maximize their output.                                                                                                                                    1.0\n",

I do know that if I was using Aperture, I'd be on the lookout for poor image conversions.\\nIf you know how or why this might have happened, please post a comment at the end of the article.\\nConverting color digital images to Black and White is a huge topic. In fact, my business partner is writing a 285 page book on that very subject in cooperation with Adobe right now. While I'm sure you can get similar results in Aperture, the before and after mode of Lightroom is the hands-down best color to grayscale method I've ever seen or used.\\nI normally create a Virtual Copy in Lightroom, then switch to the Before and After mode as in the image below. This allows me to see the colors I'm adjusting in the black and white counterpart.\\nLightroom has really got me excited about doing black and white photography again and I find myself converting a lot of images to black and white. If you like black and white photography, then you'll love Lightroom!\\nBoth Aperture and Lightroom have easy to use Export dialog boxes. I found it strange, though, that in Aperture I had to set the color space, resolution, and file export type in the Image Export Presets. It's not a big deal but it'd odd that you have to go somewhere else to deal with that. I suppose once you have all your presets in place, you just choose the one you want to use in the export dialog box and this becomes a non-issue. In Lightroom, all of the settings are set in the Export dialog box and just as in Aperture, you can create Presets that let you choose your export settings with one click.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.0\n",

Dancing will improve the condition of the heart and lungs, as well as test our balance.\\nHowever, to dance for any length of time also requires muscular endurance and motor fitness, and with so many different forms of dance there’s something for every pair of dancing feet!\\nThe British Heart Foundation agrees that dancing is a great way to stay in shape. Regular dancing will reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and cancer. And you’ll enjoy yourself so much you’ll forget you’re exercising!\\nRegular dancing will also help keep you trim. As you shimmy across the floor, you’ll be burning calories: in just a half-hour dance lesson, an average 60kg person will burn at least 99 calories. Of course this varies – Salsa dancing is classed as a high-intensity cardiovascular activity which can burn upto 450 calories an hour, so you’ll burn more with a lively Latino-style than beginner’s belly dancing because you’re moving more.\\nDancing helps to reduce the risk of osteoporosis because the steps put a strain on your bones, helping them to stay strong and dense. The denser your bones are, the longer your bones will remain strong.\\nOther skills you’ll develop as you learn to glide across the dance floor – poise and grace – encourage coordination, balance and muscle strength.\\nA regular dance will help to keep your mind active as well as your body. Exercise improves circulation and helps prevent oxygen starvation to the brain, and remembering complex steps stimulates the working memory. Research in the USA has shown that dancing is the best form of physical activity for keeping the brain active.\\nA study published in the New England Journal showed that regularly engaging in social dancing lowered the risk of dementia by a staggering 76% – Dancing showed the greatest risk reduction of any activity studied.\\nThe research, led by Dr. Joe Verghese at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, showed some physical activities appeared to offer little protection against dementia. Surprisingly social dancing came out on top,\\nReduced risk of dementia; Dancing 76%, Cross Words 47%, Reading 35%, Golf, Swimming and Cycling 0%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             6.0\n",

       "I'm worried about my child's vision. What are the signs of a lazy eye, and what types of vision therapy treatments are available to fix it?                        Differentiating Between Strabismus & Amblyopia\\nBoth strabismus and amblyopia affect the way the eyes work together as a team. Strabismus (crossed eye) occurs when the eyes are not aligned and one eye may appear to “wander”. Amblyopia occurs when one or both eyes cannot see 20/20 vision even with glasses.\\nAmblyopia and strabismus are 2 of the most common eye conditions that children experience, and if they are left untreated, they can have more severe problems and vision loss.\\nOur vision therapy programs can help treat binocular vision disorders, such as strabismus and amblyopia. These therapies are painless and can save your child’s vision.If you suspect your child’s eyes might not be working together as they should, please get in touch with our friendly optometrists. We can discuss your child’s vision at their regularly scheduled eye exam or between visits.\\nSo, What’s the Difference?\\nStrabismus and amblyopia are similar but are caused by different reasons. However, they’re both due to development issues as your child’s eyes grow.\\nStrabismus (crossed eyes) results in eyes that aren’t properly aligned to each other. This causes double vision or the brain can suppress the image it sees in one eye to help reduce double vision. One eye may turn in a different direction than the leading eye.\\nStrabismus affects people of all ages, but it usually develops between birth and 21 months of age. Strabismus won’t go away without treatment, and if left untreated, it can cause double vision and may result in amblyopia (lazy eye).\\nStrabismus can be treated at any age, however the longer it has been present, the longer the treatment length. Your optometrist will evaluate your child’s vision and determine the best treatment for them.\\nCommon treatments for strabismus include:\\n- Single vision or bifocal glasses\\n- Vision exercises and therapies\\n- Surgery in rare cases\\nAmblyopia is a condition where one eye does not see nearly as well as the other, even when wearing glasses. This usually occurs due to abnormal visual development during childhood. The brain will then favour the stronger eye, which can cause vision in the weaker eye to get worse.\\nYour optometrist will recommend the best treatment to correct amblyopia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              6.0\n",

Unfortunately, these things will all be useless if you don’t have the right content. You have to understand that a lot of people today are looking online. Content is the first thing that can grab their attention. The same goes for search engine algorithms, they’d most likely just rank websites with good content.\\npost8Ignoring SEO strategies\\nYou want your website to become visible to your audience. It is important that the website is going to rank. Unfortunately, 8 out of 10 Google users will not even bother checking the second or the third result page. This means that search result real estate is important in order to increase your company’s visibility.\\nNot taking the time to answer\\nEmails, private messages, and even inquiries on comment section are all important in order to please your clients or your customers. Always make sure that you answer inquiries whether it is onInstagram or on email. This ensures that your potential clients or customers are more pleased with your services.\\nNot having a modern web design\\nIt is also important that you have a proper web design that can attract your customers.

The price of failure is too high for errors or mistakes in the production process. To meet these challenges, Airbus, a European consortium producing the Airbus family of passenger aircraft, a corporate jet, the Beluga supertransport and a military transport, is moving toward a vision of the “Factory of the Future,” which employs real-time integration of various production components.\\nThe challenge for Airbus is to upgrade and update manufacturing processes where manual operations are still predominant. Manufacturing and assembly of aircraft, which involve tens of thousands of steps that must be followed by operators, and a single mistake in the process could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to fix, making the room for error very small. A typical subassembly may have 400,000 points that need to be tightened down, which requires over 1,100 basic tightening tools. Having even a single location being tightened down incorrectly could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\\n“Millions of people every year place their trust in airbus aircraft to safely travel around the world,” says Bernard Dupuis, head of manufacturing technology research at Airbus. “That requires assembly of heavy large components. But most of these processes are still manually intensive. Our ‘Factory of the Future’ is a research project aimed to employ emerging technology address this challenging requirement to increase quality and productivity and industry evolution on all programs“\\nHow This Business Opportunity or Challenge Was Met:\\nA vital component of Airbus’ Factory of the Future is to provide real-time views of its production processes. To address this need, the company has been developing a range of smart tools in conjunction with smart glasses to provide real-time streaming video to production operators.\\nInformation sent to and from these headsets is integrated with various production systems. Advanced image-processing techniques help operators to track tools, and enable them to display real-time status of processes on operators’ screens.\\n“If everything is okay we can go to the next step,” says Dupuis. “If there is a process that is failing, we are able at task that process immediately.”\\nAirbus is developing three smart tool families for different manufacturing processes: drilling, measuring, and quality data logging and tightening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    6.0\n",

Thus, this original structure would not ultimately be conducive to scalable performance.\\nWe implemented a parallel version of SP from first principles based on the distributed SP algorithm presented in . The main difference between the serial and parallel SP algorithms is that the decisions about which Boolean variables to fix to a particular value are done locally instead of globally. In the original serial algorithm, the variables that are fixed to particular Boolean values are selected globally after updating the weights for all variables. In the parallel version, the decision to fix a variable to a particular value is done with local information that does not depend on the state of other Boolean variables. For this reason, the distributed SP algorithm can be structured as a set of serial iterations over two large parallel steps – updating the weights of the variable nodes and updating the weights of the clause nodes. The fixed-point stopping conditions can be computed locally with respect to each variable and clause node.\\nOur OpenMP implementation reuses part of the code from the serial SP implementation to handle file input and output and most data structures, however, the main computational structure has been replaced with a new parallel structure as previously described. The computation is based on two main parallel loop nests that update the nodes representing Boolean variables and the nodes representing clauses. OpenMP threads will update a set of variables and a set of clauses using a block-dynamic scheme to reduce load imbalance. Each OpenMP thread has a separate condition flag to indicate whether a fixed-point has been reached. No node under the control of the thread changed its weight above the threshold. Special care must be taken to safely simplify the overall Boolean formula when a variable is fixed to particular value – not only the clauses in which the variable appears are affected, but other variables on the same clauses could have their values fixed as a consequence.\\nCray multithreaded implementation\\nOur Cray multithreaded version was derived from the OpenMP version and has basically the same computational structure. The main difference is that this version can take advantage of the memory latency hiding capabilities inherent in Cray's multithreaded processors, thus enabling very high processor utilization and scalability. However, since SP depends on a final postprocessing step executed by a traditional sequential SAT solver (Walksat), our experimental Cray version only implements the SP algorithm itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                     3.0\n",

A fiberglass bath tub is quite an within your means purchase but is less durable than cast iron or porcelain bath tubs. Cast iron tubs will virtually last you for generations but can be no question pricey also. As in the distance as looks go, nothing can stress wood and marble bathtubs, but these are very difficult to preserve and save clean. Thus, depending upon what your topmost priorities are (durability, strength, looks, cost etc), you should pick a construction material accordingly.\\nYou Might Also Like :\\n5) Type of bath tub: Bathtubs are mainly of two types – soaking or standard.

The Cook Island experience is one UNDP encourages to be shared, and we hope will be replicated by more countries. - Lizbeth Cullity ,UN Resident Coordinator & UNDP Resident Representative, Cook Islands, Niue, Samoa & Tokelau.\\nPhoto Essay on UNDP exposure\\nEnvironment and Energy News\\n- 04 Jun 2015:Resilient Coast: Climate Change and coastal living in Samoa\\n- 14 Apr 2015:Conservation of traditional knowledge through “replenishing” the environment\\n- 20 Mar 2015:Communities get involved in climate change workshop                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  3.0\n",
       "communication methods security impact business productivity                                                                                                        A few mistakes can derail a meeting, online or in-person, but it still amazes me that video, web and audio conferencing services continue to be dogged by poor attendee experiences, particularly when joining a meeting. While cost will always be a factor in IT buying decisions, companies should focus on understanding how features and functionality affect productivity on a daily basis.\\nSavings of a few dollars per month can easily be lost when meetings don’t start on time or participants can’t join because of a poor join experience or faulty invitation data, or when software installation requirements get in the way. When evaluating conferencing services, IT organizations should look at how the differences in features and functionality impact productivity. Small details matter, particularly in instances where conferencing solutions will be used with outside parties. While executives may argue an organization will get used to a solution’s particular quirks, outsiders will not.\\nThe following pointers should help organizations evaluate how product features impact meeting start times and in-meeting productivity. Measuring the impact of application behavior in relation to time spent will be critical to building a business case to spend more for a more user-friendly solution. Having an executive sponsor outside IT with measurable performance metrics, such as customer satisfaction for customer service or net new customers per quarter for sales, can be critical to building a compelling business case.\\n- Assume nothing, assume the worst, use past conferencing data, and use your own end user device management and support data to build a model to analyze cost. By having a mindset where you assume nothing, you open your evaluation to all possibilities. Since evaluations don’t have unlimited time and resources, you will need to focus on the most important scenarios, but you have to at least understand the possible scenarios and their impact.\\n- When evaluating the join experience for the video or web conferencing component, think about the software installation requirements for participants both inside and outside the organization. Will participants come from an organization with strict controls on their PC environments? If you have important business partners with whom you interact regularly, be sure you have an understanding of their environments so that the lines of communication will be smooth.\\n- Research the current web browser and device trends. Those will give you a sense of which browser and operating configurations are common, as well as the prevalence of older versions of Windows. Do you expect that your customers or partners will have Apple computers?\\n- Which mobile devices are most prevalent?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 3.0\n",
