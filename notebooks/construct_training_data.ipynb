      "The religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians were the dominating influence in the development of their culture. The Egyptian faith was based on a collection of ancient myths, nature worship, and innumerable deities. In the most influential and famous of these myths a divine hierarchy is developed and the creation of the earth is explained.\n",
      "According to the Egyptian account of creation, only the premordial waters existed at first. Then Ra, the sun, came out of an egg (a flower, in some versions) that appeared on the surface of the water. Ra brought forth four children, the gods Shu and Geb and the goddesses Tefnut and Nut. Shu and Tefnut became the atmosphere. They stood on Geb, who became the earth, and raised up Nut, who became the sky. Ra ruled over all. Geb and Nut later had two sons, Set and Osiris, and two daughters, Isis and Nephthys. Osiris succeeded Ra as king of the earth, helped by Isis, his sister-wife. Set, however, hated his brother and killed him. Isis then embalmed her husband's body with the help of the god Anubis, who thus became the god of embalming. The powerful charms of Isis resurrected Osiris, who became king of the netherworld, the land of the dead. Horus, who was the son of Osiris and Isis, later defeated Set in a great battle and became king of the earth.\n",
      "From this belief of creation came the conception of the ennead, a group of nine divinities, and the triad, consisting of a divine father, mother, and son. Every local temple in Egypt possessed its own ennead and triad. The greatest ennead, however, was that of Ra and his children and grandchildren. This group was worshiped at Heliopolis, the center of sun worship. The origin of the local deities is obscure; some of them were taken over from foreign religions, and some were originally the animal gods of prehistoric Africa. Gradually, they were all fused into a complicated religious structure, although comparatively few local divinities became important throughout Egypt.\n",

      "The mildly sedating effects of N. caerulea makes it a likely candidate (among several) for the lotus plant eaten by the mythical Lotophagi in Homer's Odyssey.\"\n",
      "This flower is often shown in the context of gatherings in Ancient Egyptian art, parties or rituals, so perhaps the trippy element is more important than at first it might appear, in this Sema Tawy scene, which is supposed to depict something political, or religious.\n",
      "N. caeruleawas considered extremely significant in Egyptian mythology, regarded as a symbol of the sun, since the flowers are closed at night and open again in the morning. At Heliopolis, the origin of the world was taught to have been when the sun god Ra emerged from a lotus flower growing in \"primordial waters\". At night, he was believed to retreat into the flower again. Due to its colour, it was identified, in some beliefs, as having been the original container, in a similar manner to an egg, of Atum, and in similar beliefs Ra, both solar deities. As such, its properties form the origin of the \"lotus variant\" of the Ogdoad cosmogeny. It was the symbol of the Egyptian deity Nefertem\n",
      "There are many flowers which close after sunset, the hibiscus springs to mind. Perhaps the blue and yellow appearance of the blue lotus, together with its medicinal use, gave the flower its importance. Both the narcotic properties and solar symbolism of this flower appear to give the image of sema tawy a different dimension.\n",
      "If this image, the Sema Tawy, is not just Egyptian, then it may simply have been appropriated by Egyptian pharaohs not only to symbolise their link to the divine, to life itself even, but also to giving life to Egypt in particular, and by binding the two parts, north and south. Iran is a long way from Egypt, the other side of 'Arabia'. Perhaps Egyptian culture was somehow alive in what is now Iran, either through trade connections, or perhaps imperialism, or a common culture in the entire region.\n",
      "What about the papyrus?\n",
      "Papyrus is also an aquatic plant. It's famously the source of papyrus paper, and can be turned into boats - as Thor Heyardahl demonstrated in his epic journeys. If the blue lotus is the party animal, papyrus is the practical, useful one. It's even edible.\n",

      "C corporations are responsible for filing their own tax returns with state and federal agencies; they also file an informational return under subchapter S if they meet certain criteria.\n",
      "While some states have corporate taxes on sales or incomes, most do not require them unless they have offices within those respective jurisdictions.\n",
      "C corps must pay corporate income tax before passing earnings through to individuals who then report taxable amounts on personal returns.\n",
      "Each member's proportionate share of profit distributions determines whether any resulting tax liability falls on the corporate entity or its members.\n",
      "Members of an LLC pay taxes through their individual returns concerning allocations from their company's profit and losses - not just for wages they receive as compensation for services performed.\n",
      "Because double taxation is generally avoided through this process, partnership taxation rules can be applied by default unless otherwise modified by an operating agreement between partners (except in cases where corporate characteristics exist).\n",
      "This type of business structure provides pass-through liability protection that shields member personal assets from possible debtors who might try to target any assets.\n",
      "The members of pass-through LLCs do not pay self-employment taxes. Instead, they make estimated tax payments and file an informational return each year to report income and expenses.\n",
      "C corps don't pay self-employment taxes. As a C corporation, you will be taxed on the business's profits and any salary you pay yourself. You do not pay self-employment tax as an employee, but the company pays the employer's share of those taxes.\n",
      "What Is the Difference Between C Corp and S Corp?\n",
      "The difference between a C corporation and an S corporation is in how the business is taxed. For both, federal taxes are separate from personal income taxes for shareholders and employees of the company.\n",
      "The key difference has to do with which type of taxation applies when there is a transfer of shares or distributions made by the corporation to its shareholder(s).\n",
      "The C Corp:\n",

      "Sole Proprietorship vs LLC: What’s the Difference?\n",
      "A sole proprietorship is an unincorporated business by one person. It’s one of the most common ways to start a business in the United States, probably because it’s also the easiest type to start and run.\n",
      "Suppose you wish to operate as a sole proprietor; no action is required on your part. Assuming you are the sole owner, you are automatically classified as a sole owner. However, there is no legal distinction between you and the company so that you will lose some liability protections. And since the business is seen as an extension of you, it is not taxed separately.\n",
      "In comparison, a limited liability company (LLC) is a legal entity formed at the state level. As an LLC, there is a separation between you and the business. This separation means that you have liability protection against any debt or legal action the company takes.\n",
      "To create an LLC, you will need to register your business with your state’s secretary of state. Each state has different criteria for setting up an LLC, so you will need to see the guidelines in your area.\n",

      "However, his desire wasn't to slight his cast and crew, but to allow them to get involved in a project they cared about and had a vested interest in. He also let his actors do quite a bit of improvisation in his films, although the claim that his films were largely unscripted has been exaggerated. Rather, they were scripted, but Cassavetes allowed the actors to interpret the scene and dialog for themselves.\n",
      "He sums up his approach to filmmaking in the documentary when he says:\n",
      "We decided we'd come up with a great idea, that we would buy all of our film equipment, but they wouldn't give us any credit. So, we started our film without any money, and we just used people that would help us to make the film only because of their idealistic attitudes toward filmmaking, which is, in America, a business not an art. So, we're saying [sound] with your business, and we'll try to make it some kind of an art -- art meaning that we will enjoy ourselves and express ourselves freely.\n",
      "John Cassavetes is one of those filmmakers that speaks to you on a level of humanity that is only reached when you're a teenager listening to music in your room. His films find the root of what being a human is all about, shines a light on it, and hits record. He's raw and honest, but is also enthusiastic and passionate. His philosophy on filmmaking is pure -- making films for the sheer love of film.\n",
      "Nobody expresses this sentiment more effectively than director Jim Jarmusch, who recently wrote in an open letter to Cassavetes:\n",
      "The enlightenment I anticipated from you is being replaced by another. This one doesn’t invite analysis or dissection, only observation and intuition. Instead of insights into, say, the construction of a scene, I’m becoming enlightened by the sly nuances of human nature.\n",
      "He goes on to say:\n",
      "Yeah, you are a great filmmaker, one of my favorites. But what your films illuminate most poignantly is that celluloid is one thing and the beauty, strangeness and complexity of human experience is another.\n",

      "A word of warning to slasher fans. The rape scenes in The Incubus aren’t designed for cheap titillation like those found in a Troma film. These rapes are brutal. The screams of the actresses portraying victims makes the scenes even more realistic and disturbing. If such imagery angers you, then look elsewhere for your slasher thrills.\n",
      "John Cassavetes is miscast as a small town doctor. His bedside manner includes yelling and slapping patients. It doesn’t matter how traumatized a patient is because he gives them all the same diagnosis, “You’ll be alright.” Still, Cassavetes is the best actor in the cast. Ireland just stands around looking helpless.\n",

We never learn how the killer picks victims, either.\n",

      "The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned about the potential negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the mental well-being of health and social care professionals. Symptoms of mental health problems commonly include depression, anxiety, stress, and additional cognitive and social problems; these can impact on function in the workplace. The mental health and resilience (ability to cope with the negative effects of stress) of frontline health and social care professionals ('frontline workers' in this review) could be supported during disease epidemics by workplace interventions, interventions to support basic daily needs, psychological support interventions, pharmacological interventions, or a combination of any or all of these.\n",

      "We included studies in which participants were health and social care professionals working at the front line during infectious disease outbreaks, categorised as epidemics or pandemics by WHO, from 2002 onwards. For objective 1 we included quantitative evidence from randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series studies, which investigated the effect of any intervention to support mental health or resilience, compared to no intervention, standard care, placebo or attention control intervention, or other active interventions. For objective 2 we included qualitative evidence from studies that described barriers and facilitators to the implementation of interventions. Outcomes critical to this review were general mental health and resilience. Additional outcomes included psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression or stress; burnout; other mental health disorders; workplace staffing; and adverse events arising from interventions.\n",

      "Although there is no obvious overlap of classes between the Special K registration and Kokkinakis' application, Kellogg's will likely have argued that its mark has sufficient notoriety for there to be no need for such overlap and that its mark is sufficiently well known to cut across the registration classes. This is, however, a high benchmark, traditionally reserved for only the most well known of brands with Kellogg's having no registrations for any of its marks in classes outside of cereals. Kokkinakis' company would have an argument that the nickname is a tongue-in-cheek reference to Kellogg's brand name but one which the public would recognise as a pun and one which would not be detrimental to any reputation that Kellogg's may enjoy.\n",
      "Athlete as brand\n",
      "The international nature of sports and sports personalities alongside the surge in social media allowing personalities to have a 'direct' channel to their fans, has exponentially increased the market for athletes as a brand - not only for their sporting prowess but also in relation to their personal lives. Fans now associate with a particular athlete, not just the team. As athletes grow their reputation it's fairly common that they look to set up a company that they can then use for their commercial activities, be it appearance fees, image rights payments, related expenses, etc. In many jurisdictions this allows for a more tax efficient earning due to lower rates of tax on dividends and company profit plus the ability to defer drawdown of income to a time when the athlete is in a lower tax bracket. It also has the benefit of ring-fencing any liability for those activities away from the athlete. In fact, if you look at the other registrations filed ('The Big Kokk,' 'Kokki,' 'Spitting Cobra' - all filed on the same date 15 April 2015) it appears that this was what was occurring here. There are jurisdictions (for example Luxembourg) where the addition of nicknames and other forms of protectable intellectual property can also help in any tax analysis of the company as it appears (and is) more than just a vehicle for the player. Many athletes hold trade mark registrations for their name and sometimes signature (Wayne Rooney) or personal goal celebration (Gareth Bale - though this was later abandoned). One of the most famous brands in fashion, the Lacoste 'Crocodile,' was developed by René Lacoste from his 'Crocodile' nickname in the 1930s!\n",

      "Equine disputes and mediation\n",
      "Mediation is a semi-formal way of resolving disputes outside court. Often known as Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) it can be very useful in horse disputes because:\n",
      "- The cost of a full blown court case may be disproportionate to the value of the horse.\n",
      "- An early resolution is often needed so that the horse can be returned to the seller, sold on, PTS, etc.\n",
      "- Solutions often require more imaginative terms than the court has power to order, eg. sale to a third party with all rights reserved as to the balance of the sum in dispute, supply of a replacement horse etc.\n",
      "- The parties may have an ongoing business relationship or wish to be able to deal with each other amicably in the future.\n",
      "- Mediations are private and confidential, unlike open court hearings.\n",
      "- In a cross-border dispute and there may be jurisdictional arguments.\n",
      "What if mediation seems hopeless?\n",
      "The modern view is that mediation is always worth a try. Cases where it would be considered hopeless are very rare indeed. The courts now have the power (and inclination) to impose sanctions on any party who refuses to attempt mediation. They might be ordered to pay penalty costs or their claim might be stayed so that mediation can take place.\n",
      "How does the process work?\n",
      "It is usual for the parties lawyers to arrange everything and accompany them at the mediation but there is nothing to stop the parties going it alone. But if one side is represented the other will generally wish to be.\n",
      "The parties appoint a mediator by agreement. Usually one party will suggest a few options from which the other party will choose. The mediator is contacted and asked to state his fee which the parties can accept (or not). The parties also have to choose a venue according to location cost, suitability, etc.\n",
      "Once the parties have chosen a mediator and venue and have agreed all the costs, they must pay those costs up front, half each.\n",
      "There is a certain amount of preparation for the mediation itself, including exchange of relevant documents and preparation of a mediation bundle and the drafting of Position Statements. Quite often the mediator will want a chat with the parties separately by telephone, just to get a feel for each side’s position.\n",

      "Aquaponics combines aquaculture, the raising of edible fish, with hydroponics, a method of growing plants in a soilless medium. It is one the most efficient and sustainable approaches to food production capable of producing hundreds of pounds of healthy, low-fat protein and organic vegetables in an area the size of a small room.\n",
      "Aquaponics systems are modeled on natural aquatic systems, where the waste products of the fish are the source of nutrients for the plants, which in turn purify the water for the fish. It is a model of self-sufficient food production, as it requires little in the way of external inputs and lessens reliance on large-scale unsustainable food systems.\n",
      "Aquaponics is a lot more involved than a typical vegetable garden, but it is a worthwhile project within reach of any motivated homesteader. You can try your own DIY system or work with a ready-made kit. The key is to keep your system as small and simple as possible until you master the basic techniques.\n",
      "Indoor Versus Outdoor Systems\n",
      "Aquaponics systems are often incorporated into greenhouses in order to keep them going year round. They can even be used indoors under artificial lighting. There are pro and cons for each approach.\n",
      "Because indoor systems produce food continuously in any climate, they are inherently more productive than outdoor systems. However, building a greenhouse or setting up an artificial lighting system adds a great deal of complexity and expense to an aquaponics system, not to mention the cost of heating the greenhouse.\n",
      "In mild winter climates, fish and vegetables can be produced all year outdoors, but in temperate climates the system generally has to be shut down for winter. This is potentially a big issue if the fish have not yet reached a harvestable size, though some species are able to overwinter.\n",
      "Some people choose to have a very small system indoors for breeding fingerlings in the winter that are then released into the outdoor tank once the water has warmed sufficiently.\n",
      "All aquaponics systems have certain features in common although the exact materials used can vary significantly depending on the approach.\n",
      "Many vegetables grow perfectly well without soil, as long as nutrients are provided in an aqueous solution. This is the basis of hydroponics, which is one half of the equation in an aquaponics system. Perlite, vermiculite, sand, fine gravel, coco coir and many other inert growing mediums are available.\n",

      "The religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians were the dominating influence in the development of their culture. The Egyptian faith was based on a collection of ancient myths, nature worship, and innumerable deities. In the most influential and famous of these myths a divine hierarchy is developed and the creation of the earth is explained.\n",
      "According to the Egyptian account of creation, only the premordial waters existed at first. Then Ra, the sun, came out of an egg (a flower, in some versions) that appeared on the surface of the water. Ra brought forth four children, the gods Shu and Geb and the goddesses Tefnut and Nut. Shu and Tefnut became the atmosphere. They stood on Geb, who became the earth, and raised up Nut, who became the sky. Ra ruled over all. Geb and Nut later had two sons, Set and Osiris, and two daughters, Isis and Nephthys. Osiris succeeded Ra as king of the earth, helped by Isis, his sister-wife. Set, however, hated his brother and killed him. Isis then embalmed her husband's body with the help of the god Anubis, who thus became the god of embalming. The powerful charms of Isis resurrected Osiris, who became king of the netherworld, the land of the dead. Horus, who was the son of Osiris and Isis, later defeated Set in a great battle and became king of the earth.\n",
      "From this belief of creation came the conception of the ennead, a group of nine divinities, and the triad, consisting of a divine father, mother, and son. Every local temple in Egypt possessed its own ennead and triad. The greatest ennead, however, was that of Ra and his children and grandchildren. This group was worshiped at Heliopolis, the center of sun worship. The origin of the local deities is obscure; some of them were taken over from foreign religions, and some were originally the animal gods of prehistoric Africa. Gradually, they were all fused into a complicated religious structure, although comparatively few local divinities became important throughout Egypt.\n",

      "The mildly sedating effects of N. caerulea makes it a likely candidate (among several) for the lotus plant eaten by the mythical Lotophagi in Homer's Odyssey.\"\n",
      "This flower is often shown in the context of gatherings in Ancient Egyptian art, parties or rituals, so perhaps the trippy element is more important than at first it might appear, in this Sema Tawy scene, which is supposed to depict something political, or religious.\n",
      "N. caeruleawas considered extremely significant in Egyptian mythology, regarded as a symbol of the sun, since the flowers are closed at night and open again in the morning. At Heliopolis, the origin of the world was taught to have been when the sun god Ra emerged from a lotus flower growing in \"primordial waters\". At night, he was believed to retreat into the flower again. Due to its colour, it was identified, in some beliefs, as having been the original container, in a similar manner to an egg, of Atum, and in similar beliefs Ra, both solar deities. As such, its properties form the origin of the \"lotus variant\" of the Ogdoad cosmogeny. It was the symbol of the Egyptian deity Nefertem\n",
      "There are many flowers which close after sunset, the hibiscus springs to mind. Perhaps the blue and yellow appearance of the blue lotus, together with its medicinal use, gave the flower its importance. Both the narcotic properties and solar symbolism of this flower appear to give the image of sema tawy a different dimension.\n",
      "If this image, the Sema Tawy, is not just Egyptian, then it may simply have been appropriated by Egyptian pharaohs not only to symbolise their link to the divine, to life itself even, but also to giving life to Egypt in particular, and by binding the two parts, north and south. Iran is a long way from Egypt, the other side of 'Arabia'. Perhaps Egyptian culture was somehow alive in what is now Iran, either through trade connections, or perhaps imperialism, or a common culture in the entire region.\n",
      "What about the papyrus?\n",
      "Papyrus is also an aquatic plant. It's famously the source of papyrus paper, and can be turned into boats - as Thor Heyardahl demonstrated in his epic journeys. If the blue lotus is the party animal, papyrus is the practical, useful one. It's even edible.\n",

      "An LLC may elect to be taxed as a corporation, meaning the income is taxed twice at the corporate level and again when shareholders receive dividends (or upon sale of their stock).\n",
      "C corporations are responsible for filing their own tax returns with state and federal agencies; they also file an informational return under subchapter S if they meet certain criteria.\n",
      "While some states have corporate taxes on sales or incomes, most do not require them unless they have offices within those respective jurisdictions.\n",
      "C corps must pay corporate income tax before passing earnings through to individuals who then report taxable amounts on personal returns.\n",
      "Each member's proportionate share of profit distributions determines whether any resulting tax liability falls on the corporate entity or its members.\n",
      "Members of an LLC pay taxes through their individual returns concerning allocations from their company's profit and losses - not just for wages they receive as compensation for services performed.\n",
      "Because double taxation is generally avoided through this process, partnership taxation rules can be applied by default unless otherwise modified by an operating agreement between partners (except in cases where corporate characteristics exist).\n",
      "This type of business structure provides pass-through liability protection that shields member personal assets from possible debtors who might try to target any assets.\n",
      "The members of pass-through LLCs do not pay self-employment taxes. Instead, they make estimated tax payments and file an informational return each year to report income and expenses.\n",
      "C corps don't pay self-employment taxes. As a C corporation, you will be taxed on the business's profits and any salary you pay yourself. You do not pay self-employment tax as an employee, but the company pays the employer's share of those taxes.\n",
      "What Is the Difference Between C Corp and S Corp?\n",
      "The difference between a C corporation and an S corporation is in how the business is taxed. For both, federal taxes are separate from personal income taxes for shareholders and employees of the company.\n",
      "The key difference has to do with which type of taxation applies when there is a transfer of shares or distributions made by the corporation to its shareholder(s).\n",
      "The C Corp:\n",
      "When it comes time for your business to distribute profits (dividends) after you've met all expenses, paid yourself salary/wages, covered other corporate costs like insurance premiums, etc., you will be required to pay corporate tax on any money remaining before paying dividends.\n",

      "Sole Proprietorship Vs LLC: Which Should You Choose?\n",
      "Sole proprietorship and limited liability companies are the two most common business structures favored by small business owners. But which one is right for you?\n",
      "When starting a new business, it’s important to have the right business structure in place. And most small business owners favor starting a sole proprietorship or LLC. But how do you know which one to choose?\n",
      "Sole Proprietorship vs LLC: What’s the Difference?\n",
      "A sole proprietorship is an unincorporated business by one person. It’s one of the most common ways to start a business in the United States, probably because it’s also the easiest type to start and run.\n",
      "Suppose you wish to operate as a sole proprietor; no action is required on your part. Assuming you are the sole owner, you are automatically classified as a sole owner. However, there is no legal distinction between you and the company so that you will lose some liability protections. And since the business is seen as an extension of you, it is not taxed separately.\n",
      "In comparison, a limited liability company (LLC) is a legal entity formed at the state level. As an LLC, there is a separation between you and the business. This separation means that you have liability protection against any debt or legal action the company takes.\n",
      "To create an LLC, you will need to register your business with your state’s secretary of state. Each state has different criteria for setting up an LLC, so you will need to see the guidelines in your area.\n",

The mental health and resilience (ability to cope with the negative effects of stress) of frontline health and social care professionals ('frontline workers' in this review) could be supported during disease epidemics by workplace interventions, interventions to support basic daily needs, psychological support interventions, pharmacological interventions, or a combination of any or all of these.\n",

For objective 2 we included qualitative evidence from studies that described barriers and facilitators to the implementation of interventions.
