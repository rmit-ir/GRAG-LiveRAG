Meeting Notes

## Questions

- [x] how should the references be presented in the answer –– a list of documents
- [ ] how many concurrent requests we can send to the model
- [ ] is Falcon3-10b the only model? Can we use other models for reranking
- [ ] Can we use other models to generate queries?
- [ ] run Falcon3-10b on GPU server with Slurm

## Ideas

- DSPy prompt optimization: [Tutorial: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/rag/)
- Use HuggingFace notebooks as a reference https://huggingface.co/spaces/LiveRAG/Challenge/tree/main/Operational_Instructions
