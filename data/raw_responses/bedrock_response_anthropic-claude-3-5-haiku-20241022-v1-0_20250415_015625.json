    "prompt": "What is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)?",
    "response": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI technique that enhances large language models by dynamically incorporating external knowledge during text generation. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. Basic Process:\n- The model first retrieves relevant information from an external knowledge base\n- It then uses this retrieved information to inform and improve its generated response\n\n2. Key Components:\n- Retrieval system: Searches and pulls relevant documents/information\n- Language model: Generates text using both its original training and the retrieved context\n- Knowledge base: A database of information that can be queried\n\n3. Benefits:\n- Reduces hallucinations (false information)\n- Provides more accurate and up-to-date responses\n- Allows models to access information beyond their original training data\n- Increases transparency by showing sources of information\n\n4. Common Use Cases:\n- Question answering\n- Research assistance\n- Chatbots\n- Content generation with citations\n\n5. Implementation Techniques:\n- Vector search\n- Dense passage retrieval\n- Semantic similarity matching\n\nRAG essentially acts like a \"lookup\" system that helps AI models provide more informed and contextually relevant responses by dynamically accessing external information during generation.",
