    "response": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) where, given a prompt, an AI model retrieves relevant information from a large corpus or database and uses it to generate a more informed and contextually accurate response. This approach combines the strengths of retrieval-based models, which excel at finding specific information, and generative models, which can create coherent and fluent text. \n\nIn a typical RAG system, when a user asks a question or provides a prompt, the system first searches its knowledge base or external databases to find relevant documents or passages. It then uses these retrieved sources along with the original prompt to generate a response. By leveraging external information, RAG can provide more accurate and up-to-date answers, especially for tasks requiring specific factual knowledge or detailed domain expertise.",
