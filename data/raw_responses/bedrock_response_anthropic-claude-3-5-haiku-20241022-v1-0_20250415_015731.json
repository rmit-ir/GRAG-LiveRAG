    "prompt": "What is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)?",
    "response": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI technique that enhances large language models by dynamically retrieving relevant external information to improve the accuracy and context of generated responses. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. Basic Process:\n- A query is received\n- Relevant documents or knowledge are retrieved from an external database\n- The retrieved information is combined with the original query\n- A language model generates a response using both the query and retrieved context\n\n2. Key Benefits:\n- Reduces hallucinations (false information)\n- Provides more up-to-date and accurate responses\n- Allows models to access information beyond their original training data\n- Increases transparency by showing source information\n\n3. Typical Components:\n- Retrieval system (like a vector database)\n- Embedding model to convert text to searchable vectors\n- Large language model for generating responses\n- Ranking/filtering mechanism for retrieved information\n\n4. Common Use Cases:\n- Question answering systems\n- Research assistants\n- Customer support chatbots\n- Content generation with accurate references\n\nRAG bridges the gap between static knowledge in language models and the need for dynamic, context-specific information.",
