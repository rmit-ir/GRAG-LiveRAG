exocrine pancreatic insufficiency symptoms causes patient numbers usa	"About 94% of pancreatic cancers are classified as exocrine tumors. These tumors start in the exocrine cells of the pancreas. The following table describes the most common pancreatic exocrine tumors.
|Adenocarcinoma||Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of pancreatic cancer. It accounts for about 90% of all pancreatic cancers. It begins in the cells lining the pancreatic duct.|
|Acinar Cell Carcinoma||Acinar cell carcinoma is a very rare form of pancreatic cancer. Some tumors may cause excessive production of pancreatic lipase, the enzyme secreted to digest fats. Pancreatic lipase levels can be measured in the blood.|
|Intraductal Papillary-Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN)||An IPMN is a cystic tumor that grows from the main pancreatic duct or from side branches of the duct. The tumor may appear as a finger-like (papillary) projection into the duct. An IPMN may be benign at the time of diagnosis. However, it has a risk of progressing to malignancy. This risk is high when the IPMN originates in the main pancreatic duct. An IPMN may therefore be a precursor for adenocarcinoma.|
|Mucinous Cystadenocarcinoma||Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma is a rare, malignant, cystic tumor. The cyst is filled with a thick fluid called mucin. It is similar to an IPMN but occurs in just one area of the pancreas, more commonly in the tail of the pancreas. These tumors are mostly seen in women.|
There are other rare types of exocrine pancreatic tumors not discussed in this table. For information about other types of exocrine pancreatic tumors, contact a Patient Central Associate.

traditional kofte ingredients food poisoning risks	"THURSDAY, Jan. 8, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- The potential health hazards of e-cigarettes remain unclear, and more regulation on their use is needed, say two groups representing cancer researchers and specialists.
The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) together issued a list of recommendations on Thursday aimed at bringing e-cigarette regulations more in line with those of traditional cigarettes.
In a news release, the two groups pointed out that e-cigarettes, which are not smoked but deliver nicotine in a aerosolized form, are not yet regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. They called on the FDA to regulate all types of e-cigarette products that also meet the standard definition of tobacco products.
Those that do not meet that standard should be regulated by whichever means the FDA feels appropriate, the cancer groups added.
Among other recommendations is a call for e-cigarette manufacturers to provide the FDA with a full and detailed list of their products' ingredients; a call for warning labels on all e-cigarette packaging and ads to advise consumers about the perils of nicotine addiction; and a ban on all marketing and selling of e-cigarettes to minors.
Containers for the liquid nicotine used for e-cigarettes should also have childproof caps, to reduce the chances of accidental poisoning of children, the groups said.
ASCO and AACR further urged that some of the tax monies levied on both traditional and e-cigarette products be used for research into whether or not e-cigarettes have any real value as a smoking-cessation tool, or contain any health hazards.
""We are concerned that e-cigarettes may encourage nonsmokers, particularly children, to start smoking and develop nicotine addiction,"" ASCO President Dr. Peter Paul Yu explained in a news release. ""While e-cigarettes may reduce smoking rates and attendant adverse health risks, we will not know for sure until these products are researched and regulated.""
ASCO and AACR aren't the first organizations of health professionals to come out for more regulation of e-cigarettes. In 2014, three leading medical groups -- the American Medical Association, the American Heart Association and the World Health Organization -- all advocated for more restrictions on ""vaping"" devices.
The recommendations are being simultaneously published Jan. 8 in ASCO's Journal of Clinical Oncology and the AACR journal Clinical Cancer Research.
For more on e-cigarettes, head to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.

I'm interested in environmental organizations in North America - can you tell me what the Commission for Environmental Cooperation does and when it was created?	"There are lots of organizations out there that do focus more on changing people’s minds and getting more people on board. We do other types of work, even though that work is very important. We focus on trying to solve the problems that will, hopefully, maybe even reverse climate change someday, even though that’s a huge thing to say, we like to be hopeful.
IVAN: I love it. I want to be hopeful as well. I think it’s within our reach, the more we do as organizations, as small businesses, as large businesses, in the everyday life we have, I think the more of a positive effect we can have. Now, you mentioned your role at BEF. Your title is Environmental Products Representative. What does your day to day look like at BEF?
HEATHER: It’s funny you mention my title, because I believe I may have a title change soon. But, essentially, my work at Bonneville Environmental Foundation is under the business development umbrella. So, I interact with businesses and entities, such as governments, cities, counties, universities, and other nonprofits, who are interested in looking at their own impact, especially from a water carbon and energy perspective, and doing something about it. The reason I represent the environmental products is because those are one solution, and one approach that a business can take to address their environmental impacts, and of course there are lots of other approaches as well that I like to discuss with businesses. From an energy perspective obviously there’s efficiencies and conserving energy. But at the end of the day, most businesses, I don’t know any business that doesn’t have any footprint at all, there is some effect. And when there’s something left there, what we call an unavoidable footprint, we consider the solution of using something like a renewable energy certificate, like you guys have, carbon offsets, and the water restoration certificates as a way to balance the remaining, unavoidable environmental footprint.
IVAN: Let’s talk about those three things you just mentioned. The Water Restoration Certificates, the Renewable Energy Certificates and the Carbon Offsets. Can you give me a high-level description to each of these three things that we just talked about?
HEATHER: So, a Renewable Energy Certificate… Actually, let me start with offsets, since those were first on the market."	<urn:uuid:9ffe53ea-c8c6-42e1-973e-7a09fdf84629>	0.0

ancient modern ocean pH changes coral impacts	"Coral Minerals help promote an optimal tissue pH — fast. Most other forms of minerals work too slowly or not at all, many are not ionized. All forms of minerals must be ionized via your digestion before they can be absorbed. Since 92% of Coral
Legend Minerals are already ionized, the body can use the calcium immediately without having to break it down. This is great news for those who don’t have good digestion.
A key role of ionized calcium is to neutralize acidic compounds anywhere in the body, before damage takes place. (Even a great herbal detox won’t work very well without ionized calcium.) Ionized calcium is critical in order to help promote cleansing. If the body’s pH becomes acidic, it becomes harder and harder for the body to uptake other nutrients, such as minerals, vitamins or herbs. The key is to establish the proper acid/alkaline balance in your body. An acidic pH creates a hostile internal environment, making the body struggle to get the nutrients it needs. The more acid you become, the worse you will most likely feel.
Premier Coral Minerals are 100% fine-mesh coral powder (absolutely no additives), and are easily absorbed and assimilated. Other products may contain poor quality coral, the wrong species, or many impurities. Some contain gritty coral, often with impurities such as sand. They may not be readily dissolved and thus are poorly assimilated. Other calcium products may be difficult to absorb or ineffective.
What Does a Healthy pH Balance Mean?
As the body’s pH comes into better balance (pH 6.4 to 7.0), it is like a sunny spring day; your body can easily assimilate minerals that were very difficult to absorb at a more acid pH. The first morning urine pH is the best reflection of the body’s tissue pH. Obtain a roll of pH tape at your local pharmacy to measure your own urine pH.
In a healthy pH environment, you have abundant oxygen. As the pH of the urine drops, less and less oxygen is available to the tissues. Small changes of 1/10 to 2/10 in pH can mean 10 to 20 times more oxygen availability. Ionized calcium is the key mineral to help keep the pH near ideal."	<urn:uuid:d045cb0b-e242-4d4b-bae3-fee0330a5605>	0.0
What factors are important for successful cabbage cultivation in terms of soil and water, and how do these compare to the conditions needed for proper fermentation of cabbage?	"Just a matter of finely shredding the cabbage, rubbing in salt for a while until the juice is released, then packing tightly into a jar making sure there is no air trapped within the leaves.
The cabbage all needs to be pushed down under the brine level (the brine is the juice from the cabbage, no added water needed). Then I topped it with a folded cabbage leaf and a bag of water to weigh it all down and keep it under the brine.
The natural bacteria should get to work and give off carbon dioxide and turn the mixture sour in the manner of a pickle. In a few days the book suggests trying it, although it might take somewhat longer for the flavours to develop. The bacteria are probiotics and very good for the gut apparently. And the fermenting releases more vitamins and minerals than you would get from just eating raw fresh cabbage. I have high hopes it will work and I will pretty much turn into Wonder Woman.
Next I shall give kimchi a try. Chinese cabbage, radish, spring onions, garlic, chilli and carrots from memory. I've tasted some and it's utterly delicious. The fermentation breaks the vegetables down just the right amount for me. This is the book I've been using.
You'll see I have a jar with a little vent in the lid, to allow the gas to escape. This isn't essential, you can just leave the lid a bit loose. Don't put it on tightly because of the build-up of gas. Oh how I love that phrase. Comedy and danger all rolled into one. I shall let you know how it all goes. If it works you can bet I'll be fermenting everything in sight.
Hope everyone has a very good, calm, relaxing Sunday with a bit of reading time and absolutely nothing annoying. I shall be out watching football most of the day I think. By sundown I shall be frozen solid.

What are the various forms of contraception?
There are many types of contraception. Please refer to these links for details:
- Choosing the right Birth Control Method – Health Promotion Board
- Types of Contraception – Young Women’s Health
- Preventing Pregnancy with Contraception – Health Promotion Board
- Sex Etc – Sex Education for Teens
How effective are various forms of contraception?
- The effectiveness of contraception depends on whether or not it is used properly.
- There are two different measures of contraception effectiveness:
- “Perfect use” measures the effectiveness when a contraceptive is used exactly according to clinical guidelines.
- “Typical use” measures how effective a method is for the average person who does not always use the method correctly or consistently.
For example, a woman who never forgets to take her pill will experience almost complete protection against pregnancy. But often a person may miss a day for one reason or another, in which case the risk of pregnancy increases.
Typically, effectiveness is closer to 92%, meaning on average 8 in 100 women taking oral contraceptives will become pregnant in the first year of use.

How do modern x-ray tubes manage heat generation during operation, and what are the recommended safety protocols for operating these devices?	"Likewise, some jobs require specialized equipment and in-depth knowledge. Stay out of trouble by knowing when to call a pro.
As the seasons change, so to do the needs of the vehicle. Knowing how to prepare the car for the harsh cold and wet conditions of winter is as important as getting ready for the heat of summer. Likewise, driver adjustments maximize the benefit gained from changes in hardware.
By design, preventative maintenance tasks are designed to reduce wear, increase efficiency, and prevent costly breakdowns. These are some tips for prolonging the life of the vehicle. Learn how to change fluids, preserve the paint and plastics, operate the vehicle in a systems-friendly fashion and make evaluations during use in order to proactively manage vehicle longevity.
A compelling reason to update an older vehicle is the remarkable increase in safety technologies in modern cars. Put modern technology to work by understanding and selecting the features that increase vehicle safety. Further, understand those systems so that their use increases driver awareness and reduces the risk of collisions or accidents. Also, understand the limitations of modern safety systems.
Vehicle ownership presents some common issues that are worth understanding. Changing a tire, for example, is a skill required at some point for nearly all drivers. Considering the common issues and how to prevent or handle them is the aim of this chapter. Change a tire, evaluate the brakes, add fluids, replace the wipers or jump start a car with ease.
Some sounds, smells, warning lights or vibrations are basically harmless warnings that do not require immediate attention. Others are signs that severe damage is being done or is about to be done to the vehicle. Understanding the warning signs that indicate a need for immediate service will reduce the likelihood of operating with a severely damaged vehicle."	<urn:uuid:b5b34a06-158f-411f-b2a5-c979f7cdf5e2>	0.0
As someone studying crop quality parameters, I'm curious about the early test results for the 2021 hard red winter wheat harvest. What were the key measurements for moisture content, protein levels, and test weight?	"Industry Leaders: Idaho
by Sean Ellis
Idaho wheat growers produced an exceptionally high quality crop this year, according to industry leaders,
although total production was down 12 percent from last year.
BOISE -- Idaho's wheat growers this year produced what many people are calling one of the state's highest quality crops ever, if not the best ever.
""In the 15 years I've been here, this is, in terms of quality, the best wheat I've seen statewide,"" said Idaho Wheat Commission Executive Director Blaine Jacobson. ""The whole state had a good crop.""
That quality was excellent across the state is unique because growers in North and South Idaho grow different classes of wheat for different markets, said Cathy Wilson, director of research collaboration for the IWC.
""It was not the biggest crop but the quality was exceptional,"" she said. ""There were very few discounts taken this year.""
Idaho farmers produced 90.7 million bushels of wheat in 2017, which is 12 percent less than last year's total of 102.8 million bushels.
A total of 1.1 million acres of wheat was harvested in the state this year, down slightly from 1.13 million acres last year. Yields averaged 82.2 bushels per acre statewide in 2017, down from last year's record of 91.4 bushels.
What Idaho's wheat industry lacked in total production in 2017 was made up for in quality, industry leaders and growers said.
""Our harvest this year was generally pretty good. The quality was especially good,"" said Jerry Brown, a southeast Idaho farmer.
Yields were all over the board, but quality was superb, said ""Genesee"" Joe Anderson, a North Idaho grower. Problems in past years with quality such as falling number scores, test weights and protein levels were not an issue this year, he said.
""Everything we've had trouble with (in past years) is right where the customers want it this year,"" Anderson said.
Dennis Capson, a merchandiser for Scoular Co., a marketing company that specializes in grain, said, ""Overall, especially the proteins of wheat in Idaho were fantastic this year.""
During the IWC's regular quarterly meeting last week, Columbia Grain Manager Brian Lorentz stressed to the commission's grower board members how important it is for them to continue to grow a consistently high quality crop."	<urn:uuid:137b3bb5-c9c0-475c-b878-525f16111c30>	0.0

What are the main symptoms someone should look out for to know if they are getting dehydrated from gastroenteritis?	"What is influenza?
Influenza is a respiratory infection caused by the influenza virus. It is spread through respiratory droplets. After you are exposed to someone who has the flu it takes 1-4 days before you start showing symptoms. Usually it causes sudden onset of severe headache, body-ache, fever, runny nose, and cough. While you are sick with the flu, and even a day before you get sick, you are contagious, meaning you can pass the virus along to others if you have close enough contact.
Influenza is commonly called ‘the flu’ which is differentiated from common cold symptoms by the severity of body aches and fever. It is also different from the stomach flu or gastroenteritis, which is the vomiting and diarrhea viral illness that is often referred to as the flu.
What should I expect if I get sick?
The symptoms will resolve after a week or so and most people will recover fully without any specific treatment for the flu. There are antiviral medications available to treat the flu (Tami flu & Relenza are two) but these only shorten the course of being sick by a day or two; their use should be minimized to prevent the flu virus from developing resistance to the medication. These medications are more effective if you start them as soon as possible after you develop flu symptoms and do almost no good if you have been sick for more than 72 hours. Like a cold, the cause of the infection is a virus and antibiotics will not get you better any faster unless you develop a secondary bacterial infection like pneumonia.
While you are sick, it is best to stay home and treat your symptoms with tylenol or ibuprofen, drink plenty of fluids and rest. This will allow your body to recuperate and heal itself while preventing others from getting ill.
Occasionally, people get quite ill and every year people die from influenza. Usually these deaths occur in the very young and very old, or people with chronic medical conditions. Last year, there was a higher than expected percentage of deaths in normally healthy individuals due to the H1N1 strain of influenza.
If your breathing becomes difficult at any point while you have influenza, you must see your doctor or go to an urgent care or ER for an evaluation to check your oxygen saturation, maybe get a flu test, or a chest x-ray to make sure you don’t have a bacterial pneumonia which can be a complication of influenza.

Early Retirement Challenges
While there is research to show that working longer keeps you healthier and happier, there’s also evidence for the opposing view.
The National Bureau of Economic Research found that “retirement improves both health and life satisfaction,” in part by factoring in the number of people who are forced to retire due to health issues.
However, the primary challenge is ensuring that you have enough assets to provide an acceptable level of income throughout your remaining years, so you’re financially ready to live without a paycheck.
The average lifespan in the U.S. is just under 79 years. For someone who retires at 55, this means they need to save up at least 24 years’ worth of income, and even healthier individuals who live beyond the age of 79 will need to have an even larger nest egg.

Avoid outliving your money
Whatever your age when you decide to retire, you don’t want to worry about outliving your money. Luckily, there are ways to help avoid it.
- Save more now. If you need to keep working because you won’t have enough saved, take steps now to increase your savings. Contribute the maximum to your employer’s retirement plan and to any individual retirement accounts (IRAs).
- Wait a little longer to collect Social Security benefits. For every year you wait past your full retirement age to elect benefits, you earn delayed retirement credits. The credits can increase your monthly benefit by about 8% per year, up to age 70.
- Limit your retirement spending. Many financial professionals recommend that you tap no more than 4% to 5% (adjusted annually for inflation) of your nest egg each year, to help make your money last."	<urn:uuid:96315e4b-9ef8-4848-8436-0e10576c227e>	0.0
When did the Knights of Malta own islands in the Caribbean?	"Hompesch had minimal leadership qualities. He dithered, and Napoleon landed 15,000 troops, who occupied the island in short order.
The Knights were scattered. Many of them went to Russia, for the Tsar Paul I had developed an interest in the Order. In gratitude for the refuge, the Tsar was named Grand Master, but he died in 1801, and his successor, Alexander I, had no interest. The Order effectively ceased to exist, but was reconstituted in 1879 by pope Leo XIII, and it is this restored Order that we know today as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.
Over the centuries of their rule the Knights had treated their native subjects not badly according to the mores of the time. They did a lot of public building, and the populace supported them, by-and-large, in their holy military endeavors. But the Order had become exceedingly rich, and the Knights grew thoroughly accustomed to their lives of luxury. By the time of Napoleon's appearance the ideas of the Enlightment had penetrated the culture of both the Knights and the Natives. The result was demoralization among the former and disaffection among the latter.
The French made themselves unpopular, however, by exercising the various traditional vices of occupying armies, and the people rose against them in 1800. The British came in to help, and stayed. Malta became a British colony in 1814.
The British saw in Malta what everyone else saw: a critical location for projection of naval power in the Mediterranean. With Malta added to Gibraltar the British controlled the western half of that sea, bottling up the French. They modernized the fortifications and built up their presence.
Coinage of the period was British. They struck those little 1/3 farthings to substitute for the old, small, 1 grano coppers, and they were used nowhere else. It's not too hard to collect a nice example of the British ""grain."" Pick your monarch.
That Britain held Malta through World War II is one of the miracles of that war, and the island played a key role in the Allied invasion of North Africa.
People had begun talking about independence back in the 1920s, and a movement began to form. Independence activities were put on hold during the War, but accelerated after, culminating in formal independence in 1964."	<urn:uuid:249229d7-e494-485d-9c2b-2b701b689d6a>	0.0

I'm curious about John Clarke's photography journey. How did he get started?	"JASON FABOK Brings Cinematic Style to JOKER in DETECTIVE
Written by John Layman with art by up-and-coming artist Jason Fabok, Detective Comics has been surprising readers since its new creative team took over in October. With a story that has been concentrating on villains, Layman and Fabok have given Batman fans a unique mix of gritty detective stories and fun moments reminiscent of the character's animated series.
In fact, it's animation that helps to inform the work by Fabok, who burst onto the scene at DC by helping out with David Finch's work on Batman: The Dark Knight.
Newsarama talked to the artist about his unique style on Detective Comics, drawing The Joker, and his hopes for the future.
Newsarama: Jay, what drew you to the chance to work on Detective Comics?
Jason Fabok: I've always wanted to work on Batman. That was my main goal when I started this crazy ride a few years back. Batman has been my favorite character since the first time I saw Tim Burton's Batman movie as a child. I’m still in a state of shock that I'm even working on a Batman title. I never thought that I'd get this chance so early in my career.
As for how I got this opportunity, it was right after the Batman Annual that Mike Marts approached me and asked if I was ready for a ""Big Project."" I was curious as to what he had up his sleeve and it turned out to be Detective Comics. I couldn't turn something like that down.
Nrama: Were you aware of John Layman's work before? What did you think of the chance to work with him as he started on a DC Batman comic?
Fabok: I knew he was a hugely popular writer with Chew but hadn't found the time to check out his work. But right from the get-go, I felt we've really clicked. We had some great conversations as to what he wanted to do with the series and what my thoughts were as well. I honestly couldn't believe how close our vision was for the series. He pitched a fun, action-packed, detective comic that reminded me of the old Batman animated series. I loved the idea of each issue being it's own story while having a connecting tie through the arc."	<urn:uuid:1c46868f-196a-4d28-8cda-78f215f98a70>	0.0
How do you know if there's no correlation between variables?	"How do you calculate the power of a correlation?
Using a two sided test, 5% significance level test (α=0.05) with power 80% power (β=0.2), the required sample size is approximate 47 (n=47)….Correlation Coefficient using z-transformation.
|α||Significance level (two sided test)|
|1-β||Power of the test|
|N||Sample size needed|
What is power in correlation?
The power of a test is calculated as 1-beta and represents the probability that we reject the null hypothesis when it is false. The main application of power calculations is to estimate the number of observations necessary to properly conduct an experiment. XLSTAT allows you to compare: One correlation to 0.
How does correlation affect power?
Higher correlation within subject gets you more power when the test being done is a differencing, equivalent to a paired t-test. The standard deviation used in calculating effect size is multiplied by √1−ρ.
How do you calculate effect size from correlation?
The effect size of the population can be known by dividing the two population mean differences by their standard deviation. Where R2 is the squared multiple correlation.
What is G*Power used for?
G*Power is a tool to compute statistical power analyses for many different t tests, F tests, χ2 tests, z tests and some exact tests. G*Power can also be used to compute effect sizes and to display graphically the results of power analyses.
What does Corr among Rep measures mean?
Repeated measures correlation (rmcorr) is a statistical technique for determining the common within-individual association for paired measures assessed on two or more occasions for multiple individuals. Unlike simple regression/correlation, rmcorr does not violate the assumption of independence of observations.
How do you calculate effect size for power analysis?
Generally, effect size is calculated by taking the difference between the two groups (e.g., the mean of treatment group minus the mean of the control group) and dividing it by the standard deviation of one of the groups.
What is the effect size in correlation?
As such, we can interpret the correlation coefficient as representing an effect size. It tells us the strength of the relationship between the two variables. 30 is considered a moderate correlation; and a correlation coefficient of . 50 or larger is thought to represent a strong or large correlation.

How does Polish grammar compare to deep phonological dyslexia symptoms?	"In Study 2, three participants completed one-on-one phonological awareness intervention through Zoom. They were assigned to learn one skill with simulated classroom noise and another with the simulated benefit of a classroom FM system. Both studies utilized adapted alternating treatment single-case designs and assessed performance using daily assessments on the phonological awareness skills targeted during intervention and one additional phonological awareness skill.
In Study 1, two participants demonstrated quicker and more pronounced improvement on the skill learned while wearing the FM system, suggesting FM systems show promise as a tool to use during phonological awareness training. In Study 2, two participants made gains on the phonological awareness skills assessed. However, a difference was not evident between skills learned in the simulated classroom FM and simulated classroom noise condition.
The results of Study 1 indicate that FM systems show promise during phonological awareness instruction. However, the finding from Study 2 that simulation of the signal-to-ratio of FM systems was not associated with improved performance compared to simulated classroom noise suggests that aspects of FM systems beyond the increased signal-to-noise ratio alone may be responsible for the benefit they provided. Additionally, findings from Study 2 indicate that virtual phonological awareness instruction holds promise as a method of delivery.

inherited grandma antique ring make it bigger possible problems	"A friend of mine was on holidays with her beau (now husband). They were browsing in an antique store, as one does when on holidays, and she came across a stunning antique ring. She told 'beau' how much she liked the ring and casually mentioned that 'it would be a perfect engagement ring'. Several months later 'beau' proposed with the antique ring and of course she said 'yes'. The engagement ring was a little big so she looped it on a chain around her neck with plans to have it re-sized. Later that night the pair celebrated with their families at a local restaurant. At the end of the dinner the ring still hung around her neck, but as they walked from the restaurant along a short wide path to the car, the necklace and the ring disappeared. Upon realising that the ring was gone when she arrived at the car, the couple and their families spent hours searching for the antique ring, but the ring was never found.
Aside from the financial loss, my friend received a new ring that she adores just as much and we've decided that the ring was cursed, a piece of bad luck not meant for her finger. We invented all kinds of stories to explain the ring's curse - perhaps it was the product of an unhappy marriage, a proposal gone wrong or the ring of a criminal. I don't actually believe any of our imaginative stories, but they certainly turned me off genuine antique engagement rings.
I still love love love the vintage style of an antique ring - delicate and refined, a vintage style engagement ring is perfect for soft feminine hands. Intricate settings and multiple diamonds define this style, but the good news is that you don't have to buy old when it comes to a vintage style engagement ring. I especially love these rings from Larsen Jewellery. Unlike the rings of yester year they're not storing up any dark secrets - they're brand new and just for you!
Which ring is your favourite? I am in love with the trio with pears!"	<urn:uuid:ad2c29df-41a4-498e-a752-32b485b92fca>	0.0
what hardware components needed build automatic loading firing catapult ev3	"During the French and Indian War, tactics by necessity evolved quickly in the North American wilderness. After some initial bloody tactical disasters, British leadership rapidly recognized the need to adopt a new way of warfare, shifting from a regular European style of fighting to more irregular tactics led by light infantry units. The recruits in these groups wore cut down hats, coats and leather leggings and carried equipment focused on swift movement and close, skirmish-style combat. To build out my FIW Britsh light infantry units, I’ve drawn upon a variety of manufacturers.
To begin, I purchased the single offering of British light infantry models available from AW Miniatures. This small package comes with two copies each of just three different poses with two firing variations and one model loading on the move. The figures are dressed in the popular jockey caps of light infantry soldiers along with spare equipment on chunky molds which scale well with a variety of manufacturers.
Seeking to layer in some significant variety to my forces, I went next to Redoubt Enterprises and their large offering of FIW figures. Redoubt offers two six-packs of British light infnatry, one with jockey caps and the other wearing basic round hats. The packages each come with no duplication of poses, offering a lot of variety in firing, loading and advancing sculpts. One figure in each set comes with a separate hands and rifle piece meant to be glued with the musket raised high in melee mode. I chose to invert the piece in a loading posture on each of the two models.
Finally, I went to Front Rank Figurines with their vast listing of FIW models available individually for purchase. Again, there was a lot of variety here with shooting, advancing, loading and at-the-ready troops, many hauling small campaign-ready backpacks. To these, I added two NCOs — one at ease and one commanding trops forward — along with a more formal officer sold as Major General James Wolfe (middle above).
Across three UK-based manufacturers, these figures all fit well together as heftier 28mm casts. With them, I’ve been able to create 3-4 small units of British light infantry which serve as key components to so many FIW engagements on the table."	<urn:uuid:9cf95944-2368-4a09-b779-aee81ffe0545>	0.0
I'm an architectural historian researching luxury hotels in former financial buildings - what interesting features did they preserve in The Ned hotel from its past as a clearinghouse bank?	"The historic Majestic Hotel is set to reopen its doors in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in December this year.
The 300-room hotel, owned by YTL Hotels and located along Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin on a 1.29 hectare site opposite the Kuala Lumpur railway station, will open to guests following a RM250 million ($82.5 million) restoration program.
The hotel, built in 1932, was considered one of the top landmarks of Kuala Lumpur and had also previously housed the country’s National Art Gallery.
According to the Guide to Kuala Lumpur Notable Buildings published by the Malaysian Institute of Architects in 1976, the Hotel Majestic building was erected on the site of the former residence of the German consul. With its original 51 rooms, Hotel Majestic was among the first ‘big’ hotels to be constructed at the time.
The restored Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur will also become a member of the US-based The Leading Hotels of The World (LHW) group, making it the only hotel in Kuala Lumpur to be included in its portfolio of luxury hotels.
Another grand hotel in Asia with a long and rich history undergoing an overhaul is the iconic Peninsula Hong Kong, whose rooms will all feature brand-new interior designs and technology upon completion next year."	<urn:uuid:4c42b700-899b-4458-a0a0-2675c1941e6f>	0.0
Why do birds fly high up in the evening?	"Protofeathers are in no way similar to feathers and are probably just frayed collagen fibers that originated from within the skin, not feathers from follicles outside the skin. Scientists have never observed scales turning into follicles that could produce feathers.
8. Preening Gland
Birds have a uropygial gland, or preen gland, at the base of their spine that secretes an oil. Birds turn their heads 180 degrees and use their beak to rub the preen oil on their feathers. Without this lubrication the feathers on birds wings can not operate properly. Dinosaurs do not have a uropygial gland. Scientists have never observed an animal evolve a preen gland and the ability to turn their heads 180 degrees to access the bottom of their spine at the same time.
9. Modern Fossil Birds
For dinosaurs to have evolved into birds it would require dinosaurs to be around first but we find fossils of modern birds in layers before their supposed dinosaur ancestors. Confuciusornis feducciai and Confuciusornis sanctus are some examples of modern birds found in the Early Cretaceous period. Feathered bird fossils like Jinfengopteryx and Archaeopteryx are also found in Jurassic rock layers.
The fossil Archaeopteryx is considered by some to be a transitional fossil between reptiles and birds because of it has teeth and claws; however, now Archaeopteryx is considered to be a flightless perching bird. Other birds are known to have claws such as the ostrich and the hoatzin when it is young. Also the Hesperornis birds have been found that contain teeth.
So did dinosaurs evolve into birds?
NO. Birds came first, then dinosaurs were created.
And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven... And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so... And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."	<urn:uuid:fa76471a-4ef0-4431-ac23-dfdd3e2a9ed8>	0.0

what special fluid absorbs water vapor from air in drupps system	"The part of a balanced ventilation system that captures water vapor and heat from one airstream to condition another. In cold climates, water vapor captured from the outgoing airstream by ERVs can humidify incoming air. In hot-humid climates, ERVs can help maintain (but not reduce) the interior relative humidity as outside air is conditioned by the ERV./HRV(HRV). Balanced ventilation system in which most of the heat from outgoing exhaust air is transferred to incoming fresh air via an air-to-air heat exchanger; a similar device, an energy-recovery ventilator, also transfers water vapor. HRVs recover 50% to 80% of the heat in exhausted air. In hot climates, the function is reversed so that the cooler inside air reduces the temperature of the incoming hot air. : they have multi-angled fins and foot operated dials that cannot be locked into place.

number indigenous sites artefacts damaged destroyed warragamba dam wall raising	"As evident in the Chixoy project, where the selection of the site for the dam was considered a massive state failure due to geological miscalculations, it became obvious that the development promised by the government (the official website for the Xalalá project states that one of its goals is to better the quality of life for Guatemalans) will not benefit the indigenous communities in the region. In Chixoy, the dam project already has displaced 3,500 Mayan community members and affected 6,000 other families who lost their land and means of livelihood. The argument that few will benefit at the expense of many apparently matters little to Guatemala City: The proposed dam is scheduled to bring in millions of dollars in taxes and salary revenue and is expected to produce 886 GWh per year.
The Indigenous Movement
Such disregard for the welfare of a population sector that accounts for a majority of Guatemala’s nationals (although officially the number is said to be 40 percent, other sources put the percentage of the indigenous at close to 60 percent) has motivated a determined call to action by the indigenous. In Guatemala, hostility and racism towards indigenous groups is manifested by political exclusion. The unvoiced consensus among the powerful Europeanized minority remains that although the indigenous population is substantial, its political representation should remain marginalized. President Àlvaro Colom’s blatant disregard for the 2007 community referendums, valid under international law, highlights the Central American state’s need for a more powerful indigenous presence in government.
In 1993, with the help of a failed self-coup by former President Jorge Serrano Elias, the Permanent Maya Assembly, representing an early indigenous political movement, asserted its presence and its push for permanence in the Guatemalan political arena by submitting a list with three names for the vice-presidency. Although this move gained national attention at the time, the assembly failed to generate any major breakthroughs. The indigenous movement lay semi-dormant for a number of years, until the recent election of Bolivia’s Evo Morales, the first indigenous leader in Latin America, raised expectations among Guatemala’s underrepresented community. This prompted a 2006 statement by Rigoberta Menchú Mum, 1992 Nobel Peace Prize winner and an indigenous leader, to announce that she would pursue the presidency in the 2007 election.
Menchú’s presidential bid that year proved to be a fiasco, as she gained only about 3 percent of the vote."	<urn:uuid:6568dbf0-fbca-44b7-a722-c279cb9b49a5>	0.0

safety rules near sparks welder	"How to Pick the Right Welder Technical School near Somerton Arizona
Finding the right welding trade school near Somerton AZ is an important first step to starting your new career as a professional welder. But since there are numerous schools to pick from, how do you determine which ones to consider? And more significantly, once you have narrowed down your options, how do you pick the right one? Most people start by looking at the schools that are closest to their residences. Once they have found those that are within commuting distance, they are drawn toward the cheapest one. Yes, location and the cost of tuition are important concerns when reviewing welding technical schools, but they are not the only ones. Other factors include such things as accreditation, reputation and job placement rates. So before beginning your search for a trade school to become a welder, it’s sensible to establish a list of qualifications that your chosen school must have. But before we examine our due diligence checklist, let’s cover a little bit about how to become a welder.
Welding Certificate and Degree Training
There are multiple options to receive training as a welder in a technical or trade school. You can receive a diploma, a certificate or an Associate Degree. Bachelor Degrees are offered in Welding Technology or Welding Engineering, but are more advanced degrees than most journeyman welders will need. Some programs are also made available in conjunction with an apprenticeship program. Below are short summaries of the most typical welding programs offered in the Somerton AZ.
- Certificate and Diploma Programs are generally made available by technical and trade schools and take about 1 year to finish. They are more hands-on training in nature, fashioned mainly to develop welding skills. They can provide a good foundation for a new journeyman or apprentice welder, or supplemental skills for working welders.
- Associate Degree Programs will take 2 years to complete and are usually offered by community colleges. An Associate Degree in Welding Technology offers a more extensive education than the diploma or certificate while still providing the foundation that prepares students to enter the workforce.
Some municipalities and states do have licensing requirements for welders, therefore don’t forget to find out for your location of future employment. As needed, the welder school you select should prep you for any licensing exams that you will need to pass in addition to providing the proper training to become a qualified welder."	<urn:uuid:c57ef8aa-64f2-49ca-9540-37e39e82d57c>	0.0

Phase transitions in the domain structure of ferromagnetic superconductorsKhaymovich, I.M., Mel'nikov, A.S. and Buzdin, A.I.
Starting from the London-type model, we study the domain structures in ferromagnetic superconductors taking account of the nucleation of vortices and antivortices coupled to the magnetic texture. We predict that the coupling between domains and vortices results in the formation of two energetically favorable domain configurations: (i) a Meissner-type vortex-free configuration with strong domain shrinking and (ii) a more rare domain configuration with a dense vortex-antivortex lattice. The switching between these configurations is shown to result in the first-order phase transitions which could be observable in superconducting uranium-based compounds.

Hey, I'm fascinated by archaeological digs happening in Israel. What are they searching for at the Tel Shiloh site and have they found anything interesting so far?	"BAR 35:06, Nov/Dec 2009
First Person: Barred from the City of David
I have been writing about the City of David for more than 35 years. The major excavations of Yigal Shiloh between 1978 and 1985 were undertaken as a result of a book I wrote. In that sense, I created the site. So it is no small thing to me that General Shuka Dorfman, the current director of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), has instructed Ronny Reich, who codirects the current excavations near the Pool of Siloam with Eli Shukron, to bar me from the site.a Shuka, as everyone calls him, is mad at me. It has something to do with the famous James Ossuary (inscribed “James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus”), which was first published in BAR by Sorbonne scholar André Lemaire in 2002.b I cannot be more specific about why Shuka is so angry because he won’t tell me. He won’t speak to me. What is clear is that it has nothing to do with the City of David or its excavation. At a meeting of Israel’s Archaeological Council, council members suggested he talk to me, but Shuka rejected their advice; he remains obdurate. After all, he’s a general; he is accustomed to commanding, not taking suggestions."	<urn:uuid:7071c241-1c6a-477a-b5a0-1b306091ddff>	0.0
how much percentage entertainment agents charge from performer earnings	"Disappointing, But Not Devastating
As we anticipated in last week’s post, US GDP did come in at a very disappointing 0.2% growth.[i] This was anemic and also much slower growth than the expected growth of 1.0%.[ii]
When you examine the component parts of US GDP, (Consumption + Investment + Government Spending - Net Exports), there are signs of hope and despair.
- US Consumers held up their end of the bargain by willingly spending in spite of tough winter conditions. They added 1.31 percentage points to GDP.[iii]
- US Businesses grew more optimistic about the consumer by increasing inventories and adding 0.74 percentage points to GDP.[iv]
- The big drag (no surprise) was the massive headwinds created by a huge, strong-dollar-induced trade deficit. Net exports subtracted a whopping 1.25 percentage points from GDP.[v,vi]
US GDP was in a similar position last year at this time contracting by 2.1%. In some regards, we are a little better off.[vii]
One big difference between today and this same time last year is in corporate earnings.
When you look back at Q1 2014 earnings, you see US companies in much stronger shape than today.[viii,ix]
While both periods had analysts predicting earnings shrinking, actual results vary substantially. We had decent growth in Q1 2014, but now we are facing an earnings drought.
Certainly more volatility will be in our future and that's observable for most watching their portfolio values.
What's less obvious is how much more earnings, trade, and GDP headwinds we have to face from a continued strong dollar. The dollar is up over 18% since it began its rally in mid-2014.[x] However, when looking at the trade-weighted dollar over longer periods of time, you can see we may have more to go.
A strong dollar has not been devastating at this point and the consumer is anything but disappointing. With lots of fire power in the consumer’s wallet (income growth, credit and savings accounts), we can see the US economy stumble forward for the foreseeable future while we continue to fight a strong dollar.

As a veterinary student focusing on feline development, I'm curious about the exact timeline of when kittens get their first teeth and how the teething process progresses - could you explain the key stages?	"When your baby is around 6 months old, you'll probably start to see his first two teeth pushing through his gums. This process, known as teething, is an exciting milestone for parents, but it can also be frustrating if your little one is experiencing teething pain.
A baby's discomfort from teething is caused by the fact that his new teeth are erupting through his tender gum tissue. While you may be somewhat familiar with teething issues, you might still have a tough time determining whether your child is suffering from pain related to teething or from discomfort caused by a different problem. Keep reading to learn how to recognize which of your child's symptoms point to teething pain and which symptoms may be signs of other issues that could require medical attention.
Recognizing the Common Signs of Teething Pain
General irritability and crankiness are two of the telltale signs of pain from the teething process. If you're lucky, your baby's crankiness may only last for a brief period, although some babies remain irritable for several weeks as their teeth grow in.
Because of the discomfort that comes along with teething, your little one might also refuse certain foods or have trouble sleeping. Of course, some babies are picky eaters and fussy sleepers before they ever begin teething; that's why it's important to take note of your child's normal habits, so it will be easier to determine whether any behavior changes are related to his teething process.
If you're still unsure if your baby's symptoms are caused by pain in his gums, you can examine his gums to check for visible swelling and redness. You can also gently place a finger on or near the area where his teeth are growing in to see if he has a negative reaction to your touch.
Knowing Which Symptoms Are Unrelated to Teething
Many parents mistakenly believe that a baby's fever and diarrhea are connected with teething. However, experts haven't found any links between these symptoms and teething pain. If your child exhibits fevers or diarrhea, it's a good idea to call your physician to see what else might be causing these issues.
Every baby is unique, and while some little ones will have very strong reactions to teething, other babies will show no signs of distress at all. Keeping tabs on your baby's regular behavior and learning what signs do and don't point to teething pain will help you ensure that your little one remains healthy during this important process."	<urn:uuid:c7accec6-19c3-4e95-ae0c-63728b578e6e>	0.0
compare warehouse automation cold storage medical supplies handling	"Seminars, workshops, demonstrations and acres of safety products and services are expected to draw around 10,000 visitors to Sydney Showground for The Safety Show and Sydney Materials Handling next week. Both shows are presented by exhibition organisers Australian Exhibitions & Conferences .
The two big occupational safety trade shows will run from Tuesday October 27 to Thursday October 29 and will dominate the Safe Work Australia Week in New South Wales. Organiser Marie Kinsella of Australian Exhibitions & Conferences says the events will be keenly attended by employers facing new OHS laws.
""Of all the states, NSW employers will need to deal with the most radical changes to the law if the draft national model is adopted,"" Ms Kinsella says. ""Bookings for seminars regarding the new laws presented at The Safety Show and Sydney Materials Handling have been so popular Safe Work Australia struggled to meet demand. Law firm, Deacons, will offer extra sessions for those who missed out in the rush.""
Many of the other big issues in OHS will also be addressed with safety workshops. The principal sponsor of the Safety Show is WorkCover NSW and they will keep visitors abreast of three key areas with free daily seminars:
- Workers Compensation - What you need to know
- Manual Handling and Smart Move Tool Kit
- Preventing and Dealing with Workplace Bullying
Matching the knowledge will be a vast array of practical solutions. Products and services on offer at The Safety Show will extend from first aid supplies and training through to machine guarding and risk management.

photo print longevity storage methods comparison	"There are some nice little extras, like a secondary input tray for postcard sized photo paper, and a neat CD tray for printing directly onto compatible CD/DVD discs, as also featured in the Canon MP640.
As a dedicated photo printer running six dye-based inks, the PX710W makes a surprisingly good job of mono text printing but print quality is less than perfect where you need it most – in photo output.
We often found that fine detail got lost in lowlight areas and that contrast was a little high, while skin tones were sometimes cool and less than flattering.
Another problem was that the Epson seemed more prone than other printers to print head blockages in the ink nozzles, requiring greater frequency in cleaning cycles, which is not only an inconvenience but also wastes ink.
The PX710W is one of Epson's best photo printers to date but speed and quality could still be better, even in comparison to more general purpose printers like the Canon MP640."	<urn:uuid:c7878e4d-8508-4094-8182-8e8ff10ae085>	0.0

How did ancient leaders die while defending their lands?	"Although this technically constitutes a non-apology apology and was deemed “unsatisfactory” by Muslims, many anti-Jihadists would have preferred the Pope to use the opportunity to make a clearer stand against Islamic aggression.
Still, his comments raised public debate about the issue, and certainly marked progress compared to his predecessor Pope John Paul II, who kissed the Koran in public in an effort to reach our to Muslims.
I have described examples of incredible stupidity and appeasement from Christians in the West, but also of courage and clarity of mind in standing up to Islamic aggression and defending Western civilization and the world from sharia. The ideological civil war within the West is not just between secularists and religious people; it runs straight through the Church itself.
Christians need to understand that there can be no peace or understanding with the Islamic world. They want to subdue us, pure and simple. Church leaders of all denominations, Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, must stop stabbing Israel in the back and campaigning for a de facto open borders policy while Muslims are threatening to swamp our lands. Yes, Christianity teaches compassion, but it also teaches identifying evil and standing up to it. At the end of the day, the Church must decide whether, in the defense of civilization, it wants to be a part of the problem or a part of the solution."	<urn:uuid:754ed7dd-60bc-4e03-8ede-9a33baf49e34>	0.0
Which is older, Levittown suburb or the Delaware Aqueduct bridge?	"The following year, the aqueduct was incorporated as part of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company, but a plan to convert the canal’s waterways into railways was dropped by 1849 due to competition from the nearby Great Western Railway. The canal was used during World War I as part of the Shropshire Union’s war efforts, but throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the canal’s commercial traffic greatly declined as a result of transportation technology advancements and waterway breaches. The canal was formally closed for transportation in 1944, but was preserved throughout the mid-20th century as a water feeder for the nearby Shropshire Union Canal. As a result of leisure boat traffic increase during the later half of the 20th century, the canal was rebranded as a leisure boat route in the 1980s and has become a popular tourist destination.
Rides and Attractions
Today, the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct is owned and operated as a living history tourist site by the Canal and River Trust and remains a popular site for leisure boat travel within the United Kingdom. As the longest and oldest extant navigable aqueduct in Great Britain and the highest structure of its kind anywhere in the world, the structure is preserved as a Grade-I-listed historic structure and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The 18-arched structure is constructed from stone and cast iron and spans the Llangollen Canal over the River Dee, stretching a length of more than 307 meters long in total with a 38-meter-high suspension over the water. 18 hollow masonry pillars comprise the structure’s arches, which connect to the bridge with a network of iron-arched ribs.
Visitors may explore the aqueduct on foot as part of the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct World Heritage Site, which also preserves a number of other historic structures within the nearby Wrexham community. Aqueduct travelers should allow approximately one to three hours for exploration of the site, with walks across taking approximately 45 minutes on foot. Boat trips across the aqueduct and to nearby Llangollen are also offered as separate ticketed attractions, and a variety of walking and cycling trails are provided from nearby Trevor Basin to other areas of the Heritage Site."	<urn:uuid:e41e6929-7a9b-40ce-be63-e75536833ced>	0.0

What are the key variables in convertible debt and bee population health?	"CONVERTIBLE LOAN NOTES – AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF FINANCING IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE
In this thinkpiece, the Goodwin team explore the opportunities for using Convertible Loan Notes as a way to secure funding in these difficult times.

EXTENDING YOUR CASH RUNWAY IN A DISTRESSED ECONOMY: CONVERTIBLE LOAN NOTES IN THE UK
A number of start-ups and high growth venture backed businesses in the UK are feeling the impact of the pandemic with a drop in business activity and supply chain disruptions.
In light of the pandemic, venture capital investors are advising their portfolio companies to be prepared for tougher times ahead and to manage their cash runway.
One way to extend your cash runway is by issuing convertible loan notes – On this page, we look at typical terms for a convertible loan note and how these may change given the market uncertainty being created by the COVID-19 pandemic.
What is a Convertible Loan Note
A convertible loan note (CLN) is a debt instrument – it is a loan that is never meant to be paid back but instead convert into shares in the capital of the company.
Benefits of Using a CLN
CLNs are commonly used to provide bridge financing to extend a company’s runway until its next priced equity financing.
One of the key benefits of using a CLN is it potentially allows the discussion on valuation to be deferred until the next equity financing round as it will usually convert into shares issued in the next round at a discount to the next round price.
CLNs are also quicker to implement than an equity financing – typically there is less documentation to negotiate but crucially it also allows companies to bring in one investor at a time as there is no need to have a single coordinated closing.
If, however, you have investors seeking to benefit from Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) or Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) reliefs then a CLN will not be appropriate and you would most likely need to look to an equity financing round instead.
SEIS and EIS reliefs are very valuable tax reliefs for business angels in the UK and are one of the main reasons why CLNs are not as widely used in the UK compared to the US."	<urn:uuid:ca9cb4fa-118e-4d2e-b2b1-42c08f5d38c0>	0.0
As an aviation engineer, what causes ice formation on aircraft and how is it monitored for safety?	"FAA Calls on the Aviation Industry for Help
The FAA wants to collaborate in order to equip for NextGen and help increase safety and efficiency.
The Federal Aviation Administration will host a ""Call to Action"" summit on Oct. 28 to engage the aviation industry in meeting the Jan. 1, 2020, deadline to equip aircraft with new avionics technology.
FAA and the aviation industry stakeholders plan to discuss how they can work together to resolve barriers and address potential challenges to meeting the mandate to equip aircraft with Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B). ADS-B will move aviation technology from a ground radar system to satellite-based GPS technology, increasing safety and efficiency by providing a more accurate view of aircraft location.
""The FAA has met its commitment and built the foundation for ADS-B,"" said FAA Deputy Administrator Mike Whitaker. ""It is time for all users of the national airspace – avionics suppliers, aircraft integrators, operators, and installers – to work together to ensure that all aircraft flying in controlled airspace are equipped with these NextGen avionics. The full benefits of increase safety and efficiency of the national airspace depend on 100 percent equipage.""
In May 2010, the FAA published a rule that requires all aircraft flying in specific, controlled airspace to equip with ADS-B Out avionics by 2020."	<urn:uuid:cbede9b9-37d2-4ff8-a0dc-97bbbe2afb90>	0.0
outdoor mural painting church artwork protection	"Mandan leaders consider idea to solve dispute over bar mural
MANDAN, N.D. (AP) — Mandan city leaders are considering a proposal to solve an ongoing dispute about whether a Western-themed bar should be allowed to keep a mural in front of the building.
The Lonesome Dove bar artwork and all other existing murals would be permitted under the proposed ordinance, but new murals would have to follow a different set of standards, the Bismarck Tribune reported.
Lonesome Dove owners Brian Berube and August Kersten sued the city over freedom of speech in May after they were ordered to remove the mural. The painting depicts the name of the bar along with a rearing horseman against brown hills at sunset.
The bar owners allege that requiring mural permits “allows the city to play art critic by demanding changes to murals’ artistic details,” according to court records. The city denies the accusations, saying the mural is an “illegal sign for which plaintiffs painted the sign first and then applied for permission second.”
City leaders hope that by exempting Lonesome Dove from amended mural regulations, it can reach a settlement with Berube and Kersten.
The proposed ordinance allows owners to paint wall murals on buildings without approval from the Mandan Architecture Review Commission, which is required in the current guidelines. It would also no longer prohibit painting on the front of a building.
Robert Frommer, a senior attorney with the Institute for Justice, the law firm representing the Lonesome Dove, said the proposed ordinance “raises significant constitutional concerns.” He said he opposes how the proposed ordinance prohibits wall murals that “sell a product or advertise an establishment.”
Artist Melissa Gordon, who has painted several murals in Bismarck and Mandan, said she supports the ordinance. Gordon said she has projects scheduled in Mandan, so she is waiting for the initiative to be approved by the city commission.
City commissioners will vote on the proposal Oct. 1.

what ancient building inspired construction design taj mahal india	"In the 1800s, when the British defeated the Mughals and took over India, the Taj Mahal was looted by British soldiers who cut gemstones from the walls as well as stole candlesticks, doors, and even tried to sell some of the marble.
Years after the Taj was desecrated by soldiers, Lord Curzon the British Viceroy of India in 1900 recognized that this was a structure of immense cultural value and tried to restore it to its former glory. During the restoration, the traditional Mughal-style gardens that surrounded the Taj were updated to the more European-style green lawns.
When India gained independence, the government did not recreate the original gardens but instead chose to maintain and preserve the immaculate lawns that we see in most famous Taj Mahal photos today.
Because of its immaculate beauty and important cultural significance, the Taj Mahal was named not only one of the Seven New Wonders of the World , but also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Today, the Taj sees around 2.5 million visitors per year who head to Agra to catch a glimpse of the 'World's Greatest Testament of Love'.
Today, the biggest threats to the Taj Mahal are air pollution and wear and tear from the sheer number of visitors it receives. Agra, while once the gem of the Mughal Empire, today is an industrial and dusty city. The pollution released from nearby factories and road traffic over the past century has tarnished the mausoleum’s walls turning them yellow.
To prevent further damage, the Indian government has enacted laws concerning the restriction of traffic and factory pollution. The Taj has also undergone a facelift in the last five years where its marble walls were cleaned using a special mud pack.

How does Tim Kloss contribute to the development of poetry at the weekly gatherings at Linneman's?	"Poems are Not a Luxury: Audre Lorde and Adrienne Rich
208 West 13th Street, #210
New York, NY 10011
“Poetry is liberative language,” wrote Adrienne Rich. “Poems are not a luxury,” argued Audre Lorde. How can we understand these claims about the intersection of poetry and politics? This course delves into the lives and works of Rich and Lorde, as we explore their respective poetic oeuvres. To Rich and Lorde, liberation was a through-line of experience between eros, politics, and language. And both express in their works understandings of gender, sexuality, and the body. In a famous interview between the two writers, they discuss poetry as the language of the dark, the feminine, the unconscious; we will explore this tendency in their work and the ways in which their respective renderings of the feminine influenced the trajectory of feminist theory and politics in the mid and late-20th century. Their conversations with one another, and treatments of their legacies by Claudia Rankine, Lisa L. Moore, Marilyn Hacker and others, will inform our investigation of poetry as part of feminist theory. How do Rich and Lorde navigate antiracism and intersectionality among allies with different race and class affiliations? How does poetic form contribute to their political practice? Readings will include Diving Into The Wreck, The Fact of a Doorframe, Uses of the Erotic, Sister Outsider, and the Art of the Possible, among others.

toxic waste dump locations minority communities research history first study	"What do the Columbia Basin, Chesapeake Bay, Puget Sound and the Great Lakes have in common? In addition to being large wet places where people fish, boat, work and play, these waters are all suffering from pollution levels that don't allow them to function properly or to meet the needs of the communities that rely on them.
Bonus question: What do the last three great bodies of water have in common that leaves the Columbia as the odd ecosystem out? Answer: Seventy to several hundred million dollars a year from Congress to fix the most important pollution problems facing them.
Our communities throughout the Columbia Basin have used a variety of toxic chemicals for a variety of purposes. The toxic legacy we've created continues to affect the health of our rivers, fish and people today. Toxic cleanups are never inexpensive. Cleaning up a 1,200-mile river and an approximately 259,000-square-mile basin will require substantial and sustained funding. Sen. Jeff Merkley and Rep. Earl Blumenauer of Oregon have introduced S3025 and HR4652, the Columbia River Restoration Act of 2010, which would authorize funding to study and clean up toxic pollution in the Columbia. This legislation addresses a longstanding need to understand the Columbia's toxic history and employ new toxic reduction practices to restore our river and our fisheries. Whenever new funding authorization is considered, it's important to take a realistic look at the economic cost associated with the circumstances.
We must understand what the toxic condition of the Columbia is costing us to assess the value of a potential $40 million annual investment in addressing the source of those costs. The Oregon Environmental Council conducted a study quantifying the cost of environmentally attributable components of asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, lead exposure, birth defects and neurobehavioral disorders. The council's conservative calculations concluded that in Oregon the cost of health effects attributable to unnecessary toxic exposure for adults and children combined is at least $1.57 billion per year. The cost of impacts to children's health alone is $1.10 billion per year.
Because these costs are diffuse and spread across Oregon, we don't recognize them as preventable consequences of allowing our rivers and skies to be treated as toxic waste disposal systems.
We are debating many ideas about what could be done to reduce toxic pollution without any substantial funding to support the answers. It took a long time and a tremendous investment of money and actions to pollute the Columbia Basin to its current state."	<urn:uuid:cc9eea56-a9a9-4e7d-b729-d18a8ea033c1>	0.0

It is always changing, every month or so there is a new language, library or token standard. You want to stay up with it to provide the most up-to-date information.
How did you get your foot in the door where you work?
So The DEN actually came to 42 and did some presentations. They let me know they were teaching people how to develop in this framework. I told them I wanted to learn, and that is how I got my foot in the door. That is something great that 42 provides. Although they don’t do direct job placement they bring in employers who want to hire and they introduce you to people who may know about available jobs.
Describe what you do at The DEN:
I am responsible for maintaining all curriculum, keeping it up-to-date and making new courses that involve blockchain. I am essentially the person who needs to go in and find all of the technical knowledge, package it in a way that is interesting and engaging and make it so it helps you learn new skills.
What does your typical workday look like?
A typical day starts around 11 am at the office. I will go and research something at night and integrate something new in the curriculum. The other day I was researching opcodes and seeing how they work and figuring out how I want to integrate that into the curriculum. Most of the day involves looking at different chunks of code, writing code, and at the end of the day, we will have a meetup. The meetup will start at 7 pm and end at 9 pm. At the meetup, I will present about bitcoin, etherium, smart contracts, and cryptography. I get a lot more done at night, little fixes will come up during the day. When you are coding or writing any code you need to get into a mindset where you are focusing on that and that alone."	<urn:uuid:a51faf2e-55cb-49b9-a7b7-36b4bbf5e798>	0.0

I'm curious about how hurricanes get their names - what's the story behind this tradition of naming big storms?	"People tend to move their homes and businesses into the paths of hurricanes.
Also, the time that it takes to evacuate some crowded coastal communities is longer than the time for which accurate hurricane forecasts can be made.
The following are tools forecasters and researchers are using to try to figure out these great storms.
While the hurricanes are still far out at sea, forecasters rely on direct observations from ships and instruments on ocean buoys. Satellites are their main toll and can orbit 22,000 miles above the equator at the same rate as the earth’s daily rotation, so always they hover over the same patch of the planet. Their big picture images allow forecasters to track storms night and day all over the Atlantic Ocean. These images are the first important clues to the formation of these storms as well as their location, size and intensity.
As the storms move closer to land, direct measurements are made by “Hurricane Hunter” airplanes.
Routinely, the US Air Force Reserve uses a specially equipped flight of C-130 aircraft to monitor approaching hurricanes. Their pilots fly into the core of the storm. Specialists aboard these planes drip instrument packages through the storms that radio back accurate information about the location of its eye, the strength of its winds, the direction and pace of its progress, and other important features such as air pressure, temperature, and humidity.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also have two special hurricane-probing planes, including a high altitude jet, that are designed for research.
As the storms get within about 200 miles off of the coastline, land-based weather radar begins to give forecasters importantindirect measurements. The new Doppler Radars give forecasters valuable images that give details about the internal structure of the storm – its wind fields, and how they change as a hurricane approaches land.
Forecasters are increasingly relying on computer models to help them forecast the intensity of the hurricane and its movement. Detailed information from all of the satellite sensors, and aircraft instruments, radars, ships and buoys continuously pours into thecomputer models. The results of a whole group of forecasting models are compared with one another as hurricanes approach the coast."	<urn:uuid:210929a1-c8fe-4f4f-9057-8d21e05bb0b8>	0.0
thai english learning strategies classroom support	"Supporting learning progress once students are back at school – useful teaching strategies and tools
Strategies and tools that support teachers’ thinking as they notice and respond to disruption in the learning progress of students in years 1-13 are now available in one easy-to-access place.
In a year affected significantly by COVID-19, students will have experienced different learning opportunities at home to those in the classroom.
Some students may have made progress in areas different to those more focused on in school and teachers will look to celebrate and build on this. Other areas of learning may have seen some interruption and teachers will want to ensure any impact is not lasting.
A range of information is already available for supporting students studying NCEA and we are now beginning to add to this with this collection of strategies and tools. It is intended to support teachers to consider how they respond if they notice students needing more support to move their learning along once they are settled back in the classroom.

think it will matter much...especially since that extra will only make the sock longer if I understand the
Could use your thoughts since you are experienced with the pattern
My favorite place to look for patterns is Ravelry.com :)
I've ordered my yarn and found several possible hooks--have to check gauge. I substituted the yarn for Stroll Tonal Sock Yarn. It's almost exactly the same yardage and was 1/2 the price.
I've never made socks before, but much prefer crochet to knit, so I hope these will be great. I'm excited to try.
I'm hoping we will be able to get help: I've read ahead into the pattern and am already confused! Maybe it'll be easier with the work in hand.

Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council will
meet 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
“Sanctuary advisory council members help us balance protection of our coral reef ecosystem with the concerns of the local community,” said George P. Schmahl, the sanctuary’s manager.
The 11-member Flower Garden Banks Sanctuary Advisory Council consists of eight voting non-governmental members and three non-voting federal government agency members. The advisory council includes representatives from the recreational diving, diving operation, oil and gas industry, recreational fishing, commercial fishing, research, education and conservation communities.
Located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, designated in 1992, includes three separate areas: East Flower Garden, West Flower Garden and Stetson Banks, which was added in 1996. The sanctuary harbors the northernmost coral reefs in the continental United States and serve as regional reservoirs of shallow-water reef fishes and invertebrates.
NOAA National Marine Sanctuary Program seeks to increase the public
awareness of America’s marine resources and maritime heritage
by conducting scientific research, monitoring, exploration and educational
programs. Today, the sanctuary program manages 13 national marine
sanctuaries and one coral reef ecosystem reserve that together encompass
more than 150,000 square miles of America’s ocean and Great
Lakes natural and cultural resources.

innovative hospital care system singapore how different	"The primary mission of the United Hospital Fund, a 501(c)(3) organization, is to shape positive change in health care for the people of New York. Founded in 1879 to support voluntary hospitals and assist them in solving common problems, today the Fund works to advance policies and support programs that promote high-quality, patient-centered health care services that are accessible to all persons across the full spectrum of care.
The Fund undertakes research and policy analysis to improve financing and delivery of care in hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, and other care settings. It raises funds and gives grants to examine emerging issues and stimulate innovative health care programs, and it works collaboratively with civic, professional, and volunteer leaders to identify and realize opportunities for change. The Next Step in Care campaign is one of the Fund’s many initiatives to improve patient care, especially for those most vulnerable. It is taking shape in New York, but is envisioned as national in scope.
The Fund created Next Step in Care in cooperation with health care providers, including hospitals, nursing homes, and home care agencies, as well as family caregivers. How to better manage and improve transitions in care has been a focus of the Fund's Families and Health Care Project (see chronology) since it published ""Rough Crossings: Family Caregivers' Odysseys through the Health Care System"" in 1998. That report dealt with the challenges family caregivers face in patient care transitions and the poor communication and training that oten accompany hospital-to-home discharge.

when emil kurbedinov awarded front line defenders	"Organizations can designate a person/s to be responsible for monitoring new technologies and new security protocols and for updating passwords, and codes, as well as stressing vigilance. Secondly, international human rights orgs can develop relationships with trusted local advisers and meet regularly with them for their assessment of security risks.
Security tools and systems need to be more accessible and usable for human rights orgs. and defenders. Funders should provide additional resources for tech support. It is a challenge finding trustworthy IT support in foreign countries. Sometimes older, and simpler technologies such as a pad of paper and a pen as opposed to a laptop in the field are more secure.
Provide political accompaniment to increase safety. International or national NGOs can accompany local HRDs by acting as a witness and by providing public recognition of a HRDs work. This can involve having a physical presence or writing letters to American politicians or politicians in the host country. The political cost of harming local HRDs then increases if other people are watching and their profile is raised.
Participants noted a number of protection measures to pre-empt the imminent threats to HRDs or respond to threats after the fact. The list included such measures as: temporary relocation, trial observation, emergency grants and relief programs, emergency hotlines, safe houses, protective presence at HRDs offices or homes by internationals or influential nationals, and utilizing organizations that focus specifically on the protection of human rights defenders.
Training staff how to think critically about security rather than only specific tasks using a technology is important. If a HRD considers themselves not well versed in technology this methods helps them realize they know more than they think when it comes to common sense security approaches. They also realize security is an on-going process.

Between Roman and Chinese medicine, which had earlier documented treatments?	"Erica is a UK vitiligo patient, 46 years old, who has suffered vitiligo for 27 years. And she is not the only vitiligo patient, her mother also has vitiligo for decades years. As we all know that vitiligo is also a genetic skin disorder. And she has tried many treatments but there is no obvious effect.
When she searched the website and consulted the online doctor. The doctor talked with her condition and used treatments. The white patches boundary is not clear, which shows that the vitiligo is still in active stage. If she doesn’t control the expansion of vitiligo, there will show new patches on skin. From email and calls, after 4 months communication, she wants to come China to have a try for UM-D vitiligo treatments.
The experts and nurses met her, and the other day make a treatment plan for her in 15 days treatments. There are 3 steps for her. The first step is to control the active stage. The second step repigmentation. The third step is to prevent the recurrence of vitiligo.
The doctor used UM-D system treatments for vitiligo. It is a system of western treatments as well as the traditional Chinese medicine. The Chinese medicine is a type of herb medicine of specialist vitiligo therapy. The herbs can be used to bath therapy, the skin can absorb the medicine to open the follicle of skin, then the medicine is rapidly absorbed. The heat can also promote the herb soup into gas form.
Combined with the modern treatments like laser, cream and tablets, the doctor will give a system treatment. The skin turns red, then after 6 days continue treatments and medication. There are some black dots on skin that is called as melanin island. After two weeks treatments, there are some areas showed the original color.
After 15 days treatments, there already show some good effects. Then she got another 15 days treatments, she was really happy with 3 months medication came back home.
If you also want a further consultation about the treatments, and you are also suffering from vitiligo, you can consult our online doctor and send your problem to firstname.lastname@example.org and hope we can do a favor for you."	<urn:uuid:17568c24-2284-4ac8-b411-ced3bddb885a>	0.0
What makes the underground root system of the silver-leaf nightshade plant particularly challenging for agricultural control and management?	"- Belladonna atropa L.
- Atropa belladonna L.
- A. belladonna acuminata
- Nightshade family
Parts Usually Used
Leaves and flowers
Description of Plant(s) and
Atropa belladonna is a poisonous plant with reddish flowers and shining black berries. Source of various alkaloids, including atropine and scopolamine. Belladonna (beautiful lady) is an anticholinergic. This attractive plant with its thick stems or branches and leaves is somewhat similar to the tobacco plant. However, its axillary flowers, dull brown to dark purple in color, indicate that it is neither tobacco plant or ground-cherry (Chinese lantern). The ripe, shiny black berries often entice children to pick and eat them, with fatal results. Plants can have good and bad characteristics, and this is the case with belladonna. It can kill people, but it is also a life saver.
The Garden Nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.), often thought of as the Deadly Nightshade, but should not be confused with Belladonna. The Solanum nigrum is the rarer of the many nightshade species.
Antispasmodic, diuretic, narcotic, sedative
Various alkaloids, especially hyoscyamine and scopalamine
Sedative, anticholinergic (an agent that blocks parasympathetic nerve impulses) and spasmolytic effects on the gastrointestinal tract. Treats nervous congestion, suppresses the action of smooth muscles, and is helpful for kidney pains, and colitis. It is used in ophthalmology to dilate the pupils of the eyes (Atropine).
The leaves applied externally are used as a treatment and possible cure for cancer by both Western herbalists and in Chinese folk medicine.
Belladonna in powder form from leaf and flowering top of Atropa belladonna Linne or A. belladonna acuminata. It is used generally in tincture form, though the dry extract in tablet form may be used.
If eaten, vomiting should be induced immediately.
This herb is potentially fatal. Could cause death or other serious consequences. Its use is not recommended without professional medical guidance."	<urn:uuid:e9f9b162-158e-4492-b3c2-bc941005a4e3>	0.0

What are BMD test applications and who should get screened?	"Applications for New York City public schools were originally due today, Monday, December 3. However, last week, the Department of Education announced that they were extending their deadline to turn in your rankings to Friday, December 14. They went out of their way to stress it absolutely was not due to what an unmitigated disaster their much vaunted new parent portal is. It’s simply because of… reasons. (In their defense, even before the error-plagued parent portal, the DOE had a long history of extending their own deadlines. But that was usually because either not enough students had applied to the schools the DOE thought they should or, in the case of Universal Pre-K, not enough had applied, period, despite the Mayor insisting there was overwhelming demand.)
Except for the specialized high schools, and LaGuardia, all other NYC public high school choices – Screened, Arts/Audition, Ed-Opt, etc… – go on a single form. Teens can rank up to 12 choices, and an algorithm attempts to give each their top available choice. (Click here for tips on how to maximize your odds of getting in.)
When I work with families to help them navigate NYC’s insanely and needlessly complicated school system, I inevitably get the question, “What’s the best school?”
And I always answer, “The best school is the school that’s best for your child.”
I don’t fundamentally believe that a specialized high school like Stuyvesant is necessarily better than a screened school like Leon Goldstein or Townsend Harris. It depends on what you’re looking for.
Earlier this year, Mayor Bill de Blasio and School Chancellor Richard Carranza introduced a bill that would change admission to the specialized high schools from a single test, the SHSAT, to admitting the top 7 percent of students from every public middle school. (Private and Catholic school kids, you’re not welcome anymore.)
Advocates claim that grades and test scores are a much better predictor of student success than a single test.
Here is where I get confused:
NYC has over 400 public high schools and about 700 programs within those schools. Currently, easily one-third use grades and test scores (along with, sometimes, essays, interviews and portfolio review) to accept students.
How many schools use the SHSAT?
Two in Manhattan, two in the Bronx, two in Brooklyn, one in Queens, and one on Staten Island."	<urn:uuid:68d9f650-77a5-4137-86f7-22ad11624ab7>	0.0
As a prayer leader, how does making intention for regular prayers compare to Janazah prayer regarding Qibla and timing requirements?	"Do you believe in magic?
The end of the year is ripe with holiday celebrations and an overwhelming field of possibility as people are willing to believe in miracles. It is the perfect time to watch as your visions, dreams, and prayers show up in your life.
In this episode ofThe Deep Dive with Adam Roa, I discuss the power of prayer and how you can use it to create the reality you want.
Here’s what you’ll hear:
- My own personal prayer I use to set intention and ask for strength
- Why Burning Man is so transformational
- How to use prayer to manifest the life you desire
- Why Christmas is the most powerful time to set intentions
Prayer, to me, is setting a powerful intention for what you want to experience in life. It is the understanding that we are somehow connected to God or a higher power. By acknowledging this, we can use our prayers to recognize our own power and create a life of our own design.
If you have a negative reaction to hearing the word “prayer,” I understand. In this episode, I explain my own personal history growing up in church as well as how I’ve shifted my ideas around it.
If you want to use the collective magic to create a life you love, then this episode is for you.
Thank you so much for listening to this podcast. I hope it inspires you to pray more and set your intention for the new year. Please subscribe and leave a review on iTunes so that we can share this message out to more people and help them to believe in magic.
Feel free to tag me on social media and let me know what prayers or intentions you’ll be sending out to the universe this holiday season.
Always, in all ways, you are seen, you are heard, and you are loved."	<urn:uuid:7df25f52-57ec-4a54-919c-83532d150e58>	0.0

environmental factors cold stress list	"Mayewski cited a long list of recent extreme weather events in the Northern Hemisphere: the drought in the western United States, the historically cold East Coast winter of 2014, the initially mild winter of 2015-16 that suddenly gave way to record cold temperatures.
“All of this points to instability,” he said.
In historical perspective, Arctic warming over the past five years is “as fast and as large a magnitude” as the warming that occurred during the last vestiges of the Ice Age 11,500 years ago — the transition that gave birth to our modern climate age, Mayewski said.
The Arctic’s climate system has followed largely linear patterns until now.
“While none of the global climate models predicted we’d have an Arctic warming so fast, it no less happened. The models are based on input from the last few decades. We’re experiencing something which is a surprise, a quick change in the climate system,” he said, citing the rapid release of greenhouse gases and the hole in the ozone as accelerating factors.
As the Arctic continues to warm, it will release dangerous amounts of the greenhouse gas methane, which absorbs the sun’s heat and further warms the atmosphere. In the first two decades after its release, methane is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide, according to the Environmental Defense Fund.
What Trump administration might mean for the environment...
Now, with warming well underway in the Arctic, climate scientists stress that the only way to change course is to dramatically mitigate the rise of greenhouse gases worldwide.
“The more we can mitigate now, the better we are,” Mayewski said, calling the Paris Agreement on climate change a “fantastic start and a very important cornerstone.”
President-elect Trump campaigned on the promise to withdraw from the international climate accord.
Earlier this month, Donald Trump said he is “open-minded” about climate change — but added that “nobody really knows” the truth about it, contradicting the near-universal scientific agreement on the issue.
This year from January to November was the warmest such period for the Earth on record, according to NOAA. That follows another record-breaking warm year in 2015."	<urn:uuid:d5b0785b-16a8-4106-8f72-1b87c33671bc>	0.0
I'm studying bird population dynamics and need to understand how black ducks move between regions during migration. What percentage of black ducks stay in their original Canadian regions versus moving to wintering areas?	"Boldly patterned and brightly colored, the Wood Duck is a beautiful and distinctive bird, similar in appearance to its Chinese cousin, the Mandarin Duck. Wood Ducks are members of a group within the duck family (Anatidae) known as the “perching ducks”; while not closely related to one another, members of this family, unlike most ducks, perch and nest high in trees. This preference for elevated nest sites has the advantage of protecting young ducks from predators. However, it provides a challenge for ducklings, who leave the nest the day after hatching and are unable to fly. They use their sharp claws–another trait unusual among ducks–to climb out of the nest cavity, then jump, sometimes up to 65 feet, to the earth below! The day-old ducks are so light, however, that the fall doesn’t injure them. Hunted nearly to extinction by the end of the 19th century, legal protection and conservation efforts made the recovery of the species an early and dramatic success story in the history of American wildlife management.

In computer science, specifically in algorithms related to pathfinding, a heuristic function is said to be admissible if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal, i.e. the cost it estimates to reach the goal is not higher than the lowest possible cost from the current point in the path.
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems.
In computer science, amortized analysis is a method for analyzing a given algorithm's complexity, or how much of a resource, especially time or memory, it takes to execute.
Any-angle path planning algorithms are a subset of pathfinding algorithms that search for a path between two points in space and allow the turns in the path to have any angle.
In computer science, anytime A*, also known as anytime repairing A* (ARA*), is a variation of the A* search algorithm.

How do tax benefits differ between hybrid arbitrage funds and municipal bonds?	"- Convertible Arbitrage: Convertible bonds combine elements of both stock and bonds in one trade. Convertible arbitrage funds build long positions of convertible bonds and then hedge the long exposure. Arbitrageurs attempt to make profits by identifying pricing discrepancies between the convertible bond and its component parts, and then continually monitoring these component parts for any change in their relationship.
- Market Neutral: MManagers construct long/short portfolios of equal weightings that eliminate market risks so to drive return purely from stock selection.
- Statistical Arbitrage: Managers use quantitative analysis to construct a market neutral portfolio. Managers, typically, build multifactor models to identify those factors that have a consistent impact on security prices.
Corporate Structure Strategies
Corporate structure strategies take advantage of significant corporate transactions like a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy. These funds attempt to generate returns by concentrating their portfolios in companies where it is more important to understand the event. The trade involves taking less market risk in favor of more company specific risk. Sub-Strategies include:
- Distressed: Distressed debt hedge funds invest in the securities of a corporation that is in bankruptcy or likely to fall into bankruptcy. The fund may short sell the company to profit on declining values or may purchase the security prior to the company announcing its reorganization plan to the bankruptcy court with the expectation that there will be a positive resolution with the company’s creditors. A manager may also employ capital structure arbitrage through buying and selling certain securities of the same company depending on the estimated outcome.
- Merger Arbitrage: This strategy generally entails buying the stock of the firm that is to be acquired and selling the stock of the firm that is to be the acquirer to capitalize on pricing spreads based on a successful completion of the announced merger.
- Event Driven: Event driven managers attempt to profit from significant market events that are nonrecurring, including merger arbitrage, but also can be in the form of spin-offs, share buy-backs, and re-organizations. Because the events are nonrecurring, financial markets typically do not digest the information associated with these transactions in a timely manner.
These funds are designed to take advantage of a wide-range of opportunities presented by various markets. Opportunistic strategies typically take directional bets in specific markets or securities. Sub-strategies include:
- Global Macro: Global macro funds take a macroeconomic investment approach on a global basis. These are top-down managers who invest opportunistically across financial markets, national borders, and commodities."	<urn:uuid:e218ffe7-9d55-45ba-b622-8ebb7a748c95>	0.0

head lice life cycle how many days until mature adults capable crawling between hosts	"Thermal treatment with warm water has become a common method for the control of sea lice. It is not completely effective to eliminate all stages of the louse, but it is estimated that it can eliminate between 75% and 100% of mobile lice.
A disadvantage is that warm water treatment can cause different consequences that affect the welfare of the fish after treatment. Although treatment with warm water is frequently used, the opposite approach - treatment with cold water – has until now not been investigated.
Rapid temperature decrease
The optimal thermal range for sea lice is unknown, however, it is known that they require temperatures of 4°C upwards to successfully complete their life cycle, and that under this temperature, mature females, eggs and larvae fail to reach the infective stage.
Despite that, little is known about how lice cope with a rapid decrease in temperature and whether this could cause mortality or reduce their ability to remain anchored to salmon.
With this background, researchers from the University of Melbourne, Australia, and the Institute of Marine Research, Norway, analysed whether temperature-specific treatment with cold water is a viable strategy as an antiparasitic method.
Fewer lice but more damage
To do this, they exposed fish infected with Lepeophtheirus salmonis to a rapid transfer from 15°C to several low temperatures of treatment for different durations and also analysed if there was any damage in the fish that was detrimental to animal welfare.
The researchers tested the effects of cold water treatment in the short term (0.5 and 10 min) and in the long term (30 and 240 min) at temperatures of -1, 1 or 5°C divided into 8 groups.
“The treatments with water at -1°C for 10 minutes and 1°C for 240 minutes reduced the loads of mobile lice but created more damage to the skin and eyes than the control treatments,” the authors said.
Industrial-scale research required
They also stated that despite having a potential as a control method, the long-term effects on the welfare of the fish and the possible evolutionary impacts on the thermal tolerances of lice should be considered together with their use.
“Our results on the antiparasitic and welfare effects require detailed research on an industrial scale, since agglomeration, pumping and passage of fish through treatment units add additional and possibly synergistic effects in the elimination of lice and pose more risks of animal welfare,” they concluded."	<urn:uuid:9855e07d-6753-4f87-880a-1585877d81b8>	0.0

best mic placement violin sound holes	"Hope you are all doing well.
I am wanting to record my violin and put together some audio/video with lots of different parts and instruments. I don't know much about recording equipment but with my sister's help I have been looking at the Blue Microphone range.
She thinks I could either get the Blue Snowball:
The Blue Yeti:
Or the Blue Icicle:
I think I am swaying towards the Blue Icicle, which is a Microphone to USB adapter/converter (??). Because it is a bit cheaper, and my sister has mics that I can use with it.
Any thoughts or recommendations?? I am looking at a price range of up to $150 AUD
Has anyone used any of the above?
Thanks in advance.
The Blue's are pretty good microphones. I have a Blue Snowball. Not my best microphone, but a good one. However, I think for recording fiddle there's a good chance that a ribbon mic may do a better job. I have not had a chance to test out that hypothesis, but that's what I've been told by people with more recording experience than I have.
A positive attitude may not solve all your problems, but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort. ~Herm Albright
I will keep my eye on this thread.
I too, am in need of a mic to record. Maybe something compatible with Ipad... or maybe something that works with my regular camera. I haven't figured it out yet.
Right now I am using Ipad and Sound cloud.
And of course I am tempted with the green screen thing... but maybe for another day...
Vibrato Desperato.... Desperately seeking vibrato
I have the Blue Yeti, and absolutely love it. I paid $150.00 US for mine.
It's USB, and has 4 different settings to accommodate various types of recordings/noise reduction etc. Also has a headphone jack, mute button, and gain control.
The one plus for me with the Yeti, was the fact that my violin still sounds like it's a violin on a recording. I also use it for live shows online.
I've also seen a lot of people using the Snowball, but haven't tried one myself.
Hope that helps a little.

How do wave power plants impact marine ecosystems and what are their effects on global pollution compared to other energy sources?	"Marine Pollution and Toxicology
Mission and Research Lines
Our oceans and aquatic resources are endangered due to pollution, mainly from human action, and sources of pollution are very diverse as well as its effects.
At the School of Marine Studies we are working mainly on establishing baseline data for the presence of chemical pollutants such as metals, oil and nutrients and associated biological effects in aquatic organisms (so called biomarkers). Marine plastics are also an area of research mainly the presence of microplastics. The data will be useful for future monitoring programs and environmental risk evaluation.
The effects of these pollutants (biomarkers) are being studied in aquatic organisms (bioindicators) to understand the mode of action of these pollutants and their negative impact to the wellbeing of these organisms and how these organisms deal with the exposure to these pollutants.
In more detail, our research focus in three main lines: 1) establishment and validation of biomarkers and bioindicator species as early warning tools for the presence of classical and emerging contaminants, in estuarine and coastal environments, 2) study the regulation and functioning of detoxification processes in fish species and to evaluate the potential of emergent contaminants to modulate them, and 3) assessment for the presence of microplastics in marine ecosystems and potential effects to the biota.
● Assessment of damage caused to the aquatic ecosystem from the sewage spillage in the Cunningham River
Sewage spillages are among the major contributors to aquatic pollution in estuaries and coastal areas. Raw human wastewater contain a mixture of contaminants, that include high concentrations of organic compounds such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous. Biodegradation of the sewage organics result in the production of inorganic nutrients (such as nitrate and ortho-phosphorous) which lead to eutrophication of the aquatic environment. Eutrophication is a known consequence of sewages discharges that seriously impacts the health and development of most organisms inhabiting any aquatic environment. Sewage also contains heavy metals and these can bio-accumulate in fish and shellfish making them unhealthy and unsafe for consumption. On December 6 2014, strong winds and floodwaters severely impacted the Central Division of Fiji causing flash floods in low lying areas of Suva."	<urn:uuid:2db0acb3-b278-4b0d-9598-d81ee36cbfcd>	0.0
Could you explain the annual food preparation scale and timing for this traditional German festival that's been running since 1974?	"WAUSAU, Fla. (AP) — Democrat Alex Sink can make a claim her eventual Republican opponent for governor won't be able to make: She ate possum on the campaign trail Saturday.
Yes, possum — the marsupial that looks sort of like a giant rat and likes to hang from its tail.
Sink was one of several statewide candidates to attend the annual Possum Festival, though only she and U.S. Rep. Adam Putnam, a Republican agriculture commissioner candidate, actually ate the tough, chewy beady-eyed mammal.
""I had possum when I was a child. I didn't eat it every week,"" said Sink, who was raised on a North Carolina farm and thus wasn't squeamish about poking her fork into the well seasoned chunks of meat. ""It was tender and tasty.""
The top Republicans running for governor, Attorney General Bill McCollum and millionaire Rick Scott, didn't attend the festival.
The possum festival is a tradition that's gone on for decades. Former state Rep. Loranne Ausley, a Democrat running for Sink's current job of chief financial officer, had a 1974 picture of her father at the festival when he ran for state Senate.
""That's the first time I came, when I was 10 years old,"" said Ausley, who like the other candidates bid on possums for the opportunity to stand on stage and hold the mammal by the tail.
The candidates shake the creatures to keep from being bitten. So it may have been the only appropriate time to yell at a woman candidate, ""Shake it baby, shake it"" — as one woman shouted while Ausley was on stage.
Sink handled her possum like a pro. When her husband, Bill McBride, ran for governor in 2002, she attended the festival.
""I had more trouble eight years ago. I had a much bigger possum. It tried to crawl up and bite me,"" Sink said.
Putnam was lucky enough to get the last serving of possum. He said he's eaten rattlesnake and Rocky Mountain oysters but this was his first taste of marsupial.
""It wasn't as greasy as I had heard. It tasted like pork pilau,"" said Putnam. ""I assumed it was fried, like all good things. I was a little bit apprehensive that it was Crock-Pot possum because everything's good fried."""	<urn:uuid:ba4387f5-390f-49c1-b919-c13b1b305b0b>	0.0
How do they make metal-looking props shiny?	"Guard-n-Edge is a decorative, protective cover for metal landscape edging. It is designed to protect people and pets from sharp and potentially dangerous metal edging. Metal / Steel edging is commonly used as a border to separate landscaping materials. Because of its simplicity, low cost, crisp and curvy style, and ease of installation, metal strips are an effective solution for lawn edging. However, the exposed metal edge is very sharp, and many children and pets are injured from metal edging every day. Many home owners have purchased homes and are unaware of the dangerous exposed metal edging that was used in their landscaping. Most realize the danger after it is too late, and they are making a trip to the veterinarian or emergency room. Removing and replacing metal edging with another type of edging can be very laborious and costly. Even disposing of metal edging can be a safety concern. Now, there is no need to remove the existing metal edging as Guard-n-Edge can be easily installed over the existing metal edging to convert it into a safe and decorative border. Besides the safety aspect of Guard-n-Edge, it converts exposed shiny or rusty edging into a decorative border. Many homeowners spend well over thousands of dollars to landscaper their property. They include grass, trees, shrubs, flowers, decorative rock and mulch. Shiny metal edging amongst those materials just seems wrong! Guard-n-Edge is made of flexible, high-density polypropylene with maximum UV protection. In basic terms, this is the same time proven material that is used in manufacturing outdoor play ground equipment. Guard-n-Edge is made tough and durable to withstand variable weather, foot traffic, and will even hold up and on against nylon-line edge trimmers. Guard-n-Edge is made in three foot lengths. Ten sections are packaged together to make thirty feet per package.

What's bigger - Boston's Museum of Fine Arts or The Tech Museum's BioDesign exhibit?	"Residential school exhibit honoured with Ontario Historical Society award 0
On behalf of city council and the community, Mayor Dave Canfield congratulated Lake of the Woods Museum on being honoured by the Ontario Historical Society with the Museum Award of Excellence in Community Programming. The award was presented in recognition of the museum's landmark exhibit 'Bakaan Nake'ii ngii-izhi-gakinoo' Amaagoomin: We Were Taught Differently'.
Museum director Lori Nelson accepted the award on behalf of museum staff, directors and exhibit committee volunteers at a presentation ceremony June 4 at the North York Civic Centre in Toronto.
At council Monday, Canfield read the Ontario Historical Society citation that accompanied the award presented for excellence in community involvement and programming.
The citation reads:
""Seeking to promote understanding of and respect for the cultures and heritage of the Lake of the Woods area, and to engage a diverse community in discovery and learning, the museum developed a groundbreaking exhibit in 2008.
With nine First Nation communities within an hour drive of the museum, the need to develop positive cross cultural awareness was identified in community strategic planning exercises. As the story of the Indian Residential School continues to affect the residents today, the museum undertook to tell the story.
Developed in partnership with NeChee Friendship Centre and the Lake of the Woods Ojibway Cultural Centre, the exhibit was an important community milestone to recognize the contribution of First Nations people, and facilitate understanding.
The museum's exhibit, 'Bakaan Nake'ii ngii-izhi-gakinoo' Amaagoomin: We Were Taught Differently' was a landmark display chronicling the residential school experience, a challenging topic.
Described as exceptional in terms of content and as stunning visually, the exhibit respectfully interpreted the difficult topic. The exhibit included outreach with a former student available to speak to classes and a series of educational programs, including the gathering of former students and a presentation to build awareness and develop a positive impact on relationships in the community.
The exhibit has been recognized by the Aboriginal Healing Foundation and the Lake of the Woods Museum was invited to bring the exhibit to the National Forgiven Summit in Ottawa in 2010. Because of the importance of the theme, the exhibit was developed to travel to other communities and venues."	<urn:uuid:3f016d77-a3f7-4f18-a799-50ff1cbc80a0>	0.0
I'm curious about famous painters - did both Metro Meteor and Franz Josef Kline create abstract art pieces that were sold commercially?	"Both descriptive and abstract at the same time, this image demonstrates what Siskind described as combining the intuitive impulses rooted in surrealism with formal rigor characterized by its simple composition, dominance of dark tonalities, and emphasis on the rectangular frame and flat plane of the picture. For Siskind, subject matter had become less important than creating photographs that were “psychological in character.”
Siskind’s preoccupation with shape, line, and gesture drew comparisons with abstract expressionist painting. He knew many of the artists associated with the movement and was particularly friendly with Franz Kline who in the late 1950s paid homage to Siskind in a series of paintings named after him. Siskind returned the honor in a body of work made between 1972 and 1975. Comprised of six groups of images of walls taken in different places, including Boston, Rome, Jalapa, Mexico, and Lima, Peru, the series Homage to Franz Kline evokes the dynamic feel of Kline’s paintings as exemplified by Jalapa 47 (lot 167, $1,200-1,800).
Siskind pursued abstract imagery for the remainder of his career. His final body of work captures the dark curvilinear shapes of road tar against weathered and textured asphalt. The story goes that he drove around with a companion to search for “poetic” tar to photograph. In 1989, he produced a portfolio of six photogravures from his Tar Abstracts series (lot 169, $5,000-7,000). While he also made gelatin silver prints of this subject, Siskind appreciated the rich and painterly quality of the photogravure technique, a process with visual qualities similar to aquatint etching. With their gestural marks, textural contrasts, and graphic power, Siskind’s road tar photographs are the fulfillment of his desire to use photography as a medium for personal expression.
Come learn more about Siskind’s work and see these beautiful photographs in person during our Gallery Walk and auction preview on Thursday, January 22, at 6 pm!"	<urn:uuid:43c24959-bc3a-44d0-b300-58d824d29981>	0.0
When do Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas according to their calendar?	"This year the full moon is on Tuesday, March 30 (55285) so Easter is the following Sunday. Growing up, this meant that we got to color eggs and eat candy, when we got back from church.
Few in this country know that there are sometimes two Easters, Eastern and Western. This year they coincide, but in the Eastern Orthodox church (and other eastern churches) Easter can sometimes follow in the next Sunday, or after the next full moon, four or five weeks later, because they still use the Julian calendar to compute holidays. I have Greek relations by marriage who celebrate the Orthodox holidays.
I also have Jewish relations by marriage, who celebrate holidays on the Jewish lunar calendar. Originally, Easter was based upon the Jewish holiday of Pesach, or Passover. This holiday lasts seven or eight days, beginning on the full moon that falls on the 14th day of the month of Nisan. Since Jewish days start at sunset, this year that is the evening of Monday, March 29 (55284). Easter often occurs during Passover, as it does this year, but since Christians now use their own calculations, Passover is sometimes a month after Easter. I usually celebrate this with my in-laws. Other Jewish holidays also are connected to the phases of the moon; for instance, the Jewish new year, Rosh Hashanah, is on a new moon near the equinox in September.
Muslims also use a lunar calendar, but theirs is purely lunar, so it drifts every year in relation to the solar calendar. They have holidays on new moons, including the new year (Al-Hajra) and the beginning and end of Ramadan, but these can happen on any date in the Gregorian calendar. The current Muslim year began around December 18 (55548) and Ramadan begins around August 11 (55419). The exact dates depend upon actual observations of the new moon, and can vary from place to place.
So even though we have a solar calendar, for me, at least, the phases of the moon are significant on my social calendar.

How do doctors detect serious medical conditions like epilepsy and brain tumors in patients using brain monitoring?	"Published on December 25th, 2014 | by News Feed
Colorado Approves Over $8 Million For Medical Marijuana Research
For the first time ever, government money will be used to support medical marijuana research. It was a historic moment this week when Colorado granted more than $8 million to further study how marijuana could impact devastating health conditions like brain tumors, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, and Parkinson’s disease.
While it’s still in the early stages, the grants are evidence that we are officially moving into a new frontier for medical marijuana in the United States. The initial studies will likely throw open the floodgates and more researchers will take interest and further studies will follow closely behind.
Dr. Suzanne Sisley, a psychiatrist in Arizona, is thrilled to see government funds going to learn about the positive impacts of weed for patients. “This is the first time we’ve had government money to look at the efficacy of marijuana, not the harms of marijuana,” she explained. Sisley plans to pioneer a new study to investigate how marijuana could help veterans suffering from PTSD.
Dr. Larry Wolk, Colorado’s Chief Medical Officer, said the research is desperately needed because doctors need more specific information to better guide their patients. “There’s nowhere else in medicine where we give a patient some seeds and say, ‘Go grow this and process it and figure out how much you need,’” Wolk said. “We need research dollars we can answer more questions.”
Money for the grants will come from Colorado’s medical marijuana patient fees. The program received 57 applications from interested researchers, but the advisory board chose eight proposals to sponsor for this first round of grants. The studies will cost an estimated $7.6 million, but the board approved grants totaling $8.4 million in case researchers exceeded their budget proposals as is oftentimes the case.
There are currently 117,000 people registered in Colorado’s medical marijuana registry. Each individual must pay $15 per year to stay on the state list. By using the money collected from the registry for research, Colorado will move towards better treatment for these patients. Hopefully, this will open the door for other states to begin funding medical marijuana research as well."	<urn:uuid:aa77c9cb-5e52-43f1-bca3-3a1480c92b2d>	0.0
How do the setting methods differ between homemade cranberry curd bars and traditional apple butter when preparing them for storage?	"Once I had my lovely lemons I had to decide what to make with them! There are so many things one can do with a Meyer lemon! I decided on lemon curd first as I wanted the lemons to be the star of the recipe so I could fully appreciate their flavour.
This recipe uses 3 lemons and makes just one jar of lemon curd, So the verdict of my first Meyer lemon curd? It is very fruity and sweeter than curd made with regular lemons, its delicious! Made on a sunny day following a bitterly cold couple of weeks the taste of this lovely curd made from lemons ripened in the California sunshine sang Spring to me.
Meyer Lemon Curd (adapted from this recipe by Rachel Allen)
- Zest and juice from 3 Meyer Lemons
- 75 grams ( 3 oz) butter
- 100 grams (3.5 oz) caster sugar (I used unrefined sugar)
- 2 eggs
- 1 egg yolk
- Put the lemon zest,juice, butter and sugar into a saucepan, heat gently until the butter has melted.
- Whisk together the eggs and egg yolk.
- Pour the egg mix into the lemon and butter, whisking quickly. Keep whisking until the mixture has thickened, this took 3 minutes for me. Keep the heat low or the eggs will scramble. No matter how careful you are, in my experience little flecks of cooked egg white will still appear which is why I follow with the next step.
- Remove from the heat and push through a fine sieve with the back of a spoon into a bowl to remove any cooked egg.
- Pour into a sterilised jar.
- Once cool keep in the fridge.
Christmas is almost upon us! I had such good intentions of writing some Christmas blog posts, however I’ve found that time is fast disappearing and all I do seem to be writing are lists! I’ve yet to even finish writing my Christmas cards! I did want to share this speedy gift idea though.
Although I love the idea of giving homemade gifts, sometimes food gifts can be tricky. The can have a short shelf life, don’t travel well and sometimes less foodie friends just don’t know what to do with them! This gift however has none of these issues!

Soft Tissue Massage
Soft tissue mobilization, or massage, focuses on muscles, ligaments, and tendons. Often if a patient hasn’t had a chance to use a set of muscles due to illness, or has been injured in that area, the tissues can become scarred, and robbed of the precious fluids that promote flexibility. Soft tissue massage focuses on limbering up these damaged areas while promoting overall wellness."	<urn:uuid:3e9139dc-07a6-4e50-bc60-070151ee6de2>	0.0

Can you tell me about Nolan Ryan's pitching speed and strikeout achievements?	"Nolan Reimold has started this season like I thought he’d start the 2009 season. And the 2010 season. And the 2011 season. See a pattern? If not, I suggest answering C on all standardized tests and lowering your safety school expectations. It feels like Reimold’s been sleeping on his post-hyper’dom since Branch Rickey was just a twig. He has 25-ish homer power and 10-ish steal speed. If he gets on one, he hits 30 homers and steals 15 and is a top 25 outfielder. If he hits his head on his post-hyper-ness, you drop him. In my Nolan Reimold fantasy from January, I gave him the line of 65/24/80/.250/10. Don’t wanna trust January Grey because he’s been known to hit the bottle? ZiPS updated their projections for Reimold to 65/22/68/.260/10. So don’t trust me. But you gotta trust someone in this life. You can’t go it alone. Cause when you let people in, the world opens up to you. I think the preceding was a speech given by Patrick Dempsey in an 80’s movie that was followed by a slow clap. Anyway, here’s some more players to buy or sell this week in fantasy baseball:
Henry Rodriguez – I wish I was in one of the 90% of ESPN leagues where HanK-Rod isn’t owned, but it might be impossible because at least 75% of the ESPN ten-team leagues are one guy who owns all 10 teams with ten alias then goes into the ESPN forums and says, “I’m going to grace you with my presence and answer a few questions. If you wish to know my credentials, look at my virtual trophies on my virtual mantle on my virtual profile.”
Jake Peavy – Which Peavy are we getting? The one that’s good when he’s pitching or the one that’s not good at pitching because he’s injured? Isn’t it clear? I didn’t say, “Isn’t it the clear?” Now, now.
Lance Lynn – You know why there’s so many repeat customers in these Buys? Because people picking up players in ESPN leagues are like De Niro in Awakenings."	<urn:uuid:5f656b84-c687-419d-9c71-8dece1d32a9d>	0.0

What does being DRC Conflict-free mean?	"Some do not start from this, but they feel discontented and read, and having read, they start imagining the non-dual state.
Krishnamurti: It is a theory. The fact is one thing and the idea about the fact is another. We are not concerned with the man who supplies a conclusion derived by a specialist. We are only discussing about a man who is in conflict and is discontented with that conflict. How does he get out of it?
C: The traditional way is to explore through books. Man attains by negating and resolves by knowledge.
Krishnamurti: Proceed step by step. I am in conflict. Now, how do I resolve it? You say by knowledge. What is knowledge?
C: The realization of conflict is knowledge.
Krishnamurti: I do not have to realize it, I am in conflict. I know I am in conflict, in pain, in sorrow. What do you mean by knowledge and what do you mean by conflict? To know that I am in conflict, is that knowledge? Or do you call knowledge what I should do about that conflict? When you use the word ""knowledge"", what do you mean by that? What is the sanskrit equivalent of that word?
Krishnamurti: What does that mean? Knowledge about what? Is it the know- ledge about the cause of conflict?
C: Jnana will also apply to the nature of conflict and how it arises.
Krishnamurti: How does it come into being and how does it work? What is the nature and structure of it? To know the cause is to know the structure and the nature of pain. Do you call that knowledge?
C: Sir, jnana has been divided as that which pertains to the phenomenal world and that which refers to the non-phenomenal world.
Krishnamurti: What do you mean by conflict?
C: Conflict is duality.
Krishnamurti: We know what the word ""knowledge"" is. What do you mean by the word ""conflict""?
C: Dwandva - conflict between the two - hot and cold, pleasure and pain, happiness and sorrow.
Krishnamurti: So let us proceed: I am in conflict."	<urn:uuid:a6018536-70eb-4078-bff6-3a234d5cad90>	0.0

contrast hunting tactics versus shot success rate tree stand spot stalk bow hunting	"You don’t need as much traditional hunting gear like camo, calls and elaborate scent attractions and you don’t necessarily have as much downtime. While deer hunting involves sitting in a stand or blind for hours, hog hunters spend a lot of time spotting from Mules/ATVs and then stalking. Instead of one or two deer, it’s possible you’ll spot a plethora of porkers! In fact, avid hog hunters are known to shoot hundreds…yes, hundreds…of hogs in one night!
To have a successful hog hunting trip, you will want to go out at night, and you will need lights and specialized optics to navigate, scan, spot and shoot hogs in the dark. Gearing up is part of the fun!
Things to Bring Hog Hunting
Pigs are very focused when feeding, so their food plot is the perfect spot to find them, giving you the chance to get up close—as close as 50 to 30 yards for the perfect shot. Set your feeder to throw at least two times at the same time every night—about the time you suspect you’ll be hunting. Don’t space your feeding times too far between, so that the hogs keep coming back—about an hour between feedings is good. Hogs have a keen sense of smell and will smell food from miles away. The perfect place for your feeder is in a clearing close to a water source, brush and cover.
The Moultrie Standard feeder is made of durable UV-resistant plastic and holds 30 gallons of feed. It is programmable up to 4 times a day, from 1 to 20 seconds each time. It stands 5.5-feet tall and has a durable metal spin plate. Set up is extremely easy and the display conveniently alerts you of battery life, feed weight and when it is time to refill. It runs off four AA batteries and has a port to connect a solar panel.
Whether you hunt from a blind, stand or walking, you need a stable platform to take your shot. Some blinds have built-in rifle rests, however, if you’re spot-and-stalk hunting, you will want shooting sticks, so you don’t miss an unexpected opportunity. The right shooting stick, monopod or bipod needs to have legs adjustable to your shooting position, lightweight enough to carry long distances and provide rock solid stability. The Bog Pod shooting tripod doesn’t leave one feature out."	<urn:uuid:3058f1aa-1e4b-42e9-9652-8a63b65ffa8c>	0.0

BOYA started this torture from the backside of The Grand Chapel, and led the pack off to the east through interesting (editor's note: By ""interesting"" she means ""low socioeconomic/high African American demographic) neighborhoods and industrial warehouses. First beer near was found in a relatively warm storm sewer by 13th Street and the Ditch, which we discovered was also evidently the man cave of PBR. Here, we were amazed to find out that Mexico exports crappy beers similar to Genny Lite. We then followed trail to the north, passing McAdams Park, and through even more industrial areas. Second beer near was found by old railroad tracks by the rendering plants near 21st Street. We were delighted to find even more crappy beer, but this time it was accompanied by the wafting aroma of rotting cow carcasses. (Thank you, Cargill.) Now, here's where the trail turns exceptionally shitty. The hare led us northwest across 21st Street, over fences and along a litter-strewn creek. If the entire pack avoids contracting some horrible disease, it will be a miracle. NBA, for one, needs a tetanus booster after an encounter with a barbed wire fence. We continued to the north along the creek, past an abandoned factory from which gunshots were periodically emitted (editor's note: I want to stress that NBA is serious. Someone was shooting guns inside of an abandoned building that the hare actually intended to circle behind).
We found the on-in a little to the north of the factory with a serape-clad Darth Vader waiting for us."	<urn:uuid:9b6477c4-1a6e-4b60-8bf1-f71a032cf5e1>	0.0
As a literary scholar, I'm curious how death inspires creation in Joyce and Verdi. Care to explain?	"As we encounter the bellicose reparteé of two Neanderthal men—Mutt and Jute—in the first chapter of the novel, Joyce challenges us to develop an ethno-critical kind of thought. As Mutt encounters Jute, the hybrid native meets the ambiguous colonizer/Jutlander, and here Joyce plays with and inverts the roles of native and invader, moving beyond Manichaean constructions of history. In so-doing, Joyce radicalizes and repurposes the hackneyed trope of the Vikings’ assimilation to native Gaelic culture, and while the latter become “more Irish than the Irish themselves”, we are left with the sense that the Irish ‘mutts’ become less like themselves by virtue of the same process.
To further this deconstruction of historical roles, the Battle of Clontarf becomes a teachable moment in the Wake, as it works to complicate the received Manichaean narrative that the foreign invader was somehow expelled by the resilient natives in 1014. As Joyce himself remarks:
Finally, the bloody victory of the usurper Brian Boru over the nordic hordes on the sand dunes outside the walls of Dublin put an end to the Scandinavian raids. The Scandinavians, however, did not leave the country, but were gradually assimilated into the community, a fact that we must keep in mind if we want to understand the curious character of the modern Irishman (CW 159-60).
This is taken from a lecture that Joyce gave in Trieste on the topic of Irish identity in 1907, ironically entitled “Ireland, Island of Saints and Sages”. Here, the Wake’s vision of “miscegenations on miscegenations” (18.20) comes to the fore, as Ireland functions as what Thomas Hofheinz calls a “transparency”: a historiographical overlay of a diverse array of settler cultures. Joyce’s aim is to critique the homogenizing of identity that he saw at work in certain strands of Irish culture—from the church’s promulgation of a pan-Catholic, confessional culture, to what would seem like (from a modern vantage), rather chauvinistic references to a Gaelic “race” (we find this kind of language in Douglas Hyde’s The Necessity for De-Anglicizing Ireland, a talk given to the Irish National Literary Society, in 1892)."	<urn:uuid:bf4f3d87-2c62-40fa-8c3c-46f2519daa7c>	0.0

I'm designing outdoor electrical components and need to understand Santoprene's weathering characteristics alongside its adhesive bonding limitations. What are its outdoor durability properties, and which adhesive solutions work best for it?	"Ultra-violet-reactive resins also exhibited varying degrees of yellowing; additives such as activators can exacerbate this tendency. Silicon rubbers proved stable under simulated climate conditions, but their visual and physical qualities make them unsuitable as break-fixers, because they are highly viscous, soft, and cloudy; their inability to be redissolved is a further disadvantage when considering their use on historical glass. Instant glues, mostly cyanacrylates, do not yellow, but their adhesion to glass is very unsatisfactory.
Materials commonly used in workshops as paint-layer consolidants, included waxes, acrylic resins and some silicium-organic products, were tested. The behaviour of the waxes varied according to the temperature: at low temperatures they tended to be brittle and prone to crack, at higher temperatures they softened and were capable of expanding to fill the gaps. They are opaque and not colourless, but showed no tendency to yellow in the tests. The excellent ability of the widely used polyacrylate Paraloid B72 to withstand weathering was confirmed by the tests, though its ability to adhere to the glass surface was considerably reduced in humid weathering conditions.
Apart from the materials commonly used in workshop practice, alternative types of edge-bonding agents were also tested in the laboratory; this confirmed the general material qualities of these product groups. In a special series of tests, the viscosity of the thin-fluid epoxy glues was increased by adding highly dispersive silica gel, to see if this made them easier to apply. The durability tests showed a slight reduction in the glues' adhesive abilities with higher concentrations of additive. Some of the ultra-violet-reactive glues proved to have the best results overall. The newly developed light-reactive glues proved not to possess the necessary adhesive and cohesive qualities to fix glass breaks satisfactorily. Silicon rubbers generally proved to be durable adhesives, but were on various grounds unsuitable for break fixing.
The tests on alternative materials developed for paint-layer consolidation were the most comprehensive, and the following products were analyzed: stone-conservation materials based on polysiloxanes and polyurethanes; clear lacquers based on polyurethanes and alkides; and artificial resins based on acrylic and epoxy resins. In addition, aminosilane adhesion facilitators were added to improve the adhesive durability of these substances."	<urn:uuid:a23c81a6-594e-430f-b85b-1bce13f3e446>	0.0

4+4 Days in Motion Festival, October 10 – 18, Palace U Stýblů and other Prague locations: contemporary, modern, thought-provoking theater, dance, visual arts, and debates
Prague, August 19 – 4+4 Days in Motion: International Festival of Contemporary Art, is coming to Prague again. From the 10th to the 18th of October, Prague will be flooded by “cultural adrenalin”: a number of modern, thought-provoking, interesting and stimulating events in various artistic genres, from dance and theater, exhibitions and audiovisual projects, to debates and guided tours. The many events include a large exhibition of contemporary art, located in the currently unused Palace U Stýblů on Wenceslas Square; performances by dance and theater troupes from Austria, Belgium, Israel, Norway, and the US in the Archa Theater; art projects from Belgium and the Netherlands, taking place outside traditional theaters; premieres of new performances by local troupes; or the Czech Crash international symposium, introducing a number of performing arts organizers. Apart from the abovementioned locations, the festival will take place in the Alta Studio, Ponec Theater, the former Center for Folk Handicraft at Národní třída, and several other unconventional locations.
“The Archa Theater will present five dramatic and dance productions from abroad, offering serious reflection of contemporary topics, as well as fun and entertainment. The productions are seemingly unconnected by any common theme, story or motto. However, anyone looking for a connection will surely find it,” says program coordinator Pavel Štorek. Austrian choreographer Doris Uhlich and Belgian choreographer Jan Martens present dance performances reflecting issues in contemporary society. Israeli choreographer Hillel Kogan and Norwegian dancer/choreographer Yaniv Cohen offer a sarcastic confrontation of current Middle East reality and severe religious criticism. American director and performer Zachary Oberzan cleverly intertwines fiction and documentary theater. The Belgian company CREW and Dutch director Lotte van den Berg will present projects taking place outside traditional theaters."	<urn:uuid:f417ed60-a9b8-4335-8e2b-ef63158b2403>	0.0

What are the 4 teaching approaches for speech disabilities?	"Learn the basics
You can make a positive difference in a student’s life by providing an inclusive environment. Not sure where to begin? See the basics guide for a list of simple things teachers can do to make a difference. Next, find out more about the language used when talking about a student's disability and how to use strengths-based language that focuses on their strengths, interests and personality traits.
3. Collaborate with other teachers and staff
Collaboration between teachers is important for creating a consistent approach in every class to learning and behavioural strategies for a student with disabilities. For teachers, learning how to work well with students with disabilities may involve learning new skills and trying new approaches.
Teachers can support each other to be inclusive and work out the best ways to tailor the content of their classes. They can talk together about strategies and activities that worked well with students, as well as those that didn’t. This way teachers can learn from each other’s experiences and will feel more supported.
Peer mentoring can build teachers’ skills and confidence. You may consider inviting an experienced secondary teacher who has worked with secondary students with different abilities to work with you for a day, or working with a specialist in the field to support the participation of students with disabilities and developmental challenges in your program.
4. Learn about the different types of disabilitiesLearn about the different strengths students may have, and read evidence-based strategies that are effective in school settings for each disability.

What's the maximum allowed shot shell load for handicap competitions?	"Unfortunately, ice hockey will largely come to a halt in the Netherlands in the coming month. Only youth under the age of eighteen are allowed to train with restrictions and play matches within the club. The competitions will in any case come to a standstill for the next four weeks, the cabinet announced yesterday.
Today, consultations are being held between NOC * NSF and the various sports federations about the exact effect of the measures. This concerns the measure that national competitions in all sports, except football in the Eredivisie and Eerste Divisie, will be stopped. It remains to be investigated how these national measures relate to international competitive sport.
All amateur team sports for adults, where it is impossible to keep 1.5 meters distance, are prohibited from Wednesday 22.00 PM. Individual sports, such as in the gym, or team sports with a maximum of four people, are still allowed. Children up to 18 years old can train and play mutual matches with teams from their own club.
In addition to the sports canteens, the showers and changing rooms will also remain closed. Public is not welcome at competitions. By stopping amateur competitions, the cabinet hopes that the number of travel movements will be limited. Individual sports and team sports with up to four people may still continue. It seems as if only football in the Eredivisie and Eerste Divisie are exempt from the ban.

body composition testing methods hydrostatic weighing dexa scan radiation exposure safety concerns	"Association Between Body Composition and Natriuretic Peptide Levels
The association between natriuretic peptide levels and BMI is illustrated in Figure 1. For both sexes, BNP and NT-proBNP levels decreased in a stepwise fashion across categories of increasing BMI (P<0.0001 for trend for all comparisons). In multivariable Tobit linear regression analysis, an inverse association was confirmed between BMI and BNP, as shown in Table 4. Of note, a similar inverse association was observed between BMI and NT-proBNP. To eliminate the assumption of a linear relationship between natriuretic peptide levels and BMI, we repeated the multivariable models using BMI as a categorical exposure variable. The results of these models with BMI treated categorically were qualitatively unchanged from those that modeled BMI as a continuous covariate. Model 1 used BMI as a measure of obesity, and model 2 replaced BMI with directly measured fat and lean mass values from DEXA body composition analysis. Both models are shown stratified by gender and adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, hypertension, LV mass, and end-diastolic volume. Other considered covariates (see statistical methods section) were not statistically significant in the final multivariable model. When BMI was replaced in the models by direct measurements of fat and lean mass from DEXA body composition analysis, only lean mass retained the independent inverse association with both BNP and NT-proBNP; fat mass was not associated with either BNP or NT-proBNP, also shown in Table 4.
Logistic regression analyses were also performed in which low BNP or low NT-proBNP were considered as categorical variables; the same covariates were evaluated in these models as in the linear regression models described above. The adjusted ORs for low BNP (<4 ng/L) and low NT-proBNP (lowest sex-specific quartile: <7.6 ng/L for men, <20.4 ng/L for women) are shown in Table 5. Again, model 1 used BMI as a measure of obesity, and model 2 replaced BMI with directly measured fat and lean mass values from DEXA body composition analysis. Qualitatively, these results are identical to the linear regression models. Higher BMI was associated with increased odds of low BNP and low NT-proBNP for both men and women."	<urn:uuid:c7612b9b-04d3-4c8e-af34-9e0c94f54760>	0.0

Whether you reside in a cozy apartment or possess a petite balcony, this comprehensive guide will equip you with the knowledge and techniques to nurture an abundance of potatoes in even the most confined spaces.
Unveiling the Benefits of Soilless Potato Cultivation
Ditch the constraints of traditional soil-based gardening and embrace the myriad benefits of soilless potato cultivation:
- Maximize Space Utilization: Vertical gardening systems allow you to cultivate potatoes upwards, transforming limited spaces into vertical potato havens.
- Enhanced Yields and Quality: Soilless techniques provide unparalleled control over nutrient delivery, fostering healthier plants and bountiful harvests of high-quality potatoes.
- Reduced Water Consumption: Embrace water conservation with soilless methods, ensuring efficient water usage and minimizing environmental impact.
- Minimized Disease and Pest Pressure: Soilless cultivation reduces the risk of soil-borne diseases and pests, safeguarding your precious potato crop.
Exploring the Realm of Hydroponics and Aeroponics
Delve into the world of soilless potato cultivation, where two distinct techniques reign supreme: hydroponics and aeroponics.
Hydroponics: Nurturing Potatoes in a Nutrient-Rich Bath
Hydroponics immerses your potato roots in a nutrient-rich water solution, providing optimal access to essential nutrients. Popular hydroponic systems for potatoes include Deep Water Culture (DWC) and Nutrient Film Technique (NFT).
Aeroponics: Suspending Potatoes in a Nutrient Mist
Aeroponics takes soilless cultivation to the next level by suspending potato roots in a mist chamber, periodically spraying them with a nutrient solution. This technique maximizes root exposure to air and nutrients, promoting vigorous growth and disease resistance."	<urn:uuid:f045703c-c8cf-4b51-b033-83f19993431e>	0.0
How does competition work in the Tomiki aikido system?	"Although aikido is a relatively recent innovation within the world of martial arts, it is heir to a rich cultural and philosophical background. Aikido was created in Japan by a man named Morihei Ueshiba. Before creating aikido, Ueshiba trained extensively in several varieties of jujitsu, as well as sword and spear fighting. Ueshiba also immersed himself in religious studies and developed an ideology devoted to universal socio-political harmony. Incorporating these principles into his martial art, Ueshiba developed many aspects of aikido in concert with his philosophical and religious ideology.
Aikido is not primarily a system of combat, but rather a means of self-cultivation and improvement. Aikido has no tournaments, competitions, contests, or ""sparring."" Instead, all aikido techniques are learned cooperatively at a pace commensurate with the abilities of each trainee. According to the founder, the goal of aikido is not the defeat of others, but the defeat of the negative characteristics which inhabit one's own mind and inhibit its functioning.
At the same time, the potential of aikido as a means of self-defense should not be ignored. One reason for the prohibition of competition in aikido is that many aikido techniques would have to be excluded because of their potential to cause serious injury. By training cooperatively, even potentially lethal techniques can be practiced without substantial risk.
It must be emphasized that there are no shortcuts to proficiency in aikido (or in anything else, for that matter). Consequently, attaining proficiency in aikido is simply a matter of sustained and dedicated training. No one becomes an expert in just a few months or even a few years.

How does heat affect clay drying and workplace lung risks?	"Plaster naturally dries at a slow rate, and rushing its drying can cause premature cracks. The right humidity level for plaster application is between sixty and seventy percent.
Having the right temperature is crucial to the proper drying process. Plaster takes longer to dry in cold and damp rooms, while warmer temperatures help it to set faster. Plaster that has not been properly maintained will be weak and may crack easily. The temperature of the room must be 41 degrees Fahrenheit or above, as anything below that will result in poorer bonding and possible problems. Plaster that is applied to a room with high humidity needs a constant temperature of at least seventy percent.
A dry layer of plaster will take longer to set than one that has a thin layer. Temperatures can also make it take longer to set. Other factors that can affect the amount of time it takes to dry are the thickness of the plaster and whether the area has a natural current. Winter temperatures can also affect how long it takes for plaster to dry, especially if there is not much sunlight or heat. However, these are factors that can be controlled.
Mold can form on wet plaster
It’s possible for mold to form on wet plaster if the material becomes saturated with water. Plaster is made of a non-porous substance derived from lime or clay. The water can only penetrate the surface of the plaster, and the mold will grow only on it, without producing any toxins. If you see mold growing on your plaster, it’s probably not the mold you think it is. It’s most likely mold growing on paint, dust, or organic particles that are present in the area.
Often, artists seal plaster surfaces to minimize the porosity. It’s also important to keep the relative humidity level as low as possible, since high or low humidity can lead to several problems. Mold can form on wet plaster when the material dissolves in water, and is particularly susceptible to mold. Mold can be easily damaged by abrasive materials. Mold can be especially problematic on antique pieces, such as paintings, sculptures, or furniture.
Often, white mold can be the culprit in a damp environment. If you notice white mold, it’s likely that you have mildew, a common fungus in the same environment. You may mistake it for efflorescence, a mineral deposit caused by seepage of water. To test for this fungus, try a water test."	<urn:uuid:37875f8c-9465-4acd-bb7b-8b377080b55f>	0.0

armenian culture preservation and resistance ww1	"Fact No. 22.
The Armenian-Persian legacy dates back to antiquity.
Whether the name be Media, Persia, or Iran, whether the regime be the Achaemenids of the 6th-4th centuries BC, or later the Parthians or Sassanians, the Safavid dynasty in medieval or early modern times, the Qajars, or the current Islamic Republic, the Armenian and the Persian peoples share an ancient connection that stems in part from their geographic proximity, but also from a shared culture, many elements of which criss-crossed through the Alborz mountains, the Arax river, and Lake Urmia over millennia.
The interaction in the distant past was between kings and emperors, and between priests with probably similar practices of worship. Although the dynamic changed when the Armenians adopted Christianity in the 4th century AD and Islam spread further south a couple of hundred years later, vast areas inhabited by Armenians often continued to be ruled or influenced by the shahs next door.
The actions of one ruler in particular, Shah Abbas I, led to the formation of the distinct modern-day Persian-Armenian or Iranian-Armenian community. A scorched-earth policy on the borderlands during war with the Ottoman Empire in 1604 resulted in the mass deportation of Armenians from around Julfa in Nakhichevan (a region that is part of the Republic of Azerbaijan today, bordering Armenia and north-western Iran). The Armenians were resettled in the then-capital, Isfahan, which retains the heart of the Persian-Armenian heritage in the Armenian Quarter of Nor Jougha – or New Julfa, named for the old city.
It is Tehran, the current capital, that boasts the greatest number of Armenians in Iran today although the Armenian presence in the north-western regions of the country dates back farthest. In fact, the Armenian churches and monasteries of St. Thaddeus, St. Stephen, and the chapel at Dzordzor form part of the UNESCO World Heritage List within Iran. They continue to be visited as sites of pilgrimage.
Through centuries of history, the Armenian contributions to Iran range from trade, to crafts, to culture, education, and even politics. Armenian individuals were involved, for example, in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution of 1905-1911."	<urn:uuid:43bf97c7-dad8-4c2c-86dd-03ee769bdf13>	0.0
What are the benefits of contests and the legal requirements?	"Until recently, same-sex couples could not legally marry. Now, some are finding they must wed if they want to keep their partner’s job-based health insurance and other benefits.
With same-sex marriage now legal in 35 states and the District of Columbia, some employers that formerly covered domestic partners say they will require marriage licenses for workers who want those perks.
“We’re bringing our benefits in line, making them consistent with what we do for everyone else,” said Ray McConville, a spokesman for Verizon, which notified non-union employees in July that domestic partners in states where same-sex marriage is legal must wed if they want to qualify for such benefits.
Employers making the changes say that since couples now have the legal right to marry, they no longer need to provide an alternative. Such rule changes could also apply to opposite-sex partners covered under domestic partner arrangements.
“The biggest question is: Will companies get rid of benefit programs for unmarried partners?” said Todd Solomon, a partner at McDermott Will & Emery in Chicago.
It is legal for employers to set eligibility requirements for the benefits they offer workers and their families — although some states, such as California, bar employers from excluding same-sex partners from benefits. But some benefit consultants and advocacy groups say there are legal, financial and other reasons why couples may not want to marry.
Requiring marriage licenses is “a little bossy” and feels like “it’s not a voluntary choice at that point,” said Jennifer Pizer, senior counsel at Lambda Legal, an organization advocating for gay, lesbian and transgender people.
About two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies offer domestic partner benefits, but only a minority is changing the rules to require tying the knot, said Deena Fidas, director of the workplace equality program at the advocacy group Human Rights Campaign.
Because same-sex marriage isn’t legal in all states, “many employers operating in multiple states … are retaining their partner benefit structures,” said Fidas.
Most companies making the changes, including Verizon, are doing so only in those states where same-sex couples can get married. And most give workers some time to do it.
“We gave them a year and a quarter to get married,” said Jim Redmond, spokesman for Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, which made the change for employees shortly after New York allowed same-sex unions."	<urn:uuid:abe13c2c-418a-4f69-ae62-762702b679de>	0.0
What healing roles do masters serve in martial arts versus veterinary settings?	"The promotion of Daoism in China, wedded to the knight-errant tradition, parallels the resurrection of the samurai spirit for Japan’s modern army, whose officers carried swords as symbols of the Japanese soul….”Already by the end of the 19th century there seems to have been a political dimension to the perception of Daoism’s role in the martial arts. This would become more pronounced as the Republic era progressed. In time it would become the single most important defining factor in the great Taiji debate.
“Although 19th century reformers had pointed out that archery and charioteering were part of the classical Confucian curriculum, they could only sell the martial as an expedient for national salvation and could not turn it into something transcendent. If progressive 19th century reformers rejected Daoism as representing passivity and superstition, a subset of conservative intellectuals intuited that only Daoism could transform the martial arts into a dao.” (Wile p. 21)
Ironically some of the strongest institutions and voices supporting the Zhang Sanfeng/Daoist origins of Taiji came from the KMT backed martial arts establishment. While still dedicated to the modernization and standardization of the traditional fighting arts, the Daoist origins of these practices became a critical element of the argument that they were in fact “national” in character and could be used to strengthen the people, both physical and spiritually. If the reformed martial arts were to be made to serve the national good, it was important to show that they stemmed from China’s ancient primordial past. The myth connecting Zhang Sanfeng and Daoist alchemy to the creation of Taiji, which was quickly establishing itself as the national art, served this purpose admirably.
Of course not everyone was equally happy with this development. Regional masters in local marketplaces disliked the competition from the new national Guoshu networks as it threatened their livelihood. Yet they did not have much of a voice in elite debates over social reform or the nature of national identity.
Instead it was leftist intellectuals, also interested in the role of physical culture in social reforms but opposed to the KMT and its conservative policies, who voiced the loudest concerns about the links between Daoism and the traditional martial arts."	<urn:uuid:f4078b3a-57a1-4edb-a085-c682dbb8eddb>	0.0
medical procedure fix hole eardrum patch repair surgical options	"Having an ACL reconstruction treatment can give you a competitive edge when it comes to sports or other physical activities. As the recovery process speeds up after the procedure, you will be able to return to training more quickly and take part in competitions if you desire. This can give you an advantage over athletes who still need to rest from their injuries.
Improved Self Esteem
The ACL injury can take its toll on your self-esteem and mental health. But with an ACL reconstruction treatment, you can begin to rebuild your confidence quickly. As your mobility and strength improve, so will your self-image and outlook.
Decrease Stress Levels
Finally, ACL reconstruction treatment can also help you to relax and reduce stress. By relieving the source of the injury, i.e. the damaged ACL ligament, you can go through life without stress, worry and fear of another ACL injury. Moreover, improving your mobility and reducing pain in the leg area can allow you to be more active and find ways to reduce stress.
An ACL reconstruction treatment can offer all of these benefits, giving you your mobility and quality of life back. So if you have suffered an ACL injury, don’t hesitate to consider an ACL reconstruction treatment today.
Things To Remember When Considering ACL Reconstruction Treatment
Some people who have undergone knee injuries or taken part in sports activities may require a surgical procedure called ACL reconstruction treatment. This treatment is often recommended by medical professionals to address issues related to knee injuries. It’s essential to consider your options before opting for this treatment, as there are certain factors you must bear in mind. Here, we’ll discuss the top few things you should remember when considering ACL reconstruction treatment.
Understanding What ACL Reconstruction Treatment Is
ACL reconstruction treatment is a surgical procedure done to fix the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which connects the thighbone to the shinbone and helps with knee stability and movement. It becomes damaged due to certain activities or a sports-related injury and may require ACL reconstruction treatment to repair or reconstruct the ligament. This surgical procedure involves removing the damaged tissue and replacing it with a substitute.
Expected Risks and Benefits of the Treatment
ACL reconstruction treatment is generally considered safe and effective. However, as with any surgery, there are risks associated with the procedure. Possible risks include infection, blood clots, and nerve or joint damage. Speaking to your doctor or surgeon before the procedure will help you understand the potential risks and any possible side effects."	<urn:uuid:9c089e43-38ef-4601-a923-c1603450b234>	0.0
How did Western powers react differently to Soviet control of Poland in 1945 compared to the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968?	"Tomorrow it will be the turn of Poland and Romania. When Germany has obtained the oil and wheat it needs, she will turn on the West. Certainly we must multiply our efforts to avoid war. But that will not be obtained unless Great Britain and France stick together, intervening in Prague for new concessions but declaring at the same time that they will safeguard the independence of Czechoslovakia. If, on the contrary, the Western Powers capitulate again they will only precipitate the war they wish to avoid."" . Perhaps discouraged by the arguments of the military and civilian members of the French government regarding their unprepared military and weak financial situation, as well as traumatised by France's bloodbath in the First World War that he was personally a witness to, Daladier ultimately let Chamberlain have his way. On his return to Paris, Daladier, who was expecting a hostile crowd, was acclaimed. He then told his aide, Alexis Léger: ""Ah, les cons!"" (Ah, the fools!).
Joseph Stalin was also upset by the results of the Munich conference. The Soviets, who had a mutual military assistance treaty with Czechoslovakia, felt betrayed by France, which also had a mutual military assistance treaty with Czechoslovakia. The British and French, however, mostly used the Soviets as a threat to dangle over the Germans. Stalin concluded that the West had actively colluded with Hitler to hand over a Central European country to the Nazis, causing concern that they might do the same to the Soviet Union in the future, allowing the partition of the USSR between the western powers and the fascist Axis. This belief led the Soviet Union to reorient its foreign policy towards a rapprochement with Germany, which eventually led to the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939.
The Czechoslovaks were greatly dismayed with the Munich settlement. With Sudetenland gone to Germany, Czecho-Slovakia (as the state was now renamed) lost its defensible border with Germany and its fortifications. Without them its independence became more nominal than real. In fact, Edvard Beneš, the President of Czechoslovakia, had the military print the march orders for his army and put the press on standby for a declaration of war."	<urn:uuid:7f6ac84d-a72c-483f-b33e-3cf63de6d788>	0.0

What happens when two different viruses infect the same cell?	"Examples include:
Macro viruses infect documents that are created using specific programs or applications that contain macros — mini-programs making it feasible to automate a set of operations so that they are performed as one act, saving the user from having to carry them out separately. Examples include:
These viruses alter the paths indicating the location of a document. When you execute a program (a file with the extension .EXE or .COM) that has been infected by this virus, then you are unknowingly running the app; the original document or program was relocated. Once your system is infected, it becomes incredibly difficult — if not impossible — to find your original files.
These viruses intercept or detach themselves otherwise — using different algorithms and encryption keys — each time they infect a system, which makes it impossible for antivirus programs to locate them using string or trademark searches. Additionally, it allows them to create a significant number of copies of these. Examples include:
- Satan Bug
These viruses infect applications or executable files (files with an .EXE or .COM expansion). When one of these programs is run, either directly or indirectly, the virus is activated and generates the damaging effects it is programmed to perform. The vast majority of current viruses belong to the category and can be categorized depending on what they do.
These viruses contain encrypted malicious code and typically replicate by decrypting spreading and themselves. When encrypted, it is difficult for antivirus software to detect them. However, as soon as they decrypt themselves in an effort to disperse, your antivirus can capture them fairly easily.
These could be considered file infector viruses, like a resident and direct action viruses. Once they get into your system, they follow other documents that already exist; Quite simply, so as to perform their own disease routines, they could either wait until a program is run (resident viruses) or act instantly by making copies of themselves (direct action viruses). Examples include:
These viruses quickly spread through a native Network Area (LAN), and sometimes throughout the internet. They generally multiply through shared resources like folders and drives; when they infect a computer, they hunt through the system to find new prey. Once they have completed infecting that computer, they proceed to another, repeating the cycle. The most dangerous network viruses are:
These viruses are like resident viruses (though they do not host themselves on your computer’s RAM), and include a finder module and a replication module."	<urn:uuid:0caa6c36-47be-4d27-a089-619ed3ebb7a5>	0.0
how many agents participated protocol division aiwolf 2021	"Before McLAUGHLIN, KALODNER and GANEY, Circuit Judges.
Appellant was convicted of being engaged in the business of accepting wagers and failing to pay the occupational tax in connection therewith, in violation of 26 U.S.C. §§ 7262, 7203.
The application for the issuance of the warrant was supported by the affidavits of Irving B. Dubow and A. Joseph Toscano, Special Agents, Intelligence Division, Internal Revenue Service. Both affidavits were executed June 28, 1961. The central problem is whether these affidavits contained sufficient evidence to establish probable cause to search appellant's residence, 18A Hamilton Place, Jersey City, New Jersey. Agent Dubow stated that on September 29, 1960, he had participated in the execution of a search warrant on the same premises, appellant's home. At that time, he stated, ""There were seized within, on the upper and lower floors, cartons containing packets of coded current lottery number slips, an adding machine, records, wagering paraphernalia and secreted currency in excess of $50,000.00.""
Agent Toscano in his affidavit said that, ""Joseph Moriarity has a criminal record dating from at least December 26, 1930 and continuing until July 1960. He was arrested six times for possession of number slips and in July 1960, was arrested by Special Agents of the Intelligence Division for conducting a gambling operation in violation of Sections 4401, 4411, 4412, and 7203, Title 26, United States Code.""

Treating Sleep Apnea Might Be a Win-Win for Golfers
FRIDAY, Dec. 13, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Treating their sleep apnea improved middle-aged men's golf games, according to a small new study.
Latest Sleep News
""The degree of improvement was most substantial in the better golfers who have done a superior job of managing the technical and mechanical aspects of golf,"" said study lead author Dr. Marc Benton, medical director of SleepWell Centers of New Jersey, in Madison.
Researchers looked at 12 men with an average age of 55 who had moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. The sleep disorder is characterized by frequent episodes of disrupted breathing during sleep.
Their golf performance was assessed before and after up to six months of a sleep apnea treatment called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which helps keep a person's airway open by providing a steady stream of air during sleep.
The therapy led to less daytime sleepiness and improved sleep-related quality of life. The men also had a significant 11 percent drop in their average golf handicap index, a formula used to estimate a player's skill level.
Among better golfers who had a handicap of 12 or less at the start of the study, the average handicap fell by almost 32 percent after CPAP treatment, according to the study, which was published in the Dec. 15 issue of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.
The men attributed their improved golf performance to factors such as improved concentration, endurance and decision making.
""With the cognitive enhancement afforded by successful treatment of their sleep apnea, they saw measurable improvement early and more significantly than those who were less skilled,"" Benton said in a journal news release.
The researchers said most avid golfers in the United States are men aged 40 to 70, which is a group with a high rate of sleep apnea.

What was the increase in students walking to school in Hanoi?	"Why you should have a couple massage in Hanoi
Posted by Admin
Wouldn’t it be great to spend some time relaxing and reconnecting with your significant other while enjoying a holiday in Hanoi together? A Couple Massage is a great way to do just that. There are lots of great benefits to couple massage, and a couple massage will be a perfect gift during your sweet holiday in Hanoi.
What Are the Benefits of Couples Massage?
Couples massage is a popular service at Hanoi spa, any time of year. Basically, two people are massaged in the same room, at the same time, by two different therapists. It can be a husband and wife, girlfriend and boyfriend, same-sex partners, or moms and daughters, or best friends.
What happen during the couple massage?
Couples massage is a massage that takes place in a room large enough for two massage tables. What you get in a couple massage varies greatly based on the location and focus of the therapists you select. In a Hanoi spa, couple massage typically includes access to showers, hot tubs and more. In a therapeutic setting, the focus is on the bodywork, so while the amenities might be less extravagant, the therapists are typically better trained. In a therapeutic couple massage, each therapist has an individual conversation with the massage guest to determine his or her goals for the session. At spas in Hanoi, it’s common for one massage guest to want a focus on relaxation, and the other on tending to aches and pains from athletic activities.
Benefits of a couple massage?
- It’s not a secret that massage is great for relaxation, but for a couple this is a great way to force each other to stop and take a minute together. A couple massage is a great way to free yourselves from technology and spend a relaxing, intimate moment together and make a perfect summer holiday in Hanoi.
- Marriage and family counselors will tell you that massage is a great way to release. In that moment, you are driven to let go of the past and the future and focus on the present. Couple massage allows you both to focus on each other and on the moment thus helping you reconnect.
- A Couples Massage can also help increase your feelings of affection for each other. Massage has been touted to release “feel-good” hormones that increase your feelings of intimacy.
- Couple massage is bonding experiences because you’re experiencing relaxation and bliss together."	<urn:uuid:c20e88bb-d0ad-4804-b26d-bcc16e638f3d>	0.0
What should teachers prepare before starting an afterschool lesson?	"Piano lessons provide a number of benefits that people of any age range can enjoy. They work well as a means to relieve stress and as a means of self-expression, particularly for kids. They also are a child’s starting point in learning music reading and music theory which gives them a big head start for learning all other instruments. In fact, most professional musicians suggest starting music study with piano lessons.
Today we will look at how to prepare for your child’s first piano lesson. Take note of these steps as they will help you make the most of that first piano lesson. As Kenneth Thompson, CEO and Founder of MACSAinc states, “The first teacher is the most important teacher!” The first teacher builds the foundation for your child’s love of music and inspires them to achieve greater things in piano lessons and music in the years to come. Your child’s first piano lesson is step one of a lifelong journey.
Evaluate Your Child’s Goals in Learning Piano
Before taking your child to their first piano lesson, look at your goals as a parent and what may help motivate your child to get the most out of piano lessons.
There are many reasons to take piano lessons:
- Piano lessons are great for your child’s brain. Music works on all parts of the brain in a coordinated way. If they are analytical it will help them become in touch with their emotions. If they are more emotionally grounded it will help them develop self-discipline, learn to break goals down into smaller daily tasks and apply themselves towards reaching long term goals.
- Piano lessons are fun! Excellent piano teachers seek to find ways to motivate and inspire your child towards success no matter what their level.
- Piano lessons help your child understand and enjoy allmusic more. As they explore the world of music through the piano their minds, ears and hearts will find even more joy in listening to music of all styles and from all cultures.
- Piano lessons set the foundation for learning any other instrument! Most students find that piano lessons provide a thorough grounding in music reading that they can then use with any other musical instrument they wish to learn in the future. This greatly speeds up learning of multiple instruments.
Communicate Openly with Your Teacher
Your child’s piano teacher is an expert who wants the best piano lesson experience for you and your child. They have become a professional piano teacher because of their enthusiasm for helping adults and children reach their potential at the piano."	<urn:uuid:0598ce8f-5bbe-4fb3-80c2-99cf533c812d>	0.0
why earth domes good for growing plants	"- If you are using cups it’s a good idea to plant three to four seeds per cup, and at least two per cell in the seed trays. This will insure that something comes up in each cup or cell. Don’t forget to write on each cup what you planted in it, or mark your row of cells in the seed starting tray with popsicle sticks. Do this for each type of plant you will be growing.
- Place your cups into the sheet pan, or any kind of container with a short lip on it that will hold water. Make sure your seed starting trays come with a bottom that holds water, most do. Some come with domes too but I don’t think these are necessary.
- Ok it is critically important to keep the soil moist. When you get up in the morning spray the top of the soil. Do this again in the evening or whenever you notice the surface of the soil is dry. But minimally twice a day. You must be consistent about this. After the seeds sprout and become established you can start watering from the bottom. Just pour some water into the tray and you will be watering all the cups at the same time. not to much though you don’t want to over do it. As they get bigger more water will be required.
- After the seedlings reach about three inches tall you will need to decide what plant in that cup or cell is the strongest. Using a pair of scissors cut the other seedlings off about 1/4″ above the soil or pinch them off with your finger nails. Be careful not to injure the one you want to keep. You do not want to pull the ones you are culling out, this could damage the strong plants roots.
- Now I suggest using cups right from the start because at some point if you are growing in a seed tray with small cells “lets say a Tomato plant” it’s roots are going to fill out the cell. If you don’t transplant it into a larger container like a plastic cup it will become root bound this will stunt the further growth of the plant. So I just start right out in the larger cups. By the time they are in danger of becoming root bound, it’s time to plant them outside anyway.
- How to harden off your plants. About a week before it’s time to transplant out in the garden you have to harden your plants off."	<urn:uuid:515cad2d-6a68-4900-bb71-a4dc2a60968d>	0.0

Faced with new recycling laws, city leaders said they decided to build their own plant after growing tired of waiting for the county and other cities to agree on where to build a waste transfer station.
Even if the Waste Commission adopts the Camarillo proposal, Oxnard officials said they still may pursue construction of a recycling and waste transfer plant in their city.
""We have made overtures to every other city in the western waste shed and we would love to have the other cities join,"" Herrera said. ""But right now we have to worry about our obligation to meet the dictates of state law."""	<urn:uuid:872e0cf8-2cc0-4421-8bbd-0be6b355c2d6>	0.0
How does the Index of Urban Green Zones Allergenicity work?	"by Corine Laan (Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences) and Nanda Piersma (Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and CWI)
Parks are necessary for sustainable urban vitality. We studied the optimal availability of parks by combining open data sets with polygons and classification frameworks from urban planning literature. Both distance and population density should be considered as measures of availability when planning urban parks.
Urban green spaces may have a historic origin or be planned in cities for purposes such as maintaining biodiversity, recreation, health, climate control, amelioration of air pollution and fire protection. Parks and their facilities may be owned and maintained either by municipalities or private parties. Studies show a positive relationship between the availability of parks and the health and the wellbeing of residents.
The evaluation of urban green space has been studied from different perspectives, including city planning, user appreciation, availability and accessibility, and its function in the urban context. Many case studies from these perspectives have given city planners and municipalities tools to manage urban green spaces in their cities.
The classification and evaluation of urban green spaces has commonly accepted indicators such as availability and accessibility [R1]. Availability is defined here as a quantification of green spaces (in size and distance) without consideration of public availability or proximity to residential locations (WHO2016). Accessibility is defined as a quantification of green space availability to general or specified public groups in relation to distance, expressed in service radius, or neighbourhood green index.
With the availability of more and new data sources on green urban areas, the classification framework for urban green spaces can be further developed and detailed. Global data also enables the framework to be generalised and standardised to overcome case-specific city characteristics.
In our research, we include the park size and population density within the catchment area of the parks as an indicator of availability of urban parks. The case study of Amsterdam shows that including park size and population density provides a radically different availability score of parks.
The indicators are modelled in an interactive dashboard for the Amsterdam case.
The Amsterdam case
We use open data, provided by the Municipality of Amsterdam, and consider urban parks that are open to the public and maintained by the municipality. The parks are denoted by polygons in line with another data set from the Copernicus urban atlas data for Europe [L1]. The polygons are plotted on a 100 x 100 m grid of the city of Amsterdam."	<urn:uuid:5f2bbc28-f2ea-4996-9f02-1314d72fa1e6>	0.0
how modify trust agreement when laws family circumstances change	"Attorney At Law
Free Phone Consultation
Circumstances change over time and it often becomes necessary or appropriate to seek to modify the amount of child support or alimony that you are paying or receiving, or to adjust parenting timeshares as children get older or begin new schools. Particularly in these economic times, people's financial lives are changing rapidly. With regard to support awards, if you are a payor of child or spousal support your orders remain in effect no matter whether you have less income or no income today as compared to when the orders issued unless and until you file a motion or Request for Order application to modify them.
We understand how important these changes can be to your family budget, or how drastically they can affect children's lives. Whether you are seeking to modify previous orders or resisting a modification, we can assist you in the most professional and compassionate manner.
In order to succeed in modifying certain types of orders the law requires that a ""material change of circumstance"" has occurred since the time the last order was issued. Courts are reluctant to modify recent orders, and parties who claim that circumstances have changed when they are really just dissatisfied with the court's orders rarely achieve what they hope. And, the passage of time is generally not itself enough to qualify you for a change. Other orders that are temporary don't carry with them this burden of proof of changed circumstance. As a non-family law expert you are not likely to know the difference, but the courts always treat you as though you did. To achieve a modification you need expert assistance in setting up the grounds for what you want to change and the evidence that justifies that change.
We would be pleased to consult with you about the specific facts of your situation and help evaluate whether this is the best time to seek a change in the existing orders. Contact us today for a consultation!

What are the key similarities and differences between ancient Roman elections and modern democratic elections in terms of citizen participation and voting rights?	"New State Voting Laws II: Protecting the Right to Vote in the Sunshine State
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law thanks Chairman Leahy and the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Human Rights for providing this opportunity to submit written testimony in advance of the important field hearing, “New State Voting Laws II: Protecting the Right to Vote in the Sunshine State.”
The Brennan Center is a nonpartisan think tank and legal advocacy organization that focuses on issues of democracy and justice. Among other things, we seek to ensure fair and accurate voting procedures and systems and to promote policies that maximize citizen enfranchisement and participation in elections. We have done extensive work on a range of issues relating to voting rights, including work to remove unnecessary barriers to voter registration; to make voting machines more secure, reliable, usable, and accessible; and to expand access to the franchise. Our work on these topics has included the publication of studies and reports; assistance to federal and state administrative and legislative bodies with responsibility over elections; and, when necessary, participation in litigation to compel states to comply with their obligations under federal law and the Constitution. We submit this testimony today in our capacity as national advocates of voting rights committed to (1) preventing efforts, such as Florida’s H.B. 1355 (alternatively “the Law”), to constrict voter registration and participation and (2) promoting improvements that will make our election system secure and accessible to all eligible Americans.
The harm caused by HB 1355 to Florida voters and community-based voter registration groups is so severe that several organizations and individuals have been forced to turn to the courts for relief. In Florida v. United States, the Brennan Center is co-counsel to the League of Women Voters of Florida (“LWVF”) and the National Council of La Raza (“NCLR”), who oppose HB 1355 because of the harm it will cause to minority voters. The Brennan Center also represents LWVF, Rock the Vote (“RTV”), and Florida Public Interest Research Group’s Education Fund (“FL PIRG”) in LWVF v. Browning, a broad challenge to the Law on the basis that its provisions violate the U.S. Constitution, the National Voter Registration Act, and the Voting Rights Act.
In this statement, the Brennan Center will detail why the discriminatory provisions of HB 1355 should be struck down."	<urn:uuid:feeeffdc-d891-4a84-b7c2-ee21741106b9>	0.0
watering hours nassau county lawns allowed	"Dry, warm and windy weather ahead has Brandon focused on water conservation
It’s been hot, windy and dry in recent weeks, and the extended forecast looks to be more of the same.
That has the attention of Brandon’s Conservation Water Committee.
Brandon is currently in Phase 1 of its water restriction plan, which means no watering of lawns between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Residents must also follow the odd/even rotation, which means watering is only allowed on days when the address of the property matches the day of the month in regard to odd or even numbers.
That’s where Kevin Smith, chair of the committee, hopes Brandon can stay this summer. But on June 7, Brandon used 1.5 million gallons of water. If the city climbs to 1.6 million gallons per day for three straight days, Phase 2 of water restrictions kick in..
Phase 2 limits watering to just one day per week, and Smith said he watches it closely every day.
“Some people watch the stock market, I look at water usage,” Smith said of the city of Brandon web page that lists daily water usage. “It’s always top-of-mind for a lot of us, but for most people they don’t think about it until it gets hot, dry and windy.”
As part of its effort to help educate the community, the committee is giving away a rain barrel, valued at approximately $100. Residents can register to win the barrel on the city’s Facebook page and the winner will be announced July 31. Rain barrels collect water from rooftops which is stored for uses such as watering flower beds and vegetable gardens.
The Water Conservation Committee met on June 9 and came up with the idea as a positive step to help educate citizens about the need to conserve water.
The June 7 date of 1.5 million gallons jumped off the page for Smith. A year earlier on that date, Brandon had used 940,000 gallons of water. Although last year was much cooler and wet in early June, it was still a significant jump.
Smith said residential lawns only need one inch of water per week. To help residents keep track of that number and to limit the amount of watering they are doing, the committee is going to make rain gauges available to residents yet this summer.
Those gauges will be smaller than typical rain gauges and will and can be put in a yard that only holds an inch of water."	<urn:uuid:244b2c58-3895-4d97-8ca0-72f34bfdd733>	0.0

hitler otto great leadership differences similarities	"How do I Improve Employee Performance Through Leadership?
Raising and maintaining high performance among your work force is an essential element to your business reaching its goals and objectives. Your leadership team--supervisors, managers and executives--plays a vital role in ensuring employee performance levels remain high. This is a challenge for many leaders; however, it's one that can be resolved. With effective leadership, your work force can prove to be your organization's most valuable resource.
Jot down the differences and similarities among the employees who report to you, and draft an action plan for acknowledging those differences as well as the similarities. Use this planning technique to identify goals for your employees, according to their skills, aptitude and capabilities. One of the traits of an outstanding leader is the ability to develop effective interpersonal communication skills that adapt to the varied work styles, culture and needs of employees. Management and leadership are two separate functions; however, to become a good manager, your leadership style needs to be one that acknowledges the strengths in the different personalities and skills within your work force. An effective manager works to adapt her style so it works for the entire work force, not just a select few employees. Attention to the needs of a diverse work force will encourage your employees to perform well.
Exhibit behavior that your employees will emulate; modeling behavior is likely the best way to train employees in the nuances of professionalism in the workplace. When workplace professionalism becomes standard procedure, employee performance improves because your work force is proud of the manner in which they perform duties and interact with internal and external customers. Employees are most likely to exceed job expectations when they have a sense of pride in their work. In addition, praise employees for their efforts and for a job well done. Providing regular feedback to employees is another trait that true leaders and effective managers possess.
Reward employees whose performance exceeds expectations and develop performance improvement plans for employees whose performance falls below expectations. Work together with your employees to construct plans that will enhance skill sets and prepare them for future roles within your organization. Investing the time and energy in developing your work force has significant returns. In addition to improving performance, this leadership activity demonstrates you have a vested interest in your employees. This can increase job satisfaction, which can, in turn, raise the level of job satisfaction among your work force.
Communicate with your work force on a continual basis."	<urn:uuid:25230e45-5042-45e1-8b8c-8cd92810e25c>	0.0
How fast can an E. coli bacteria swim?	"And they actually rewound the tape, and they went back to that particular line of bacteria end evolved citric eaters all over again. The kind of research that Lenski is doing is important not just to answer some of the basic questions about life but to answer some important questions about our own health. E. coli and other bacteria can make us sick, and in World War II scientists developed antibiotics to kill them and it seemed like magic bullets. The problem was that the scientists discovered very quickly that E. coli and other bacteria were becoming resistant. They were evolving resistance because the mutants that could resist a little bit were doing better than the susceptible ones and over time, it became more and more resistant. So now today scientists are trying to develop new kinds of antibiotics to overcome this resistance. You know, they are trying to find these drugs that maybe bacteria have not evolved resistance to, and they found some really promising ones. For example, they found the [that] frogs in their skin made this new totally different kind of antibiotic and first it seemed like it was indeed the magic bullet that there was no way that bacteria could evolve resistance to it, but scientists decided to run [an] experiment where they exposed E. coli to a little bit of this frog drug and then a little bit more and little bit more, and sure enough the E. coli evolved resistance to it in the lab. So even before this drug makes it to the market, we already know that we have to be very careful in dealing with the evolution of resistance.
Another thing about life is that, as Darwin argued, life forms a tree. So he envisioned species branching of from each other through natural selection, and here is actually where those E. coli that make you sick come into the story. So, most of the strains of E. coli that you will encounter are perfectly harmless and you have got probably about 30 of them inside of you right now; but there are some that are very nasty. So these are the kinds that contaminate spinach and hamburger. Their name is E. coli 0157:H7 and when they get into you, what they do is they build a needle and inject toxins into your cells in your intestines and [your] cells form these bizarre pedestals almost kind of like this throne you are making for this bacteria that is making you sick."	<urn:uuid:4f8a1953-fb11-4de2-90a5-7b342b40d17b>	0.0
how many residents michigan wind farm opt out	"“If you take their study and boil it down, you only get jobs — maybe in the thousands,” Transeth added. “And most of those gains would be offset by other jobs lost in the energy industry.”
A study by the Mackinac Center for Public Policy showed that by 2025 the mandate would cost the state 10,540 jobs, increase the average annual household electric bills by $180, and impose net costs of $2.55 billion on the state economy.
Most of the increased generation is expected to come from wind power, according to McDiarmid.
“The lion’s share of the generation will be from wind,” he said, adding that even with the production of the federal Wind Production Tax Credit, wind would still be a major source of generation. “Wind works in Michigan, with or without the production tax credit.”
According to Detroit News, wind farms faced fervent opposition in many communities in Michigan, and residents along Lake Michigan worked hard to keep companies from putting wind turbines offshore.
Wind power only made up 0.3 percent of the state’s total net electricity generation in 2010, according to the Energy Information Administration. Likewise, renewables only made up 3.7 percent of the state’s net electricity generation in 2010.
Fossil fuels still play a significant role in statewide energy production. Coal represented 54 percent of Michigan’s net electricity generation in 2011, though much of the coal is imported from Wyoming, according to the EIA. Another 30 percent of Michigan’s 2011 net electricity generation were provided by three nuclear plants.
“The Proposal 3 energy mandate will put a $12 billion burden on Michigan’s electric customers, but the real bottom line is the financial harm that Proposal 3 will inflict on each family and business,” said Megan Brown, spokesperson for the CARE for Michigan Coalition, in a statement.
Research by Public Sector Consultants, a Michigan-based research firm, shows that renewable energy generation is 67 percent more expensive than conventional energy generation.
“There is an investment cost up front, it’s not very much, and we think the voters should have a chance to decide whether or not they want to do this,” said McDiarmid.
One poll done in Michigan done by MRG for the Michigan Energy and Jobs Initiative found that 58 percent public supported it and 31 percent opposed it."	<urn:uuid:e77e893f-3bf1-4cc0-beb1-e93e691b131d>	0.0
How large is the server space in the Quicken Loans building?	"According to a post on WarrenBuffet.com, Warren Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathaway and Quicken Loans have teamed up to offer $1 billion to someone who is able to pick a ""perfect"" NCAA March Madness bracket. Registration for the Quicken Loans Billion Dollar Bracket Challenge opens up on March 3rd.
What is a perfect bracket? That means picking the correct winner of every single game in the NCAA men's college basketball tournament that begins on March 18, 2014. Berkshire Hathaway is ensuring the grand prize. I think they're good for the money, given the company has over $200 billion in net assets (assets less liabilities) as of September 2013.
The chances of winning are 1 in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808, which in words is nine quintillion, two hundred twenty three quadrillion, three hundred seventy-two trillion, thirty-six billion, eight hundred fifty four million, seven hundred seventy-five thousand, eight hundred and eight. This actually gives me some incentive to play POWERBALL, with its much better chances of winning the prize at 1 in 176 billion!
Is this really $1 billion!? Well, kind of. If you take the winnings over 40 years, you'll receive $25 million each year. Or you can take a lump sum of $500 million up front. I think I'd go with that option. Of course, if there are multiple winners, you'll split the proceeds.
Quicken Loans is also giving away $100,000 to the top 20 scoring brackets! They are capping contest entires to the first 10 million registrants, thought they may expand that at their discretion. The contest is open to legal, 21 and older residents of the U.S. and District of Columbia.

rainbow cave and house rock which natural force shaped them both	"El Nido Tour B With Picnic Lunch (Joiner)
About the Experience
El Nido is a Philippine municipality on Palawan island. It’s known for its white-sand beaches, coral reefs and as the gateway to the Bacuit archipelago, a group of islands with steep karst cliffs.
El Nido Tour B – Discover the wonders of El Nido Caves and Coves with 5 major destinations including Pinagbuyutan Island, Cathedral Cave, Cudognun Cave, Snake Island, Populkan Island.
Pinagbuyutan Island – Soft powdery white sand comparable to the world’s best beaches. The water is shallow for about a couple of meters from the shore and then a few meters away you will see a snorkeling area full of fishes. Get captivated by the emerald green color of the water and the phenomenal seascape fronting island.
Snake Island – Located near Pangulasian Island, it is also referred to as, “Snake Island,” because of the fine natural sandspit (s-shaped sandbar) that “snakes” off it shores. The sandspit is clearly visible only when the tide is low. On both sides of the sandspit are shallow swimming areas. Climbing the hill of the nearby island provide a glimpse of an awe inspiring seascape and a bird’s eye view of Bacuit Bay.
Cadugnon Point and Cave – It is an important anthropological site, where jewelry and pottery dating back to the Sung Dynasty (960-1279 BC) were yielded. The anthropologists believe that the cave dwellers were from Borneo, and travelled across the ancient land bridge that connected Palawan from Borneo. A small opening hidden among the rocks near the beach reveals a cathedral like cave inhabited by sea sparrows. Inside you’ll see spectacular rock formations and a way to climb a small limestone hill.
Cathedral Cave – The island has a cathedral-like cavern accessible by dinghy and kayak. Its cool interior is lit at certain times of the day by sunlight coming through an opening at its peak. This one of important sites for the busyadors or the birds’ nest gatherers.

jennie wade death circumstances gettysburg civilian casualties statistics	"Discourse Does Not Match Falling Sept. 11 Death Toll
By Shankar Vedantam
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, November 22, 2001; Page A18
Nearly 2,000 names have been removed from the lists of those dead and missing in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- but it would be hard to tell that from the public discourse in America over the past two months.
Initial estimates of 6,030 casualties in New York, Washington and western Pennsylvania had dropped to 4,132 by yesterday and will probably fall further as officials sort through the confusion and remove double-counted names and other errors. Politicians, pundits and the general public, however, have often used numbers larger than the steadily declining count.
The discrepancy reflects both the resilience of statistics and a curious psychological irony: Although people are glad that there were fewer victims, powerful political, social and emotional forces conspire to make reducing the number of casualties difficult.
For once a number becomes a symbol for tragedy, reducing it runs the risk of seeming callous and implying the tragedy was not as bad as previously thought, say statisticians and sociologists who study how numbers are used.
""Once a number gets into circulation, it takes on a life of its own,"" said Joel Best, author of ""Damned Lies and Statistics."" ""People become invested in it, they feel they need to defend it, criticism of the number becomes a criticism of larger principles.""
The toll of missing and dead has fluctuated because of confusion over casualties in New York. The plane crashes in Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon were known early on to have caused 44 and 189 casualties, and those figures have not changed. But an accurate count has been far more difficult at the World Trade Center.
Officials in Manhattan were inundated with missing-person reports -- often of the same person and sometimes with different spellings. Dewi Williams, a spokesman for the British consulate, said yesterday that about 26,000 phone calls to British officials triggered initial estimates of 200 to 300 dead and missing Britons. The current number is 63.
On Monday, when official reports were putting the number of victims at 4,184, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said, ""It is now 69 days since September 11th, when coldblooded terrorists turned civilian airliners into flying bombs and used them to kill 5,000 innocent people.""

As someone studying military medical history, I'm curious about how U.S. Army nurses served during WWII and how this led to changes in the Air Force Medical Service structure. What were their combat roles, and how did this influence the later organization of the Air Force Nurse Corps?	"11, 2017) - Met with skepticism before World War II about whether African Americans could master the skills of flying in combat, the Tuskegee Airmen went on to become an acclaimed fighting force. And the Hoosier parents of two of our guests were among the most distinguished members of the all-black Army air squadron during an era when the military was segregated.
As Hoosier History Live salutes Black History Month, we explore Indiana connections with the squadron, which drew its name from the Tuskegee Army Air Field in Alabama. Many of the men who were part of what is known as the ""Tuskegee Airmen Experience"" were not pilots and did not aspire to be. Many fought in the war as ground crewmen or in other non-flying support roles. To share insights about the Tuskegee Airmen, who were collectively recognized (both flight and non-flight personnel) in 2007 with a Congressional Gold Medal, Nelson is joined in studio by:
Some of the Tuskegee Airmen received training at Freeman Field (now Freeman Municipal Airport) in Seymour. In the spring of 1945, it became the setting for the ""Freeman Field Mutiny,"" a non-violent civil rights protest. More than 100 officers were arrested for refusing to sign an order that they would not attend the whites-only officers club.
In another piece of Hoosier African-American history, Tuskegee Airmen of the 618th and 619th Bomb Squadrons of the 477th Bomb Group trained at Atterbury Army Air Field, near Columbus Indiana.
Some other Indiana connections, courtesy of our guest Reginald DuValle:
At the outset of the war, the U.S. Army Air Corps set up College Training Detachments (CTDs) because there weren't enough aspiring pilots with college degrees to meet the need. Theodore Randall, an Indianapolis native, served as commander of the CTD at Tuskegee.
Tuskegee pilots ended up fighting in aerial combat over Europe and North Africa. Many were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.
In Indiana, the Tuskegee Airmen were honored at a ceremony last October during which a stretch of I-65 from Seymour (not far from the site of the Freeman Field Mutiny) to the Bartholomew/Johnson County line was named the Tuskegee Airmen Highway."	<urn:uuid:5db1f5ca-5a83-4f70-aec1-c8cfc1aae16d>	0.0
found article about early paralympics history want know where first international event for disabled athletes	"|North Korean athletes and officials for the PyeongChang Paralympic Winter Games wasl through the PyeongChang Athletes’ Village in Gangwon on Thursday. [YONHAP]|
Over the next nine days 570 athletes from 49 countries, the most athletes to ever compete at a Winter Paralympics, will descend on Pyeongchang County, Gangwon, and the surrounding area to compete on snow and ice, pushing themselves to the limit in the pursuit of an elusive gold medal.
Heading to the Games with 36 athletes, Korea hopes to win its first-ever gold at the Paralympics, while its goal for the overall medal standing is to place 10th.
North Korea will also attend the Games, its first time competing at a Winter Paralympics, sending two athletes - skiers Kim Jong-hyon and Ma Yu-chol.
At the Paralympics, athletes will compete in 80 events across six sports - alpine skiing, cross country skiing, biathlon, ice hockey, wheelchair curling and snowboard.
Although the events at the Paralympics are similar in concept to Olympic sports, the rules are noticeably different. Paralympians are assigned categories based on their impairment. These classifications determine which athlete is eligible to compete in which event and how they are scored. As different sports require different physical activities, classifications are specific to each style of event.
Like the Olympics, the Games will begin and end with official ceremonies.
The opening ceremony, which begins tonight at 8 p.m., will officially declare the start of nine days of sports and spectacle, and at the center of it all are the athletes.
“I have always been a sport addict. Until [I was] 16 years old, I practiced gymnastics at a high level, but with my handicap I always experienced difficulties with the beam that I couldn’t see properly. I used to fall a lot,” explained Eleonor Sana, a visually impaired alpine skier from Belgium.
In visually impaired events, athletes race with a guide runner. The guide wears a brightly colored vest with the letter “G” emblazoned on it and both the guide and the athlete have wireless communication devices attached to their helmet so they can communicate to navigate the course.
In these events, trust between the athlete and the guide is crucial."	<urn:uuid:5ede2ee4-80bc-4a45-b619-164cfe55f09c>	0.0

As someone studying Pacific naval operations, I'm particularly interested in the battle stars awarded to Nassau and Princeton - how did their combat decorations compare during their respective service periods?	"Before he was wounded, his squad's machine gunners Mike Massaconi and Clancy Lyall were low on ammo. As Webster was their ammo bearer, Clancy and Mike yelled at him to bring more ammo, but Webster did not move out of his foxhole. After numerous shouts from both men, Clancy took out a grenade and threw it right in Webster's foxhole. The pin on the grenade was still in place, unbeknownst to Webster. Webster quickly fled up the dike to get ammo.
While recuperating back in England, Webster missed the Battle of the Bulge fighting and rejoined his unit in February, 1945 after being formally released by the hospital. What he found was a decimated regiment, exhausted, weary and bitter over his absence and the loss of friends. Soon thereafter, Easy Company discovered their first concentration camp, witnessing firsthand the walking and also the unburied dead of the Landsberg Concentration Camp.
Author Stephen Ambrose had this to say about Webster: ""He had long ago made it a rule of his Army life never to do anything voluntarily. He was an intellectual, as much an observer and chronicler of the phenomenon of soldiering as a practitioner. He was almost the only original Toccoa man who never became an NCO. Various officers wanted to make him a squad leader, but he refused. He was there to do his duty, and he did it - he never let a buddy down in combat, in France, Holland, or Germany - but he never volunteered for anything and he spurned promotion"".
Awards and decorations
His list of authorized medals and decorations are:
- Bronze Star
- Purple Heart with one oak leaf cluster
- Good Conduct Medal
- European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with Arrowhead and 4 service stars
- World War II Victory Medal
- Army of Occupation Medal
- Presidential Unit Citation with one Oak Leaf Cluster
- Combat Infantryman Badge
- Parachutist Badge with 2 jump stars
He was the last of the surviving Toccoa veterans who had fought in Normandy to be sent home. He returned to work as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Daily News and found great enjoyment sailing, studying oceanography and sea life. During those years he worked on his wartime memoirs and occasionally approached magazines with an article but deferred any wholesale treatment of the war."	<urn:uuid:963aaab7-9acc-4780-ba05-eaa680432b7e>	0.0
What are some of the key things that theaters should consider when making their shows more welcoming for people with special needs?	"Events are the times that people come together and they are meant to be happy times because one should ensure that they can benefit from all of them. There are so many ways that the people apply so that the event can be an event and that is why we have to ensure that we pull off some great tips. One of them that the people hold in such high esteem is the barbeque. When doing the ribs on the grill, the event is able to have a great aroma and the attendees are able to indulge into some great tasting food. The appearance of the food on the grill as well as the appearance is boosted using the basting sauce and that is what people should get. There are so many of them in the market and they are brought by the many manufacturers interested in making sure that the people benefit so much. The choice of the basting sauce for the client should be a choice that they can be proud of and that is why they have to consider some things when choosing.
One has to look at the flavor as the first thing. Flavor is everything when the people can be able to get the tastes that they have and that is what they should ensure. The choice of the basting sauce most of the time is the one that can offer them with the needs that they have. They have to check first with the preferences that they have as well to ensure that they go for an amazing choice. The variety of the flavors have been availed so that the different people can get accommodated.
The client has to make sure that they check the quality of the paste. Most of the products that come in the market have to meet some standards and that is what the people should ensure the choice of the client most of the time has to be a basting sauce that has been brought in the market. The client has to ensure that there is a diamond mark of quality since it shows the standards that they have. The client has to ensure that the basting sauce will benefit them the most and that is why the quality is necessary.
The client has to ensure that they look at the pricing too. There are so many varieties and they pricing vary according to the manufacturer. They also can change the dealer so that they can be able to benefit. They have to ensure that they compare several so that the price they go for will be the lowest and that way they will benefit the most."	<urn:uuid:f00c9703-3942-4dc3-9984-7d7a4c6ec1fd>	0.0

plutonium waste treatment decontamination effectiveness	"In many cases, this may provide a desirable factor of safety. In other cases, it may lead to the expensive over-engineering of a system or unwarranted increases in operational costs. Laboratory research has also determined that air temperature, relative humidity, flow rate, lamp design, and ballast engineering have significant impacts on the effectiveness of these systems. Furthermore, the location of the decontamination UV array is of crucial importance because of the potential for air eddies and corners of ducting to allow some of the flow to pass through untreated. HVAC systems designers and control contractors will have to factor these components into their plans, and base decontamination systems designs on tested parameters in order to ensure maximum effectiveness. Because of the constant airflow in modern ventilation systems, making this work in an HVAC system requires coordination between dampers (in order to slow the passage of the air enough to allow all particles to receive a sanitizing ray of UV light) and the UV light itself. While this kind of attention to detail might not be necessary in installations primarily concerned with improving the day-to-day healthiness of air, in order to control the spread of a deadly bio-terrorist pathogen (such as anthrax or smallpox) the design of a UVGI system is of critical importance.
The effectiveness of UV light as a germicidal agent has resulted in two other techniques for decontamination. Pulsed UV (PUV) involves pulsing UV lamps at high power at regular intervals. This technology is being increasingly applied for air and surface sterilization and decontamination due to the powerful use of advanced UV light lamps and efficient energy consumption. This is a procedure, which appears to have certain advantages of very high inactivation rates for most known microorganisms. PUV is also effective on very hazardous and ""hard-to-break"" toxic organic compounds and odors from water, air, or surfaces without producing ozone at a very high speed. These systems use mercury-free flash lamps that emit pulses at such high energy that the cells are actually physically destroyed. To have this mechanism work, the rate of the energy deposition into a microorganism (the fluency rate) must be higher than its rate of cooling to a surrounding media. In this case, a microorganism undergoes momentous overheating and disintegration."	<urn:uuid:163803b2-d1ea-490c-bec7-0456a1eb729d>	0.0
I'm replicating old paint colors. Why do standards shift?	"Luxury Home Exterior Designer
indian house design front view best exterior ideas on pinterest luxurious homes designs photos contemporary colors
Are you bored with the exterior design of your home? I suggest you to make a renovation plan. Make a design before you do your home renovation. The simplest form of renovation is the renovation of paint. You need to apply new paint for years to keep the house looking good. Even if you do not have a mansion, you can still make your home look good with the simplest remodeling. Vinyl siding could be considered if you are planning for a renovation.
It’s very durable, neat, and durable. Vinyl siding is available at an affordable price. Choose the best colors that can make your home look great. Planning to own a unique house is good but you have to consider whether the color is right or not. Look at another house before you repaint your house. Never do paint because your house may look weird. For example, a surprising pink color will make your home stand out from the rest of the house.

If your house is painted in neutral colors, you can repaint it with light or darker colors. Choose a soft color to maintain balance. You can also create a feel for a great home. Match the colors of each element in your home. You can avoid blaring images by matching the colors. Never add contrasting colors to maintain the color balance. Exceptions can be made if you are on a low income. You can make some tricks to solve this problem.
If you can not change old units with new ones that have similar colors, you can simply paint them into the nearest color scheme. Another trick is to add another unit that has a similar color. If you have an old house, you can choose a color scheme that suits the architecture. Take color samples to fit colors more easily. You can hire a professional to do this job because the renovation of the old house exterior is a bit hard to do by beginners.

How long could the powered hip exoskeleton run between charges?	"At some point in your nerdy childhood, you surely imagined what it would be like to build an entire exoskeleton out of Lego. How much fun would that be to have a Lego creation you could actually climb inside and drive around?! Well, award-winning Lego enthusiast Diavo Voltaggio is well on his way to that bright future.
As far as we know, Voltaggio isn't building a badass Lego mech suit, but we can't stop think thinking about how rad it would be if he did. The Lego enthusiast won well deserved accolades for his Mark VI Mindstorms robotic arm and hand at BrickFair Virginia last week.
The cyborg attachment includes four independently motorized fingers powered by touch sensors as well as a blue light bar and five blue LEDs for looks. The lights also came in handy when the convention switched into ""World of Lights"" mode, shutting down all of the convention center lights so that the brick creations could light up. The arm also includes a smartphone mount for fun and convenience.
Now, Lego isn't necessarily the most durable material for a battle-ready mech suit. But if you did want to build one, this cyborg arm is a great starting point. If you've got a whole bunch of bricks lying around, you might as well start building an exoskeleton for the big BrickFair in November. After all, a full Lego mech suit might be the only thing that can save your from the imminent doom of a Lego Firewalk. [Pocket Lint]

cryptocurrency key seed generation security audits implementation requirements	"The RC14001 Technical Specification is more comprehensive than ISO 14001, but the certification process grants both an ISO 14001 registration certificate and an RC14001 certificate, if the management system meets all requirements. As a result, certification to the RC 14001 Technical Specification fully meets customer requirements for ISO 14001 registration.
Every ACC member company must complete either RCMS or RC 14001 certification audits for a specific number of sites. Headquarters plus a fraction of the plant sites must be certified.
How RC14001 and ISO 14001 Audits Differ
RC14001 audits are similar to ISO 14001 audits, but with a few key distinctions. In RC14001, additional personnel are involved from logistics, distribution, product stewardship, process safety, and security. Safety, Health and Environmental (SH&E) professionals will be involved in the plant and headquarters sites.
Interaction and communication with community partners, local governments and agencies represents a larger part of RC14001. Companies are focused on stakeholder concerns.
Because of the additional requirements, auditors need additional time to assess the RC14001 management system relative to the typical time requirements for an ISO 14001 audit.
Who Should Seek RCMS® and RC14001
RCMS is limited to ACC members only. Businesses in the chemical, petroleum, and allied industries can use RC14001 to implement a single environmental, health and safety management system that meets best practices, encourages stronger performance and provides a route to business success. Responsible Care® is a valuable tool to demonstrate to customers and stakeholders that a company is committed to corporate and social responsibility.
By participating in Responsible Care®, ACC members agree to:
- Measure and publicly report performance
- Implement the Responsible Care Security Code
- Obtain independent certification for a professional management system
- Apply the modern Responsible Care Management System to achieve and verify results
Benefits of an Effective Responsible Care Management System
Achieving Responsible Care certification helps companies improve their performance and better succeed in business.
Through the Responsible Care Management System, companies can provide alignment and compatibility with other management systems. RCMS provides a method to integrate safety, environmental, security and health performance thereby improving efficiencies of the processes and systems that may be currently operating independently.
The certification process encourages teamwork, by revealing how many management groups interact, including environmental, health, and safety, community relations, shipping, security, regulatory compliance and purchasing."	<urn:uuid:7b6b1dee-c212-43fb-a605-6e2fee7099ec>	0.0
My family has German roots and I'd like to know how language use has changed in Lutheran churches - what's the difference between St. James Lutheran's historical language practices and modern Lutheran churches like the Missouri Synod?	"Three graduates of Seminex, the St. Louis theological seminary run by moderates who split from the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, will become pastors in United Methodist churches. Such a move would have been unthinkable in the parent group, which has few ecumenical ties and only limited dealings with fellow Lutheran bodies.
""This is the first official opportunity for our Lutheran confessional witness to be welcomed beyond the borders of Lutheranism,"" declared Seminex placement director, the Rev. Karl Reko, in announcing the appointment of the three graduates to United Methodist churches in New York state.
Stephen Rosendahl, one of the three graduates, acknowledged that at first he had some questions about serving a Methodist congregation but ultimately, he said, ""I decided I'm a Christian first and a Lutheran second.""
In a separate development, the LC-MS formally expelled the Rev. Dr. Alfred P. Klaysler, widely known religious journalist and former editor of LC-MS publications. He refused to give up membership in the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, the body formed by moderates who disagreed with the conservative LC-MS interpretation of the Bible.
The Unification Church and an evangelical Protestant television syndicate are partners in a challenge to a new North Carolina law requiring licensing and financial reporting by groups that solicit money from nonmembers.
The challenge originally was filed by the PTL (Praise The Lord) television network, based in Charlotte. The Unification Church subsequently secured court permission to join the suit.
Vice President of PTL Robert Manzano complained that PTL was not confortable in the alliance and charged that court action permitting the Unification Church to join the suit ""only muddies the waters"" and could affect the credibility of PTL's suit.

What breakthrough features does the HX90N tooling prepreg material offer in terms of surface quality and thermal properties?	"US Aluminum Castings has an engineering department with over 60+ years of combined tooling design experience. By pairing highly experienced foundry designers with recent graduate level engineers, our design team is able to provide tried and true design methodology backed by cutting edge solidification modeling, CAD analysis, and an A9100D certified tooling design and development process.
We work hard to develop high quality, cost efficient casting tooling and machining fixtures consistent with the needs of our customers.
Our Niche: Heavy Truck, Aerospace, and Defense Castings.
During our initial quoting of a new project, we look for the follow design criteria:
- A dimensioned 2D print and 3D model showing casting/machining tolerance requirements.
- Aluminum casting alloy or required material properties.
- Anticipated annual production rates.
- Anticipated order schedules/quantity.
- Any critical dimensions or special characteristics related to the casting or machined part.
- Casting Class and Grade
- Surface finish requirements
- Allowable draft angles
With this information, our design team will work along with the customer to help determine a suitable casting process and tooling plan. It is our goal to provide our clients with quality castings delivered reliably, within budget.
When designing a part as a casting, some standard design considerations are:
- Is there sufficient draft? Is it placed suitably in relation to the parting line?
- If required, where are the tooling points located? Are they on or near the parting line?
- Is there ample machining stock in appropriate locations?
- Are there any unnecessarily thick or thin wall sections?
- Are fillets and radii adequate/inline with tolerance expectations?
- Can the number of cores be reduced/eliminated while maintaining functionality?
With an in-house pattern shop and full service machine shop, US Aluminum Castings is able to provide our clients with high quality tooling at an affordable price. We are able to design tooling to fit all of our production lines, from cast iron permanent molds to urethane sand patterns and multi-material machining fixtures. We take great pride in our ability to not only design our tooling, but to also build it to the highest standards. These in-house capabilities also enable us to maintenance and repair all of our customer owned tooling whenever the need may arise. We design it, we build it, and we use it."	<urn:uuid:bc6f52ec-71f6-4f68-8812-49ebb49fbdd0>	0.0
what natural winemaking methods used modern winery burgenland austria	"– Winemaking in Austria was long a male area but the trade is seeing a sluggish but regular change of face with extra women taking lead roles within the industry.
Thus personal contact allowed Jewish women artists to be admitted to the airtight artwork associations.

Thus for Austria as a whole, the proportion of the aged population will grow from 18.6% in 2017 to 28.1% by 2060. By then, Carinthia (34%) as well as Burgenland (33%) are expected to stay the “oldest” areas whereas the western a part of Austria in addition to Vienna will still rank as the “youngest” areas. The average age of Austria’s inhabitants will significantly improve over the subsequent decades from forty two.5 to 47.0 years . According to the assumptions for fertility, mortality and migration by Statistics Austria, the entire population of Austria will increase to 9.43 million folks (+9%) until 2030.

Can ACFM and Hall probe field measurements both work through surfaces without direct contact?	"What's a Bar Code?
Hand held laser scanners are the most expensive of the scanning devices, but offer the largest depth of field making them an appropriate choice for a wide variety of non-contact applications.
How Lasers Work Hand held laser scanners use a laser diode to create a scan line by projecting a beam of energy off a rotating prism or oscillating mirror. The beam is reflected out the scanner window onto the bar code, where light energy from the bars and spaces is reflected back to the scanner, collected on a mirror, focused, and read by a photodetector. The resulting signal may then be read using decoding software within the scanner or at the terminal or host.
Lasers have their advantages over CCDs. They're not bar code width-dependent. Depth of field is significantly greater and lasers can work in direct sunlight because the amount of reflected light is much greater and much more defined; the signal return is in a defined pathway. Also, lasers don't have to touch the bar code. There's a visible scan line which allows for larger bar code reading.
Laser technology is an excellent choice for non-contact applications, and the only choice for applications that require reading distances of a foot (.3048m) or more. Available in both hand held and fixed mount form, lasers are easy to use, read a wide variety of code densities, and allow for easy reading of bar codes from irregular surfaces or throughglass. Because they are non-contact devices, lasers will not wear out repeatedly scanned labels.
Hand-held lasers can scan media in hard to reach places, on curved surfaces, or through plastic. They also add longer label life to your application.
The light generating medium in first-generation moving beam laser installation was a Helium-Neon laser tube. In the past few years semiconductors capable of producing laser light have been incorporated in most laser products..
Laser diodes, both visible and infrared, are in a package about the size of an LED. Compared to the gas tube used to create Helium Neon lasers, the laser diode is much smaller, requires significantly less power, and is more durable. This makes these hand-held devices suitable for portable data collection terminals or for fixed-station decoders that are powered from the terminal.
Fixed-mount lasers allow both hands to be free for use in handling product or paper. In addition, self-triggering mechanisms allow these lasers to operate without human intervention."	<urn:uuid:ba33d69a-29f9-4e77-a4da-12934782fe61>	0.0

I'm curious about how Islamic scholars dealt with religious texts - what are the two main approaches they used to interpret difficult passages, and how did they decide who could use which method?	"In other words, coming out of Khorasan, an area that now encompasses Afghanistan, will come an army that includes the Mahdi, the Islamic savior of the world. The parent organization of ISIS was al Qaeda, which, of course, was headquartered in Afghanistan at the time of the 9/11 attacks.
Last year, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi named himself caliph, which means that in his own mind and in the eyes of his followers he is not only the leader of ISIS but the overall leader of Muslims everywhere.
These beliefs may seem like a crazy delusion to most of us, but it’s important to understand that they are theological in nature, and this theology is rooted in ultra-fundamentalist Islam.
ISIS sees itself as the vanguard army that is bringing back true Islam to the world. This project is of such cosmic importance that they will break any number of eggs to make this omelet, which accounts for the’ir murderous campaign against every ethnic group, religious group and nationality that they perceive as standing in their way. ISIS recruits also believe that we are in the end times, and they are best understood as members of an Islamist apocalyptic death cult.
IS THERE ANY ROOM FOR DEBATE OR DIALOGUE?
Getting back to the literary festival of 2014. While there, I moderated two sessions, ‘Reading the Soul’ and ‘Writing the Self.’ The former was about how religious texts have their own literary tradition on the notebook of humankind; the latter was about the relative truth of memoir – in this case as told by two very different Bangladeshi-origin female authors, both of them Muslims.
It was difficult to avoid religion in both sessions, especially as one of the authors had chosen to read a passage from her book recounting an incident passed down from her grandmother in which she was humiliated by her Hindu teacher at school because he had forgotten to return her school notebook. The story culminated in the teacher ‘purifying’ his house by spreading cow dung on every surface. I was skeptical of her grandmother’s recollections – after all, as a student, how could she know he did this at his home without her having seen it? And, I wondered aloud why she had chosen to read that passage at the venue when her book had many more interesting passages."	<urn:uuid:4c3ea52f-8ef7-4bd6-8782-664c2c69e15b>	0.0
dangers chemicals used compostable paper food containers health effects	"Bottled and Jarred Packaged Goods have been around for a long time. Glass containers were used in Ancient Egypt even before the invention of the wheel. Bottle manufacturing technology hasn’t changed much over time. Glass containers are also often used for household chemicals. Since the situation has changed, glass jars and bottles now compete with combination cardboard sacks and plastic bottles. Bottled containers are still in great demand in the packaging business, despite the competition.For a long time, food and medical product manufacturers have favored bottled and jarred packaged commodities.
Furthermore, there are numerous types of food packaging available on the market today. Regardless of which type is chosen based on the product to be packed, they all have the same goal: to keep food safe. This is packaging’s fundamental function, but it has evolved to include additional functions that benefit both makers and customers. A variety of things is packaged in cans, glass jars, plastic bottles, and foil pouches. When ready-made doughnuts, pies, pickles, and jams are accessible in bottles and jars, there’s no need to fuss with making their own. Packaged goods, like other convenience items, include a variety of hidden dangers. Fortunately, with a little knowledge and awareness, users can determine which packaged things are worth their money and which pose serious health hazards.
Many busy customers have turned to bottled water branding as an alternative to tap water, which may include extra chemicals or bacteria. Many packaged items come in glass jars, making them a healthier alternative to cans for individuals worried about their health. Glass jars may be reused or recycled, and they don’t contain any potentially hazardous substances.
The vast majority of packaged goods are perfectly safe to eat. To minimize bacterial infection, some require particular handling and storage. To minimize spoiling, consume packaged fruits as soon as feasible. Before eating, some packaged meals must be reheated. When it comes to purchasing packaged goods, the grocery store looks to offer a diverse selection. On the one hand, processed foods are typically less expensive and more convenient, thanks to their long shelf life. On the other end of the scale are high-end boutique goods made using locally sourced ingredients and natural preservatives. The things that fall in the middle provide convenience without sacrificing flavor.
Packaged items in bottles and jars have various advantages:
These items can be consumed at any time of day. They’re also simple to transport and store."	<urn:uuid:ac4bafd7-42c5-473d-a678-605bde081955>	0.0

What are the most common symptoms someone gets when infected with Legionnaires disease, and which groups of people are at higher risk of getting it?	"- Salmonellosis in children - what to do?
Salmonellosis - a fairly common infection that is usually transmitted through food.Her pathogens can live in water, soil, animal feces, raw meats, eggs.Salmonellosis in children is not uncommon.
In the last two decades have seen an increased incidence of typhoid salmonellosis in Europe and North America.Perhaps this is partly due to the fact that people are increasingly traveling to and including, visit third world countries where the risk of Salmonella contamination is particularly high.In countries such as typhoid fever is common - a very dangerous disease, caused by a salmonella.For example, in India and Pakistan typhoid fever ill people from 40-50 million - is much greater than in developed countries.Worldwide recorded annually from 16 to 33 million cases of typhoid fever, and 500-600 thousand people a year die from the disease.
Not everyone in the body which gets salmonella, ill with salmonellosis.However, children, particularly
most common in children as in adults, there are gastrointestinal form of salmonellosis.Carriers of the bacteria causing the disease, can be chicken, beef, and some reptiles.Typhoid Salmonella - causative agent of typhoid fever, is carried exclusively by people and is usually transmitted through the feces of an infected person.
Symptoms of salmonellosis in children
have, in general, healthy children gastrointestinal form of salmonellosis usually occurs in mild and moderate forms.The incubation period for salmonellosis in children lasts 12 to 72 hours, that is, as time passes since entering the bacteria into the body before the first symptoms of the disease.Symptoms of the disease include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, headache.Typically, the temperature is reduced by no more than three days, while the other symptoms may persist for up to seven days.Salmonellosis in children under one year sometimes be severe, and causes severe symptoms that persist for a longer time.

The magic of the app is the ability for allergy and asthma sufferers to record their flare-ups. By leveraging near real-time flare-up tracking and using machine learning we can develop an empirically-derived population-based risk index, and, ultimately a personalized risk index for each patient/consumer based on their individual susceptibility to exposures.
So, what’s a flare-up?
That is a great question and it’s the crux of making DailyBreath valuable to you. We have little understanding of outdoor triggers; the weather and the environment surrounding an allergy or asthma sufferer. We really want to understand the conditions that are present when even the earliest onset symptoms are experienced. If you have allergies, is there a time, place, or conditions when your symptoms worsen even after you’ve taken allergy medicines. If you have asthma, anytime it is necessary for you to use your quick-relief medication, it’s likely you’ve experienced a flare-up. But, you may just experience a time when it is harder to breathe or you feel yourself laboring. If so, it may be the right time and place to record your flare-up.
What happens when I record my flare-up?
DailyBreath collects a time stamp and your geographical location (either via GPS or city, state). It records the weather and environmental data at that time and for that place. For your protection, the saved flare-up data which is transmitted does not contain any Personal Identifiable Information (PII), which includes first name, last name, and e-mail address. Every saved flare-up entry is securely encrypted and transmitted via HTTPS protocol to a database managed by Amazon Web Services.
Why should I record my flare-up?
DailyBreath refines its original DailyBreath Risk Index by applying all flare-up data to machine learning to develop a population-based DailyBreath Risk Index and, ultimately, once sufficient flare-ups for you have been recorded, into a personalized DailyBreath Risk Index that reflects your individual susceptibility to certain weather and environmental conditions.

Can my family join me if I get a Greek Golden Visa?	"by Expatguru - 01/29/2010
""This article describes some important information for those planning to bring their families to the kingdom""
Okay, so you have been offered a lucrative job in Saudi Arabia and have signed the contract. You have been promised that you would be able to bring your family after the mandatory probation period. You have submitted all required documents for stamping of your visa and are all set to go. Now, all you need is a visa and a ticket and once you land in the kingdom, after the probationary period you can start processing the papers for your family to join you, right? Well, not always.
Expats planning to relocate to Saudi Arabia on family status must be aware that there is something called a ""visa profession"". Do not get this confused with the profession which you have been hired for. Let me explain this in detail. Every organization in the kingdom will be allotted a certain number of visas at the beginning of each Hijri year. Prior to this, the organization must have submitted their requests to the Ministry of Labor in the kingdom. The Government carefully evaluates each request and releases a certain number of visas in each category. It doesn’t always happen that the organization would get the same quantity and category of visas applied for. So, they end up with taking whatever is given to them and bring people in whichever visa is available.
So, you might, in reality, be an engineer working in a reputed firm, but the visa you have arrived may not actually mention your profession as an engineer. The problem is that if the profession mentioned in your visa is that of a non-supervisory category, for instance, labor, mason, carpenter, etc., you would not be eligible to bring your family because of restrictions by the Government. As a policy, the Saudi Government wants to make sure that only those who can support their families would be issued a family visa. Changing one's visa profession after arriving in Saudi Arabia is not an easy task.
So, how do you ensure that your visa is actually the profession for which you have been hired? Well, to be safe, make this as one of the conditions before signing the contract that you need a supervisory category visa in case the appropriate visa is not available with your employer. When your visa comes stamped from the Saudi Embassy / Consulate, check the passport and get someone who can read Arabic translate the profession mentioned in the visa."	<urn:uuid:6aca8efa-bc18-4066-93b6-1f9fb8d2941a>	0.0
I'm curious about different ways that humans used animals for transportation in the past - what are some examples of how animals were used for moving people and goods?	"Some companies have already banned animal testing with their beauty products, and are trying to put an end to all of it.
The beauty company LUSH. For more than 30 years, they have been fighting against animal testing. It’s Cruel and ineffective, and despite some changes in the last four decades, there’s still so much more to be done, says the LUSH company. This company advertises for animal testing awareness on all of their products like bags, packaging, and even on the receipts. In Europe, India, Israel, and Norway animal testing for cosmetics are banned. One good thing that has come out of animal testing, is animal testing for medical purposes. Due to animals and people being able to get the same illnesses some research is very beneficial to humankind. All medical research is planned out, and experts only use animal experimentation for urgent purposes. Scientists do try to keep the welfare of the animal in mind as they are experimenting, which means a small number of an applicable species can be used.
Veterinarians are an essential part of the medical research team. The veterinarians make sure that the animal is being treated humanely and they also provide the medical/surgical support. The animals are protected through laws, regulations, and policies to provide humane treatment to all of the animals in the research. The Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Animal Welfare Act give details about day-to-day animal care. Some good examples of animal testing for medical research would be on dogs to discover insulin for people with diabetes, monkeys for the polio vaccine, pigs for skin grafts for burn victims, and mice for a rabies vaccine.
Many people are against animal testing for beauty-products but, of course, we have people that would love to say that it is okay. Animals are a great way to further research on humans. This makes sense but, not all animals have the genetic makeup of a human. That means that these innocent animals that are not similar to humans were just inhumanely slaughtered all in the name of research. If scientists would like to discover more about humans, they could find some humans that have no problem being tested on. Some people believe that animal testing is cheaper than others.
This is also false. The USA spends $16 million dollars annually for animal testing at the taxpayer’s dollar."	<urn:uuid:6728df3f-8de9-487d-84c8-04b8d536e7c1>	0.0
marine scientist here terrapin keystone species significance	"Members of the Atlantic Menhaden Advisory Committee, which served the same role as technical committees established for other species, were appointed by the management board, and also included representatives from the states, the industry, NMFS and the National Fish Meal and Oil Association.
The fox had free run of the henhouse.
Thanks to the hard work of a number of angling and conservation organizations, that system was finally overthrown in 2001, when Amendment 1 to the Interstate Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic Menhaden established a management board and support structure that was consistent with those used for other species.
Since then, ASMFC’s menhaden managers have been spending their time trying to get a better understanding of the health of the stock and the factors that can drive down menhaden abundance. The most recent benchmark stock assessment passed peer review nearly two years ago, and found that menhaden were neither overfished for subject to overfishing.
However, those findings were based on a traditional, single-species approach to management. Now, ASMFC is seriously thinking about breaking new ground, and managing menhaden in a way that recognizes their role as a keystone species in the coastal ecosystem.
In possible furtherance of that goal, ASMFC has released the Public Information Document For Amendment 3 to the Interstate Fishery Management Plan For Atlantic Menhaden.
That document addresses a number of issues important to the future of menhaden management. However, it’s easy to argue that the question of managing menhaden as an important forage species, rather than managing it merely for sustainable harvest, is the most important issue of all.
As noted in the Public Information Document,
“Given the crucial ecological role that menhaden play as forage fish, the [Management] Board has expressed interest in developing ecological reference points (ERPs) to manage the menhaden stock. Menhaden serve an important role in the marine ecosystem as they convert phytoplankton into protein and in turn provide a food source to a variety of species including larger fish (e.g., weakfish, striped bass, bluefish, cod), birds (e.g., bald eagles, osprey), and marine mammals (e.g., humpback whales, bottlenose dolphin). As a result, changes in the abundance of menhaden may have implications for the marine ecosystem."	<urn:uuid:58c55f56-de40-4abb-973c-6ede3654c125>	0.0

Overpopulation stresses social cohesion and brings out the worst in people, but overpopulation takes it’s biggest toll on the environment. Which brings us to…
Fact #2, The Environmental Crisis Even if you live under a rock, you’ve heard of this. Al Gore has a new movie about it. Thanks to the endless “awareness raising” efforts of myriad environmental organizations, pretty much everyone knows that “the environment” needs help. Everyone knows about global warming, even if they deny it. Not everyone knows that we’ve lost half of the world’s biodiversity since 1970, and that species are going extinct at a rate of 100 to 150 every day. Not everyone knows that this is the highest rate of extinction in geological history, since the Cretaceous Extinction Event that wiped out the dinosaurs more than sixty million years ago. You know about the environmental crisis, but the truth about it is even worse than you know.
Not coincidentally, the Environmental Crisis also began about 10,000 years ago, with the advent of the farming lifestyle in the Middle East, considered to be the birth of modern civilization. Early farmers deforested huge swaths of land in the Middle East to grow wheat and barley, which quickly exhausted the fertility of the thin soil. They then abandoned the fallow, depleted land to erosion and continued to slash and burn their way through abundant forest rich with fish and game. That’s how they turned “The Fertile Crescent” into the Sahara Desert.
Now ask yourself, “Why did the people who founded our culture, and gave birth to Civilization, burn millions of acres of wild, abundant forests, unleashing plague after plague of pests, to grow wheat and barley, thousands of years before the invention of bread?” What do you think they did with all of that barley and wheat? They made beer out of it. Beer! Which brings us to the third fact you already know about.
Fact # 3, Alcoholism Alcoholism is a debilitating disease that destroys the life of the alcoholic, and creates dysfunction within the alcoholic’s family."	<urn:uuid:1eb96d1f-6ade-4072-863d-65717cd8693e>	0.0

My mom has dementia and can't sleep well at night - she's always confused and agitated in the evening. As her caregiver, I'm wondering what causes these sleep problems and what an occupational therapist could do to help?	"I had a similar problem with my lil girl, we had certain rules and behaviours then i had a friend over too much who ignored these rules and let her do what she likes! we now see a lot less of the friend and stick to our routine and rules! it took a few weeks but we're now back on track! hang in there…and enjoy the bonbons when they come
After wanting a dog for over 20years and loving Basenji's for almost as long I finally became a very proud Basenji mummy a few months ago. I'm form the UK and currently spending some time in the Netherlands, I looked into finally getting my first dog before christmas, then a few weeks into the new year i decided i'd definately get one this year, I looked online that night and found my girl! (I think we were meant to be!) she was last of a litter and the people who were going to take her just never showed up, so I went to meet her, fell in love instantly and she came home with me within the week.
Now i knew that Basenji ownership wasn't going to be easy (the other breed i like is bull terrier so i clearly have problems here…) and we've had some moments...but words cannot express my love for this little one. I can't remember my life without her!
She's turning 5 months soon and is more than I could ever hope for. I'm at the barn all day with the horses and she's settled so well to the barn life, I was so worried she'd run off but she's such a good girl, life is often hectic and always changing, but i'm her constant so she's always keeping an eye on me and knows to come back to me if she's unsure of anything. She now has off lead walks and is such a good gal, when new people or dogs appear she stops, comes to me and waits for the new people/dogs to come to her. then plays like a maniac!
She's not had an accident in the house for a month now and always tells me what she wants. I'm naughty and now let her sleep on the bed with me, and am I the only one who gets guilty just going to the shops or cinema for a few hours and leaving her alone!?! she's with me 24/7 and I'm a little worried i'm becoming a crazy dog lady...but I really dont care!"	<urn:uuid:c91b4c07-f5bc-464e-9eaf-6581c5857ef5>	0.0

Parks of Peterhof
Extending over thousands of hectares of waterfront land,Peterhof parks are characterized by their magical beauty. The lower park is one of the largest parks in the baroque style in the world. Tourists are enchanted by the magical ambience of these places. Large flower beds are arranged symmetrically at the base of the Great Cascade. They are decorated with two basins with in the center, a large marble cup from which flows a stream of water. In the driveway of Marly, the longest avenue of the park, there is a bronze statue of Peter 1st the Great, as well as Adam and Eve fountains decorated with marble sculptures.
The fountains of Peterhof
Renowned for its unique fountains in the world, Peterhof or the ” Capital of Fountains ” attracts thousands of tourists who come to look at the fabulous fountains. These fountains operate daily from May until October. They are officially open to the public on the last day of May, during a lively festival animated by several artistic performances.
Being among the most powerful water jets inPeterhof, Samson reaches more than 20m in height. At the time, the caretaker Paul Sualem built a special pipe fed by a pond on the heights of Babigon to ensure the power of the jet. In 1799, Tsar Paul I ordered to replace the lead sculptures distorted with time by other bronze statues quite identical.
The Fountain of the Pyramid
Considered the most picturesque fountain of Peterhof, the Pyramid attracts a large number of visitors. Designed by Michetti, it was inspired by the famous Obelisk Fountain at Versailles. Pyramid has more than 500 water jets of different heights while the Obelisk Fountain has half of these water jets.

As a breast cancer researcher studying viral links, how does MMTV transmission and treatment differ from BRCA-related cancers?	"From Our 2007 Archives
Breast Cancer Genes Don't Raise Tumor-Linked Death Risk
Latest MedicineNet News
WEDNESDAY, July 11 (HealthDay News) -- Women with breast cancer who carry BRCA gene mutations have the same death rates from their malignancies as women without this DNA variant do, a new study finds.
These findings, published in the July 12 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, run counter to much current medical thought.
""Our main finding of similar -- or even better -- survival of the carriers is in contrast to some, but not all, of the former publications on the subject,"" noted study author Dr. Gad Rennert, of the Clalit National Cancer Control Center and Carmel Medical Center in Haifa, Israel. ""However, we employed a 'clean' design which was not possible for other research groups and therefore our study results come closer to 'truth' than any other study on the subject.""
Practically speaking, the findings could impact the treatment decisions of women who have one of the two genetic mutations, called BRCA1 or BRCA2.
Many previous studies on the issue had suggested that cancer resulting from these mutations had a worse outcome than other types of breast tumors.
The BRCA mutations are more common among women of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, which may help account for why breast cancer is the leading cause of all deaths from cancer among Israeli women. Some 60 percent of Israeli Jews are Ashkenazi. About 2 percent of all Ashkenazi women and 12 percent of Ashkenazi women with breast cancer carry a mutation in one of these two genes.
BRCA1-associated breast cancers, especially, tend to occur in younger women, are high-grade and are not estrogen-receptor positive, all factors which are associated with a poorer outcome.
But information on how a woman's BRCA status might affect her prognosis has been ""inconsistent,"" the authors stated.
To clarify the picture, the authors looked at all cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed between Jan. 1, 1987 and Dec. 31, 1988, and recorded in the Israeli National Cancer Registry. This represented the majority of all women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer in Israel during this time period. The researchers examined patient tumor samples and analyzed DNA, and they also catalogued deaths occurring within 10 years of diagnosis."	<urn:uuid:a3034fa2-a7e0-417d-b27f-11cc89127857>	0.0

What makes the Horezu Monastery significant in terms of its architectural and artistic value?	"King Milutin filled up all these buildings with frescoes, icons, ecclesiastical vessels,
books and embroideries. A lot of them were lost with the time, but many of them have
also been preserved in churches and in monasteries' treasuries. The exceptional
diptych with miniatures of Venetian art, was donated to Chilandar monastery by the
""Christ loving and God fearing King"".
STEFAN UROSH III OF DECHANI
King (1321 - 1331)
St Stefan of Dechani
Stefan Urosh III was the son of King Milutin. Out of his love for Christ, as well as
gratitude to the Chilandar community which had mediated in his reconciliation with his
father Milutin, Stefan built in the courtyard of the Hrussia Tower, in Chilandar, the
Church of St Basil.
He built many more endowments, the most famous being the monastery of Christ the
Pantocrator near Dechani, in Metochia, after which the King was named by the people
""Stefan of Dechani"". Because of its architectural symmetry, lavish sculptural
ornamentation, theological themes of paintings and richness of the monastery treasury,
Dechani represents one of the most significant monuments of the Serbian medieval
Relics of the donor, Stefan of Dechani, are resting in peace in the Dechani monastery.
STEFAN DUSHAN THE MIGHTY
King (1331 - 1346), Tzar (1346 - 1355)
Dushan was the son of Stefan of Dechani. Borders of Dushan's state included the
most important centre of Orthodoxy of the Byzantine Empire - Mount Athos -The Holy
Mountain. The State Assembly in Skopje accepted the proclamation of the Empire and
Patriarchate. On Easter day 1346, Dushan was crowned the Tzar by the Serbian
Patriarch Ioannikos and the Patriarch of Trnovo Symeon.
At Dushan's time not many enlargements were done at the Chilandar monastery, but
he bestowed it with many gifts and untold wealth. He was generous also to other
monasteries of Mount Athos. The legend credits him with donation of the Holy
Archangels Church."	<urn:uuid:8fb38eb0-f8ce-40f8-8fc2-522f45721351>	0.0
who commissioned lee friedlander photographs computing 1980s	"“Crane’s goal,” Rohrbach believes, “has been to critique our subservience to photographic realism and to suggest that we have fallen into a bad habit of giving undue preference to that part of photography’s magical language.” Writing specifically of Crane’s nude studies, Rohrbach writes that “[e]ach body almost dissolves, becoming a sinuous river flowing across a snowy landscape.” The gentle lyricism and natural sense of flow of Crane’s nudes departs drastically from Weston’s almost sculptural, static nudes. Such works beautifully capture the philosophical difference between Crane’s “challenging vision” and the vision of her contemporaries. Crane achieves what Rohrbach calls an “unnerving disconnect” that breaks old associations and forces us to reconnect with what we see before us.
Crane jumps from subject to subject throughout her career, always seeking something new to cast askew and make new. In a series of collaged photographs involving neon lights, Crane “juxtapos[es] neon lights over faces like ceremonial urban masks,” writes Foerstner in her essay, “On the Path to the Perfect Photograph.” In Neon Cowboy (above, from 1969), Crane superimposes a grid of neon cowboy signs over a series of male nudes. Rohrbach connects Crane’s use of series to the influence of John Cage’s music celebrating the artistic potential of chance. Although the neon sign does not move, the male model beneath does, sometimes wearing the neon like a mask and sometimes pulling away, revealing the hollow “mask-ness” of the sign. Rohrbach also makes a fascinating connection between Crane and the philosopher- semiotician Roland Barthes. Contrasting Crane with Lee Friedlander, who sees photography as seeing rather than making, Rohrbach calls Crane “a linguist at heart, in love with photographs as signs rather than signifiers.” Such philosophical depth adds a whole new dimension to what seem to be Crane’s simple pictures of people, buildings, neon signs, etc. “Crane taps the everyday world for the tumultuous undercurrents of unifying themes: chance, accident, chaos, contradiction and mystery playing out before our eyes,” Foerstner concurs.
After years of photographing the urban landscape and its inhabitants, Crane went “back to nature” in the 1990s with her Coloma to Covert series."	<urn:uuid:9ff4d8d0-733c-48ba-a1d0-1ff4a5248e72>	0.0
studying rock composition mechanisms explain how minerals freeze during magmatic differentiation	"It is composed mainly of sedimentary and igneous rocks. Its upper part is composed of magmatic formations and may also present sedimentary rocks. In the continents, it is formed mainly by granite rocks that form a solid layer. It is also made up of minerals, organic substances and living organisms, water and gases.
The Earth's continental crust is made predominantly of gabbro (dominating the lower crust) and granitoid rocks (i.e., granite + granodiorite + diorite) (concentrated in the upper crust). 5 In 1915 N. L. Bowen proposed that gabbro is the only magma produced by melting of rock and that all other magma types derive from it by processes of ...
Countertops in kitchens and bar areas are often exposed to acidic substances such as lemon, vinegar, alcohol, and tomato sauce. Knives, dishes, pots and pans, and other implements may cause scratching of lesser materials. Granite is the hardest and densest of all-natural stones and the silicates it contains won't react with acid.
Granite and similar rocks are said to be felsic (composed of feldspar and silica) and basaltic rocks are referred to as mafic rocks (magnesium + ferric). Olivine is a common rock-forming mineral in mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks, but it also occurs in impure metamorphosed carbonate rocks (picture below).
According to the International Mineralogical Association, there are 5,575 known minerals, but most rocks are composed of just a few common minerals. In fact, only seven minerals make up 84% of Earth's crust (Figure 2.2). So when you find an unknown rock, there is a good chance that at least one of those seven minerals will be present.

The Chao Phraya River Basin is one of the largest in Asia and is highly vulnerable to water-related disasters. Based on rainfall gauge data over 36 years (1981–2016), a frequency analysis was performed for this basin to understand and evaluate its overall flood risk; daily rainfall measurements of 119 rain gauge stations within the basin were considered. Four common probability distributions, i.e., Log-Normal (LOG), Gumbel type-I (GUM), Pearson type-III (PE3), and Log-Pearson type-III (LP3) distributions, were used to calculate the return period of rainfall at each station and at the basin-scale level. Results of each distribution were compared with the graphical Gringorten method to analyze their performance; GUM was found to be the best-fitted distribution among the four. Thereafter, design hyetographs were developed by integrating the return period of rainfall based on three adopted methods at basin and subbasin scales; each method had its pros and cons for hydrological applications. Finally, utilizing a Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model, we estimated the possible flood inundation extent and depth, which was outlined over the Chao Phraya River Basin using the design hyetographs with different return periods. This study can help enhance disaster resilience at industrial complexes in Thailand for sustainable growth."	<urn:uuid:476f0d04-8d6c-4a28-97b0-38c115373dab>	0.0

small animal vs large animal anesthesiology courses monitoring equipment	"Make sure it will support the weight of the tiny animal in a safe manner. Use safe paints. Painting or sealing the surface your equipment is important so that you can keep it clean (think urine) and safe for your small pets.
If you are teaching your mouse to run an agility course do not let them have the same type items in their cage to play on or sleep in. For example, you will have a hard time teaching a mouse to run through a tunnel on a course if they sleep in one in their cage.
Fence Jumps are made to look like a fence that a horse would be behind in the country. Why? Because all animal agility, all, meaning dog, cat, rat, gerbil, mouse all or any species came from the idea of Steeple Chase. An event horses compete in by jumping over all kinds of pretty and functional fences...well, cut outs if you will. The event can also be called ""Show Jumping"".
So you will see, even in mice agility, fence jumps on about every agility course that is set up.
This is also the reason some folks call all the jumps and or all agility equipment ""fences"". Many people also refer to the small animals agility or jumping courses as ""Show Jumping"" or Showjumping"".
Bar Jumps are made with ""bars"" that are the same height in either side of the matching sides. Most bar jumps are adjustable.
Bar Jumps are usually where you will see the most artsy type jumps at an event. It is fun to make the course a pleasure to look at and have a little fun while making your equipment.
Some, but not all, Bars or polls are made to fall if hit while the animal is coming over it and hits the top bar.
Be sure to start the animal with low bars when first training these pieces of equipment.
STATIONARY BAR JUMPS
This is a fun little Coke Bar Jump. The jumps do not have to be fancy, but functional and stable.
I have directions on how I made this on our craft page.
The edges look a bit unsightly not because I was sloppy, but that I added glue to the area where the caps were put together to give the jump more strength.
I also have this type of Stationary Bar Jump. This one could also qualify for a Fence Jump. It works well and is stable enough for a gerbil or hamster or even a small or young rattie."	<urn:uuid:1280fa25-31fc-416c-a9e0-78267e2aeafd>	0.0
How do you identify the positive lead on an LED?	"Positive Deviance (PD) was designed as a practice for social change that enables communities and organizations to discover and act on the wisdom and skills existing in the system. The underlying premise of PD is that every community has individuals or groups whose uncommon practices or strategies enable them to find better solutions to problems than neighbors and peers who have access to the same resources. PD is led by people in the community who help identify and spread successful practices. Ideas, experiments and projects for change are more likely to be accepted and adopted when they are based on existing local wisdom versus external initiatives imposed on the system.

when did european eels get anguillicoloides crassus parasite	"The North Queensland Cowboys have romped home to a 42-14 win over a lacklustre Parramatta Eels side in front of a crowd of 13,285 at 1300SMILES Stadium in Townsville.
In what was an extremely one-sided affair, it was ultimately poor starts in each half that cost the Eels in a tough night for them in Northern Queensland. The Eels just couldn't get any decent amount of ball at any point throughout the match, with possession flow sitting at over 60% to the Cowboys for the majority of the game.
The Cowboys impressive victory was built on the back of a dominant performance from their giant forward pack with Australia and New South Wales hopeful James Tamou finishing the match with over 170 run metres, closely followed by a strong performance from second rower Jason Taumalolo who ended the match with over 140 run metres.
It took only 5 minutes for the Cowboys to open up their account for the night with Johnathan Thurston chasing through on a Michael Morgan grubber to get the night's first try. Two more Cowboys tries followed in quick succession with Matthew Scott and Curtis Rona both adding their own tries within the 20 minute mark.
Amazingly, despite hardly having any ball, the Eels were able to get within four points of the Cowboys at halftime. Paul Green wouldn't have been happy with the soft defence shown from his side as Ken Sio went over in the 25th minute, followed by a 33rd minute Pauli Pauli try with what were basically their only two chances of the half. Chris Sandow took the score to 18-14 and within a converted try with a penalty goal right on half time.
The second half began as the first did, with Kane Linnett scoring only 5 minutes into the half. When Sandow went himself and got over the line 10 minutes later, it looked as though the Eels might be back in it, however the video referee correctly ruled that Sandow had knocked on in attempting to ground the ball.
A second Kane Linnett try in the 57th minute, followed by a second Curtis Rona try in the 65th ended any hope of an Eels fight back, not that it was ever likely."	<urn:uuid:23fc354a-3bb3-4ed1-aa35-d8af7f385513>	0.0
Which condition has a higher survival rate: untreated neuroblastoma or untreated CML?	"Progression Free Survival with Nivolumab in Recurrent NSCLC
HealthDay News — For patients with previously untreated stage IV or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), nivolumab is not associated with longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy, according to a study published in the June 22 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
David P. Carbone, MD, PhD, from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center in Columbus, and colleagues randomized patients with untreated stage IV or recurrent NSCLC and a programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor expression level of 1% or more to receive nivolumab or platinum-based chemotherapy.
The researchers found that the median progression-free survival was 4.2 months with nivolumab versus 5.9 months with chemotherapy among the 423 patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.45; P=0.25); median overall survival was 14.4 versus 13.2 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.80 to 1.30). Overall, 60% of 212 patients in the chemotherapy group received nivolumab as subsequent therapy. Treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurred in 71 and 92% of patients who received nivolumab and chemotherapy, respectively; treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 18 and 51%, respectively.
""Nivolumab was not associated with significantly longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy among patients with previously untreated stage IV or recurrent NSCLC with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more,"" the authors write.
The study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb, the manufacturer of nivolumab, and ONO Pharmaceutical."	<urn:uuid:bf179abd-8371-445e-bf1e-f0cffb523697>	0.0

The commanding general further instructs me to inform you that hereafter Shell Point Battery will be known as Battery Simkins; battery half way between Johnson and Legare’s, as Battery Cheves; battery at Legare’s, as Battery Haskell; and the battery at Mellichamp’s, near lines, as Battery Ryan.
Those are depicted on the map below:
One additional work on James Island, though not bearing on Morris Island, was Battery Wampler. This work went up near an old Martello Tower behind Fort Johnson. Laid out for five heavy guns, that work would not be completed until August.
While these batteries were mostly armed with guns reallocated from other positions, Beauregard kept up calls for more guns from Richmond. A few heavy guns and mortars arrived in response to those pleas. He also pulled guns from Savannah.
Through late July and into August, pieces fell into place for a grand display of heavy artillery. Two of the best practitioners of the employment of such weapons – Beauregard and Gillmore – would direct this display.

violin bow string maintenance cleaning	"The beginner violin is an ideal musical instrument for any student who has dreams of playing music. The set contains all the necessary items to start playing. The sleek violin has a hand-carved top with maple back and sides. A finish of metallic varnish, maple fingerboard, chin rest and an alloy tailpiece make this a work of art. The Violin Learning Kit includes Cecilio violin, 1 bow, extra set of violin strings, 2 violin bridges, a quality rosin, and a lightweight hard case with pockets, backpack and shoulder straps. A Mendini Violin First Lesson book with instruction on basic techniques and lessons on how to read music is included in the Basic Technique set. The companion download has exercises and pieces recorded with violin and piano accompaniment. The violin, like most band & orchestra musical instruments, is delicate. The bridge won't be setup to avoid damage during shipping. Also, note: When adjusting, the tuning pegs must be pushed in.
👤Many of the violins that have been sent back with nothing wrong with them have been bought by people with no experience or knowledge of violins. You should do more research than just read reviews. I've seen many reviews complaining about the finish on the neck. The neck isn't finished and hasn't been for centuries. Poor fingering can be caused by the finish. I've heard that the violin was broken on arrival because the bridge had fallen. The bridge isn't like a guitar bridge. The violin is held to the string. The bridge will fall if the strings are loosened. It needs to be between the f-holes to be set back up. There are four modes on the tuner: guitar, bass, violin and cello. If you don't set the violin to violin, it will break a string. The tuning pegs. The tuning pegs on a violin are held in place by a force of inertia, unlike a guitar that uses a set of gears. When tuning, you have to push in the pegs when you seat the taper or they will slip and not retain tension on the string. Please do your homework so you don't believe something is wrong with what you've bought when it's exactly as it should be. 100% satisfied with my purchase.

I live in Mali. How much has rainfall decreased here in the past 50 years?	"“This € 170.000 grant will be used to invest in mobile-based cashless payment facilities for a project that is going to provide 560.000 rural people with drinking water in the Sikasso region (Mali) for the 15 coming years”, explains Thierry BARBOTTE, Chairman of the ODIAL SOLUTIONS group and Director of UDUMA MALI. “In 2018, UDUMA MALI has entered into public service delegation contracts with the first 11 out of the 30 targeted municipalities.”
3 Malians out of 4 live in rural areas and provide themselves with drinking water by means of manual pumps. However, 1 pump out of 2 is regularly out of service. “This existing situation implies more time-consuming and exhausting water chores, has a high cost for the pump upkeep, affects the health conditions and contributes to the rural exodus”, states Nicolaas VAN DER WILK, Operations Manager of UDUMA MALI. Furthermore, boreholes made unusable by defective pumps represent nearly 66 billion CFA francs (100 million euros) in lost public investments.
Mobile technologies at the heart of the UDUMA model
The project, under the tutelage of the Malian Ministry for Energy and Water, is offering an alternative to this situation for the Sikasso region. The Malian local authorities are going to entrust the management and the operation of 1.400 water points equipped with manual pumps to the private operator UDUMA MALI. The operator guarantees a continuous water service (72-hour max downtime) for at least 15 years and renews a large part of the equipment.
UDUMA MALI will be charging a fixed user fee per consumed volume (500 CFA francs/m3, 0.76 euro). The water pumps will be equipped with digital water meters. The water service is provided by a caretaker (1 on each pump) and a mechanic (1 per 50 pumps), whose remunerations evolve with water consumptions. The new water service delivery model is expected to create small-scale income-generating activities for nearly 1.500 women in the Sikasso Region.
The GSMA M4D Utilities Innovation Fund grant will enable UDUMA MALI to deploy mobile-enabled devices for cashless revenue collection, combining Mobile Money and Near Field Communication (NFC) technologies."	<urn:uuid:e1f6d3a2-2585-437a-bf8a-1819db481032>	0.0

Between Foster's Beijing airport and Creative Group's Goa terminal, which has the bolder roof design?	"Everything about Goa!Goa to Kerala
Kerala and Goa share the same Arabian Sea coastline along the western coast of India.
Goa to Kerala by Train : By far train is the most popular means to travel between Goa and Kerala. It's a 15 hours or so journey from Madgaon (MAO) to Ernakulam Jn (ERS), the main railway station for Cochin.
There are two daily express trains connecting Goa with Kerala. The first one is the Mangala Lakshadweep Express (Train No: 12618 ) from H Nizamuddin (NZM) near New Delhi to Ernakulam Jn (ERS) .
If you are heading further south of Kerala like Alleppey (ALLP), Kollam (QLN), Varkala (VAK), Trivandrum(TVC) etc, opt for Netravati Express (Train No 16345) Netravati Express connects Mumbai with Trivandrum via Goa.
Both has stop at Madgaon (MAO) of Goa. Additionally, you can board Netravati Express from Karmali (north Goa) or Canacona (south Goa).
Mangala Lakshadweep Express stops at Thivim (North Goa) also.
Other than these two daily trains you will see 3 or 4 more trains between Kerala and Goa that are weekly, bi-weekly or tri-weekly.
Select the train that suits you based on the day of travel, time and destination in Kerala. Check with irctc.co.in website for updated schedules and reservation availability.
Goa to Kerala by Flight There are no direct flights to Kerala from Goa.
By the way Kerala has three airports, to which domestic and international flights operate: Calicut International Airport (CJJ), Cochin International Airport (COK) and Trivandrum International Airport (TRV).
There are frequent flights from Goa to Mumbai, some decent number of flights between Goa and Bangalore. Both Bangalore and Mumbai are well connected by direct flights to Calicut, Cochin and Trivandrum.
It's a hop on hop off type journey, but that's the best available option to fly to Kerala from Goa.
Goa to Kerala by Road : National Highway 17 (NH17) running along the west coast of India connects Mumbai with Cochin via Goa."	<urn:uuid:d49ed392-b85d-4c6d-9ab2-70dc997b85e1>	0.0
I'm new to guns. What exactly does ballistics mean?	"These three kinds of scenes are very similar in that they have to tell a part of the story by using details. Horror and action are not my strongest points as a director. I'm better at making pretty paintings than the deliberate pacing of shots which build up tension in a horror or action scene. I'm getting better at the pacing of shots in a love scene as I've had more experience with them. Horror is very very specialized and difficult to do.
Storyboards are important in commercials. And for films with budgets so large that you know exactly what your sets will be like. But in our world they are mostly a waste of time.
Instead, use the following rules.
What's actually important
There are only two things that are important when shooting a movie
And you read the scheduling section of the Wiki first, right?
Shooting the movie isn't important. That's the fun part of what we do. But in order to sell the movie we absolutely must have good stills. Frequently the producers rep will tell us what they want for stills. Otherwise, we need all the actors in front of a blue screen with their guns or whatever. And then we need pictures of them in character doing the things their character does. Distributors will actually reject a picture that does not have several hundred high-resolution stills.
One of the most important and potentially expensive deliverables on a motion picture is the DM&E tracks. We absolutely must have well recorded dialog in order to deliver those. The dialog quality is more important than the picture. Viewers will presume the picture looks terrible if the sound is terrible.
To recap: the two most important things are stills and sound. Everything else you do to make a movie? Tertiary or... worse...
What to shoot
- Shoot all of the action
- all the entrances
- all the exits
- shoot all the dialog
- shoot everything in the scene that anyone refers to: dead body on the floor, glass of whiskey, baccarat table.
And remember that it's all about the decisions made on-stage. I don't mean the decisions the director makes, I mean the decisions that the characters make. If you have a character come to the end of a hallway and she has the option of going left or right — we want to see her make that decision. Left or right?"	<urn:uuid:a3cbe4cd-2ded-474b-b221-71f601c657f4>	0.0
I'm working on a school project about food science pioneers. Could you tell me if Nicolai Vavilov and the botanist Petr Zhukovsky had similar goals in their travels to Turkey?	"RED: And where did you learn the most about winemaking?
SCOTT: Growing up I had a lot of varied interests, not just in oenology but also in food science, so I pursued studies in Fermentation Science at the University of California at Davis. In addition to winemaking, I also explored the principles and science behind distillation, food engineering and even a little cheese-making. Since my brother and I were experimenting with home brewing during the summers, I took the opportunity to study at Davis’ Institute of Brewing Studies, eventually earning a Master Brewers Certificate. After Davis, I joined the Carmel Brewing Company, and eventually assembled a brewpub in Monterey from the ground up, formulating the recipes and brewing all the beer that we would serve on tap. I had always enjoyed the engineering side of things such as fluid dynamics and heat transfer, and working in a small brewpub allowed me to be hands-on throughout the brewing process and use some of the mechanical skills I learned growing up.
Ultimately though, I found that brewing didn’t really fulfill my creative side, and I found myself gravitating back toward winemaking. In 2000, I joined the Robert Mondavi family of wines working on a variety of brands that took me from Australia to Italy. These experiences abroad really shaped my philosophy about wine and winemaking, my travels to Italy clarified the synergy between wine and food, while making wine in Australia introduced me to a new approach with a focus on the details and the idea that you only get one chance to make a wine great.
RED: What is your winemaking style or philosophy?
SCOTT: Winemaking fulfills my artistic side without giving up the innovative hands-on experience that keeps me in touch with my family’s roots in agriculture. I enjoy all of the challenges that each vintage presents in order to shape the style of wines we make at Estancia.. Our winemaking style is one that fully embraces the coastal terroir.
RED: Tell me, what makes the Monterey and the Central Coast region so special?
SCOTT: Born and raised in Monterey County, I have tremendous respect for the climate – the wind and fog and the impact it has on the fruit and wine."	<urn:uuid:4ac305b0-9dad-4baf-a489-c38801be01a0>	0.0
Which blocks noise better, suspended or acoustic ceilings?	"We have already discussed how to address flanking noise through floors and ceiling
The problem with cavity walls is it is not only the cavity allowing the free passage of noise around the party wall but the internal masonry skin is often of low density blocks. In the early days these would be known as “breeze” blocks but in more recent years they have been replaced with even lower density blocks called “Thermalite” blocks. The Thermalite blocks are more efficient at allowing noise to be transmitted through them into adjoining rooms and are a particular problem with flats when flanking noise travels up and down through these blocks into flats above and below but the soundproofing of flats is an issue I will discuss in a later article. The best way to soundproof these walls to reduce flanking noise transmission is to install a 50mm M20AD solution but can be expensive so should only be installed in extreme cases where the flanking noise is more of a nuisance. If you still want to look at the M20AD solution to reduce flanking noise through a wall go to our web page via the following link M20AD To soundproof a wall.
And back to the cavities within the walls and the best way to treat these is to have blown mineral wool installed that will have the advantage of giving additional thermal insulation. Other types of thermal insulation such as injected foam or polystyrene will not be as efficient at absorbing the noise and could actually compound the problem making the noise being heard even clearer.
More information on how to soundproof a party wall can be found on our web page via this link soundproof a party wall.
This article explains how flanking noise uses the cavities and lightweight masonry of walls to gain access. More about how to soundproof a party wall will be published in the near future.

There is a common misconception concerning acoustic underlays and what is required of them. Most people want an acoustic underlay to reduce airborne noise such as speech and music being heard through a floor. So when they go to buy a new carpet, they also ask for a sound absorbing underlay from the carpet supplier."	<urn:uuid:009d05d0-bfc5-459c-b932-9541d3baea99>	0.0

How do Yoruba religious practices influence modern rituals across different regions?	"By normal processes of socialization, and unless other significant forces intervene, more than what parents might say they want as religious outcomes of their children, most parents most likely will end up getting religiously of their children what they themselves are. (Smith, 57)
The importance of parental faith and practice on the lives of children and teens is clear. Smith concludes by saying:
Contrary to popular misguided cultural stereotypes and frequent parental misconceptions, we believe that the evidence clearly shows that the single most important social influence on the religious and spiritual lives of adolescents is their parents (emphasis added).
Grandparents and other relatives, mentors, and youth workers can be very influential as well, but normally, parents are most important in forming their children’s religious and spiritual lives.…the best social predictor, although not a guarantee, of what the religious and spiritual lives of youth will look like is what the religious and spiritual lives of their parents do look like. Parents and other adults most likely “will get what they are.” This recognition may be empowering to parents, or alarming, or both.
But it is a fact worth taking seriously in any case. (Smith, 261)
The best way to get most youth involved in and serious about their faith communities is to get their parents more involved in and serious about their faith communities (Smith, 267).
How do religious families practice their faith at home?
In his study Growing Up Religious, Robert Wuthnow explored the religious journeys of people who grew up religious and the role of the family.
Effective religious socialization comes about through embedded practices; that is, through specific, deliberate religious activities that are firmly intertwined with the daily habits of family routines, of eating and sleeping, of having conversations, of adorning spaces in which people live, of celebrating the holidays, and of being part of a community. Compared with these practices, the formal teachings of religious leaders often pale in significance. Yet when such practices are present, formal teachings also become more important. (Wuthnow, xxxi-ii)
The prime source of faith for self-described “religious” people was the way faith permeated the daily life of their family. Time and again the people Wuthnow interviewed pointed to variations on several common family activities. “The daily household routine was marked by rituals of prayer, by conversations about God, and by sacred objects. Holidays provided special occasions for experiencing the warmth of family, friends, and fellow congregants."	<urn:uuid:b3dd70b1-81bd-4082-bca9-3584521a2be4>	0.0
I'm fascinated by local food traditions and heard about a big bean festival somewhere in Piedmont - could you explain what this event is all about?	"Yay! It's Blogger's Quilt Festival time!! What could be better than seeing lots of beautiful quilts from all around the world and hearing the stories behind them, with the bonus of finding new bloggy friends.
Today I'm sharing my version of a pattern by Chris Jurd called Mariner's Garden.
The paper pieced center is a scrap attack of blues and greens. I didn't have an overall plan when choosing my colours. I had a lot of blues and greens so figured that was a good start. When it came to choosing a background I thought I'd use orange or yellow, something sunny and bright, but when trying those options they just fell flat, but the purple really made the center pop.
The flowers in the setting triangles were my first attempt at applique and far from perfect, but I'm okay with that. You have to start somewhere, and I learnt a lot doing them...
This peacock fabric was in my stash and the colours were right so they became the corner blocks. They inspired the name for the quilt - Peacock Garden
The quilt top has sat in my cupboard for about 2 years. I was putting off quilting it , partly because it's big! and because I was worried about not doing a good enough job. I took it to Tanya Croft, my lovely long arm quilter who chose a simple loopy squiggly all-over design. I'm so happy with it, it's not too fussy and just dances around the quilt.
I love this pattern and enjoyed making it, I'd really like to make it again in other colours.
Fun backing fabric!! Domestic Diva by Emily Taylor.
A super big Thank You to Amy from Amy's Creative Side for organising the Blogger's Quilt Festival!! And to all the wonderful sponsers for supporting such a fun event.
I always try to reply to comments but it's going to be a busy week of trying to visit as many festival blogs as I can so please excuse me if I don't reply, but if you leave me a comment I'll make sure I visit your blog and leave a comment in return. :)"	<urn:uuid:6d55d591-a4b8-4637-b364-ea3511d5bcf2>	0.0
maximum precision machined springs versus wire	"Contact us today:
Exact Metrology, a comprehensive 3D metrology service provider and hardware sales company, is excited to announce that a large scale Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) has been installed at their office location in Moline, Illinois.
This machine is a high-accuracy CNC coordinate measuring machine that guarantees a maximum permissible error of E0, MPE = (2.5+3L/1000)μm. With this machine, measurement uncertainty remains within one-fifth of the dimension tolerance up to 30.2” (766mm). The higher accuracy specification therefore gives it more than double the effective measuring range in terms of accuracy-guarantee capability.
In addition, the room the machine sits in is temperature controlled. From sensors installed on each axis scale and working in conjunction with sensors placed on the workpiece, temperatures are obtained before outputting the measurement result to the controller. The combined axis scale/workpiece temperature compensation design used gives superior results compared to systems with sensors only on the axis scales.
This CMM offers a maximum drive speed of 693 mm/s and a maximum drive acceleration of 1,732 mm/s2 resulting in an increase of drive distance in one second. Combining high speed and high acceleration, this machine reduces measuring time. As the number of measuring points increases, measuring costs per point are reduced.
It will be used by Exact Metrology for precision machined parts and has a measuring volume of 47 inches by 78 inches. Components, parts and finished durable products that are designed to maintain extreme tight tolerance margins, as well as a high degree of durability are essential and common drivers for the use of precision machining. Precision machined parts typically have intricate features and need precise specifications and measurements. Additionally, many of these parts have holes, grooves, tapers, and/or textures that require an exact fit into other components. Precision machining is used in numerous applications such as: aerospace, medical device components, electronics, oil and gas, etc. CMMs don’t need the “old school” method of calipers, measuring tapes, and/or rulers.
Commenting on this new arrival, Exact Metrology co-President, Dean Solberg, said, “We’re very happy to install this machine and we’ve even heightened our ceilings and reinforced our floors to make sure it fits inside our facility."	<urn:uuid:d28c24c9-3405-4385-a6be-4d731afb614d>	0.0
What kind of editing do alpha and rush readers focus on?	"Now agents also require the writer rather than the publisher to pay them.
3. The technical part of publishing -- getting ink onto paper, editing in the larger sense of organization and content, proofing for accuracy and clarity, formatting, illustrating, printing and binding, and finally distributing -- have never been easier. If you have the money, the machinery is all there. In fact, it takes less money than ever before because printing can be done one copy at a time instead of in mass lots that must be stored until sale (and taxed as property) and distributing can be handled online.
4. There are more customers out there than ever before. But they read less. And no one is quite sure what they DO read, in spite of all the demographic studies. But there are technical ways to find readers for any genre or discipline -- just takes time, effort and maybe money. Rather like locating voters. Or consumers of any kind. Amazon uses the technique of the publishers: sell them what they bought last time. (If you liked X, buy X2.) But writing the same thing over and over is not good for authors.
5. The major problem is sorting and evaluating. Everyone wants to be an author, even if they have to pay to do it. Critics are less eager. “Branding” is how some publishers do -- one publishes thrillers, another publishes chick lit, etc. (Agents also “brand.”) See http://www.dennismcmillan.com/ for a fascinating analysis of the market. McMillan sells to high-end readers of thrillers. His books are fine objects but he gives no attention to editing and proofing, depending on the writers for that. He’s got a “chimney” relationship going: readers who are like the writers in tastes and assumptions. The result is that a few years after publication, the individual copies, the actual books, can be worth a lot of money, introducing the element of speculation that is characteristic of the arts these days.
6. This means that the reader who chooses his or her books carefully AS OBJECTS can actually MAKE money rather than only being a consumer. Originally, the readers were the ultimate source of money for everyone. This practice also moves the profit to the second-hand (“antique” or “collector” market if you think “second-hand” implies downscale) rather than the original publisher.

- Black Butler, insofar as being cut into whimsical shapes. They're skulls.
- Edward Scissorhands. The title character uses his title appendages to create one of these, including a Tyrannosaurus Rex◊ and a stag◊.
- In at least one version of The Shining, the haunted hotel has one of these...and the animals move.
- Meet the Robinsons has them.
- In Pocahontas, Wiggins, the foppish valet to Governor Radcliffe, is seen making topiaries in the wilds of Virginia.
- Dungeons & Dragons has monsters called Topiary Guardians, basically animated hedges in the shapes of whatever animal you want to use (including a leopard, a warthog and a triceratops).
- The Sims had several ornamental bushes you could buy, including one shaped like a llama. In The Sims 3, you can trim your own bushes into several shapes, including animals.
- There was one episode of the old My Little Pony that involved a hedge maze with topiary animals that came to life and went after the characters when they triggered some kind of trap."	<urn:uuid:cbdb92b2-0818-4c01-8ca8-8f4b50aa5192>	0.0
What countries did the gemstones in Anglo-Saxon jewelry originate from?	"Anglo-Saxon Rune Lore
Beginning with an introduction to Anglo-Saxons and the Futhorc, the Anglo-Saxon expanded version of the ancient Norse runes, Anglo-Saxon Rune Lore provides an excellent brief guide to Anglo-Saxon rune lore and interpretation.
An individual guide is given for each rune including its Elder Futhark equivalent, Younger Futhork equivalent, phonetic value and symbolic interpretation for divination. Ancient stories are looked into with guidance for interpretation in contemporary life.
Throughout this book the author quotes the Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem as translated by Bruce Dickens in his 1915 work Runic; a complete version of the poem being included at the end of the book in Anglo-Saxon followed by its translation into modern English. There is also a very useful glossary of terms and bibliography for further study.
If you are interested in discovering these runes for yourself Anglo-Saxon Rune Lore provides an excellent basis, presenting the background to these ancient English runes together with wonderfully clear guidance on their interpretation and use.

awards european film festival cannes 2014 2023 comparison	"The Locarno International Film Festival last week released their line-up for the 2014 festival, including a plethora of new films, retrospectives and festival honours.
The festival will run this year from the 6th -16th of August. Locarno falls in the European festival circuit between Cannes and Venice, tending to allow for smaller films to come to the fore in the midst of the heavyweights of Cannes and Venice. The festival is mostly known for its Piazza Grande open-air screenings, which seats over 8 000 people and features one of the world’s largest open-air screens.
The festival includes an International Competition, Concorso Cineasti (highlighting the first and second films from emerging directors), an Out-of-Competition selection, a Short Film Competition and the Open Doors section, which focuses each year on a specific region. This year’s Open Doors features films on Sub-Saharan Africa.
Locarno typically functions as a discovery festival, launching new trends, films and careers – for example, Roberto Rossellini’s Rome, Open City screened at the first ever festival in 1946. This generally means that many of the titles in the line-up will be unknown to even the most avid of festival-circuit followers.
There are a few familiar faces however – Jean-Luc Godard’s Goodbye to Language will be screening out of competition, as will Thom Andersen’s latest offering, The Tony Longo Trilogy and some competition heavyweights such as Lav Diaz and Pedro Costa will be recognisable names to ardent cinephiles. Sydney audiences will have the chance to catch Aaron Katz and Martha Stephens Land Ho! at the Possible World’s Film Festival before it screens outdoors at the Piazza Grande at Locarno, alongside Luc Besson’s Lucy, starring Scarlett Johansson. Cannes-attendees will recognise Tony Gatlif’s Geronimo, which updates West Side Story, and Olivier Assayas’ Clouds of Sils Maria."	<urn:uuid:890265b5-1e96-4bee-ad0d-63c166137cbf>	0.0

What percentage of performance horses have gastric ulcers?	"M1 signifies the presence of metastatic disease. Sampling of at least 15 lymph nodes is recommended during surgical staging (see Curative Surgical Resection below). A staging laparoscopy prior to definitive surgery to exclude peritoneal carcinomatosis should be considered in patients with stage T1b or greater disease without radiographic evidence of distant metastases. Pathologic review should include (1) grade of tumor; (2) histologic subtype; (3) depth of invasion; (4) whether lymphatic or vascular invasion is present; and (5) if there is known metastatic disease, the status of HER2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry or fluorescent in situ hybridization or both.
Ulcerating gastric adenocarcinomas are distinguished from benign gastric ulcers by biopsies. Approximately 3% of gastric ulcers initially believed to be benign later prove to be malignant. To exclude malignancy, all gastric ulcers identified at endoscopy should be biopsied. Ulcers that are suspicious for malignancy to the endoscopist or that have atypia or dysplasia on histologic examination warrant repeat endoscopy in 2–3 months to verify healing and exclude malignancy. Nonhealing ulcers should be considered for resection. Infiltrative carcinoma with thickened gastric folds must be distinguished from lymphoma and other hypertrophic gastropathies.
- Curative Surgical Resection
Surgical resection is the only therapy with curative potential. Laparoscopic techniques achieve similar outcomes and lower overall complication rates as open gastrectomy. After preoperative staging, about two-thirds of patients will be found to have localized disease (ie, stages I–III). In Japan and in specialized centers in the United States, endoscopic mucosal resection is performed in selected patients with small (< 1–2 cm), early (intramucosal or T1aN0) gastric cancers after careful staging with endoscopic ultrasonography. Approximately 25% of patients undergoing surgery will be found to have locally unresectable tumors or peritoneal, hepatic, or distant lymph node metastases that are incurable. The remaining patients with confirmed localized disease should undergo radical surgical resection with curative intent. For adenocarcinoma localized to the distal two-thirds of the stomach, a subtotal distal gastrectomy should be performed."	<urn:uuid:b3a39804-cfe0-4059-b2c7-35571b7715d2>	0.0
virginia oyster industry aquaculture development permit requirements disease monitoring	"“I lead a small team which conducts internal audits, training and procedure development to ensure that everyone is doing the work that they need to do to not only meet our regulatory requirements, but meet additional requirements that we are certified.”
Jennifer’s involvement in aquaculture doesn’t stop with her day job at Cooke Aquaculture though. She is involved with many national aquaculture organizations. She sits as a board member of the Aquaculture Association of Canada, a technical committee member for the Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance, a member of the Salmon Farm Standard Technical Committee for Best Aquaculture Practices, and much more.
“One of the biggest issues with marine farming is that people can’t see the cows grazing, horses galloping and that scenic red barn in the background,” Jennifer explains. “Marine farming happens underwater and for people not in the industry, it can be difficult for them to understand everything that happens. I am especially passionate about helping people to understand what happens on a fish farm.”
Reflecting on her time at the AC and her switch to studies in aquaculture, Jennifer has no doubt that her decision was the right choice.
“Aquaculture isn’t just about being on the farms and feeding the fish, there are so many varied careers within the industry or those associated with supporting the industry,” she explains. “With so many different species under the Cooke banner and various operational locations, I get to interact with a multitude of people, farming and fishing practices, learning new things daily. It’s never redundant and never slow!”
“I knew from the day that I learned about aquaculture that I wanted to be involved,” Jennifer smiles. “I have been involved and absolutely loving it since I graduated in 2002.”"	<urn:uuid:dc94edd6-7447-47ae-b21e-d30a324130c9>	0.0

From “El Gigante” on Easter Island to the “Unfinished Obelisk” at Aswan, Egypt, step-by-step solutions of how the ancient architects might have constructed these magnificent feats of engineering
Ancient Moonshots: Megalithic Mysteries from before Technology
A new book proposing step-by-step solutions to the completion of four of the ancient world’s most mind-boggling but only semi-finished feats of megalithic construction: the boulder-hewn Inca “fortress” of “Sacsawaman” above Cuzco, Peru; “El Gigante,” the 65-foot long “moai” statue still in the quarry on Easter Island; the 1200-ton “Unfinished Obelisk” abandoned in the quarries at Aswan, Egypt, and the enigmatic assemblage of 100,000 tons of the world’s largest dressed stone blocks at the Roman temple-site at Baalbek, Lebanon.
In their times, and for their builders, these were the technological equivalents of our Apollo Space Program. The reader is first offered a 54 page primer on hand methods for manipulating gigantic blocks of stone and a short, but fascinating history of megalithic architecture in the western world, from the huge standing monoliths at Göblekli Tepe, Turkey’s enigmatic 12,000 year old temple site, and the earliest known free-standing megalithic structures on the tiny Mediterranean island of Malta, on through Stonehenge and numerous examples of Egyptian, Minoan, Mycenean and Classical Greek work, culminating with the seldom-visited, but incredible Roman temple of Jupiter-Baal at Baalbek, in its day the largest in the world.
Note: this publication includes the author’s previously published works “SACSAWAMAN, AN INCA MASTERWORK”,“EL GIGANTE, AWAKENING THE GIANT”, “THE UNFINISHED OBELISK” and “BAALBEK’S TRILITHON: AN ENIGMA”, all available as separate publications through this website.

I'm curious about local breakfast foods when I travel - what's a typical morning meal that people eat in the Philippines?	"As a loving mother, preparing meals for our family is one of our very important task. I must admit that it has never been easy on my part as a busy mom. A lot of things to consider...budget, time, effort and even willingness to do it consistently.
Many of us find preparing and eating breakfast to be yet one more of the daily challenges we face in starting each day. We may basically know that breakfast is important, yet it is a meal that is often a hurried affair, with food that is the most convenient to cook (as in fried fare) and eat, while some of us skip it altogether.
In an initiative to encourage a good breakfast habit and make the first meal of the day exciting, Nestlé Philippines has launched I Can’t Believe It’s Breakfast! – a book of 30 easy-to-follow recipes that offer a variety of breakfast ideas to excite the palate and spice up the mornings, from the very “quick” when you don’t have much time to spare, to the “not-so-quick” for mornings when you can invest a little more time and effort for the most important meal to jumpstart your day!
The recipe book highlights the importance of breakfast as part of the Company’s long-term advocacy of helping consumers Choose Wellness through proper diet and physical activity.
|Consumer Engagement Services Head Aurora Alipao|
Studies show that those who skip breakfast become easily irritated, feel weak and uncoordinated, and tend to over-eat later in the day. Performance at work or in school also suffers, and weight management becomes difficult.
Nestlé Philippines Corporate Nutritionist Catherine Sarmiento highlighted the importance of eating breakfast in order to start the day right and make the most out of it. “Breakfast not only gives you the right fuel to perform your day’s tasks, it also sets the pace for the types of food you choose to eat throughout the day, helping you better manage your weight,” Ms. Sarmiento said. “Aside from promoting bone, gut and heart health, breakfast also helps you focus and do well mentally and emotionally. When it becomes part of your daily routine, breakfast promotes a healthy lifestyle for you and your family.”
|Corporate Nutritionist Kaths Sarmiento|
Recognizing the time constraints everyone faces in the morning, Ms. Sarmiento suggests for parents to have a weekly breakfast plan that allows for food variety (to avoid taste fatigue) and optimize nutrition, while sticking to the budget."	<urn:uuid:5611ce26-f223-403b-996a-185fb30e7ed7>	0.0
who were first people interviewed monthly newsletter eso 2019	"There are way too many people thinking, “as long as we send out our newsletter regularly it will engage our audience”; if only it were that easy….
If your nonprofit is serious about engaging your audience and getting them to donate or volunteer then you need to have a sound email marketing strategy to ensure your newsletter becomes a signal instead of noise.
Today I am going to explain a strategy for your nonprofit organization that you need to follow. It almost guarantees that you will increase your open and click through rates and engage your supporters.
First here are some statistics you need to be aware of:
• Targeted emails drive 18 times more revenue than broadcast emails. Thanks Emma
• Email list segmentation is considered the most important tactic used for email marketing
• Segmented email campaigns have a 14.32% higher open rate than non-segmented campaigns. (Mailchimp, 2016)
• And just so you know how you compare to the benchmark; in the nonprofit sector the average open rate is 24.98% and the average click through rate is 2.76%.
The good news?
You can implement this strategy for your newsletter…. even if you have a small database of subscribers and use a free platform such as MailChimp’s free plan.
So what is this email segmentation strategy all about?
In an ideal world we would only receive emails that were of interest to us. The sad truth about monthly newsletters is that they take a lot of time to create and are not engaging supporters like they used to.
Most people suffer from an overflowing email inbox and simply do not have the time to read through a newsletter. In the nonprofit industry newsletters are mostly read by the employees of the nonprofit organization and not the target audience.
The solution? It is easy for a potential donor to just ignore a newsletter which has say five articles of which he has little interest. In this instance, a potential donation is lost. However, by sending targeted emails, the potential donor’s time is saved, and interest is gained.
By targeted email I mean segmenting your mail list into various groups. For example you could divide your email base into:
• Regular donors
• Once-off donors
• Potential supporters
• People who have attended an event
Now instead of sending 1 monthly newsletter with five articles to all of these readers, you send one relevant article to each group. By doing this it makes the newsletter more targeted and the readers only get information on what they are interested in."	<urn:uuid:181282ad-d907-45da-aa3c-8a2c00411c86>	0.0
multiple sports games single day safe teenager playing basketball	"Born and raised in Farmington, NM, Alana Nichols is no stranger to competitive sports. While growing up in northern New Mexico Alana split her time between softball, volleyball, basketball and snowboarding. During a snowboarding trip to the CO backcountry when she was 17, Alana had the opportunity to send a backflip; something she prepared for all summer. It was late in the day and early in the season, but not being one to back down from a challenge Alana hit the jump and over-rotated onto her back. Unbeknownst to her there were rocks lying just beneath the snow’s surface. She was instantly paralyzed.
The overnight transition from being a full-time athlete to being wheelchair bound plunged Alana into uncharted territory. It wasn’t until Alana discovered wheelchair basketball at the University of New Mexico two years later that she realized she could still ball out and fuel her love for competition through adaptive sports.
Now a Paralympic Gold Medalist in both the Summer & Winter Games, Alana is a force to be reckoned with on multiple playing fields, and a leading advocate of adaptive sports progression.
""Yes, I announced my comeback very late because it was a very personal decision for me to make. I have a few short months before the games and a great team of coaches and athletic trainers to help me accomplish this goal! I actually really love and thrive under pressure so I’m excited about it all!""
""I have had the great fortune of competing in 5 Paralympic Games 2 winter, 3 summer (so far) and would have to say, I prefer the summer games! The summer Paralympics are so much bigger than the winter games because of the number of sports offered. It’s absolutely grandiose with almost 4,500 athletes, its mind blowing!""
""Oh gosh, I have had some awesome Paralympic memories... my favorite is probably after winning my first gold in Vancouver in 2010. With that medal I became the first female to win gold in the summer and winter games and it was a huge accomplishment for me after a very hard life experience going into it. I love thinking about seeing my whole team standing out in the rain getting soaked at the medal ceremony, singing out the national anthem, and being so happy for me. Was incredibly special.""

I'm interested in winter houses - what's special about Sirdalen House location?	"Ibiza, you took my heart, and now I've taken it back
It was love at first sight, such an immediate feeling of ""ah.. I'm home""
I know I'm far from the only one to have felt that way about this island. It IS SPECIAL, very very special. It is stunningly beautiful, parts of it in biblical ways, other parts in paradisiacal ways. Parts of Ibiza look like the garden of Eden, and others like the picture perfect beach. Her landscapes are beautiful, pure, crystalline and raw. Natural, with fruits and vegetables growing freely in nature.
The first winter I spent in my house in Ibiza was like Christmas every day, picking huge, juicy oranges off the trees, chili from the bushes below, and pomegranates to sprinkle in my salads. In September the figs were so abundant and almost erotic, and the grapes had this golden color that mesmerized me, thinking of the significance it had for centuries of wine making, not to mention wine drinking.
I kind of ignored the bad sides of the island, which I'll also now ignore, not really wanting to go into any details. I have plenty to say, but am afraid I might get stoned or shot to death by Ibiza fanatics who'll hate me much for criticizing their beautiful paradise.
The thing is with these people, that it seems they are convincing themselves and others about how wonderful this place is. Everyone goes on and on about how stunning it is, how lucky we are to live here. And this happens especially in the winter, when the island goes to sleep, the tourists have gone back home, and it's just what it is: a tiny island with about 120,000 inhabitants. It's a village- a graveyard village. It's dead and dull and flat out boring. There's no culture, no art, no events, no libraries or book cafes to hide out in when it rains, the houses are cold and humid and dark and... There, I said it. A few bad things.
But the expat population here go crazy in the off season, convincing themselves and especially others, especially in Facebook, what a perfect paradise it is that they live in. Numerous pictures of empty beaches- yes, they're sunny and it's probably 18 degrees Celsius, but they're empty."	<urn:uuid:b6a8a567-0eda-4cf7-9ec4-5ed1caa8bd58>	0.0
I'm fascinated by coffee processing methods - what's unique about the honey processing technique used in places like Costa Rica?	"In the selection process the percentage of floating cherries is reduced and plants with better and more uniformed height, yield, ripeness and quality are separated.
From the evaluation performed in the Perez Zeledon region ( Southern Costa Rica) it is noticed that this varietal present a slower coffee cherry ripeness process, and since this characteristic is of great importance for the coffee cultivation in this region, a special emphasis is given to the development and evaluation of this varietal. Thus, in the year 2010, the varietal was released for the benefit of Costa Rica coffee farmers looking for late harvest varietals to avoid early rains during the harvest season and maintain the Caturra arabica high quality in the cup.
Evaluations performed measuring growth, yield, and quality in the cup, coffee cherries ripening process and resistance to fungus and pests, The Venecia varietal present the following characteristics:
a. High quality in the cup.
b. Big coffee bean size ( bigger that its Caturra Parent ) and yield similar to Caturra varietal.
c. Late harvest: Coffee cherries ripe late in the coffee harvest season.
d. Compact size of the coffee plant that favors harvesting
The harvest of the Venecia Varietal in the regions where it was evaluated was similar to the Caturra Varietal. It can be clasified as a varietal of medium yield.
Regarding coffee cherry size variables and coffee bean after processing. The Venecia varietal presents bigger coffee cherry size and same or higher yield after mill processing. Coffee beans have a higher size in the 17/64 filter, compared to the Caturra Varietal.
Same results were obtained withe the peaberry coffee bean.
This Venecia varietal presents a high quality coffee cup. In several cupping events during the selection process, the quality in the cup was same or higher than the comparable Caturra and Catuai Varietals. It is more Aromatic, has more body, higher acidity, less bitterness, and overall, it was selected the best among the three varietals by selected institute cuppers.
Because of this varietal is of late harvest, it is recommended in micro climates where rain may interfere with optimal harvest. Besides the higher quality in the bean, the Venecia coffee Varietal allows to decrease the lost in coffee cherries due to rainfall, thus farm labor use and farm infrastructure is optimized."	<urn:uuid:5d2d9de1-1927-4938-a9bd-3f334007f4d7>	0.0

Opportunities that allow unexpected yet transformational connections across disciplines distinguish Marymount Manhattan from other institutions. Our integrated and experiential approach to a liberal arts education leads us to new frontiers of knowledge.
This plan indicates how, over the next five years, the College will firmly articulate its identity, strengthen its academic offerings, make its administration more efficient, utilize its technology resources more effectively, and promote itself more vigorously. It will guide the allocation and re-allocation of resources that occurs in the annual budgeting process over these years.
Articulating our Identity
The Plan was guided by discussions within the Strategic Planning Committee and among the faculty and the larger community, and reinforced by the report of our consultants, AKA / Strategies. It proposes that the College recognize that it is an institution with a tri-partite identity, i.e., as a college of the performing, visual and media, and liberal arts. Marymount Manhattan’s strength draws from the interrelationships between and among these areas.
Many faculty members cross the boundaries of these three branches, as do our students: e.g., the double major in Communication Arts and Business who interns at the White House; the Psychology major who is now a highly successful fashion designer; the International Studies alumna who has performed with her band on Saturday Night Live; the Dance alumna who is now a corporate lawyer and another who is in medical school."	<urn:uuid:77cffcdc-90cc-41d2-9f24-f26394e65730>	0.0
I notice most circuit boards I see are green in color - I've always wondered why they chose this particular color for circuit boards?	"From the emails I've been receiving, it's very clear that I need to create new up-to-date web pages ASAP. I'm sorry it's so confusing. I'm going to start redesigning the MP3 player portion of the site tommorrow.
Aug 31, 2000: We received the first few circuit boards yesterday evening, and I've built the first board and I'll be testing it this afternoon. Here's a photo of the board:
The next step is to add the board, kits, and parts to our on-line store so that we can begin taking orders for them. We currently have about 20 boards and the rest are expected today or tommorrow. Robin and I are planning on working to build boards all weekend so that we can ship them on Tuesday.
I should also mention that the firmware currently does not make use of the DRAM, so there is very little buffering, and the drive can not spin down (high capacity NiMH batteries last only about 1 hour with the drive spinning continuously). It will take me some time to merge the DRAM controller with the other FGPA player hardware, but the good news is that when this is ready, anyone who has the board will be able to flash upgrade to get DRAM support. The other issue with not having DRAM is that the hard drive must be defragmented before it is put into the player.
There is also a larger copy of the board photo, where some of the chips are more readable.
Aug 28, 2000: Robin and I have been spending quite a bit of time preping components and getting ready to make a bunch of boards. I've made dozens of orders for parts from various distributors, and our living room is filled with boxes and parts. We spent part of Sunday moving the phones and printer around, which required getting under the house to pull more wires (not fun). The new arrangement makes it much easier for Robin to process an order. Most of this doesn't involve the computer, so I've not updated this page in a while, and I'm horribly behind in answering emails. If you have an email message sent to me, please be patient. I'll try to get to them soon.
The guy from the circuit board place called a couple days ago. The boards will be delayed a bit, because his wife who was pregnant and expecting in a couple weeks had a blood pressure problem."	<urn:uuid:f6d47292-ddb3-4e21-9a70-b567b5394e50>	0.0
what is used to study meaning of words that describe truth levels	"As an ancient language, Hebrew went through a long period of disuse. Towards the end of the 19th century, it underwent a transformation and emerged as a modern language due to the efforts of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, a noted Jewish linguist.
Today, people participating in Hebrew language learning online often find words that can’t be directly translated into English.
Some of these words are discussed below:
1. Firgun (פרגון)
The word ‘firgun’ is used to describe feeling genuinely happy for another’s person joy, or taking pride in their accomplishments.
It’s also a concept, implying that a person who engages in ‘firgun’ has a generosity of spirit, and feels no resentment or jealousy towards someone else’s happiness.
2. Davka (דווקא)
‘Davka’ is an incredibly versatile word, as its meaning can vary depending on the usage. One says ‘davka’ when they want to describe something that’s the opposite of what they were expecting.
The word can also be used to describe irony, or a deliberately harmful act.
3. L’ecole Sratim (לאכול סרטים)
The term ‘L’ecole Sratim’ literally means ‘to eat movies.’
One uses the term when talking about someone with a dramatic, over-the-top personality. It also describes someone who tends to blow small things out of proportion.
4. Chutzpah (חוצפה)
‘Chutzpah’ is perhaps one of the most popular Hebrew words used by non-Hebrew speakers. The word is commonly used in conversation and in writing by English speakers, but it does not translate directly to English.
Someone with ‘chutzpah’ has a lot of nerve or audacity, bordering on rudeness. In Hebrew, the word generally has negative connotations. But in English, it takes on a more positive meaning since it’s used to praise a person’s brashness.

5. Stalbet (סטאלבט)
‘Stalbet’ is one of many Hebrew slang words with no English translation.
It’s used in the contexts of relaxing, unwinding, or simply doing nothing."	<urn:uuid:07a78134-4554-4afa-9d7f-51971edfbbe1>	0.0

I'm researching blockchain tokenomics - how does Kin's implementation on Solana handle transaction fees and rewards, and what stake-based security measures are in place?	"When quantum computing is commercialized and computers far more powerful than today’s’ ones are created, then the hackers may entertain hopes to hack the Bitcoin network. However, with today’s computing technology, it can’t be hacked.
Proof of work vs proof of stake: How is proof of stake algorithm different?
You can see the blockchain network is really safe with POW algorithm, however, such high security also comes at a high cost. I will explain this cost before I describe how the proof of stake algorithm is different.
POW algorithm requires every node to participate in the transaction validation, and this creates scalability issues in the network. The scalability reduces the more the network grows because now even more nodes will need to participate to validate a transaction.
The need to solve ever more complex mathematical puzzle reduces the transaction throughput. The Bitcoin users want their transactions to be included in the very next available block, and they pay fees to the miners for this. With the puzzle growing in complexity, the competition to include transactions in the next available block intensifies. The fees increase as a result.
Blockchain was supposed to be completely decentralized. However, the ever-increasing complexity of the cryptographic puzzle makes it hard for the miners to continuously upgrade their hardware and foot the growing energy bill.
Mining pools have emerged to achieve economy of scale, and Bitcoin mining is becoming increasingly centralized with giant mining rigs operated by centralized companies at an industrial scale. This is indirectly centralizing the network.
Before 2018 ends, the Bitcoin mining operations in Iceland will consume more electricity than the entire domestic consumption in the country. A mathematical money without the backing of tangible asset expending this level of energy with the concomitant strain on the environment is attracting negative media coverage.
What is proof of stake algorithm? In this consensus mechanism, there are a few nodes that stake their own cryptocurrencies for transaction validation. They are called ’stakers’ and stakers are identified using a deterministic process.
The more the amount of stake and the longer the duration of the stake, the more likely the staker will be chosen for the transaction validation. All nodes needn‘t participate in the transaction validation, and there is no complex cryptographical puzzle to solve.
All coins have already been created and there is no mining. The transaction validation process is called ’forging‘ in PoS algorithm.
This improves scalability and transaction throughput."	<urn:uuid:0bc3508f-d78b-477f-8dc0-f28799a65a3b>	0.0
I've been analyzing workplace risks and disabilities - how do the physical mobility challenges differ between the recycling collector's work environment and Stephen Hawking's professional career?	"I will deal with this question over a couple of separate journals, as there are many issues...
Firstly, it’s crucial you have one or more health and safety representatives (HSRs) as it’s becoming increasingly clear that there are going to be a range of issues which need to be considered and dealt with before workers can safely return to work. Under the obligations of the OHS Act, the employer has a legal duty to consult with any HSRs when identifying and assessing hazards and risks, and when implementing controls to eliminate (or minimise) these hazards and risks. If there are no elected HSRs, then the employer must consult with affected workers – but this is difficult to do effectively, and is often just not done at all. The duty to consult, which is in s35 of the Act, also requires the employer to consult when proposing changes to (almost) anything, like the workplace, the systems of work, the plant and so on.
This is super important – how things will need to be done, what the workplace might look like, and more will need to change. Specifically, this might mean changes to or consideration of:
- The physical layout of the workplace – to ensure physical distancing
- The hours of work
- How and how often the workplace needs to be cleaned
- Evacuation procedures
- How many visitors/clients can enter the workplace
- Interaction between staff and visitors/clients
- Leave policies
- and more…
These issues will affect the level of risk to workers of contracting COVID-19.
There will be other issues, depending on the workplace and the type of work. For example: workers in the transport sector – potential overcrowding in buses, trams, trains and platforms; or construction workers – there have already been employer complaints about the difficulties of maintaining physical distancing. For these reasons it is crucial that workers, through their HSRs have a say. It is unacceptable for employers to not consult – using the excuse that there has not been time. It is absolutely ‘practicable’ to ensure that HSRs are involved in the return to work process.
Please remember: if you have any OHS related queries, then send them in via our Ask Renata facility on the website.

blank canvas opera premiere location date	"Although Verdi did not attend the premiere in Cairo, he was most dissatisfied with the fact that the audience consisted of invited dignitaries, politicians and critics, but no members of the general public. He therefore considered the Italian (and European) premiere, held at La Scala, Milan on 8 February 1872, and in which he was heavily involved at every stage, to be its real premiere.
Verdi had also written the role of Aida for the voice of Teresa Stolz, who sang it for the first time at the Milan premiere. Verdi had asked her fiancé, Angelo Mariani, to conduct the Cairo premiere, but he declined, so Giovanni Bottesini filled the gap. The Milan Amneris, Maria Waldmann, was his favourite in the role and she repeated it a number of times at his request.
Aida was received with great enthusiasm at its Milan premiere. The opera was soon mounted at major opera houses throughout Italy, including the Teatro Regio di Parma (20 April 1872), the Teatro di San Carlo (30 March 1873), La Fenice (11 June 1873), the Teatro Regio di Torino (26 December 1874), the Teatro Comunale di Bologna (30 September 1877, with Giuseppina Pasqua as Amneris and Franco Novara as the King), and the Teatro Costanzi (8 October 1881, with Theresia Singer as Aida and Giulia Novelli as Amneris) among others.
Most performances of Aida have used a subdued, relatively brief, prelude. Verdi also composed a longer concert overture, which includes more melodies from the opera; this was given a rare broadcast performance by Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra on 30 March 1940, which was never commercially issued.
Details of important national and other premieres of Aida follow:
20th and 21st centuries
Aida continues to be a staple of the standard operatic repertoire and appears as number 16 on Opera America's list of the 20 most-performed operas in North America. As of 2007, the Metropolitan Opera alone has given more than 1,100 performances of the opera, making it the second most frequently performed work by the company behind La bohème."	<urn:uuid:65c6e1ed-89f3-4df2-b4c1-9394b27c525f>	0.0

Which protected water area is bigger, Nha Trang Bay or Great Barrier Reef?	"First published January 2017 | Words and photos by Vietnam Coracle
INTRODUCTION | GUIDE | MAP | RELATED POSTS
Filled by the calm, glistening waters of the East Sea, Cam Ranh Bay, just south of Nha Trang, is a splendid natural harbour surrounded by hills. From its southern shores, a finger of land points northwards into the bay: This is Cam Lap Promontory, one of those rare places that’s easily accessible yet undeveloped and utterly beautiful. It’s the kind of place you fall in love with, and one that, for the time being, really does deserve the overused epithet of ‘hidden gem’. Beaches don’t get much better than this in Vietnam, and yet, if you visit on a weekday (avoiding weekends and national holidays), you will probably have the chalky, white-sand, boulder-studded beaches and mirror-flat, jade-blue sea all to yourself. This is my guide to one of my favourite corners of coastal Vietnam.
GUIDE: CAM LAP PROMONTORY
Often dubbed ‘Vietnam’s Maldives’, Cam Lap Promontory is in the perfect stage of development: fairly easily accessible but far enough from the beaten track to ensure that few travellers make it here; a handful of good accommodation options but large-scale construction has yet to arrive; locals are welcoming and friendly to foreign travellers, not cynical and predatory as they can be in the more popular beach towns. Cam Lap Promontory makes a rewarding day trip from Nha Trang or Phan Rang, or as a destination in itself for those who like their sandy beaches less trodden. Weather in Cam Ranh Bay is pretty good year-round and it receives less rain than Nha Trang, just 70km to the north. My favourite time to visit is the height of the dry season, from January to April.
I’ve divided this guide into 4 sections: click an item below to read more about it:

professor asking twitter book suggestions law students what was main conclusion	"No, I am not a scientist, and really this experiment started out very innocently. I wanted to find out what great books there were available (as a gift) about Social Media. What is it? Why do it? What results can you expect? Is it fun? SOOOO, I thought that certainly the best place to find out about Social Media might be through, well, Social Media – and in this case Twitter (and a quick try on LinkedIn). I know I could have used a search engine, but I wanted to hear from all of those people that I trust and respect. I was not prepared for the onslaught of silence that I received. AND I didn’t just send one tweet, I sent FIVE – yes 5 – I will repeat 5. See below:
- Can anyone suggest a great Social Media book that I can buy for someone for Christmas? Gotta be encouraging and easy to read!
- Still looking for info on good books on #SocialMedia. How it works, why do it and what to expect. Any help?
- Want to buy a good book on #SocialMedia. How it works, why do it and what to expect. Any suggestions?
- You know I find it interesting that I essentially tweeted the SAME Social Media info request 3 times and got 1 response. Why? worth a blog
- I am going to try this one more time. Looking for a book on #SocialMedia - how it works, why to use it, gauge its success. any suggestions?
Hard to understand? I even hashtagged it! I got a grand total of 2 responses. The first one came from HRmarketer.com, which also happens to be the company I work for. Congratulations team – you were watching the Twitter conversations just like we tell our clients to do.
Then on my last Tweet, @Herzwords contacted me with a great suggestion. I would have thought that if the companies who have solutions surrounding the confusing world of Social Media, would have been contacting me with suggestions of the books, ebooks, articles, white papers that they have. Not good.
Now like with any experiement, we review the process, and create a Hypothesis/conclusion.

what link between classical jazz concert halls historical significance modern day	"BULGARIAN CULTURAL INSTITUTE IN MOSCOW
Bulgarian Cultural Institute in Moscow was established on 19.01.1988. It is situated on 20, ""Leningradskiy Prospect"". The building was constructed in 1914 after the design of the famous Russian architect D. P. Suhov. This is a magnificent building constructed according to the order of the staff-captain Belik and his wife. The halls impress with their elegancy, harmony and solemnity.
The Embassy of Republic of Bulgaria occupied the building in the period 1946 - 1987 and since 1988 it houses the Bulgarian Cultural Institute.
The main activities of the Bulgarian Cultural Institute are the following:
- supplying information about cultural, public and political life in Bulgaria;
- support of the cooperation and contacts among related creative organizations and individuals from both countries;
- promoting the achievements of Bulgarian culture around the world;
- information about cultural centers and cultural events and festivals taking place in Bulgaria.
The activities of the Bulgarian Cultural Institute could be presented in three aspects:
Aspect One is the program, which is held in the halls and in the lobbies of the building : concerts of performers of different musical genres (from folklore and classical music to jazz and Nuvo); authors' and poetical evening performances, meetings with popular Bulgarian performers and creators, exhibitions, book presentations, courses in Bulgarian language and Bulgarian folk dances.
The magnificent interior of the building which includes a concert hall (80 seats), a conference hall (40 seats), a fireplace (20 seats), art gallery, rich library and offices gives the opportunity for holding several events at the same time.
Aspect Two in Bulgarian Cultural Institute activities includes assistance in organizing of cultural events which are carried out on the basis of the traditionally good contacts between the Bulgarian and the Russian institutions which traditionally participate in the cultural dialogue between out two countries.

genetic treatment success rate retinal cells vs amoeba reproduction	"Understanding female IRD carriers
Research into X-linked inherited retinal diseases often focuses on males, but a study at CERA is aiming to make sure everyone benefits from newly developed treatments.
Inherited retinal diseases (IRD), a broad group of genetic eye conditions caused by changes in a person’s genetic code, do not always affect men and women in the same way.
“A majority of female carriers of X-linked IRDs have a near-normal retina, while at the other end of the spectrum is quite severe disease, similar to what males with these conditions experience,” says Sena Gocuk, optometrist, CERA researcher and PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne.
The condition of many female carriers can often be so mild that it is only identified after a male relative is diagnosed with an inherited disorder.
This lesser severity has led past research to focus only on males with these diseases, but a new study at CERA is seeking help change that.
Chromosomes, the thread-like structures located inside the nucleus of living cells, contain the instructions for how those cells should operate.
They also determine a person’s biological sex; females have two X-chromosomes and males have one X-chromosome and one Y-chromosome.
For IRDs caused by changes in the DNA code of eye genes found on the X-chromosome, the sexes can be affected in very different ways.
“Conditions like choroideremia, and some forms of retinitis pigmentosa, are X-linked conditions, meaning they are caused by faults in the X-chromosome,” says Gocuk.
“For males, who only have one X-chromosome, a single copy of the mutated gene means that they will develop the retinal condition.”
For females, who have two X-chromosomes, an X-linked retinal condition may present quite differently – with some women having no symptoms, and others noting changes in their vision.
“If a female has one mutated and one normal gene, individual cells decide which of the two X-chromosomes are expressed,” says Gocuk.
“Because of that, you get a wide spectrum of disease severities.”
Survey and study
The study involves clinical visits, where Gocuk will learn more about the eye health of female carriers of these X-linked retinal diseases.
Participants will receive genetic testing and counselling, undergo a comprehensive eye examination to assess their retinae, and also have the opportunity to continue in the study to monitor how their vision changes over time."	<urn:uuid:10ff4be0-4275-4b2e-832c-f7836c13208b>	0.0
Do cats with leptospirosis and liver disease both show increased thirst and urination?	"In one study, dogs were dosed daily for one year (52 weeks) without a report of a serious adverse event. Additionally, an investigation into Bravecto® by Snopes also put facts to the falsehoods, finding them UNPROVEN.
Effects of Bravecto® in Dogs and Cats
The flea and tick medication Bravecto® is a systemic antiparasitic drug given by mouth or topically. The medicine spreads through the bloodstream to all areas of the skin. It kills the flea or tick when it tries to bite and is then exposed to the active ingredient.
Bravecto® works by inhibiting the nervous system of insects. It does not have any effect on the nervous system of animals. In fact, it is excreted unchanged through the pet’s liver and kidneys. Since its introduction in 2014, Bravecto® has provided longer-lasting flea and tick protection and as of 2020 more than 125 million doses distributed in 85 countries.
The best most frequently reported adverse reaction in dogs in both the active control groups was vomiting. Other side effects occasionally seen in dogs include decreased appetite, diarrhea, lethargy, excessive thirst and flatulence. Bravecto® formulations are safe for pregnant, breeding and lactating dogs. Use with caution in dogs with a history of seizures or neurologic disorders.
For cats Bravecto® is available as a topical or an oral medication given every 2 months. Side effects in cats may include vomiting, itching, diarrhea, hair loss, decreased appetite, lethargy, and scabs/ulcerated lesions, increased liver enzymes, or hyper-salivation. It should be used with caution in cats with a history of neurologic disorders.
Bravecto® is a valuable antiparasite treatment that contributes to the health of millions of dogs and cats. By killing fleas, ticks and mites, it promotes dog health worldwide by protecting them against dangerous parasite infestations that are known to lead to disease transmission, blood loss, local irritation, and skin allergies. Flea, tick, and mite exposure poses a much more significant risk of transmitting a devastating disease to your pet or yourself."	<urn:uuid:2d131609-e2c6-4d73-a876-89c4f821a375>	0.0
How long did Yacov Sharir and Keith Saunders work in dance?	"Was Yosef absolving his brothers of all responsibility since it was all part of the Divine plan, or were the brothers responsible for their brutal behavior despite the fact that all worked out?
The Midrash (Tanchuma Vayigash Siman 5) sheds light on this dynamic. Immediately prior to Yosef’s revelation, the heated exchange between Yosef and his brothers becomes dangerously close to turning violent. Yosef understood that he must reveal his identity. “Yosef said to his brothers, ‘Did you not tell me that your brother died? In fact, I purchased him, and I will bring him out to you.’ At this point Yosef called out, ‘Yosef son of Yacov come to me, Yosef son of Yacov come to me and speak with your brothers who sold you.’ The brothers began scanning all corners of the room to catch a glimpse of their long-lost brother. Yosef turned and said to them, ‘Why do you look here and there? I am Yosef your brother.’ In that moment their souls left their bodies, and they were unable to answer him.”
Yosef was conflicted; on one hand he was overjoyed to see his brothers and feel a sense of belonging and familial security. On the other hand, Yosef realized that these were the very men who turned an indifferent ear to his cries; these were the men who were supposed to be his beloved protectors but instead became rage-filled antagonists. These were the men who were ready to murder their own flesh and blood. Perhaps, I cannot have a relationship with them. Perhaps, it is better to remain distant and repay them in kind so they can suffer as I did. And so, Yosef calls out, “Yosef the son of Yaakov come to me, Yosef the son of Yaakov come to me”. He is looking for his self, for his identity. Who should I be? What should I do? Should I seek revenge or reconciliation?
Yosef finds resolution with one simple phrase – I am Yosef your brother. I choose to be your brother and not an indifferent, vengeful tyrant. I make this choice not because you have earned it; I make this choice because it is best for me."	<urn:uuid:2bf34ce2-15f7-4ff2-88f7-aaa124446123>	0.0
classical music black composers outreach programs impact	"Over the 24 weeks of a Classical Conversations year, there are none so glorious as the 6 weeks spent delving into orchestra and great composers.

Handel’s Water Music was no problem, the soothing woodwinds are essentially easy listening, smooth jazz for the 1700’s. Next week I have the privilege of introducing Mozart, the crazy haired, youthful genius of the Classical Period. Who, incidentally is one of my absolute favorite composers. I could listen to his delightful, deceptively simple sounding piano concerto #22 on repeat for hours. However (insert dark foreboding theme music here), this week we are discussing Bach. Fugues and Preludes. Harpsichord Bach. I am not a fan. I know Bach is “the man”. Prolific as a composer and a father (20 kids!). Hard working and methodical in his ability to have every note in exactly the right place. He’s considered a scientist of music. My local classical radio station devotes the noon(ish) hour to him in a segment called “Bach’s Lunch”. That’s my kind of humor, but still…harpsichord? Ugh. It’s just awful.
It’s that time of year again! Time for Classical Conversations six weeks studying orchestra and great composers."	<urn:uuid:968a4e7c-8090-4b8f-9e24-4753c345fbf1>	0.0
what was average speed record breaking million franc delahaye compared to circuit du sud ouest speed record	"Last month the 2018 Honda Civic Type R set a new record in Belgium and now the hot hatch has done it again by setting a new record at the Silverstone GP circuit in the UK. The 2018 Civic Type R set a new front-wheel drive production car record, which was previously held by the 2016 Civic Type R.
For its latest record setting sprint, the Honda Civic Type R was piloted by British Touring Car Championship winner Matt Neal. According to Neal, “Where I found the real advantage of the Type R was really in the high-speed corners – the stability which is a combination of the aero and the new advanced suspension system. Into corners like Copse and Stowe at the end of the Hangar straight, you can carry big entry speed with supreme confidence.”
The latest record time at the Silverstone circuit is the fourth lap record for the new Honda Civic Type R. It all started in last April at the Nürburgring Nordschleife, where the Civic Type R set with a lap time of 7mins 43.8 seconds. Shortly after that WTCR driver, Esteban Guerrieri set a new record at the ‘Type R Challenge 2018’ with a 2 mins 1.51 seconds lap record for a front-wheel drive production car at the Magny-Cours GP circuit in France. Most recently Bertrand Baguette recorded a time of 2 minutes 53.72 seconds in the same car at Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium."	<urn:uuid:8435b90a-9418-46e5-b80c-b0a09cfb8209>	0.0

I've been reading about ancient religious clothing and was wondering what kind of precious stones were used in the first row of the breastplate that they made?	"Paula's monument was Jerome's life-work--his letters, his doctrinal treatises, his commentaries, but above all, his Latin version of the Hebrew Scriptures--the Vulgate. And what a unique monument it is!
All the Anglo-Saxon translations, not to speak of others, were made from it, as was also the English version of Wyklif, while its influence in Tyndale's and subsequent English versions was most profound. It was the first book to come from the press of Gutenberg, a copy of which Bible is the most prized volume in the world today. But a still more signal honor awaited it, for it was decreed by the Council of Trent, that ""the old and Vulgate edition,"" approved ""by the usage of so many ages,"" should be the only Latin version used in ""public lectures, disputations, sermons and expositions."" And so far-reaching has been its influence through the centuries that the religious terminology of the languages of Western Europe has in great part been derived from or colored by the Vulgate.
Nor is this all. As is well known, most of the modern languages of Europe have been formed under the influence of, and as the result of the fecundity of, the ancient Latin. But the Latin from which these languages have been fashioned was not the language of Cicero, or of Virgil, popular as he was during the Middle Ages, but the language of the Church and of the Bible--the language of the Vulgate--which was created by Jerome acting under the inspiration of Paula. It is the Vulgate, which was the first book of which the nascent languages of medieval times essayed a translation, the first book of which an attempt at translation was made in the French of the twelfth century, and in the German of the eighth century. It is the Vulgate, with its admirable narratives, with the fascinating simplicity of Genesis, with its charming pictures of the infancy of the human race that supplied the needed language in which to address the barbarians from the North, when they first came under the beneficent influence of Christian civilization.
Our fathers were wont to cover the Vulgate with gold and precious stones. And they did more."	<urn:uuid:dfabd2bb-7340-4b51-ba7f-6b713c2a2bc8>	0.0

I'm curious about the unique steam engines at Crofton - what makes them special compared to other historic machines?	"The Wisconsin Automotive Museum displays more than ninety collectible autos including such rarities as a Hudson Essex Terraplane, a Reo Flying Cloud, and a Pierce-Arrow. The collection also includes vintage American standards such as Pontiacs, Studebakers, Chevrolets and Fords, all arranged in the striking Art Deco interior of Wisconsin's largest auto museum. But the real stars of the museum are two Wisconsin-made automobiles: the Kissel, which was manufactured in Hartford from 1906 to 1931, and the Nash, which was built in Kenosha from 1916 to 1957. The museum also displays a collection of automobile signs and advertising art, as well as license plates, spark plugs and oil cans. A series of industrial and outboard engines built in Hartford from 1936-1992 is also exhibited, along with a huge operating layout of Lionel trains.
105 years in the making, the Harley-Davidson Museum opened its doors to the public in 2008.

What's the role of context in space design and DC's guidelines?	"Hopefully, we see that things are slowly changing; students and new practitioners study new guidelines and lookat new and different practices. For example, in order to offer a new set of guidelines, Pedro Olivera and Luiza Prado have published a “Cheat Sheet for a Non- (or Less-) Colonialist Speculative Design” as a starting point for decolonisation of the speculative design. James Auger and Julian Hanna in “Crap Futures” blog document their work on the positive paths, seeking to produce tangible societal outcomes. Franciso Laranjo in his “Modes of Criticism” magazine, among other stories, constantly publishes comprehensive discursive and critical texts on the speculative and critical practice. We also witness activitiesat the School of Design at the Carnegie Mellon University to re-stage “Feral Experimental and New Design Thinking” exhibition as a part of the “Climactic: Post Normal Design” event by adding works from South Asia, East Asia and Africa.
Moreover, recent Speculative and Critical Design Summer School at the London College of Communication (led by Ben Stopher and Tobias Revell) approached the practice from the broad perspective “with the criticisms that were discussed in the context of the future of practice in a wider design context than academia”. In practice we also find approaches that can be taken as positive examples of the new speculative views. For example, Demitrios Kargotis’ and Dash Macdonald’s (DashnDem) work focuses on critical citizenship education and participation. They are working directly in the public realm. Our practice at the Arts Academy in Split tackles dystopian scenarios in line with the Mediterranean approach (“from the edge of Europe”, removed from the European urban and technology centres) and challenges them from a humanist perspective.
The above-mentioned examples from the discursive, educational and practical context bring hope that the critique in this field will become more precise and, as David Benque states, will “start dissecting why a specific approach, or project is, or is not successful in its context”.
James Auger (JA) is one of the pioneers of speculative design practice. He is a former member of the legendary Design Interactions department at the Royal College of Art. James is now a researcher at the Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute and also co-founder of the Crap Futures blog, which questions contemporary design practice."	<urn:uuid:6e3a5e64-e591-4e48-89d3-ec34fdf9857e>	0.0

What specific measures has Beneteau implemented to reduce their environmental impact in their industrial operations?	"Return/Recall Service Support
A product recall or return is normally a high stress and time sensitive events but that does not mean that sustainability and environmental considerations should not apply. Our specific suite of services enhance the sustainability of each step in the recall process with a focus on conserving energy and achieving measureable, net-positive sustainable results at reasonable costs. From transportation to disassembly, segregation, storage, recycling/destruction, and disposal, customers receive guidance on how to most efficiently and effectively minimize their environmental impact and meet sustainability goals.
Stericycle will manage through the urgent, critical nature or recall event to ensure no environmental penalties for any number of regulatory violations will result. These penalties can have more than just an immediate financial impact—they can also dramatically interrupt business operations or impact brand image. Our experience and unmatched knowledge of environmental regulations and regulatory agencies ensures our clients avoid costly fines.
Minimizing Our Footprint
Beyond the services we provide our customers, we recognize the importance of minimizing the direct impact our own operations have on the environment and communities. While, by law, a small portion of the medical wastes we handle must be incinerated, we are constantly looking for ways to reduce the impact of this disposal method or seek opportunities for electric cogeneration when incineration is used.
To reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions, Stericycle leverages sophisticated transportation logistics and telemetry technology. The impact of such technology in Canada and the U.S. has resulted in a significant reduction in the total number of miles driven. In 2014, our fleet traveled 2.5 million fewer miles in Canada and the United States.

How do blazar plasma jets accelerate particles, and what technology detects them at the South Pole?	"Dawn of Plasma Age
In recent years, there has been a virtual eruption of plasma applications. It seems safe to say that here at the beginning of the 21st century, we are also at the dawn of plasma age.
Plasma has a number of characteristics which make it useful. Because of its exceedingly high temperatures - 10,000 to 20,000°C - we may use plasma technology to separate out various gases and liquids which are harmful to humans and the environment.
This ability has proved beneficial in the production of optical fibre, an essential new material in modern communications. Optical fibre is produced from refined quartz. Japan, for example, imports this quartz from Brazil. In the refining process there, charcoal is used and carbon monoxide, a deadly poison gas, is a by-product. Hot plasmas, however, can dissipate the carbon monoxide and thus reduce the hazards to those working in or living close to the quartz refineries.
The ability of plasma to form new coatings is another very useful property. While the plasma temperature must be high, it is not necessary that the matter to be modified need to be the same temperature - this in contrast to the ordinary chemical processes. In this way, a thin metal coating can be applied to the surface of a plastic lens, say, without melting the plastic. When plasma particles and other gaseous particles come together on the surface of solid materials, many useful reactions occur.
Since the plasma particles (atoms, molecules, charged ions) are pure energy, they stick on a number of surfaces - metal, ceramics, plastic, glass, fabric, wood. The plasma particles actually penetrate the atoms of the solid target, forming a very strong and hard surface. Some of the typical uses here are for drills and other cutting tools, anticorrosion piping (oil, artificial blood tubes), anti-friction coating, anti-rusting, or even the application of gilt to decorative jewellery items.
Lessen Air Conditioning
Plasma technology makes a major contribution to energy conservation through its ability to coat window glass and thereby reduce infra-red rays. Air conditioning is a major consumer of electricity in hot climates and during summertimes. Infrared rays normally pass through glass windows and help to warm a room. By using plasma technology to coat windows, infra-red warming can be cut, thus reducing air conditioning needs.
It has been found that the cost of such plasma coating is more than justified by the reduction in electricity costs."	<urn:uuid:1d21ac6b-5951-48f5-9f95-92323edb00cd>	0.0
How much more expensive are investment fees in other countries compared to the United States for regular mutual funds?	"Investors may think twice before hopping from fund to fund or chasing the latest hot performance because they have a real incentive to stick around and ensure long-term treatment of their gains. As it is, investors often have no built-up gain and thus no frictional costs for hopping from fund to fund.
2. Create parity between mutual funds and other investment vehicles.
Mutual funds offer investors diversification and professional management, and many come with a reasonable price tag. Yet, stocks, exchange-traded funds, and separately managed accounts have a leg up in attracting investors because they are inherently friendlier from a tax standpoint. With stocks, investors pay gains based on when they transact and thus can control their own destiny with their buy and sell decisions. The ETF structure allows management to scrub the portfolio of capital gains using inflows or redemptions, thus avoiding capital gains in all but the rarest cases. All of these vehicles are means to an investing end, and there's no good reason why mutual funds--one of the more shareholder-friendly and widely owned investment types--should sit at such a disadvantage in this regard.
In fact, the United States would not be alone if it made this change. Most countries tax their mutual fund equivalents just as they do other investments, or they don't tax them at all, thus encouraging investing."	<urn:uuid:26869e60-5b32-48d4-8137-c472fc16dcd6>	0.0

explain double triple bond electron sharing	"Calcium carbonate (CaCO3), primarily, is an ionic compound having the bivalent calcium and carbonate ions. However the carbonate anion is a polyatomic species. The carbon atom is bonded to all of the three oxygen atoms by covalent bonds – two carbon-oxygen single bonds and one carbon-oxygen double bond.
What kind of bond is co2?
Be aware that carbon dioxide has two covalent bonds between every oxygen atom and the carbon atom, which is proven right here as two strains and known as a double bond. When molecules are symmetrical, nevertheless, the atoms pull equally on the electrons and the cost distribution is uniform.
Is bacl2 an ionic compound?
Rationalization: Barium chloride is an ionic compound composed of 1 barium cation and two chlorine anions. On this case, chlorine will need to have a −1 oxidation state on account of its excessive electronegativity. There are two chlorine atoms, so the overall oxidation state might be −1⋅2=−2 .
What’s an ionic bond give an instance?
The definition of ionic bond is when a positively charged ion types a bond with a negatively charged ions and one atom transfers electrons to a different. An instance of an ionic bond is the chemical compound Sodium Chloride.
How an ionic bond is fashioned?
Ionic bond, additionally referred to as electrovalent bond, kind of linkage fashioned from the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions in a chemical compound. Such a bond types when the valence (outermost) electrons of 1 atom are transferred completely to a different atom.
What produces an ionic bond?
An ionic bond is fashioned by the entire switch of some electrons from one atom to a different. The atom dropping a number of electrons turns into a cation—a positively charged ion. The atom gaining a number of electron turns into an anion—a negatively charged ion.
How do ionic bonds work steps?
Ionic bonding is the entire switch of valence electron(s) between atoms. It’s a kind of chemical bond that generates two oppositely charged ions. In ionic bonds, the metallic loses electrons to grow to be a positively charged cation, whereas the nonmetal accepts these electrons to grow to be a negatively charged anion.
When ionic bond is fashioned?

How many protons are needed to make one ATP?	"Protons Are What Make Elements Distinct
All matter, including mineral crystals, is made up of atoms. All atoms are made up of three main particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons have a positive charge, neutrons have no charge, and electrons have a negative charge. Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, but electrons have a mass that is 10,000 times smaller.
The element hydrogen (H) has the simplest atoms. Most hydrogen atoms have just one proton and one electron. The proton forms the nucleus (the centre of the atom), while the electron orbits around it (Figure 5.5, left). All other elements have more than one proton in their nucleus. Protons repel each other because they are positively charged, but it is possible to have more than one proton in a nucleus because neutrons hold them together. The next most complex atom, helium (He) has two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus, in its most common form. Some atoms of the same element can have different numbers of neutrons. For example, forms of hydrogen exist with one and two neutrons, and a tiny fraction of He atoms have only one neutron. Forms of an element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.
The number of protons in an atom determines what element it will be, so the number of protons is called the atomic number of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is the mass number. The mass number distinguishes between isotopes of an element. Isotopes of an element are denoted by putting the mass number as a subscript in front of the symbol for that element. For example, the isotopes of hydrogen are 1H (1 proton), 2H (1 proton + 1 neutron), and 3H (1 proton + 2 neutrons).
For most of the 16 lightest elements (up to oxygen) the number of neutrons is equal to the number of protons. For most of the remaining elements, there are more neutrons than protons. This is because the more protons that are concentrated in a small space, the more neutrons are needed to keep the nucleus together. The most common isotope of uranium (U), for example, is 238U."	<urn:uuid:89ea6050-9047-4a6b-a97c-59b612addd4c>	0.0
As a maritime archaeologist studying recovery techniques through history, I'm curious how the excavation approaches differed between the Antikythera wreck and the Mary Rose - what can we learn about the artifacts and human remains recovered from each?	"Water may seem the most ordinary of substances – it pours from our taps and falls from the sky – but you would be surprised at what a profoundly strange substance it is. It bends the rules of chemistry and defies easy scientific understanding. Without this rebel behaviour, however, none of us would exist. Alok Jha will change the way you look at water – showing how it has shaped life on earth, and how this molecule connects you and everyone else to the birth (and death) of the universe.
Alok Jha is the science correspondent at ITN, working on news and current affairs for ITV. Before that, he was at the Guardian for more a decade, where he wrote news, features, comment and presented the award-winning Science Weekly podcast. He has also reported live from Antarctica and written and presented several TV and radio programmes for the BBC.
Martijn Manders is a maritime and underwater archaeologist and head of the Maritime Programme at the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands (RCE). The projects within this programme deal with Dutch maritime heritage overseas and shared cultural heritage. One of the main projects at this moment is the research and excavation of the East Indiaman (VOC) ship the Rooswijk, off the coast of England.
His research interests also include underwater cultural heritage management on a global scale, specifically on in situ preservation, sedimentation erosion processes and monitoring. The latter is strongly connected with geophysical research, a very important discipline for maritime archaeologists because it enables them to explore, monitor and manage underwater heritage sites. Within Europe Martijn has initiated and worked on several innovative EU projects to develop new methods and techniques for geophysical and underwater research. The results contribute to making the Netherlands one of the leading countries in managing maritime heritage and conducting high quality maritime archaeology research on a professional level.
As a maritime heritage expert Martijn has travelled all over the world to cooperate with many countries managing cultural heritage underwater. He also works for Leiden University where he teaches maritime archaeology at masters level, and he trains young professionals worldwide, mostly in cooperation with organizations like UNESCO and ICOMOS/ICUCH.
Martijn has a special interest in emphasizing the social and cultural importance of studying maritime heritage as a source to learn more about our past:

What are proper hay sampling methods and nutrient components?	"Very simply, vegetation structure refers to the three-dimensional arrangement of plants and plant materials on a site or across a landscape. Vegetation structure is primarily influenced by plant cover on horizontal and vertical planes.
10. Biomass and Production
This module focuses on plant biomass: what it is, how it is measured, and how biomass data are used by land managers to inform resource management decisions.
This module focuses on plant utilization: what it is, how it is measured, and how utilization data are used by land managers to inform resource management decisions.
12. Composition, Diversity, Similarity
This module focuses on plant community diversity: how it is described, how it is measured, and how diversity is interpreted by land managers to inform management decisions.
13. Remote Sensing for Vegetation Monitoring and Assessment
Remote sensing techniques offer many opportunities to inform, supplement, and sometimes replace traditional field-based aproaches to vegetation assessment and monitoring. This module explores ways in which remote sensing can be used in monitoring and provides example applications.
14. Assessment and Monitoring Programs
This module explores some established rangeland assessment and monitoring programs, describes their protocols, and discusses how the collected data are used in management decision making.
3.1 Elements of Sampling Design
To add captions to this video click the CC icon on the bottom right side of the YouTube panel and select English: Corrected captions.
What is sampling design? Simply put, sampling design is what, where, how, and when we measure in order to meet our sampling objectives. The essential elements of a sampling design are:
- Population or area of interest
- Attribute measured
- Measurement methods
- Type of sampling unit
- Sampling unit dimensions
- How sampling units are positioned in the area of interest
- Number of sampling units (sample size, n)
- Sub-sampling intensity
Sampling designs incorporate the detailed, practical components of a sampling plan. Sampling designs are case-specific, and are driven by both resource management objectives and sampling objectives. There is no special combination of the “right” quadrat shape, number of sampling units, or measurement method to measure vegetation attributes; rather, the sampling design must be tailored to the nature of the information needed and how it will be used.
Population or Area of Interest
Our sampling may focus on a population if we need to learn more about a species of concern, or we may focus on an area of land or habitat that we are managing."	<urn:uuid:d389a970-2a2f-47bf-8abc-597bce15a863>	0.0
eagle scout project approval steps needed	"On Sunday, Aug. 12, Troop 50 bestowed the Boy Scouts of America’s highest rank during a ceremony honoring new Eagle Scout Nicholas Emil “Nick” van Zuk. He is the son of Rose-Marie Zuk and the late Dr. Gary Zuk of Auburn. At the time of his Eagle Scout Board of Review, Nick was the troop’s youngest Eagle Scout and its 15th since its founding in 2012.
Nick’s ceremony, held at Monarch Estates senior living and retirement community — the site of his Eagle Scout Leadership Service Project — included many of his fellow Scouts and adult leaders who have been in Scouting with him since his days as a Cub Scout, and who have served with him in a variety of troop leadership positions. It also included his pastor, Rev. Msgr. William Skoneki of St. Michael’s Catholic Church, who offered the invocation.
After accepting the “Eagle Scout Charge” from Scoutmaster Andrew Baird, Nick’s mother, Rose, the Eagle Scout medal on Nick and presented him with an Eagle Scout neckerchief slide. He in turn presented his mother with an Eagle Scout mother’s pin. Mr. Baird presented Nick with a framed Eagle Scout medal, noting that Nick was the first Eagle Scout in the troop to have enough merit badges at the time of his Eagle Scout Board of Review to receive all three Eagle Scout palms. Concluding the troop’s recognition was Chartered Organization Representative Michael Tullier, who acknowledged the troop’s gift of membership in the National Eagle Scout Association.
Also on hand for the ceremony was Ron Anders, Ward 2 councilman and mayor pro tem for the City of Auburn. On behalf of the city and Mayor Bill Ham, Mr. Anders congratulated Nick on his achievement and his example of leadership. In recognition of those achievements, Mr. Anders presented Nick with a proclamation declaring Aug. 12, 2018, as “Nicholas Emil van Zuk Eagle Scout Day.”
|Nick honors the contributions of Mark Hankess, one of five individuals he presented with Eagle Scout mentor pins.|
During Nick’s closing remarks, he acknowledged his fellow Scouts and the adult leaders who had supported his efforts to earn the Eagle Scout rank. As is customary, he singled out individuals who played a special role, presenting each with an Eagle Scout mentor pin."	<urn:uuid:6115c116-784b-4391-b5ba-28cbe891cd0d>	0.0

How do ThingSpeak and Azure Event Hubs differ in their capabilities for handling real-time data streaming from IoT devices?	"It is important for Mobile Developers to build their apps in easy and fast way to follow the demand. Choosing the right cloud hosting can be the best way to start building the mobile application.
Tizen is an OS (operating system) based on the Linux kernel and the GNU C Library implementing the Linux API. Tizen OS works on a wide range of devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, Blu-ray players, printers, tablets, in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) devices, smart cameras, smart TVs, PCs, and smart home appliances.
The devices that are able to work with Tizen mostly are devices that we can see daily. This makes Tizen is competitive enough following their competitors such as Android and iOS and becomes “eye catch” for developers to build in Tizen Mobile Backend as a Service.
With various implementation of Internet of Things, IoT developers are competing to build their own IoT Devices. With a huge market, there are more and more devices launched each year. How developers compete with other developers are by using IoT Platform to make their development process faster.
It is because IoT Platform provides various features such as:
Real Time Storage Data – Internet of Things technology needs integration with data storage (Cloud Storage), where data storage from sensor or data from other devices need a real time data storage. It is because IoT’s main focus is data streaming.
IoT Protocol Connection – Protocol Internet of Things from every device might be different. This makes developer must do many changes and data conversions.
Data Processing – Internet of Things is focused on faster data processing to make a real time data insight.
Analytic’s – Statistic processing and data management by various data connections and hardwares have to make a result about accurate data analytic.
These basic features in IoT Platform can be useful for developers to connect and manage the device. With the features, developers also able to manage their user and checking the device performance."	<urn:uuid:585e0df7-6009-4514-842c-2838966bdc38>	0.0

As someone interested in education reform, I'd like to know how modern schools evaluate student progress beyond traditional grades and test scores. What different assessment methods are being used?	"3 Important Lessons We’re Learning from Teacher Evaluations
Although many reforms have been made in teacher evaluations, including those under President Obama’s Every Student Succeeds Act, many critics are not yet satisfied with the results. They’re asking for more complex solutions that go beyond classroom observations, student test scores and other recent proposals. Some are even suing state officials over teacher reforms.
It’s obvious we still have a long way to go before a consensus is reached. But lessons have been learned along the way. Many education experts agree the following steps are essential items to be considered when creating a fair and comprehensive teacher evaluation system.
Determine and address the cause of so many teachers getting high ratings.
Even though the past’s high teacher ratings were the initial cause for implementing new teacher evaluation systems, research performed by Matt Kraft of Brown University and Allison Gilmour of Vanderbilt University, shows that the new processes in place for evaluating teachers still rate a majority of teachers as effective.
So why are principals giving teachers these high ratings? Kraft and Gilmour’s study shows that principals have many worries when considering giving teachers a low rating. These include finding good teachers to take the place of less effective teachers, concern over a teacher’s morale after receiving a low rating, and the difficulty involved in the process of dismissing a teacher. It seems that the easiest way to resolve this issue, would be allowing principals to have more of a voice in the creation of new teacher evaluation systems.
Don’t evaluate every teacher in every grade and every subject based on test scores.
There are many issues in the method of using test scores to evaluate teachers. One of the consequences is the creation of new tests for classes other than reading and math, and for grades other than third through eighth. Some schools are giving teacher evaluations based on the school averages or courses the teachers didn’t participate in. There must be a credible test to evaluate teachers based on test scores. This test must thoroughly assess a teacher’s influence on student growth.
Create a system that encourages teachers’ professional growth.
A report by New America states that, “For the most part, states have prioritized getting evaluation systems up and running and are only beginning to think about using them to promote ongoing teacher learning and growth.”
If a teacher isn’t performing up to or above expectations, and even if they are, states should have a system in place that encourages continued education and progress."	<urn:uuid:778b07e6-66ed-4bf5-86bf-0adeac09e967>	0.0
How did John Cassavetes and Andrei Tarkovsky approach working with studios?	"Which photographers do you admire ? Walker Evans , Lewis Hine . Raymond Meeks, Josef Sudek.

test validity experimental studies mental powers	"She was afraid that a failed virginity test would result in loss of honor and social condemnation. The examinee stated, “I wanted to do [the examination]. I wanted to know if I lost my honor. I paid to learn that I lost my honor” . In another study of South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal province by Leclerc-Madlala, those who failed a virginity test were subject to name-calling and social exclusion . One respondent referred to a girl who failed as a ""rotten potato"" who must be kept away from the ‘virgin girls’ because she will surely “spoil the bunch.” Another respondent noted that being in close proximity to a girl who failed the test would, “cause the flowers of the nation to wilt” .
Quality of the eight studies reporting on the impact of virginity testing on examinee was assessed according to USPSTF guidelines and is reported in Table 2. All eight studies were level III evidence [4, 6, 14, 30, 32–35]. The internal validity of the studies reporting on impact on examinee ranged from fair to poor. Four studies had fair internal validity [6, 14, 30, 34] and four had poor internal validity [4, 32, 33, 35].
The present review assessed 17 published studies on virginity testing, in particular its medical relevance and impact on the examinee.
The utility of hymen examination as a test for virginity was reviewed [22–31]. The studies indicated, as has been described in previous reviews, that the inspection of the hymen cannot give conclusive evidence of vaginal penetration or any other sexual history [36, 37]. Normal hymen examination findings are likely to occur in those with and without a history of vaginal penetration [22–30]. A hymen exam with abnormal findings is also inconclusive: abnormal hymenal features such a hymenal transection, laceration, enlarged opening, or scars are found in females with and without a history of sexual intercourse [22–30].
One hymenal feature commonly examined in virginity testing is hymenal opening size. Hymenal opening size also was found to be an unreliable test for vaginal penetration [25–27]."	<urn:uuid:d28a9116-3167-4f47-b108-dc9de1e41e48>	0.0
what material piano soundboard made of and how it works	"PIANO: Yamaha, G3, 6’0” Professional Grand & Bench, serial #85865
Finish: Ebony Polish Finish
Description: Yamaha Pianos, made in Japan, are very well designed instruments and are internationally recognized as world class pianos of exceptional value. This model was made for the professional market as a high quality performance instrument. Designed to be a sweeter elegant sounding model, this piano was built in the Hamamatsu factory in 1969. Bought from a bankrupt dealer in Oregon, this piano was part of his unused rental inventory. It has been completely rebuilt and refinished with factory hammers and parts, new strings, new pinblock and original soundboard and bridges. This piano appears to have been hardly used. It has a uniquely warm tone and very even touch and sound. We only had to regulate the action and voice the hammers as it needed little else. The piano is built better than its newer Yamaha cousins due to a less brighter and more traditional European sound than the newer Yamaha Grands. This is a unique find in a fine piano that is like brand new at less than half the price of a new one!"	<urn:uuid:04f2820c-0928-4078-a74d-acdc76009c8d>	0.0
I'm a workshop owner and I've been thinking about getting a band saw. What features make it good for different types of cuts, and what safety measures should I keep in mind to prevent injuries?	"Increasing Student Interaction in Class
I have just prepared next Tuesday's workshop on 'Increasing Student Interaction in Class'. It is the first time this one has been offered and I'm pretty enthusiastic about the topic. So far there are 8 people enrolled, which will just about be enough for me to take the approach which I think is crucial: this workshop, of all workshops, cannot be a pure and simple powerpoint presentation where participants sit and listen! I have to model, so far as I can, what I want to communicate. So I have worked out what I hope will be an hour's session that is almost entirely interactive, and at the times when it isn't, this too has a specific reason and point to convey. The biggest challenge for me, and probably the biggest novelty for the participants, will be the use of clickers, but I'm excited about trying these out for myself. I have to admit my participants will be my guinea pigs, but I've had a good introduction to clickers from Hannah in the Teaching Grid and this context is absolutely perfect for trying them out in safety. I trust that those attending will not eat me alive or the workshop slide into chaos and bedlum! I've done some reading to back up my thinking about the benefits of student interaction in class, although this is fairly familiar territory for me, and I have also spent some time finding and watching a variety of vodcasts on YouTube, especially about the use of clickers in class. Somewhat frustratingly, I haven't actually found a vodcast which actually models good practice in the use of clickers. Most do exactly what I've been at pains to avoid in my session: lots of talk about the benefits, lots of 'presentations', but lamentably little which demonstrates a full-length class where they are integral to the session and where the lecturer models excellent practice. Maybe there's a niche here...
Are there likely to be any other challenges that I have to cope with? Yes, if the clickers don't work, or if I haven't got a sufficiently good grasp of how they are used. I'm always a bit nervous when it's a first time using something, but I have done my prep and the TG staff will be around to help out if need be. I shall go to the Grid at least an hour early to make sure all is in order."	<urn:uuid:9860c4ac-3a4c-4230-bd96-9b9b4d895a65>	0.0
I've noticed my sprouts sometimes ferment when I'm rinsing them - what's the proper rinsing technique to prevent fermentation during the sprouting process?	"Coconut Water Kefir
This is a popular variation on water kefir made with coconut water. Fresh coconut water is best if you can get it. Pasteurized bottled coconut water works fine too.
Updated: Mon, 05/13/2019 - 8:51pm
- 4 cups of coconut water
- 1 Tablespoon of water kefir grains
- Fruit (optional). Blueberries, mango, lilikoi, pineapple and guava work well.
- Sterilize a quart-sized glass jar and it's lid. Wash you hands, utensils and work space well.
- Rinse the kefir grains in non-chlorinated water and add them to the jar. Cover with coconut water.
- Set on the counter, in a dark place, with the lid loose. Leave for twelve hours.
- Check for fermentation. It should taste yogurty, not sweet and have a slight fizziness. If it is still sweet, or tastes like “weird coconut water” leave it out for another 12 hours, then test it again.
- Once it is fermented to your liking strain out the grains. Be careful to keep them clean and not touch them. They like to be handled with wood, plastic, ceramics or glass - not metal.
- The kefir is ready to drink. If you want to store the kefir, add some fruit to the liquid, then tighten the lid of your bottle or jar and refrigerate. The kefir will ferment more slowly in the refrigerator and get more fizzy. The fruit will supply it with some sugar to eat while it is fermenting.
- Store the grains in fresh water and sugar in a jar in the fridge, rinsing and changing them every week. Or use them ferment another batch of kefir, starting again at Step 1.
- Making coconut kefir is said to be hard on water kefir grains. It is recommended to set some of the grains aside, storing them in sugar water, to keep them strong and healthy for later use."	<urn:uuid:905004b1-3946-4df7-b084-d267e9d39031>	0.0

"I think the best thing parents can do is just prepare in any way they know how, have the baby showers, go to the doctors appointments and birth classes, learn everything they need to know and then the rest is just on-the-job training. Being “ready” is this concept that society tries to impress upon you to make you buy things, take even more classes, read more books, and still at the end of all of it, there’s no guarantee that you won’t mess up a few times. I take comfort in the fact that I have been fortunate enough to spend time with lots of different little ones at a variety of ages and feel pretty comfortable with the idea of having a child of my own. The rest will just happen, and I’m sure we will be more than capable of rolling with the punches and learning together as we go.
Super fun additions to this pregnancy, this week, have been acid reflux, combined with amazingly strong heartburn, probably from baby wiggling all over that stomach and making the acids take a road trip. I feel so bad for Holly, because at this point the pregnancy symptoms aren’t nearly as fun as they have been, and she’s so uncomfortable all the time, it just sucks. Luckily, that 7 week countdown is ever present in both our minds as we barrel toward our due date with wide, terrified eyes and excited hearts.
If you aren’t attending our shower, I will be doing a recap next week (or possibly Sunday) of all the antics and fun. We wish we could celebrate with everyone, but we know that distance and time make it hard for everyone we love to be there. However, we know you, like us, love our little one already and we’re excited for you to meet her in a few short weeks."	<urn:uuid:6d8d353f-fc85-4042-b956-168d5d50f804>	0.0
I'm curious about how companies measure if they have a good workplace environment - what are some concrete ways they track this?	"Do you recognize yourself in the quote above? Some people admit to it, most people don’t.
It’s easy to keep reading and keep going to seminars and courses, in an effort to understand what to do in the future. If we could only get the hang of this digitalization thingy, we’d know how to change. I get to meet lots of people in the midst of those efforts, but we have no doubt reached a tipping point from ”what should we do” to ”how do we do that”. It is of course not evenly distributed yet, but the macro shift is indisputable.
This means the world now knows a whole lot more about what can be done and what’s possible. We’re familiar with a few “best practices” and cases of successful digital transformation. Now all that remains is to do it. Our Head of Digital has been here a while, maybe even a head of digital innovation. Question is – how do we do something differently in your organization? Not daily operations. Something different. How do you do new things? Here’s the new frustration, bigger than ever. But it’s the right one.
In a pre-workshop interview recently, I read this: ”I will be very impressed if I can walk away with concrete tools for changing things, or actually doing something different.”
This is why Co:LabX – where I spend most of my time since mid 2015 – is about helping companies practice doing things differently. We are an innovation partner and we design innovation processes, but what we really do is help companies practice doing new things, and with new people. The key to really start working on the future is to become more curious, and you become curious simply by doing.
We paint future scenarios, we apply lateral ideation methods to produce vast amounts of ideas and we produce prototypes to test in quick ways. But the most important thing is to foster new ways of collaborating in organizations. New types of personal relationships. That takes creativity. And like another workshop participant said: ”…but then it feels like we all have to be change change agents nowadays”. That’s exactly it, isn’t it?
I’ve experienced it, you’ve experienced it. Everyone has. To some extent, we know what’s not working for us, but often we don’t act on it."	<urn:uuid:817a4cb8-9d8b-4ee3-856b-44f2d61d6d9e>	0.0

Citation: Snyder, K.A., James, J.J., Richards, J.H., Donovan, L.A. 2008. Does hydraulic lift or nighttime transpiration facilitate nitrogen acquistion?. Plant and Soil Journal. 306:159-166. Interpretive Summary: This study investigates whether hydraulic lift by plants increases a plant's ability to capture nitrogen from the soil. We used greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus) in Mono Lake, CA for this study. Hydraulic redistribution is the observed phenomenon where, at night when plant stomata are less open, plants passively redistribution water through their root system in response to differences in soil water availability near the plant's root zone, which become the driving gradient for water movement. Hydraulic lift is the specific case where water from deep wetter layers is redistributed to shallow soil layers. Since the bulk of soil nutrients are concentrated near the soil surface, it has been proposed that this behavior may facilitate nutrient uptake. We found no evidence to support this hypothesis for nitrogen uptake. The range of hydraulic lift we studied had no effect on nitrogen uptake. However, we did find that plants that transpired at night, relative to plants where we artificially suppressed nighttime transpiration had increased nitrogen uptake. Indicated that nighttime transpiration my facilitate nitrogen capture.
Technical Abstract: It has been proposed that plant species that hydraulically lift water to dry shallow soil layers should have improved nutrient relations. Yet, this idea has not been adequately tested. We choose ten Sarcobatus vermiculatus plants with different magnitudes of hydraulic lift to examine the hypothesis that the magnitude of lift will be positively related to the amount of nitrogen (N) uptake. A 15N tracer was injected in the 20-30 cm soil layer to determine plant 15N capture by shallow roots that exhibited hydraulic lift. Half of the plants were also placed in large humidified tents (i.e. “bagged”) to suppress nighttime transpiration in an effort to increase hydraulic lift."	<urn:uuid:a0327381-c69c-4c48-ac53-60ca3509edab>	0.0

Analysis and Evaluation of Moises Silva's ""A Case for Calvinistic Hermeneutics"" Hermeneutics defines the discipline and subject of completely deriving theories, principles and other methods that are used in day to day interpretation of texts. This is specially used to make a better and easier understanding of texts and information that is written in a complex manner…
There is a need to replace the complex ancient words with evolving words that are understood in the current context, especially with the readers. Traditional hermeneutics have focused on ensuring the ancient texts are traditionally interpreted to derive reasonable meaning according to the scriptures.1 This is an incident where many people encompass their knowledge in deriving meanings to texts that were written by ancient writers during the time of the events. In essence, the concentration on such interpretation is to derive the primary meaning of the historical scriptures, without distorting the meaning of the stated expressions. Therefore, skills and knowledge must be utterly used to make a possible meaning out of the scriptures, without relaying discordant information. According to Moises, the Calvinistic hermeneutics is an expression of the interpretation from the Calvinists. The Calvinists have their interpretation in accordance to the intended message from the historical writers, which is acceptable and understood. The Calvinists have their own theories, principles and methods that are entirely used in expressing their interpretation of the scriptures. ...

What makes leather production better for the environment in developed countries?	"The choice of an investment location by a multinational enterprise (MNE) is determined not only by firm‐specific variables that define the motive of foreign direct investment (FDI), but is also determined by variables that define locational aspects. The purpose of this paper is to report on the study of the constituents of production and logistics environment of a host country and its effect on FDI decisions of MNEs. The concept is introduced of supply chain capability (SCC) of countries, a long‐run variable based on the production and logistics environment, as shaping the FDI of MNEs.
The research uses regression analyses on secondary data to test the research hypotheses.
The analysis substantiates the basic proposition of SCC of a country being a determinant of FDI, and that its effect varies with the size of the host country's economy. Further, the study suggests a differential impact of SCC on developing and developed countries. The study also confirms that SCC is a determinant of vertical and export‐platform FDI but not of horizontal FDI.
The study has limitations, in that the unit of analysis is a country. Countries, however, are not homogeneous in their SCC. Thus, regional differences or sectoral differences have not been taken into account.
By providing a holistic view, SCC helps MNEs in taking a more integrated view of a location's attractiveness. The study also has relevance and prescriptive value, especially for small developing countries which are seeking to improve their attractiveness as a FDI destination.

As someone interested in ocean conservation, I'd like to know what's the difference between how marine protected areas help with scientific research in the Philippines versus Australia?	"New data could help inform conservation policies
By Summit Voice
SUMMIT COUNTY — University of British Columbia researchers say they’ve identified key areas where fishing pressure — driven by the lure of profits — outweighs the appetite for conservation.
The fisheries scientists combined economic data and fisheries population growth rates to develop a conservation risk index that shows the economic-conservation trade-offs of fishing.
The most at-risk areas include the northeastern coast of Canada, the Pacific coast of Mexico, the Peruvian coast, the south Pacific (offshore of New Zealand in particular), the southern and southeastern coast of Africa, and the Antarctic region.
According the study results, these areas are the most biologically and economically vulnerable to overfishing.
“This index gives us a clear guide to determine the appropriate conservation and fisheries management policy for each region,” said William Cheung, an assistant professor in UBC’s Fisheries Centre, who presented his research during a press briefing at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Vancouver, Canada.
“The most vulnerable area may need to be protected with special management approaches – such as marine protected areas, while others may benefit from economic incentives to better manage the ecosystems – such as territorial use rights in fisheries, or TURFs,” saidRashid Sumaila, professor and director of the UBC Fisheries Centre.
The index can also help conservation managers use scarce resources in a targeted, efficient and effective way to ensure the conservation of seafood and marine ecosystems, Sumaila adds.
“Fishing has a major impact on marine biodiversity, causing the depletion of many species,” said Cheung, who grew up in Hong Kong and focused his earlier research on fisheries in the South China Sea — one of the most over-exploited areas in the world’s oceans.
“I witnessed how overfishing can damage marine ecosystems and the goods and services they provide — but in order to solve the problem, we need an understanding of both biology and economics. Biology determines whether a stock is more vulnerable to fishing, while economics determines how strong the incentive is to overfish the stock now.”
The conservation risk index is based on two numbers: the discount rate and intrinsic population growth rate for fisheries. The discount rate for the fisheries is how much a dollar of fish would be worth now if one were to get this dollar one year later – similar to the long-term lending interest rate of central banks. The intrinsic population growth rate is the difference between the birth and death rate."	<urn:uuid:80a6bafb-fdfb-47a9-a344-106f9f56e362>	0.0

fungal sinusitis diagnosis immune deficiency causes	"Stray and feral cats often present with small patches or entire areas of missing fur. There are quite a few possible causes, including ringworm (a curable fungal infection), flea dermatitis (an allergy to fleas), or a healed-over injury such as a wound or burn. The only way to diagnosis the problem is to visit a veterinarian, but here is some basic information on common causes:
Ringworm typically presents as a small, circular or oval patch of missing fur. The skin beneath may be scaly or scabby. It is especially common on cats’ ears, face, and legs but can appear anywhere on the body. Ringworm spores can spread to other animals and humans, and it can be annoying to treat, but it is not serious except in severe cases when an animal’s immune system is compromised. Ringworm is usually diagnosed with a fungal culture. The vet will scrape the area and pluck a few hairs from the animal, place it in the culture, and wait for it to develop, which can take several weeks. In humans, ringworm clears up in a few days with use of over-the-counter anti-fungal cream. In pets with fur, it can take longer to go away. Depending on the severity of the fungal infection and the cat’s immune response, ringworm could away on its own or it might require veterinary treatment. We have had success in eradicating minor ringworm infections in foster cats using a prescription anti-fungal topical lotion applied once per week. Some cats may require stronger medicated baths or oral medications.
Flea dermatitis (allergic reaction to fleas) often affects larger areas of the cat’s body, giving the cat a patchy, scraggly appearance. The fur may be thin or missing along the back, sides, or stomach. A few minutes with a flea comb can tell you if your stray cat has a flea infestation. There is one simple solution: get rid of the fleas and the allergy will go away! City Kitties recommends using a prescription product such as Revolution or Advantage Multi, not an over-the-counter medication or bath like Hartz — those don’t work well and can actually harm cats.
Old scarred-over injuries such as abscesses sometimes result in areas where fur simply does not regrow. Usually these patches are smooth, as opposed to the scaly or scabby appearance of skin on a ringworm fungal infection."	<urn:uuid:f16579e1-5575-4020-98ee-d36ff7eca5f2>	0.0

Uranus in Taurus square Mars in Aquarius brings to life the humanitarian needs behind the laws of the land, and the relationship between humans and nature. The need to stand up for what is fair and ethical for the group and not for only the individual means “we are all in this together.” It may link the ideals of human law to a larger, natural law. Or, in a surprising manner, show how nature’s power can eclipse human power—and almost in an instant. There is a deep and important relationship to Uranus’s mission in Taurus and the idea of the Mars mission through Aquarius, the ruler of Uranus. This is an important month to examine humanitarian values, even though it is challenging on many levels. A push from Mars may awaken Uranus energy. Uranus and Aquarius are both linked to genius. Genius is the ability to act and think in ways that are new/novel and have never been taught to us.

How does the U.S.-Japan Okinawa Reversion Agreement of 1969 handle the issue of nuclear weapons in Okinawa, and what special provisions were included?	"Mark E. Manyin
Specialist in Asian Affairs
Since the mid-1990s, tensions have spiked periodically among Japan, China, and Taiwan over the disputed Senkaku (Diaoyu/Diaoyutai) islets in the East China Sea. These flare-ups run the risk of involving the United States in an armed conflict in the region. Japan administers the eight small, uninhabited islets, which some geologists believe sit near significant oil and natural gas deposits. China and Taiwan both contest Japanese claims of sovereignty over the islets.
U.S. administrations going back at least to the Nixon Administration have stated that the United States takes no position on the territorial disputes. However, it also has been U.S. policy since 1972 that the 1960 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty covers the islets, because Article 5 of the treaty stipulates that the United States is bound to protect “the territories under the Administration of Japan” and Japan administers the Senkakus (Diaoyu Islands). Under the treaty, the United States guarantees Japan’s security in return for the right to station U.S. troops—which currently number around 50,000—in dozens of bases throughout the Japanese archipelago. Although it is commonly understood that Japan will assume the primary responsibility for the defense of the treaty area, in the event of a significant armed conflict with either China or Taiwan, most Japanese would likely expect that the United States would honor its treaty obligations.
Each time tensions over the islets have flared, questions have arisen concerning the U.S. legal relationship to the islets. This report will focus on that issue, which has four elements:
- U.S. administration of the Senkakus (Diaoyu Islands) from 1953 to 1971;
- the application to the Senkakus (Diaoyu Islands) of the 1971 “Treaty Between Japan and the United States of America Concerning the Ryukyu Islands and the Daito Islands”—commonly known as the Okinawa Reversion Treaty, approved by the Senate in 1971 and entered into force the following year (the Daito Islands lie to the east of Okinawa);
- the U.S. view on the claims of the disputants; and
- the relationship of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty to the islets."	<urn:uuid:3fefd35e-e8e6-413b-8dc8-bb5ec4a19c20>	0.0
best temperature and conditions to store feijoa fruit long time	"In general, the skin holds a little tighter to the fruit than in the standard tangerine.
Now that you’re hungry for all these different types of oranges, how do you know how to pick out and store the best of these citrus wonders? Here are a few tips.
|Tips for when you’re at the store
- Except for tangerines, all citrus should feel firm with a smooth, tight skin.
- The fruit should be heavy in the hand. If you pick up two or three, choose the heaviest one in the bunch.
- Some citrus are coated with a thin, food-grade wax so they don’t dry out in storage. Thus, they may not smell as ripe as they actually are.
- Look for sales. Because citrus are perishable, grocery stores are often eager to turn over the stock. Get them while the getting’s good!
- Avoid any oranges and the like with soft or squishy spots.
|Tips for when you’ve got the fruit home
- Store oranges, tangerines and mandarins at room temperature for a few days, maybe up to a week.
- Longer than that, put them in the crisper drawer for up to six weeks.
- However, remove them from the fridge an hour or so before eating so they’re not ice-cold. They taste best near or at room temperature.
Everyone loves those little orange sections in salads — the perfect little morsels without any white pith. They’re called supremes — and they take a little practice to make. Here’s how:
Cut off a small slice of the fruit’s top and bottom so the round citrus can stand steadily on the counter. Use a sharp paring knife to cut the rind off the flesh in long arcs, starting at the top and following the natural curve of the fruit to the bottom. Cut far enough into the flesh to remove the white pith but not so far as to damage the pulp. Once peeled, hold the fruit in your hand and use a paring knife to cut between the flesh and the white membranes separating the individual segments. Allow the segments to fall into a bowl. Discard any membranes, the pith and the peel. Click here to see a how-to video"	<urn:uuid:0787932e-7a7d-45c5-9cd8-68098b7ff127>	0.0

Being an expert in bridge architecture, I'm wondering how do the total lengths of the Burlington-Bristol Bridge and the Veterans Memorial Bridge compare to each other?	"The Veterans Memorial Bridge (New Steubenville Bridge) carries US Route 22 over the Ohio River between Steubenville, Ohio, and Weirton, West Virginia.
In August 1961, the Michael Baker, Jr. Corporation developed a preliminary engineering report on US Route 22 for the state of Ohio. 3 The report considered only the construction of a limited-access freeway from Reeds Mill eastward along Will Creek to the Ohio River at Alikanna 1½ miles north of Steubenville. It was proposed to construct a bridge over the Ohio River into West Virginia at that location. A report completed for the West Virginia Department of Highways (WVDOH) in 1964 recommended a bridge over the Ohio River near the Fort Steuben Bridge, and a limited-access freeway on the hillside northwest of Harmon Creek Valley to Marland Heights. It would include connections to WV Route 2 and OH Route 7.
In 1970, Wilbur Smith & Associates prepared the US 22 Feasibility Study for the WVDOH, the Jefferson County Regional Planning Commission, and the Ohio Department of Highways which evaluated six alternative alignments for US Route 22 through Ohio and West Virginia. 3 Four of the alignments would cross the river near the Fort Steuben Bridge, and the other two would cross the river upstream at or near Alikanna. It was heavily favored that a new crossing would be located just south of the Fort Steuben Bridge because of its central location to Steubenville and Weirton. 1 By November 1972, it was determined that an alignment 500 feet downstream from the Fort Steuben Bridge.
The proposed river structure was a unique cable-stayed box girder bridge that would provide 800 feet of horizontal clearance and 69 feet of vertical clearance above a normal pool. 3 It would include two 12-foot lanes in each direction with a 12-foot outside and 6-foot inside shoulder with the ability to restripe the bridge for three lanes in each direction with 3-foot shoulders. The proposed bridge would tie into the ultimate upgrading of US Route 22 in the region, including a freeway (completed in 1972) from Harmon Creek Road in Weirton proceeding eastward toward Pittsburgh and freeway proposals in Ohio."	<urn:uuid:f1e192af-7fd8-45eb-9cf9-ade965d18396>	0.0
Do nest associate fish and arctic grayling both migrate for spawning?	"They are usually found swimming on the middle to top regions of the aquarium because gourami is labyrinth fish. The tank should have good water chemistry with pH of 6.0-8.0, hardness of 4-10 dGH and water temperature is between 77°F and 82°F. A regular weekly water change is strongly recommended to keep your fish healthy. The tank should also have an efficient filtration system. In this case air stones are also recommended as they prefer well oxygenated water. It is a good community fish that can be kept with other peaceful fish. Suitable tank mates include peaceful cyprinids such as the Harlequin Rasbora, Trigonostigma heteromorpha and many of the other rasboras, Kuhlii Loach and its relatives, many of the Tetras, smaller catfish like Corydoras species and smaller Rainbowfish. Some of the peaceful barbs also work well but it should not be kept with those fishes that are notorious fin nippers like Tiger Barbs, Clown Barbs, guppies, as well as other anabantoids, including Bettas.
Breeding Dwarf gouramis
The Dwarf Gourami can breed in captive condition. The male gourami builds a floating bubble nest in which the female lays eggs. The water level of the tank should be reduced to 7–10 cm during spawning and the temperature should be approximately 82 °F. The aquarium must be planted with suitable plant species like Ceratopteris thalictroides, Limnophila aquatica,Riccia fluitans and Vesicularia dubyana. To build a bubble nest the male uses bits of vegetation in its nest. In nature it adds leaves, twigs, roots, peat fibers, and other debris to build a nest. The spawning session lasts for two to four hours and the female produces 300 to 800 eggs. After spawning the female should be moved to a different tank. The male picks up eggs in his mouth and put them in bubble nest and continues to guard the eggs until they hatch. The eggs hatch in about 12-36 hours, but the fry stay in the bubble nest and continue developing. In about 3 days fry become free swimming and leave the nest. At this time the male should be removed to prevent eating the young."	<urn:uuid:868f3c36-7a1e-4618-9d5c-1c60eacbfbf0>	0.0
aquarium expert curious about differences between siamese flying fox vs algae eater distinctive features	"Article © Julian Dignall, uploaded October 01, 1998.
There are an awful lot of L - numbered plecos that have a basic black with many white spots colour pattern. This is one of the more commonly seen fish with these colours. Some specimens can exhibit a more yellow tinge to the spots and this appears related to water conditions.
When it was first offered for sale (before it was assigned its scientific name) the fish was also labelled as the Tusken or Vampire Pleco, since classification the common name Galaxy pleco has become more often used and for the sake of continuity it is adopted here. Additionally, the tusken and vampire features (a strange bony growth on the fishes head and it's fang like teeth respectively), are characterisitic of the genus and don't identify this species clearly. Although its colouration is not unusual, it is however odd in that it has a large front ""tooth"" - the use of which is unproven - although a few theories exist.
Close-up showing specialised teeth.
The specialized dentistry is not for rasping algae from bogwood - I did not notice any tell-tale toothmarks (like those left by Royal Plecs, Panaque nigrolineatus) on any bogwood present in the tanks with these fish. It also was a poor green algae eater in the way, for example, a common pleco is not, although it did make some impact on brown algae. Maybe the ""tooth"" (you can see it protruding out of the top of the fishes mouth in the out-of-water shot below) provides some function in the fast water environment that the fish hails from and it is under-utilized in the home aquarium. I personally favor the idea that it is used to gain access to crustacea, molluscks or insects embedded in rotting wood or thick algae. The fish does eat meat and can despatch a frozen prawn in record time (for a pleco). It is also reported by other keepers of these fish that they eat snails too.
It is a territorial fish; I had real problems keeping it with a Polka Dot Catfish, Synodontis angelicus, but in hindsight keeping two similarly patterned ""warmongers"" together was not a good idea."	<urn:uuid:a6fb4590-63a9-4d76-8016-4c1ccf85e8c4>	0.0

how did gunpowder spread from china west	"The Great Fire of London was huge, destroying the majority of the city.
The great fire swept through the city from Sunday 2nd of September to Wednesday 5th of September 1666. The portion of the city inside the ancient roman walls was completely gutted. It came close to the aristocratic district of Westminster, Whitehall, and most of the suburban slums, but it was extinguished before it reached them.
St. Paul's Cathedral was consumed, as were 13,200 houses, and 87 parish churches (out of a total 95).
About 75 thousand people were left homeless.
Only 6 people were officially recorded as being killed in the fire, though in reality the number must have been higher. Despite this the real numbers were also traditionally very low, though it is accepted that many refugees did die in the impromptu camps which resulted. Personally i find this surprising, however, I suppose once the fire was in full flow, the whole city knew about it, and fled from the fire as it spread. Despite this though i think the real figure must have been much higher, at least hundreds, and probably thousands. This was 1666, and the real number of people in London would have been impossible to know, many of the missing poor would have gone unreported as missing, and the fire would have been so fierce that remains would have been hard to find, especially under the rubble of the city.
The fire started in Thomas Farriner's bakery on pudding lane, in the early hours of the Sunday morning, spreading west across the city. The wind fanned the flames and the fire quickly got out of control. Spreading west, then north the fire spread through the center of the city.
Eventually the strong easterly winds died down, and the firefighting force used gunpowder to demolish buildings in the path of the fire to create effective firebreaks.
The Fire put an end to the plague at the time, which is thougth to have actually saved a great many lives.
The city was reconstructed on much the same street layout.
What is clear is that many people will have died, and many more would have been displaced, Charles II encouraged refugees to move elsewhere away from London, as the city was not able to cope with the population which wished to stay in the city."	<urn:uuid:735a62d0-c002-443d-9127-673de7106549>	0.0

I'm doing research for my college assignment and was wondering what's the main difference between how old school scientists and modern researchers think about their own influence on what they study?	"Since at least the end of World War II, the United States has arguably been the major center for advanced research in science and technology. This has been possible, at least in part, because many of the best and brightest students and scholars have come to study or carry out research at our world-class research universities and in our centers of industry.
One wonders, however, how much longer the United States will enjoy this primacy if our government continues to place ideology above scientific results, both in public policy initiatives and in support of fundamental research.
Concern about government distortion of scientific results has been growing among scientists over the past six years. In February 2004, for example, 60 prominent American scientists, among which I was privileged to count myself, voiced their concern over the misuses of science by the current Bush administration — including the manipulation of public access to information resulting from scientific studies, disbanding scientific advisory committees, placing unqualified individuals on these committees, and suppressing or altering reports by government scientists. Since that time, more than 9,000 additional scientists have signed on to this call for scientific integrity in government.
Attempts to distort science have not been limited to the federal government. In numerous states, including my own, Ohio, state school boards have attempted to alter the teaching of high school science to give students the impression that various bedrocks of modern science, including evolutionary biology, are somehow “suspect.” Via a disingenuous campaign called “Teach the Controversy,” various groups that oppose the teaching of evolution on religious grounds have helped to convince many among the public that evolution is not on firm scientific ground — in spite of the fact that almost all of modern biology is based on the predictions of evolution, which have successfully confronted experiment and observation for more than 100 years.
One might argue that distorting evolutionary biology for some high school students will not impede the education of our country’s very brightest students, those who may go on to become tomorrow’s scientific stars. In at least one area, however, government interference has already begun to put prominent researchers in this country at a disadvantage: stem-cell research.
Because of government restrictions on the use of embryonic stem cells, American researchers are forced to either seek private funding for their work or go abroad. There has already been a minor exodus of such researchers to places like the United Kingdom and Singapore, where there is active support for this important area of biomedical research."	<urn:uuid:acb7ebda-7098-4166-9d92-a02f2822683f>	0.0
mortality timeline ash trees younger than ten years infected with chalara	"The Asian insect cutting a swath out of the city’s urban canopy could soon be taking a bite out of homeowners’ wallets.
Toronto residents are on the hook for the removal of dead ash trees killed by the Emerald Ash borer on their property. A recent citymap shows the beetle has infected trees throughout the eastern half of Toronto and is moving fast to the other side of Yonge St.
The city estimates that two-thirds of the Ash trees — almost 600,000 — are on private property. Their removal could cost some homeowners thousands of dollars.
“We want the general public to maintain trees on their property and to recognize that that is their responsibility,” says Beth McEwen, the city’s manager of urban forest renewal. Private tree maintenance is mandated under the city’s property standards bylaw. “And we want them to replant trees if their trees die because that’s part of maintaining Toronto’s tree canopy,” she says.
That’s a concern for residents in the Guildwood area of Toronto, where 80 to 90 year old ash trees tower above homes south of Kingston Rd.
“There are people here who are retired folks. If they’re hit with $100,000 of tree removal in three years I don’t know how they would be able to afford it,” says resident Jean-Marc Frion, who has three large ash trees in his backyard.
Frion expressed his concerns at a public information meeting on the ash borer this summer after a neighbour was charged $7,000 for the removal of two dead trees.
He’s particularly concerned that as the infestation spreads and reaches his area, demand for tree removal will inflate costs.
In the early part of the infestation, it can take three or four years to kill trees, but as the number of beetles build up, trees could die within a year, says McEwen. By 2017, most of the city’s ash trees will be dead, a loss of almost 10 per cent of Toronto’s tree canopy.
“If we have between five and 25 trees to take down in a matter of two years, obviously we’re going to be sitting in a situation where there is going to be gouging,” says Frion.
The city is currently trying to streamline the process for residents. They are waiving the $100 permit to remove trees more than 30 centimetres in diameter from private property. Instead, residents can call 311 and provide photos of the infested tree or provide proof from a reputable arborist."	<urn:uuid:25c64233-ab6a-4fa4-85d1-c225928ff6ab>	0.0

I'm interested in watches with art pieces inside them. Can you tell me what the Art Piece 1 watch looks like and what rights would the building owner have if this art was painted on their wall instead?	"Whoever coined the phrase “better late than never” clearly didn’t own a watch. Watches are a valuable investment for any individual, young or old, and serve a variety of purposes. The most important aspects for consumers to consider are cost and quality, and in some cases, brand name.
Ornate, luxurious watches are a necessity to some, while others place the focus on function. Extravagant watches can be very expensive but there are ways to acquire lavish watches for a fraction of the cost. Most watches are manufactured to last indefinitely, making used and refurbished watches a practical investment.
Used watches are desirable because of their cost; purchasing a second-hand watch allows shoppers to acquire a solid piece without compromising quality. All watches depreciate as soon as they are purchased, so buying a used watch allows consumers to avoid this initial drop in value.
When looking for a used watch, it is often helpful to consider refurbished pieces. These watches have been carefully inspected and repaired by a watch specialist. Restoring a used watch can entail the replacement of one or two parts to several components, breathing new life into the piece. In fact, it can be hard to tell the difference between a new watch and a well-polished, refurbished watch.
Some resellers offer a warranty on refurbished watches, providing the consumer with piece of mind. These vendors are confident that a used watch is as dependable as a new watch. In the case of a purchase made outside of a jewelry or watch store, it is helpful to clarify the age of second-hand piece in case part of the original warranty still applies.
The value of a used watch can also be determined by its certification. More expensive watches often come with papers that declare their authenticity and confirm their value. Any watch owner who appreciates the value of their piece will keep this important document, especially if they have any intention of selling the watch in the future. When a used watch is accompanied by a certification record, the buyer feels more secure in the investment.
There are also many practical advantages to buying a second-hand watch. With the exception of high-priced pieces, used watches can be easily replaced so they do not have to be diligently safeguarded. Second-hand watches require the same maintenance and care as new watches.
For buyers concerned with the environment, used watches are being incorporated into some recycling programs. Second-hand watches are also being used in art pieces and turned into other forms of jewelry, such as bracelets and necklaces, making them a great choice for the consumer and the Earth."	<urn:uuid:d8b8bbfb-d553-438d-9f9e-bf6fbdd5bb96>	0.0

How do American and European approaches to Varroa control differ?	"by Vern Faulkner
A brief mid-June memo issued by New Brunswick’s provincial apiarist sent a shockwave through the province’s beekeeping community: samples of Small hive beetle (SHB) were found in hives imported from Ontario.
Samples taken on June 3 and 4 tested positive for the pest, stated provincial apiarist Chris Maund.
“Inspections on the Acadian Peninsula identified the first-time presence of small hive beetles in colonies rented for blueberry pollination from one beekeeper from Ontario,” confirmed Anne Bull, a provincial government communications officer. Bull acknowledged what many beekeepers already knew: the pest has been found in hives in Maine, Ontario, and Quebec.
The affected colonies required provincial approval to be removed, stated Bull. The imported colonies were to be removed by June 22.
The beetle’s larvae is the main cause of damage, devouring pollen, bee larvae, and honey. The pest also defecates in honey, spoiling it.
Calvin Hicks, president of the New Brunswick Beekeepers Association, isn’t happy. “The obvious concern is that we’ll end up with a domestic population of Small hive beetle in our hives in New Brunswick,” he said.
According to the Ontario government, SHB first hit Manitoba in 2002, and again in 2006. It spread to Alberta and Quebec. And it moved into Ontario in 2010.
SHB can overwinter in hives. The beetle spreads through hives and beekeeping equipment.
Hicks said SHB is less harmful to bees than other pests. “They are a nuisance, they are a pest, they can ruin honey and equipment, but they aren’t killing bees,” he said, adding that if SHB spreads to New Brunswick hives, it will “affect profitability.”
If SHB is now a problem, it will simply add another stress on the domestic honeybee population, joining a list of pests and parasites such as the Varroa mite, American foulbrood, European foulbrood, nosema, Tracheal mites and Wax moths.
Of those, the two foulbroods are invariably deadly and quite contagious. The Varroa mite is perhaps the best known: the red, spider-like mite, feeds off larval and adult bees, and is a delivery vector for viruses and other pathogens.
“A lot of managers have Varroa mites at a low or reasonable level,” said Hicks."	<urn:uuid:63778b50-1004-466a-b020-3200f1ed2a14>	0.0
error ellipse vs pca axis meaning difference	"We have freedom to choose what these six dimensions are. Based on my description of the problem, it would seem that the most obvious way to choose these dimensions would be exactly what I said — position and velocity. Together, these bits of information can be represented as two three-dimensional vectors, the orbital position vector and the orbital velocity vector . Together, these are called the orbital state vectors, and they are enough to completely describe an orbit.
For practical purposes, however, this is not a very useful way of describing an orbit. Yes, knowing where we are and how we are moving gives us enough information to completely describe what we are doing, but it would be far more useful to find a set of parameters that more directly describes the shape of the orbit. The traditional set is known as the Keplerian orbital elements.
Named for Johannes Kepler, who discovered that all of the planets move in elliptical orbits, these orbital elements describe the size, shape, and orientation of the orbit. For a basic two-body problem, such as a spacecraft orbiting a spherical planet, neglecting things like the gravitational influence of other bodies, the orbit will always be a conic section — a circle, an ellipse, a parabola, or a hyperbola, with the body to be orbited at one of the foci of the section. For our purposes, we will not consider parabolas and hyperbolas, which are for escape trajectories. Instead, we will focus only on circles and ellipses. For simplicity’s sake, let’s say that the planet is located at the point on the diagram below.
Let’s go through the six parameters now:
The first parameter we will look at is eccentricity. Eccentricity is a single number that describes the shape of our ellipse. On the diagram at right, the eccentricity is defined by the ratio of the distance between the foci ( and ) and the major axis (the widest distance across the ellipse — from to ). An eccentricity of zero makes a perfect circle. As the eccentricity increases towards 1, the ellipse becomes flatter and flatter. Once the eccentricity reaches or surpasses 1, it’s no longer an ellipse — rather, a parabola or a hyperbola, i.e., an escape trajectory.
The next parameter we’ll explore is the semimajor axis. This parameter controls the size of the orbit."	<urn:uuid:199c7bb4-224e-4f8e-b24a-0f986b3dd98a>	0.0
working voice actor benefits creative freedom risks equipment damage	"Overall, upgrading your processor can be a cost-effective way to improve the performance of your computer without having to purchase a new system. It can save you money in the short term and extend the lifespan of your current system, making it a better value in the long run.
What are the risks of upgrading a processor?
Damage to the computer
Upgrading a processor in a computer can be a complex task that requires technical expertise. One of the main risks associated with upgrading a processor is the potential for damage to the computer. Improper installation can damage the processor or motherboard, which can result in costly repairs or even a complete system failure.
Additionally, electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage components and cause malfunctions. ESD is a static electricity charge that can build up on your body, and it can be discharged when you touch a metal object, such as a computer component. To prevent ESD damage, it is important to follow proper grounding procedures and use anti-static wrist straps when working with computer components.
In some cases, upgrading a processor may also require the replacement of other components, such as the cooling system, to ensure proper functionality. If these components are not installed correctly, it can lead to overheating and other issues that can damage the computer.
It is important to note that upgrading a processor can be a risky process, and it is recommended that only experienced computer technicians attempt it. If you are not comfortable with the installation process, it is best to seek professional assistance to avoid any potential damage to your computer.
Loss of warranty
Upgrading a processor may result in the loss of warranty on the computer. This means that if there are any issues with the computer after the upgrade, the manufacturer may not provide repairs or support. This can be a significant risk for those who rely on their computer for work or other important tasks.
It is important to note that the loss of warranty may not be the only risk associated with upgrading a processor. There may also be compatibility issues with other components of the computer, and the upgrade may not provide the desired performance boost. It is essential to research and carefully consider the potential risks and benefits before making the decision to upgrade a processor.
When upgrading a processor, one of the main risks is compatibility issues. These issues can arise when the new processor is not compatible with certain motherboards or other components in the computer. This can prevent the computer from working properly and can result in a significant loss of productivity."	<urn:uuid:83a75781-6fd7-464f-94f9-0512e2795f0e>	0.0

I am dedicated to eating healthy because it’s a source of interest and enjoyment for me, plus we all want to be well, of course, but without a real verdict on whether or not eating a high-raw diet is more beneficial than a mainstream diet, my head is swimming with what it all means for me and my own lifestyle. I would be interested in trying the high-raw thing for like a week perhaps, just because I’m interested and open to other lifestyles, but I have a feeling that the crux of it is to eat clean above all else and to make good choices. I can only do my best to know how to make that happen! It’s got to work for me and my lifestyle, at the end of the day. Thanks again for showing points in favor of both arguments!
Wow, I learned a lot from this post. I am going to steam my spinach for a bit before I use it in my GM too.
You know where I stand, for the most part!
That said, I make clear time and time again that the emphasis should be 100% healthy, plant based, and digestible, NOT 100% raw. And of course, different strokes for different folks.
LOVE the post! i think it’s really good to remind people that there is always an opposite side to the coin! :) So informative!
Great post, Angela! I think the best diet is something you can stick to permanently and a 100% raw diet just isn’t feasible for most. Some days you just need a hot soup!!
Thank you SO much for the information, Angela!"	<urn:uuid:686ba005-a22f-43c8-9535-d3ef7bd6ab64>	0.0
What unique symbol marks the pilgrimage trails in Norway?	"Walking these ageless trails not only offers the opportunity for spiritual renewal but also provides a link to our past, while contributing to sustainable tourism and community development in each area. You can obtain your passport for all 5 walks here in Ballintubber and once completed we will issue your Teastas.
Comments from some of the people who recently walked the Pilgirm Paths of Ireland.
“I wish to take this opportunity to thank everyone again for warmth of reception and support, friendship and encouragement while on walk over Croagh Patrick and confirmatory emails prior to my journey.” Denis
“I want to thank you for this—I thoroughly enjoyed each one of the walks and the wonderful experiences I had along the way will remain as great memories with me forever.” Deirdre
“Many thanks for all your help and assistance especially on the Tochar Phadraig Pilgrim Path”. Bernadette
‘A Pilgrim Walk’ – Elements of Pilgrimage
There are certain elements of Pilgrimage built into the walk and reminders of these are erected at certain places along the way. They distinguish the ‘Pilgrim’ from the ‘Tourist’
Penance – No complaining. Instead say “Thanks be to God”
Community – Include ‘the stranger’ in your group – No ‘Cliques’
Faith – Light a Candle as symbol of your faith before setting out
Mystery – Silence observed at certain designated parts of Tochar.
Celebration – Share your Food, your Joy, your Love and your Care
Registration and Regulations:
N.B. Minimum of Two people must walk together for Health & Safety Reasons if doing the Tochár on their own.
- There are five official walks organised by the Abbey in May, June, July, August and December (Contact Office For Details, please see below). A ‘back up car’ and transport back to the Abbey is provided.
- Other walkers may organise their own groups but must comply with the following details:
- All walkers must register at Ballintubber Abbey and sign a declaration, exempting Ballintubber Abbey Trust and farmers from liability, should a mishap or accident take place. Must walk in a minimum of 2 people. Registration fee €10.
- All walkers must comply with the regulations for walking the Tóchar
- Those under 18 years must be accompanied by an adult (Health & Safety)
- It is important that the walkers notify the Abbey on completion of Walk by leaving message on answering machine."	<urn:uuid:374c5098-9ed2-44a3-b1a8-2c1efaa37e4d>	0.0
mazda rx7 first version power specs	"The 2017 Mazda 6 car is yet another release that has been announced by the Mazda company which is going to be released quite soon. The model is going to offered perhaps next year and is among the vehicle which have been getting an update coming out of the production line of Mazda. Mazda has also been on a tear as they have been providing cars left and right ever since the year started and have a number of new releases already lined up. But what the 2017 Mazda 6 has that other new releases do not is the added power and the quite strong output this vehicle has.
Other vehicles that Mazda is going to produce this year do not have a great output and are solid cars which are basically measured because of its value for money equation. This is perhaps the only vehicle that promises to offer some very high performance specs and also some very premier driving ability.
The vehicle is getting a slew of changes that are going to make it much better and quite handsome. The vehicle is going to become quite a looker and it is all thanks to the recognizable language design that Mazda is giving to all of its future model. Mix the performance and great design together and we are getting a very nice concept and a very good update for the 2017 Mazda 6. You can read all about it in our review which is going to help you get a better understanding what the latest release brings. Also check out the positional release date and the price ranges as well.
2017 Mazda 6 design
The 2017 Mazda 6 actually looks pretty amazing on the outside. Because of its great KODO design that Mazda uses for all of its vehicles, the vehicle has an absolutely cool looking design which is going to be one of its man advantages. All of the vehicles coming out of the Mazda lineup are actually incorporating this type of a design language and is what makes them unique and very handsome-looking.
The changes compared to the previous model include a much more angular grille to the front of the car which makes it look a little bit meaner than before. There is a huge bumper front bumper which combines with the already great looking front part of the car making it very interesting and much appreciative for the fans. The wheel arches are also great looking and are more muscular now. Compared to the sedan version, the coupe one has a more sporty look to it which is going to get much more attention than the previous model ever did."	<urn:uuid:ec5422a5-2eca-4017-9fd3-7b483a97e01f>	0.0
domestic abuse victim workplace rights nyc	"The penal code provides for a maximum punishment of life imprisonment for rape; however, most rapes were prosecuted in the magistrates' courts, which have a sentencing limit of 10 years. There were inconsistencies in the sentences imposed for rape by different magistrates; sentences generally ranged from one to six years' imprisonment. The Fiji Women's Rights Movement and the Fiji Women's Crisis Center pressed for more consistent and severe punishments for rape. The Court of Appeal has ruled that 10 years is the minimum appropriate sentence in child rape cases. Women's activists continued to press for the formal criminalization of spousal rape, which is not a specific offense; however, husbands have been convicted of raping their wives.
Although there is no specific law against domestic violence, it can be prosecuted as assault. Police claimed to practice a ""no-drop"" policy, under which they pursued investigations of domestic violence cases even if a victim later withdrew her accusation. However, women's organizations reported that although police generally were more responsive to domestic violence cases than in the past, they were not always consistent. Courts dismissed some cases of domestic abuse and incest or gave the perpetrators light sentences. Incest was widely believed to be underreported. Traditional practices of reconciliation between aggrieved parties were sometimes taken into account to mitigate sentences in domestic violence cases. An active women's rights movement sought to raise public awareness about domestic violence.
Four women's crisis centers funded by foreign governments operated in the country. The centers offered counseling and assistance to women in cases of domestic violence, rape, and other problems, such as child support.
Prostitution is illegal, but it occurred, particularly in cities. Sex tourism is prohibited by law but reportedly occurred, particularly in tourist centers such as Nadi and Savusavu, including cases involving children. Taxi drivers, hoteliers, bar workers, and others reportedly acted as middlemen, facilitating the commercial sexual exploitation of children.
The Human Rights Commission Act specifically prohibits sexual harassment, and criminal laws against ""indecent assaults on females"" prohibit offending the modesty of women and have been used to prosecute sexual harassment cases. Under a new employment relations law that came into effect in April, sexual harassment in the workplace is a specific ground of complaint that can be filed by workers.
Women have full rights of property ownership and inheritance but often were excluded from the decision-making process on disposition of communal land, which constituted more than 80 percent of all land. Many women were successful entrepreneurs."	<urn:uuid:9f3f18e4-0735-45f8-b8d5-9bca3a48c8a1>	0.0

What should I feed mailed catfish in my aquarium?	"The corydoras catfish is the latest addition to the fish on display at the Shanghai Ocean Aquarium.
The Shanghai Ocean Aquarium has introduced two new breeds of fish to celebrate the new year.
The corydoras catfish from South America, which looks like a mouse, is on display to mark the Year of the Mouse, while bowmouth guitarfish from Taiwan are very rare, officials said.
The catfish can be seen in the aquarium's South American exhibition area. Some seven to eight centimeters long, they have whisker-like markings near their mouths, giving them the appearance of mice swimming in water.

what genetic data format did 23andme use to project customers onto hgdp data set visualization	"First Personal Genome User Group
July 11, 2008
Last Tuesday 23andMe, the genome sequencing service, hosted the first meeting between its customers. Like Navigenics and deCode, 23andMe will sequence half a million “snips” from your own DNA to give you glimpse of your personal genetics. What you get for your $1,000 payment is lots of numbers and strings of letters, and a little bit of information of how these correspond to health studies and ancestry research. So far this is a very nerdy hobby, requiring a love of data and great patience with crude tools, bugs, and beta everything.
The idea behind gathering early enthusiasts face to face was to increase the exchange of information, methods, motivations in a way that Web 2.0 can’t do. There are ethical issues, social uncertainty, incredible technical complexity, and rapid advancement in this field; having a person in front of you who might know more than you is a great way to learn. 23andMe cleverly calls this initiative to harness customer-generated value 23andWe.
As a paying customer I attended this informal gen-con. I think of this event as the first Personal Genome User Group. We gathered at 23andMe world headquarters in Mountain View, CA, but I think we were outnumbered by the ever helpful staff on hand to answer questions. I was extremely curious about the other customers’ experience, and what they have learned by sequencing their DNA. I don’t want to speak for them, but here is what I have learned by messing around in personal quantified genomics in the last six months:
1) There is far less known about proven genetic diseases that I thought. The list of illness with established origins in genetic mutations is very short, and even then the genetic factors operate statistically. The presence of a particular gene will raise or lower the percentage risk for a health issue, at the most. So one thing I learned from having my DNA sequenced is that very few diseases have a single point genetic basis, which means that gene sequences will be just one factor in a very complex brew of influences. Personal genetic knowledge is sort of like knowing your blood type: Important to know but far from sufficient.
2) Sequencing is not just about health (and one of the reasons it should not be hijacked by the doctor squad). Your DNA can reveal much about your deep genetic past."	<urn:uuid:932d89a1-5279-4696-a6f6-87806b0e4b8b>	0.0

I'm doing research on hereditary cancer patterns. What makes some families more susceptible to ovarian cancer, and how does this affect their recommended screening approach?	"An estimated 1-3% of cases of stomach cancer are caused by inherited syndromes. Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is an inherited cancer syndrome that leads to an increased risk for both diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. Patients who inherit the genetic mutation for HDGC are at high risk for developing stomach cancer at a young age.
History of HDGC
In 1964, stomach cancer was noted in a Maori tribal family in New Zealand, following an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. CDH1 gene mutations were first described in patients from three Maori families in 1998. At this time, the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC) was formed, and the name “Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer” was introduced. Families with multiple cases of diffuse gastric cancer, lobular breast cancer, or both may be affected by hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome.
Diffuse Gastric Cancer
HDGC leads to a cancer called diffuse-type, signet ring cell gastric adenocarcinoma. These signet ring cells appear as isolated cells or in small clusters in the lining of the stomach. Unfortunately, the diffuse type of gastric cancer associated with HDGC is difficult to diagnose because the cancer is not visible on upper endoscopy (looking into the stomach with a small camera). For this reason, most cases of diffuse gastric cancer are diagnosed at late stages (III or IV), and associated with a lower survival rate.
Lobular Breast Cancer
Women from HDGC families should be followed by oncologists or breast surgeons and have clinical breast exams regularly. Screening with yearly breast MRI, which can be combined with mammograms, is recommended starting at age 30. There is a possible role for preventive hormone-blocking medications to reduce the risk of lobular breast cancer in CDH1 mutation carriers. If there are many cases of breast cancer in the family, prophylactic mastectomy may also be considered, but mastectomy is not routinely recommended.
Future of HDGC
Research on the genetics, diagnosis, and treatment of HDGC is ongoing. Centers of Excellence have been established worldwide and experts from the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium continue to work together to develop new guidelines and recommendations for patients and families affected by HDGC.

I frequently work with both ventricular drainage and JP drains in post-surgical care. What are the essential positioning requirements for both types of drains to ensure proper fluid drainage and prevent complications?	"The clinical examination at the beginning found a cervical inflammatory placard with cervicothoracic crepitation related to subcutaneous emphysema, an important element for the diagnosis .
In misleading forms and at the beginning stage, the diagnosis is essentially based on radiological data. Chest X-ray generally shows widened mediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and sometimes a mediastinal hydroaeric level. Cervicothoracic CT is gold key for early stage diagnosis [5, 9,14,15]
it allows to find strongly evocative lesions, like the modification of the density of the mediastinal fat which becomes heterogeneous. It makes it possible to specify the extent and the ratios of the cellulitis at the cervical and thoracic level, especially with the vascular structures after the injection of the product of contrast. In addition to diagnosis, CT can guide cellulitis drainage and monitor its evolution . The favorable evolution in our cases was obtained thanks to the early practice of the cervico-thoracic CT which made it possible to make the diagnosis before the stage of the complications.
The complications usually encountered during this affection are [5,16]:
- pleural empyema, pulmonary parenchymal lesions ;
- pyopneumothorax, purulent pericarditis,
- vascular lesions (ulcerations, rupture).
Other complications are possible: peritonitis by migration through the esophageal hiatus  or subphrenic abscess. Estrera, et al. Have described cranial nerve palsies (IX, X, XII), intracranial suppurations . All these complications result in rapid death in a severe and irreversible sepsis chart. Mortality of this affection varies between 36% [5,18] and 75%  with an average of 50% .
Descending necrotizing mediastinitis is a medical and surgical emergency that must be treated before the onset of its dreadful and irreversible complications.
Drainage is essential:
- endobuccal drainage by retropharyngeal puncture;
- cervical drainage with a large cervicotomy and placement of large drains a little distance from the vessels
- possibly thoracic drainage by anterolateral thoracotomy in case of pyothorax

What role do mental health considerations and individual gun rights play in the debate about preventing mass shootings, and what does research tell us about the actual effectiveness of different weapons in stopping threats?	"Gun control advocates are using this horrific tragedy to justify the promotion of an agenda that they have been progressing for decades. As David Axelrod said a few years back, “Never let a tragedy go to waste.” All the while, supporters of the Second Amendment, like me, are expected to apologize, like it was our guns that were used in the crimes, or simply shut up and let the extremely vocal gun control lobbyists be the only voice in this “search for common ground.” I, for one, am not going to apologize, I’m not going to be quiet, and I’m not going to let someone else tell me what is acceptable common ground.
First, there are approximately 50 million households in our country that own firearms, and about 300,000,000 firearms privately owned in this country. 299,999,995 weren’t used this week in mass shootings, and the owners of those weapons have nothing to apologize for.
We are either a free people, or we are not. There is no “common ground” when infringing on human liberty. If you take away the rights of the entire citizenry because a small number of them might abuse those rights, then you really aren’t free.
The argument that “ordinary” people don’t need to own weapons that “should only be possessed by the military,” have forgotten the roots of our nation. This country was founded upon the belief that the government in NOT great, better, smarter, or more capable than the people that it serves. The Second Amendment isn’t about hunting, or even individual self defense. The purpose of the Second Amendment was to guarantee that a free people would always be able to remain free.
When asked who belonged to a “well regulated militia,” Thomas Jefferson answered, “All free men, excepting a few select politicians.” Whether it be in defense of our nation from outside invaders, or as a safeguard from a government that no longer valued the individual rights of its citizens, our founders knew that only an armed citizenry could truly protect itself from threats to their freedom. They knew that the only thing that could truly keep a government in check was that government’s fear of its rightful masters: us. And if we aren’t armed, with guns that “should only be possessed by the military,” then any vigil that we stand in protection of our freedom is only symbolic.
On a side note, the “assault weapons” that are being demonized in all of this, aren’t military weapons."	<urn:uuid:0d7f72b0-6d29-44f6-b181-cf012950ecc3>	0.0

how matter velocity affect primordial star formation	"Dark matter and Galaxy formation
Prof. Dr. Francoise Combes (Observatoire de Paris, LERMA)
The ""standard"" model of cold dark matter LCDM is today the best to account for the formation of large-scale structures of the universe. However, there remain unsolved problems at the scale of galaxies. The distribution of baryons and dark matter in galaxies predicted by numerical simulations is far from what is observed. The model predicts a large excess of dark matter in galaxies, and a large number of satellites, with orders of magnitude discrepancy with observations. I will discuss how baryonic physics (Star Formation and AGN feedback) confronted to observations can constrain the nature of dark matter. Alternative models with modified gravity will also be discussed."	<urn:uuid:19fbbb81-e0b0-40dc-a114-810725f172f2>	0.0
As someone interested in both ghost stories and inclusive theater, I'd love to know how modern theaters balance creating scary atmospheres while ensuring everyone can access the full experience. How do they manage both aspects?	"A crucial part of a live performance happens behind the scenes, both before a production is mounted and during its run.
Whether you have experience working backstage or want to learn about working backstage, you should consider taking THEATRST 350.2 to learn the basics of technical theater at Duke and get academic credit for working on the mainstage!
You're also invited to get in touch with Theater Operations at Duke. There are both paid and volunteer opportunities for students to work behind the scenes in Reynolds and Sheafer Theaters, Page Auditorium, and other theaters on campus. Theater Operations can be reached at 660-1711.
Pre-production (also called ""prep"" crews) Positions and Activities
Scenic Construction -- Builds the set designed by the set designer. Opportunity to learn how to make a set happen from the blueprint to the finished set on stage. If you like to hammer and nail or want to know how things go together, this is a really fun place to be. Closed toe shoes required; no opened-toed sandals.
Scenic Paint -- Once the structural pieces are built, this crew paints the scenery to create the illusion of the world of the play, creating the structural environment of the piece. The paint chargeperson will instruct the crew on various techniques of paint illusion as indicated by the current show and how to basecoat properly.
Prop Master -- Acquires the list of objects the set designer and director put together of all things attached to the set or carried onto it by an actor. The set is like an empty house you purchased. Whatever you bring into the space is a prop, such as furniture and luggage carried on by the performer. The props master oversees the gathering crew much like a soccer team: the ball starts rolling and together you make it happen.
Prop Prep -- Works with the prop master to find, build or secure props for the play, including some rehearsal props that do not have to be the real thing. This is a fun crew because you do research for pictures, receive research from the set designer, go shopping, and get to create many things for the set. One of the most creative crews for people who like to paint and do crafty-type things.
Electrics Prep - Selects lighting instruments from a list, learns how to hang the lights in designated spots in the theater according to the light plot. Once in place, focus occurs and the lights are aimed to the area assigned. This crew comes into action closer to tech week."	<urn:uuid:ce144eca-87db-4ec4-82bb-1bdae8416f8f>	0.0

wildlife stand improvement techniques harmful effects glyphosate herbicides forest management	"Kansas State University scientists have completed long-term evaluations of a limited number of independent kochia (Kochia scoparia) populations on privately-owned land in western Kansas that are now confirmed to be glyphosate-resistant.
These populations have undergone both greenhouse and field testing by K-State and Monsanto personnel.
Kochia, also called fireweed, is a drought-tolerant weed commonly found in cropland, rangeland and pasture, and non-agricultural sites in arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and Canada. Kochia is highly adaptable and grows on many soils including saline and alkaline soils.
Phil Stahlman, who is a weed scientist with K-State Research and Extension, has listed as many as five glyphosate-resistant kochia populations in western Kansas on the International Survey of Herbicide Resistant Weeds Web site (www.weedscience.org) following lengthy evaluations of greenhouse and field studies. He, along with K-State scientists Kassim Al-Khatib, Curtis Thompson, and other colleagues, including Monsanto scientists, have investigated the sites independently, focusing on the variability of the resistance and difficulties in proving heritability — a trait required for confirmation of resistance.
“This complicates and may increase control costs for those growers who may have a resistance problem, but there are other herbicides that can be used to control kochia,” said Stahlman, who is based at K-State’s Agricultural Research Center at Hays, Kan.
Thompson, who is based at K-State’s Agronomy Department in Manhattan added, “If glyphosate-resistant kochia is suspected, the grower should consider a two-pass weed control program that includes use of residual pre-emergence herbicides that control kochia.”
Kochia control can be adversely affected by both growth stage and environmental conditions, with erratic performance fairly common. Initially, the lack of control was thought to be due to factors or circumstances other than resistance. Stahlman noted that some growers learned to manage kochia with glyphosate rates below the recommended rate by using enhanced application techniques.
“We know that herbicide rate is very important in preventing resistance and areas that practiced low use rates were among the first to exhibit lack of control of kochia not due to environmental factors,” said Stahlman.
Monsanto is working on a multi-state effort with university scientists in a number of Plains states to continue evaluating standard weed management recommendations and to learn more about glyphosate resistance in kochia."	<urn:uuid:b21b237e-41a5-4ae7-9253-0d515e8592a0>	0.0
How do adult and fetal lung progenitor cells compare to autologous versus allogeneic CAR T-cells in terms of their therapeutic potential and implementation challenges?	"Cell Medica and Baylor College of Medicine expand partnership to develop allogeneic CAR-NKT cells for cancer treatment
London, UK and Houston, TX – November 10, 2016 – Cell Medica, a leader in cellular immunotherapy for cancer, has expanded its partnership with Baylor College of Medicine (‘Baylor’) to develop an off-the-shelf allogeneic cell therapy, taking advantage of the unique aspects of invariant natural killer T (NKT) cells.
Cellular immunotherapy offers great promise in treating cancer but may be limited in application if products require individual preparation for each new patient. Most cell-based immunotherapies utilize T cells which are naturally programmed to kill malignant cancer cells and can be further engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or modified T cell receptors to improve their use for treating cancer. As an off-the-shelf product, however, allogeneic T cells derived from healthy donors carry the risk of recognizing the patient’s body as foreign, which can cause a serious side effect called graft versus host disease (GvHD).
Baylor and Cell Medica plan to overcome this problem by developing off-the-shelf therapies based on CAR-modified NKT cells generated in large volumes from healthy donors. While endowed with powerful cancer-killing properties like conventional T cells, invariant NKT cells express special T cell receptors that are not associated with GvHD. Hence allogeneic NKT cells can be used to treat multiple cancer patients with minimal risk of GvHD. The success of this program may expand significantly the potential use of cell-based immunotherapies on a cost-effective basis for the treatment of cancer patients.
Exclusive License & Development Plan
This new project will be conducted under the exclusive license and co-development agreement between Cell Medica and Baylor, announced in June 2016. Under the agreement, Baylor will perform the research required to develop off-the-shelf NKT cell therapies with funding and strategic input from Cell Medica. Cell Medica will have an exclusive option to develop all products and technologies arising from this effort, under the terms of the licensing agreement. As announced previously, Cell Medica and Baylor expect that their collaboration will generate a significant number of new products for Cell Medica’s pipeline."	<urn:uuid:3ecf7d67-72f4-41fe-ac5c-4c8009c77bf9>	0.0
I've been asked to gather information for creating a safety plan at work, but there's so much data out there. How do I know which information is actually useful for my specific workplace?	"Bringing Big Data for Transportation to Canada
Just a few weeks ago, I joined StreetLight Data as the company’s first dedicated Canadian sales consultant for the transportation industry. In many ways, this is the natural next step in my forty-year career as a transportation engineering and mapping professional. My experience spans the public and the private sector, and I’ve been honored to contribute to several of Canada’s most important transportation initiatives. From helping to plan the Confederation Bridge in Prince Edward to creating the first turn-by-turn navigation maps of all for Canada, I’ve always dedicated myself to projects that make our country more connected and improve quality of life in our communities.
While the field of Big Data analytics is relatively new to me, I’m thrilled that my next contribution to Canada’s transportation practice will be focused on data. The lack of quality transportation data has been the missing link in so much of my work for the past forty years. I believe StreetLight Data has the right solution to this long-standing problem.
It's Time for Better Transportation Data Collection
At StreetLight Data, I will be helping public agencies and engineering firms adopt StreetLight InSight®, the first on-demand web application for customized, real-world transportation analytics. It’s a new solution to transportation data collection that gives planners, modelers, and engineers better information efficiently and cost-effectively. For me and my peers, having better information at our fingertips is the ultimate game-changer.
With the StreetLight InSight platform, transportation professionals can dedicate more of their scarce resources to the work that matters the most: Putting Big Data to work to solve the complex mobility challenges we face today. It’s time to move beyond the days where more time is spent putting together surveys or doing analyses than actually making decisions with the information we gather. StreetLight InSight makes that possible.
Why I Joined StreetLight Data
Thanks to recent product advancements, StreetLight Data is ready to establish a local sales team in Canada. In last week’s software release, we launched several important new analytics in Canada, including Trip Purpose and Visitor Home-Work Projects, which describe how people travel from home to work. (Click here to read our release notes).

As someone researching the relationship between faith and academia, what's the connection between Catholic thought and philosophical inquiry in terms of how they complement each other?	"There are tons of online articles listing the “top five signs your partner is cheating” but our advice is to avoid these articles at all costs! Do not let yourself fall into the trap of investigating your partner for signs that he is cheating; instead, seek out a couples therapist immediately to address the issues that are causing you to feel insecure and disconnected. The sooner you address the problem in therapy, the easier it will be to recover from whatever is happening in your relationship.
What’s the difference between an infidelity and an emotional affair?
There is no standardized definition of what it means to have an affair. Generally speaking, infidelity is either having a sexual relationship or an intimate emotional connection with someone other than your partner. When you first committed to each other, did you and your partner discuss the expectations for your relationship? (i.e. Is it okay to flirt with someone at work? Are you comfortable with looking at online pornography? Did you agree to have an open relationship?) Unfortunately, most couples do not discuss these uncomfortable questions and, therefore, do not know what behaviors are “stepping over the line”. It is important to clarify what constitutes infidelity in your unique relationship and not to assume that there are certain unspoken rules between you.

How do emperor penguins manage eye adaptation in different environments, and what's unique about their breeding location compared to other birds?	"Evolution has taken these birds in different directions, by producing different adaptations for life at sea. This is called divergent evolution.
There are nearly 10,000 species of bird in the world and there are probably more than 100 billion individual birds. None is exactly the same as any another. Every species is different, and every individual bird is unique.
Some families, including parrots, pigeons and hummingbirds have more than 300 species. Others, such as the ostrich, have just one or two. A family evolves as many different species as the environment can support. Each one has a slightly different adaptation.
Thrushes are a good example. The blackbird feeds on worms and berries on lawns and in gardens and woodlands, the song thrush feeds mainly on slugs and snails, the mistle thrush feeds more on fruit and the rare ring ouzel lives on mountainsides. Some thrushes, redwings and fieldfares, migrate to Britain for the winter, while the ring ouzel heads south from its snowy mountains.
Male or female?
Male and female birds rarely look quite the same either. In some species the differences are tiny, such as the slightly thicker belly stripe on a male great tit. In others, they are much more obvious – such as blackbirds, where the female is brown.
The differences depend on their behaviour: most male ducks have colourful feathers for courtship display; most female ducks have brown feathers to camouflage them on the nest.
Size can also differ. A female sparrowhawk is almost one third larger than the male. This means the female can catch birds as big as song thrushes whereas the males can only manage smaller birds such as blue tits. This stops the two of them competing for prey.
Colours for all seasons
Birds also change their colours at different times of year, by moulting their old worn feathers.
Many have one breeding plumage and one different non-breeding plumage. For instance, a male wheatear in spring has a handsome pink breast, blue-grey back and black face mask. By autumn, he has become brownish all over – just like the female.
Even within one species, each individual bird is slightly different from every other. This is usually hard for us to spot, but in a few birds it’s more obvious. Some birds of prey, such as buzzards, can also vary greatly."	<urn:uuid:dc267c30-e718-41a0-89e0-95ff306fcbf6>	0.0

As a military band enthusiast, I'm intrigued by the historical significance of James Reese Europe's 369th Infantry Band - what recordings exist of this notable ensemble?	"Pogrom Death Metal / Co. Kildare
Technical Death Metal band hailing from Kildare and influenced by old school death such as CARCASS, CANNIBAL CORPSE and more modern bands like MESHUGGAH. Originally formed in 2004 by brothers James and Robert Connolly who were joined by Karl ‘Squelch’ Walsh soon after.It was this line-up that recorded their one and only release, ‘The Fury Of Silence’ Demo later that same year in 2004 in Jam Studios, Kells. But Squelch left soon after the demo was released. David Knott (FIFTH DOMINION) joined later on bass and Eoin Byrne on vocal. They also made some other recordings, two covers for a compilation album and two originals, but weren’t happy with them so they were never finished properly.
They have shared the stage with bands other notable Irish bands such as ABADDON INCARNATE, COLDWAR, MASS EXTINCTION, THE SWARM, PUTREFY, OVEROTH, SKEWERED, ZEALOT CULT and NEPHRIDIUM amongst others. Eoin eventually left the band while David switched over to second guitarist with the intention of finding a new bassist and vocalist, but the band called it quits in 2010.

im new archer need know main differences beginner bow easy hard maintain	"This takes time as compared to using a gun. Newer guns will have an increased fire rate and reduced rates of misfires.
- The amount of training needed to be able to use a bow takes time. The time might not always be on your side in a survivalist situation. Ask anyone who has trained as an archer, the answer is always that the process takes long to master it.
- Taking bow shots needs the archer to be closer to danger as compared to when using a rifle. You can see that your stealth skills have to be at the top or else you will be noticed before you can take the shot.
There is no doubt that when compared to bows, guns will easily be seen as a more powerful weapon for survival. New rifles today can deliver impressive ranges, some up to 600 yards easily and still maintain accuracy. The ammo used in guns has the ability to drop the target easily if you know how to handle the gun.
Pros of Guns
- The ability to deliver the ammo over a longer distance than a bow makes a gun preferred by many people. You can aim easily, in the comfort of your stand, and send the bullet towards your target. A number of factors can affect the type of gun and ammo to use, but on overall a gun would be better at shooting over long distances.
- The stopping power of a bullet has been always enough to take down the target with ease. It is a minimal effort as compared to using the arrows. You might have to shoot your target with several arrows to get it down.
- How about learning how to use a gun? As compared to using bows, the guns are always easier to master. You will be a pro in using a gun within a short time as when compared to shooting arrows over a long time.
- The shortage of ammo always makes the gun useless. It is not the same as for the bows where, again, you can make arrows in the wild.
By now you have an idea which weapon you would choose. Each weapon has its best applications, so make sure that you keep that in mind before picking a gun or bow.

I'm researching the Malaysian influence on Belgian electronic music - can you tell me more about any connection between San Soda and Malaysian artists?	"Ten aircraft and 11 ships scouted more than 98,000 square miles (254,000 square kilometers) of Indian Ocean on Monday looking for the missing plane, Malaysia’s acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Monday.
Flight 370 vanished March 8 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
A new Australian Joint Agency Coordination Center is being formed to synchronize search efforts among Australian agencies and other countries taking part in the search, Hishammuddin said.
And Malaysia will ask the United States about the possibility of deploying more military assets, he said.
New details on handoff
On Monday, Malaysia’s Transport Ministry said the final voice transmission from the cockpit of Flight 370 was “Good night Malaysian three seven zero.”
That’s a departure from earlier language in which Malaysian authorities said the final transmission was “All right, goodnight.”
The new language is routine and is not a sign of anything untoward occurring aboard the flight, said CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo.
But she said it does raise questions about how Malaysian officials have handled the investigation.
“Well, it speaks to credibility issues, unfortunately,” she said.
Family members of people on board Flight 370 have accused Malaysian officials of giving them confusing, conflicting information since the plane vanished more than three weeks ago.
On Monday, dozens of Chinese family members visited a Kuala Lumpur temple. They chanted, lit candles and meditated.
“Chinese are kindhearted people,” said Jiang Hui, the families’ designated representative. “But we can clearly distinguish between the good and evil. We will never forgive for covering the truth from us and the criminal who delayed the rescue mission.”
Jiang asked Malaysia to apologize for announcing March 24 that the plane had crashed, despite the lack of any “direct evidence.”
At the daily press briefing, Hishammuddin responded, saying Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak had not used the word “crash” or mentioned a lack of survivors in his announcement that the plane’s flight had “ended” in the southern Indian Ocean.
And, he said, Malaysian authorities were not hiding anything by declining to release some details of the missing flight. Some details are part of ongoing investigations into what happened to the plane, he said.
“We are not hiding anything. We are just following the procedure that is being set.” he said.
He described a meeting Saturday between Malaysian authorities and Flight 370 relatives as “the most difficult meeting I’ve ever attended.”
“The families are heartbroken."	<urn:uuid:59fe8fde-cc01-483d-92e0-2045637e8535>	0.0

What's the deepest place on Earth and what kind of creatures live there?	"We suggest that the student read the following verses several times, and as usual in this study, compare them with other translations.
24. Then God said, ""Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind""; and it was so.
25. And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good.
Let's stop here for a moment and consider the above verses.
This is the day of the creation of the land animals and man.
Here again, in verse 24, we see the use of the phrase ""living creatures"" or ""living soul"", ""neh-fesh hah-yaw"". This further emphasizes the importance of all of God's creatures, and that Man is but one of them. All of us, humans and non-humans, have a soul and a spirit.
Remember also that God did not call forth the earth to create or make the animals, as we discussed before. It is God who made [aw-sawh] the animals as we can see from verse 25. God made [aw-sawh] the animals from what he had previously created [baw-raw].
In verse 25, God again emphasizes that each type of creature is created after its kind. God seems to imply that He wants things to remain as He created them, for He says of His creation when He saw it, ""that it was good."" And since we are talking about God's created animals, we likewise need to consider the goodness, the love, the compassion that God feels towards these beings, and feel as He does.
Let's continue with our study verses, as they relate to Man.
26. Then God said, "" Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.""
27. And God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.

On a summer day, hundreds of visitors would arrive on the island by small steamboats, row boats or canoes. The plan for locks and gates for letting out the freshet in a proper manner was left for the present to be devised in due time if found necessary.

What's the difference between butterfly and moth development stages?	"Conservationists have released hundreds of caterpillars in a bid to boost the numbers of one of the UK's rarest moths.
Around 2,000 Barberry Carpet moth larvae have been introduced to the organically managed Cholderton Estate on the Hampshire/Wiltshire border.
The Barberry Carpet moth is extremely rare and is restricted to just a handful of sites across the UK.
Wildlife charity Butterfly Conservation timed the release to take place in the evening, giving the larvae a better chance of avoiding predators such as wasps and birds.
The cryptically coloured grey and brown moth gets its name from its association with barberry, a plant that has suffered extensive persecution in the past.
During the 1970s the Barberry Carpet suffered a dramatic decline when the plant was widely eradicated to prevent it from acting as a host for wheat rust fungus.
But, by the time scientists developed rust-resistant varieties of wheat the barberry plant had almost disappeared, spelling disaster for the Barberry Carpet
Now steps are underway to reintroduce the moth to parts of its former range.
It is hoped the caterpillars released on the Cholderton Estate will go on to form a viable breeding colony.
The fully organic Cholderton Estate will provide an ideal home for the new colony of moths as it is managed with an emphasis on nature conservation.
The site boasts a number of established barberry plants including one bush that is believed to be the oldest in the UK.
More than 450 species of moth have been recorded on site and 34 species of butterfly are thought to breed on the Estate.
Butterfly Conservation's Moth Conservation Officer Tony Davis explained: ""The Cholderton estate is superbly managed for wildlife and we hope that it will provide a secure home for this extremely rare moth.""
The Barberry Carpet is limited to a few small sites, mainly in Wiltshire, with colonies also in Gloucestershire, Dorset and introduced colonies elsewhere. A further colony has also recently been discovered in Oxfordshire."	<urn:uuid:199ad7d1-8bb6-4894-a36e-c7db943c981b>	0.0
how did commanders injuries affect battle outcomes at cunaxa and drepanum curious about wounded leaders impact	"About UsPeripheral nerve surgery is complex from both the diagnostic and management perspectives. Because it is a young field with new techniques constantly in development, few surgeons are exposed to the full range of nerve surgery techniques during training. And after training, few opportunities exist for mastering the full range of those new techniques or for incorporating them into routine practice.
This educational website was developed to review established practices and to provide detailed information about many of the newer ideas and techniques now being used in peripheral nerve surgery. Dr. William W. Campbell, Professor and Chairman of the Department of Neurology at the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, through the Comprehensive National Neuroscience Program and the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, provided start-up funds for this project. A key impetus for this project is the urgent need to develop and disseminate better strategies for treating wounded soldiers returning from continuing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Many advances in medicine stem from a desire to improve outcomes of wounded men and women who sustain devastating injuries from warfare. Some of those injuries to peripheral nerves can lead to loss of function. However, newer techniques – in particular, nerve transfers – described on this website can improve patient outcomes by restoring some degree of function. Nerve transfer is but one new modality for treating severely damaged peripheral nerves. This website describes it and many others for treating these challenging problems, and should prove helpful for a range of specialists, including plastic surgeons, neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and general surgeons among the many health care providers taking care of patients with severe peripheral nerve injuries."	<urn:uuid:cfd14b32-319c-43f7-9478-1c9bdb46807e>	0.0
What are the positive externalities of public transit?	"All physiological processes require energy to run, yet no one uses the word ""addiction"" to describe the dependence of physiology on energy. At best one might say that we are addicted to cheap gasoline but that is just another way of referring to hidden subsidies. So in the end, it all turns on one key question: What is the real cost of gasoline, and how does that differ from what we pay at the pump?
The ""Real"" Cost of Gasoline
At least ten independent attempts have been made that I know of to estimate a price for gasoline at the pump which corrects for all hidden subsidies, tax breaks, and external costs. The aggregated estimates for all hidden subsidies, tax breaks, and external costs in the USA fall into an astonishing range: from a low of nearly zero to a high of $1.7 trillion per year.
The differences between these estimates come from the joker in the deck: external costs, which are known in economics as ""externalities."" Whenever money changes hands, there are some costs and benefits in the transaction that are not reflected in the price paid. These are the externalities of the transaction.
Every time my car runs through a tank of gasoline, for example, there is an increment in local air pollution. This air pollution causes an increase in respiratory diseases (asthma, emphysema, pneumonia ...), and hastens some deaths in my community. Thus medical expenses in my community will increase by a small but measurable amount, there will be suffering and loss of income, and there will be loss of useful life. These are examples of ""negative externalities"" of my purchase of a tank of gasoline, because they are external to (i.e. not reflected within) the transaction itself. Positive externalities are also possible: these are external benefits.
Needless to say, estimating the size of these externalities is a matter of some difficulty and controversy. Being myself an asthmatic and highly sensitive to air pollution, I am nevertheless reminded every day that external costs are real and significant.
Let us set aside external costs such as health for a brief moment, and consider only direct subsidies and tax breaks. What would happen if Congress were to eliminate all direct subsidies and tax breaks for the petroleum industry? By my rough estimate, the pump price of gasoline in the USA would only rise by 5 to 50 cents per gallon."	<urn:uuid:3a66f95a-5e6d-4771-8028-78cf211eebd2>	0.0
geographical regions showing significant decrease marine cartilaginous species	"The current study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the H9N2 HA, that includes sequences from all of the geographical regions where H9N2 has been reported. This investigation shows how host species and geographical distribution have shaped the evolution of distinct lineages of H9 HA. This reveals clades that are both geographically and host species dependent. From these analyses new hypotheses can be generated for more specific events such as migrations or intra-species infections.
Materials and Methods
The complete set of H9N2 hemagglutinin protein sequences were downloaded from the NCBI on the 22nd of May 2013. The search term used for searching the protein database was H9N2 hemagglutinin. The sequences were exported in FASTA format.
The complete set of H9N2 hemagglutinin nucleotide sequences were downloaded from the NCBI on the 9th of September 2013. The search term used was ((H9N2 hemagglutinin) NOT precursor) NOT partial. The sequences were downloaded in FASTA format.
A dataset for the complete set of Korean H9N2 hemagglutinin sequences was downloaded from the NCBI on the 15th of June 2014. The search term used was ((H9N2 hemagglutinin) NOT H5) Korea).
After removal of long truncations (>40 amino-acid residues) as well as a group of sequences that were actually from other AIV subtypes, the final protein dataset contained 2,045 sequences, the final nucleotide dataset contained 1,052 sequences of which the Korean nucleotide subset contained 64 sequences.
The edited protein and nucleotide datasets were then broken into sub-groups based on the sequence annotations, using a short text matching program written in Perl. The data was split into subsets based on geographical location and host species.
The geographical subsets were based on national boundaries except for China, which was divided into its regions. Where a Chinese region had 10 sequences or less then phylogenetic analysis was not carried out. National borders have been identified as barriers to influenza transmission and so these are appropriate geographical subsets (Wallace & Fitch, 2008). A subset was created for the Americas including all of the North American and the single South American (Argentinian) sequence."	<urn:uuid:3a12bd5a-4996-4a1c-a5b9-36ddb452e264>	0.0
I'm interested in military units from the 1700s - can you tell me what happened to the Jung Braunschweig regiment at the end and why did the Seven Years War start in the first place?	"Former cavalry officer James Brown, a veteran of Australia's inconclusive campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, sees the country heading towards another messy war in an atmosphere of open public discussion and informed national debate. Unfortunately, most of the debate is about a war that ended almost 100 years ago.
Brown, military fellow at the Lowy Institute for National Policy, believes Australia's increasingly enthusiastic commemoration of an imperfectly remembered Anzac past actually helps prevent us from coming to terms with our contemporary military situation.
He is awkwardly handsome in classic junior-officer style, with the confident bearing of a man well accustomed to making life-or-death decisions, such as whether to turn his guns on enemy insurgents, and which bottle of wine to bring to his first dinner with his future father-in-law, the Liberal politician Malcolm Turnbull.
Brown first became interested in Anzac when he heard politicians making speeches about Afghanistan at the end of the last decade.
""And there was no substance in any of it,"" he said, ""just cliched, hackneyed phrases: we've got to support this and that, references to Anzac and World War I.
""And I thought we probably deserve better, we probably deserve a bit more thought. And I was really curious about why these guys didn't get it.
""It's their job, and they didn't know who we were fighting in Afghanistan. They didn't know the difference between infantry and armour. If you'd asked them to articulate what the strategy was, they couldn't tell you.
""Afghanistan was becoming more and more unpopular, and yet at the same time these reports were being done about the centenary of Anzac. I just couldn't reconcile those two things: it didn't make sense.""
Brown and I meet for lunch at North Bondi RSL, where Brown is vice-president of the sub-branch. The walls hang with reminders of the real cost of modern war: photographs of three sub-branch members killed in Afghanistan.
They all belonged to the Special Operations Engineer Regiment based at Holsworthy, which has a special relationship with the sub-branch. They were invited as part of a deliberate strategy by the executive.
While most sub-branches are dwindling, or packed with non-military affiliates, North Bondi has more than 400 members, many of whom are still in uniform."	<urn:uuid:85059da2-ff7b-408a-b45e-704e9ff5db99>	0.0
I'm fascinated by collaborative artworks - can you explain how two different artists, Coninxloo and Van Mander, worked together to create the Judgement of Midas painting?	"We caught up with celebrated artist, Daisy in Dots, to talk about her connection to country, her inspiration, and seeing her artwork come to life on a custom InStitchu jacket lining.
Tell us about yourself. How did you land at doing what you do?
I am an intuitive modern contemporary Aboriginal artist and proud descendant of the Muruwari people. My work is deeply rooted in my connection to the Motherland – the trees, water, sand, sun, Earth and animals. I have a strong eye for visual beauty… prior to transitioning into full time painting, I worked as a Visual Merchandiser for a number of major global retail brands.
Tell us about your amazing artworks.
Painting is a spiritual process for me. I paint to convey the beauty I see in all things and to express my gratitude and acknowledge the Country I am living, walking and breathing. My artworks are inspired and influenced by my experiences growing up on Yugambeh Country (Gold Coast). I’m particularly fascinated by the beauty of the land, sea and sky. The sun, in combination with my choice of soft, earthy, feminine paint colours has become my signature style I am most recognised for.
What are the materials and tools you use as an artist? Do you stick to traditional processes, or do you explore your own techniques?
I use a variety of sticks, paint brushes, brush ends and sponges to create the perfect dots. I like to mix my own colours but am also a huge fan of Derivan Matisse acrylic paints. I predominantly paint on canvas but have also recently started painting on ceramics too.
How do your pieces and your style reflect a broader culture and tradition in art?
Story telling is at the heart of what I do and is something I have always been passionate about. I paint intuitively, the same way my ancestors did. It is a deeply spiritual process and something I was called to do. It is a privilege and honour to share my connection to Country and culture with the world through my art. All Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural groups have different perspectives, interpretations and understandings of the stories and knowledge. First Nations people are the oldest known living civilisation on Earth and their knowledge has been passed between generations for over 70,000 years.

max doppler shift tornado wind speed	"LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Posted July 8, 2020
Correction submitted and posted July 10, 2020
First, do no harm.
The citizens of DeWitt County, who are unlucky enough to be in the footprint of the proposed wind farm, are asked to suffer and sacrifice so Chairman of the County Board, Dave Newberg, and his group of YES votes, will have another stream of income for the County. None of these six County Board members voting YES have homes located near proposed wind towers.
These are no ordinary wind turbines. Some are 599 feet high, only 31 feet shorter than the St. Louis Arch, and there are lots of them. There is only one St. Louis Arch, and it does not make noise, blink red lights at night continuously, or send giant moving shadow flickers across the countryside.
What about the lives at risk of the people downwind from the wind farm who will be without the Doppler early warning system for tornado activity? The Doppler radar would be obscured by the wind turbine blade activity.
Aren’t these DeWitt County residents’ lives valuable?
One Board member told me that the wind farm project income stream was “for the greater good.” And what is “the greater good”? Are we choosing money over public safety?
Speaking of money, we now know that the Clinton Schools will not get a very significant sum of money from the wind farm because we have been blessed for many years by the income from the power plant and the State of Illinois formula for school funding limits the wind farm subsidy to the schools.
It is just plain wrong to approve the Special Use Permit on July 14 without a mutually agreed upon decommissioning plan in place before the vote. In addition, we can’t trust Tradewind Energy to “pursue” a system that stops those never-ending blinking red lights at night (when aircraft are not in the area of the towers.)
We have precedence for selling out DeWitt County. Years ago, the Board sold the landfill and lost control of that. The landfill, now operated by Area Disposal Corporation, is located over the Mahomet aquifer that supplies water to several adjoining counties, and has risen to the heights of “Mount Clinton” and keeps growing! Garbage comes in from many states.
We need to stop selling our County off to the highest bidder."	<urn:uuid:ba62a077-6e66-45e2-96a1-f9d44bb2b8f1>	0.0

geothermal system temperature depth relationship modern power plant applications clay mineral indicators	"For the most part, maintaining a geothermal system isn’t a do-it-yourself project. Geothermal heat pumps are generally considered low-maintenance. The heat pump components are located indoors, sheltered from the elements, and the underground heat exchange loops are guaranteed for up to 50 years, seldom presenting leakage issues. The little maintenance that is required is critical to getting the dependability, performance and low operating costs you expect from the system.
Professional geothermal service requires training and expertise specific to geothermal technology, as well as the specialized equipment that goes along with it. Here are four things you should know about what’s required.
Change the Air Filter
Any homeowner can tackle this task. All heat pumps, including geothermal models, rely on higher airflow rates than standard forced-air HVAC systems. Keep your system’s airflow up to specs with the simple DIY task of replacing the system air filter monthly.
Check the Flow Rate and Temperature
The heat exchange fluid circulating through the underground loops must run at a specific gallons-per-minute figure; 6 to 9 gpm is typical. To a trained technician, readings outside that range may indicate air in the system, pump problems or obstructions. Fluid temperature measurements entering and leaving the heat pump in both cooling and heating mode are also indicators of the overall health of the system.
Heat Pump Tuneup
Basic heat pump maintenance includes measuring refrigerant level and troubleshooting any low readings. Wiring connections to the thermostat and thermostat operation are also tested, as is a proper operation of supplemental heating mode.
Clean Indoor Coil
The surfaces of this critical component sealed inside the air handler must be kept free of dirt and dust accumulation by regular cleaning with approved chemicals. A dirty coil severely inhibits heat transfer and impacts system efficiency and performance.

Hey, I've heard that some cities are letting regular people decide how to spend their money. Which Finnish city is leading the way in giving citizens control over spending decisions?	"The city had its own ""Ken Livingston moment,"" a reference to the Mayor of London's vehicle congestion charge, which for the Romans meant strict restrictions on vehicles entering Rome by day. Despite this density and the immigration that caused it, Rome, like London, was no parasite. Its artisans and shopkeepers added value to their wares, and they had a sense of pride in their city. Jones thoroughly debunks a popular view of Rome as a city of villas, and of citizens bathing in calm repose amid luxury.
Roman entertainments, roads, buildings, aqueducts, brothels, and food distributions, are the concerns of the second chapter, while the Millennium Dome and the BBC--which the government should ""throw out"" in favor of private initiatives--are his modern targets. Chapter Three tells us how the Roman authorities paid for all this--they focused not on extorting Roman citizens, but rather on bleeding other people dry using the army. Jones' Mediterranean world ""was in a fairly constant state of conflict either for self-protection or in order to extract the wealth"" of others. (45) Inside Rome, the ruling aristocracy used the revenue to create a sense of personal beneficence and of loyalty among the populace. The contrast Jones creates with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs today begins with its spending of our money--not money taken from strangers--in a way that divorces our ""payments"" from any direct benefit to us. One suggestion Jones offers is whether Queen Elizabeth should provide some kind of Res Gestae for the British people--a return to the quid pro quo of personal benefaction found in Rome. Is Jones serious about trying to support the English state by taxing foreigners, and then distributing the spoils by personal largesse? Is it properly ironic to claim that the ""lesson for our government"" is to ""concentrate on wondering how to screw it [taxes] out of someone else. That's the way to stay in power.""? (50)
Chapter Four shows us how the Romans kept control over this cauldron--the key was to gain and keep the support of the population. We have heard very little of the Greeks so far--the first four chapters are consumed almost totally with the Romans. Chapter five, on the Athenian democracy, sets us on a path to a deeper discussion of the nature of government and of citizen participation."	<urn:uuid:574136f7-986c-4ff4-8876-fff7da28dcdc>	0.0
As someone studying environmental education approaches, I'm curious about why natural outdoor settings are considered effective for teaching environmental literacy?	"It is fair to say that workers’ environmental education is an underdeveloped field, especially in comparison with managerial and technical training and school-based environmental education. At the international level, education of front-line workers is often mentioned in passing and is overlooked when it comes to implementation. The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions has commissioned a series of studies on the educational dimension of environmental protection, and in its next programme of work will directly look at the shop-floor workers and their environmental educational needs.
What follows are several examples gathered through the WEI at Cornell University that illustrate both practice and possibility in worker environmental education.The WEI is a network of managers, trade unionists, environmentalists and government policy officials from 48 countries in all parts of the world, committed to finding ways that workers and the workplace can contribute to environmental solutions. It addresses a wide range of industries from primary extraction to production, service and public-sector enterprises. It provides a means for education and action on environmental matters that seeks to build knowledge at the workplace and in academic institutions that can lead to cleaner and more productive workplaces and better connection between internal and external environments.
Australia: Eco-Skills Modules
The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has developed new approaches to workers’ education for the environment that provides both broad social awareness and specific competencies for employment, especially among young workers.
The ACTU has organized an Environment Training Company with a broad mandate to address a variety of sectors but with an initial focus on land management issues. This focus includes teaching ways to handle reclamation work safely and effectively but also ways to assure compatibility with indigenous peoples and natural environments. With input from trade unionists, environmentalists and employers, the training company developed a set of “Eco-Skills” modules to establish basic environmental literacy among workers from an array of industries. These are integrated with a set of skill competencies that are technical, social and safety oriented.
Eco-Skills modules 1 and 2 contain a broad base of environmental information. They are taught alongside other entry-level training programmes. Levels 3 and higher are taught to people who specialize in work focused on reduction of environmental impacts. The first two Eco-Skills modules are composed of two forty-hour sessions. Trainees attain skills through lectures, group problem-solving sessions and practical hands-on techniques. Workers are assessed through written and oral presentations, group work and role plays."	<urn:uuid:401231d1-79b1-4797-89df-69e27ea2515b>	0.0

By focusing on waste segregation, proper packaging, safe transportation and storage, appropriate treatment and disposal methods, and ongoing training and education, healthcare facilities can protect public health, minimize environmental impact, and maintain a high standard of waste management practices.
Regular Monitoring of Waste Management Practices
Regular monitoring of waste management practices is crucial to ensure ongoing compliance and identify any deviations from established protocols. Healthcare facilities should implement internal monitoring systems to assess the effectiveness of waste management procedures. This may include regular assessments of waste segregation, packaging, labeling, transportation, storage, and treatment processes. By monitoring waste management practices, healthcare facilities can identify areas for improvement and address any issues promptly.
Conducting Audits and Inspections to Identify Areas for Improvement
In addition to internal monitoring, conducting audits and inspections provides an external perspective on waste management practices. Audits and inspections involve independent evaluators assessing compliance with regulations, standards, and best practices. These assessments may be conducted by regulatory agencies, third-party organizations, or internal audit teams. By performing audits and inspections, healthcare facilities gain valuable insights into their waste management processes, identify gaps or deficiencies, and highlight areas that require improvement.
Addressing Non-Compliance Issues Promptly and Implementing Corrective Actions
When non-compliance issues are identified during monitoring, audits, or inspections, it is essential to address them promptly and implement corrective actions. Non-compliance may involve inadequate waste segregation, improper packaging, transportation violations, or other breaches of waste management protocols. Healthcare facilities should have a system in place to document and investigate non-compliance incidents thoroughly."	<urn:uuid:2a624f0c-672b-4fad-8a81-d7cbfd2d1c45>	0.0

The Dragon-killer motif is also Mesopotamian, being a core theme in the Gilgamesh Epic, in the story of Ishtar and Tammuz. Tammuz was a diety of agriculture and flocks, personifying the creative powers of spring. His consort was the goddess Ishtar who is reported to have gone into the underworld to recover him when he died (as Isis recovered the body of her husband, Osiris or as Persephone helped restoreTheseus and Alcestis.).

What factors affect forecast accuracy in polar regions vs temperature measurements?	"Technology Projects > Ocean Acoustics and Modelling > Introduction
NIOT has developed expertise in the area of Ocean Acoustics in the last one and half decades and development of acoustic systems for ocean applications, ambient noise measurements in Indian deep and coastal waters and Polar regions, and underwater acoustic systems for source localization and strategic applications have been accomplished successfully. Further extensive data analysis on ocean ambient noise characterization and noise modelling have been carried out. A vector sensor and array has been developed and demonstrated successfully and is being enhanced towards coastal surveillance applications. The group also maintains an NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories) accredited Acoustic Test Facility (ATF) for testing and calibration of underwater acoustic transducers.
Presently the group is focusing on
Ambient Noise Measurement System (ANMS) for polar region and Arctic measurements
Developed an autonomous ANMS for measurements in the Polar region for studying ice dynamics, bioacoustics, meteorological and other anthropogenic noise, through long term measurements, towards understanding climate change. The first autonomous Ambient Noise Measurement System (ANMS)for polar region was developed and deployed successfully along with IndARC mooring in July 2015 at Kongsfjorden Svalbard, Arctic with the support of OOS NIOT and NCPOR. The system is retrieved and redeployed in summer every year and four years data have already been obtained. ANMS was successfully deployed as an independent mooring in 2018
The retrieved data for the period July 2015 to July 2019 has been quality checked, analyzed and interpreted. Sound scape of Kongsfjorden has been analysed and variability in noise levels during open water and ice covered condition is examined. Sound propagation modeling is carried out to understand the variability in ambient noise levels. Ice melting in winter identified and causative factors analysed. Papers have been published in high rated peer reviewed journals including Nature- Scientific reports
Development of Deep Water Ambient Noise Measurement System (DANMS) and measurements in deep waters.
The objective is to record time series of ambient noise data in deep sea Indian ocean region particularly to gain knowledge on noise variability and noise field in deep water, for acoustic oceanographic and strategic applications. A deep water system was acquired and deployed as part of OMNI buoy of OOS, in Arabian sea and one year data obtained. Further indigenous development of DANMS has been accomplished."	<urn:uuid:900593fb-841c-48ec-9a09-25143dd9f365>	0.0

I run an after-school program focusing on STEM education and want to combine music-making with safety education. How can we integrate mathematical concepts into instrument creation while ensuring proper safety protocols for different age groups?	"BALDWIN HILLS (CBSLA.com) — A Head Start preschool in Baldwin Hills received iPads this week to provide children with an early learning math program implemented at 10 Los Angeles Universal Preschool sites.
The school, which is part of a federal program that promotes learning for children under 5 years old for low-income families, is implementing the Pre-K ST Math program to develop foundations in math as defined by the California Department of Education, including counting, identifying shapes and understanding addition and subtraction concepts.
The nonprofit MIND Research Institute created the program for 1,400 preschoolers, thanks to a $200,000 grant from the W.M. Keck Foundation.
“We’re grateful to the Keck Foundation for sharing our vision of ensuring all children have the mathematical skills necessary to not just succeed in school but to become problem solvers and innovative thinkers,” Matthew Peterson, Ph.D., cofounder and Chief Operating Officer of MIND Research Institute, said in a statement in September. “I’m particularly excited about the opportunities of compounding the learning effects by focusing on preschool age children.”
The three-year grant will also provide professional development sessions by MIND Research staff for 20 preschool teachers, who can then use the learning program to establish a blended learning environment in their classrooms that combines group lessons, and individual, self-paced work on computers.
“At LAUP, our mission is to provide an affordable and accessible quality preschool education to 4-year-olds living in LA County, because all children deserve a year of engaging, thought-provoking learning activities to ensure their kindergarten readiness,” Celia C. Ayala, CEO of LAUP, said. “Young children are naturally curious and drawn to exploration, scientific discovery and patterns, and we are excited for this grant opportunity from the MIND Research Institute and the Keck Foundation to help more children become better prepared for their future academic success.”
The LAUP is a nonprofit network of more than 300 preschool sites, established to fund a free or low-cost, quality preschool education to better prepare children to succeed in school."	<urn:uuid:0b322ab8-cad6-49b7-aa6c-a455992669a5>	0.0

what happens at grain boundaries during material separation process carbides	"The sleeve may be coated with a finished coating, which gives a surface having a Rockwell hardness of around ""C"" 40 or greater. Such coatings can be formed from heavy metal carbides such as tungsten carbide, cemented carbides and tungsten carbide based cemented carbides with the addition of titanium, tantilum, and niobium carbides, silicon carbides and columbium carbide, cobalt, nickel, nickel-chromium-boron alloys and the like. There may also be present minor amounts of chromium oxide, calcium oxide, silica and magnesia. Cobalt, nickel, or nickel-chromium-boron alloys are usually present as a soft metal binder or matrix for cementing the tungsten carbide type materials. Also, other coatings may be used such as zinc, both pure and containing six percent antimony, aluminum, high carbon steel, tin, chromium, copper, bronze, brass, babbitt, cadmium, nickel, monel, stainless steel, silver, gold, molybdenum, tantilum, nichrome and the like.
The coating is applied to a sleeve having a thickness that is substantially greater than that of a foil, which is preferably any type of noncorroding material, that has been prepared for maximum adhesion. The thickness of the sleeve required for coating is generally around at least 1.5 mm (0.05 in.). The preparation techniques include threading, grooving and blasting with sharp sand or steel grit to present a clean, fresh surface of sufficient roughness to furnish good anchorage for the coating.
The hard coating is applied to the prepared surface of the sleeve by the spray process known as powder spray metalizing, although wire spray metalizing can be used where the hard metallic materials are available in wire form and flame plating, plasma arc spraying and sputtering may also be used. After the cylindrical sleeve has been spray coated with at least 0.001 inch (0.0254 mm) of coating, the surface is treated to remove a fraction of the coating. This finished treatment is by brushing, grinding, sanding or polishing. Such a treatment gives the surface a finish ranging from a mat finish to a mirror finish.

how does romantic imagination compare objective realism proust work perspective	"Walfrido Garcia, son of artist Edgardo Garcia, learned at an early age to use his God-given talent to evoke beautiful emotions by translating visions from his imagination to a permanent form. Through years of apprenticeship and formal art education, he quickly learned how to manipulate light, form, color and detail. He has been teaching art since the age of seventeen, and he is a widely sought after instructor/demonstrator in the Bay Area. In his mid-twenties, the future looks very promising for this talented man.
Having spent most his life near the ocean, he combines his two most cherished activities: surfing and painting. Through his first-hand knowledge of the sea, he is able to capture its realism while his style emphasizes its romance, mystery and grandeur. Walfrido divides his time between Hawaii and California.
Considering himself a ""romantic realist,"" Walfrido uses an unusual style that pays close attention to the delicacies of light and color. Light is the most influential element in his work, reflecting the artist's relationship with God. When viewing his work, one gets swept away to a place where the light caresses the gentle, rolling waves as they greet the powder-soft sand.
Walfrido uses his skills as a photographer and video-grapher to aid in his creative pursuits. In the first stages of his work, Garcia forms the relationship between light, color and shapes. The next colors are glazed on with meticulous brush strokes to form details. When all is done, the highlights are applied to give the work a special glow. This makes his work appealing to the connoisseur as well as the first-time buyer."	<urn:uuid:b99e1f3a-3b1e-4c7c-9645-561aaa1b98cb>	0.0
where has musician charlie romo performed trying to find venues concerts appearances	"This was followed in 2008 by the autobiographical collection co-penned with David Preston, ""Lifejacket"", also on Linn Records. In 2009 Shaw recorded his long-awaited solo album, “Somewhere Towards Love” (Splash Point Records) which continues to represent beautifully his increasingly popular solo shows.
Shaw’s career in performance began unusually for a jazz musician on the Alternative Cabaret Circuit, alongside such performers as Julian Clary, Rory Bremner and Jo Brand. Shaw was spotted by Dave Illic, jazz critic for City Limits and was described as “the voice of the decade”.
During the next few years Shaw moved from the singer-pianist format to working with his new band to an eventual move into jazz. Shaw has toured extensively in the UK - regular venues include the Purcell Room, Queen Elizabeth Hall, Blackheath Concert Halls, Ronnie Scott's, The Vortex, the Jazz Café and The Barbican. Ian has played at all of the major jazz festivals in the UK including Cork, Brecon, Liverpool, Birmingham, Edinburgh (where he was nominated for a Perrier Award), Grimsby, Glasgow, Cheltenham, Scarborough, Swanage and St. Ives.

I love learning about traditional drinks - what's the main difference between how sake and sherry are aged, particularly the manzanilla type?	"18 Dec 2012
Old Pulteney 1974 (G&M)
Posted by: Ruben Luyten In: Old Pulteney
Old Pulteney 1974
(43%, Gordon & MacPhail 2009)
Nose: starts coastal and slightly sour, but folds open nicely and displays everything a good sherry cask should have. Figs, leather, polished oak… with an above average amount of mint and coastal notes (wet limestone, sea breeze). Lovely notes of tropical fruits as well (papaya, kumquat). Excellent. Mouth: still some lovely fruity notes (oranges, tangerine) and fruit tea with an oaky sourness. Interesting balance of sweet & sour (I love Madeira). The oak is loud although it’s not excessively dry. Fades on soft herbs, liquorice and a hint of mustard seed and Manzanilla sherry. Finish: medium long, with Seville oranges and the same oaky touches.
I’ve never had such an old Pulteney, but this was really interesting. Especially for nosing, as the oak is a little disturbing on the palate. Sold out but occasionally seen in auctions."	<urn:uuid:2505e4c8-fafe-4cad-8dae-17ee50874344>	0.0

Cuba, Puerto Rico, and America all share the same colors on the flag, and I share all the same colors in the complex, layered concept of my identity.

cattle methane natural balance reduction technologies	"The California Air Resources Board has approved a new regulation aimed at curbing methane emissions from oil and gas operations.
The new regulation is expected to reduce methane leaks from oil and gas operations in California by the equivalent of 1.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, and requires quarterly monitoring of methane emissions from oil and gas wells, natural gas processing facilities, compressor stations and other equipment used in the processing and delivery of oil and natural gas. Some equipment will also be required to add vapor collection systems.
The new regulation adds to emergency regulations that were put in place by the Department of Conservation’s Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources after the methane leak in the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage field. Those regulations require additional monitoring and testing at all underground natural gas storage facilities, making it easier to prevent well leaks.
“This new tool to curb methane emissions complements the rigorous safety and inspection requirements now in place at all gas storage fields in California,” said David Bunn, director of the Department of Conservation. “Not only is California working to prevent another major methane leak like the one at Aliso Canyon, it’s important that we also reduce the cumulative impacts of smaller leaks.”
Although the largest source of methane in California is livestock, the oil and gas industry is responsible for about 15 percent of the state’s methane emissions.
Adoption of this oil and gas rule is a step toward implementing the state’s Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Strategy, which provides guidance for development and implementation of California’s overall effort to reduce highly potent climate pollutants. SB 1383 sets the target for statewide methane reductions of 40 percent below 2013 levels by 2030."	<urn:uuid:5e480eb7-ee4d-4828-a77a-4fb3ce3ee2d1>	0.0

How do protein supplement guidelines compare across different types?	"- Lack of wet food; all dogs may not prefer grain-free dry foods only
American Journey Dog Food 101: FAQ
American journey dog food recall
American journey dog food is one of the most popular dog food brands among many pet owners in the USA. The fact that it provides a fully balanced diet for your dog at a very affordable price makes it a perfect choice for every dog owner. Also, the variety and the ingredients used make it very reliable. But still, there are some things like the usage of controversial ingredients and some ingredients that are actually considered harmful puts many customers in a dilemma. The fact that American journey dog food has never been recalled makes it very convincing for the customers.
American journey dog food ingredients
The main ingredients used in making American journey dog food are:
Deboned chicken, turkey meal, chicken meal, Peas, Chickpeas, Sweet Potatoes, Pea Protein, Dried Beet Pulp, Chicken Fat, Flaxseed, Natural Flavor, Salmon Oil, Menhaden fish meal, blueberries, salt, carrots, dried kelp, choline, fructoolingosaccharides, chloride, mixed tocopherols, vitamin E supplement, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, zinc proteinate, iron proteinate, niacin supplement, yucca schidigera extract, copper sulfate, sodium selenite, potassium chloride, calcium panthothenate, riboflavin supplement, copper proteinate, manganese sulfate, manganese proteinate, thiamine mononitrate, Vitamin A supplement, vitamin B12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, Folic acid, vitamin D3 supplement, calcium iodate, dried bacillus, rosemary extract, coagulans fermentation product.
American journey dog food vs taste of the wild
If we compare these two then we have to take some factors into consideration. First is the protein levels. Both of these neurontin best prises products provide an almost similar amount of protein in their dry formula. But Taste of the Wild’s wet formula provides more protein than American Journey dog food. Also, there is fat that should be addressed. Fats are required for the development of the dog’s body and they also provide energy to function throughout the day.
Now, if we compare both of these products then we can say that Taste of the Wild provides significantly more fat than American journey dry dog food."	<urn:uuid:72cd5e00-dde7-4240-aa46-1388b0496a6f>	0.0
What's the connection between childhood trauma and urinary problems?	"The trauma-sensitive schools movement is the result of a confluence of forces that are changing how educators view students' academic and social problems, including the failure of zero-tolerance policies to resolve issues of school safety, bullying, and academic failure, as well as a new understanding of adolescents' disruptive behaviour. In this follow-up to her bestseller, Trauma-Sensitive Schools, Susan Craig provides secondary school teachers and administrators with practical ideas for how to improve students' achievement by implementing a trauma-sensitive approach to instruction. Along with clear explanations of the role that childhood adversity and trauma play in determining academic success, readers will find dozens of concrete strategies to help them: View poor academic and social progress through a trauma-sensitive lens. Create a school climate that fosters safety and resiliency in vulnerable teenagers. Establish relationships with students that support their efforts to self-regulate. Design instruction that reflects the social nature of the brain. Work with the brain's neuroplasticity to increase adolescents' executive functioning. Reduce teacher attrition in high-risk schools by decreasing secondary traumatic stress. Influence educational reforms by aligning them with current research on childhood trauma and its effects on learning. Provides an overview of the effects of three types of trauma on adolescent development: early childhood adversity, community violence, and systemic inequities. The book links the effects of trauma on students' cognitive development to educational reform efforts, integrates research on adolescents' neurodevelopment and current educational best practices, and builds the capacity of education professionals to successfully manage the behaviour of adolescents with symptoms of complex developmental trauma.

What does research show about the patterns of transmission for people who get infected with West Nile virus compared to those with measles-related brain inflammation?	"119]||- Clonally expanded T cells from the CSF of MS patients recognize viral motifs||- No difference between MS and healthy subjects in the level of TTMV infection|
|CMV||[120-124]||- T cells specific for CMV- elicited inflammation and worse demyelination in MS animal models|
- CMV has been found in demyelinating plaques and in the CSF of MS patients
- Enrichment of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells in chronic inflammatory lesions of the MS brain
|- CMV infection is associated with anti-inflammatory activities, which could lead to a less severe disease course|
- CMV infection acquired during childhood reduced the risk of developing MS or CIS in subjects up to 18 years
|Measles||[125,126]||- Measles antibody titers were significantly higher in blood samples of MS than in control cases|
- Higher levels of measles antibodies in CSF were found in more disabled patients with a malignant disease course
|- No correlation was found between the presence and level of serum anti-measles antibodies and anti-MBP T cell activity|
- The measles vaccination is not associated with MS
|Rubella||[127,128]||- Rubella virus multiplies to low titer in glial cell cultures derived from rats, and induces damage to oligodendrocytes and myelin||- No evidence|
|Coronavirus||||- Some coronaviruses are neurotropic and disrupt the blood-brain barrier, causing immune-mediated demyelinating-like lesions in rodents||- No evidence|
|HSV-1||[130-132]||- HSV-1 antibodies were found in the CSF of MS patients||- Prior HSV-1 immunity could be protective against MS|
Convergent evidence points to the role of EBV in neuroinflammation. Common patterns were observed in the epidemiology of infectious mononucleosis (IM) and MS[10,11]. MS risk is about 2-3 folds higher among individuals with a clinical history of IM, as compared with those without a history[12,13]. Compelling evidence has demonstrated that individuals who are not infected with EBV rarely, if ever, develop MS."	<urn:uuid:ddd221b5-1f55-499e-af76-d42d95b478ec>	0.0

What's taught about German culture and Aquinas's influence on European thinking?	"Blaga completed his undergraduate degree in 1917 and enrolled in the PhD program in philosophy at the University of Vienna. During this time he published his first two books, a book of poetry and a book of aphorisms, which sold well in Romania and helped him finance his studies. He successfully defended his dissertation in November of 1920. It was titled Kultur und Erkenntnis (Culture and Knowledge).
Blaga’s life experiences growing up in a multicultural region (Transylvania was populated by Romanians, Hungarians, Germans, Gypsies, and several smaller minority groups); experiencing the contrast between the peasant village and the modern city; and studying Eastern Orthodox theology and liturgy side by side with European philosophy, history, and science spawned in him a philosophical outlook that gives prominent place to philosophy of culture. Within the broad framework of culture Blaga finds places for science, art, history, and religion.
Blaga’s philosophical system interacts with the theories of classical and contemporary philosophers and intellectuals. These range from the pre-Socratics through early twentieth century philosophers like William James, Edmund Husserl, and Henri Bergson, and also intellectuals such as Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, and Paul Tillich. The influence of Plotinus, Kant, and the German Romantics is clearly evident. But Blaga’s philosophy is not merely an attempt to synthesize the insights of other thinkers. It is a systematic and integrated attempt to address the issues that occupied the leading minds of his day.
Blaga’s early philosophical career involved research and publication rather than teaching. He published many articles and a number of books, and served as an editor for several literary magazines. His publications range from fiction to philosophy. His first book of philosophy, Filosofia stilului (The Philosophy of Style), was published in 1924. He also served his country as a statesman. In 1936 he was inducted into the Romanian Academy (a prestigious research institution). Finally in 1938 a special chair of philosophy of culture was created in his honor at the University of Cluj, a leading Romanian university in Transylvania. His inaugural essay was titled Despre plenitudinea istorica (Concerning Historical Fullness). He taught at the University of Cluj until 1949, when he was removed from his post by the newly installed Socialist government of Romania."	<urn:uuid:6376d82c-d243-403b-8b18-bf9f5612108e>	0.0
practical applications enzyme behavior constants	"In conventional statistics, the standard deviation measuring the amount of variation in this mean value is defined as:
This standard deviation is then used to calculate the two token rate and bucket size values as follows:
Here, this embodiment of the invention includes the determination of the various constants K1–K8 by any method. For instance, the constants K1–K8 can be determined empirically using rate samples from a number of DDOS attacks, or experimentally by establishing different values for each constant and determining the effectiveness of the resulting TokenRate and TokenDepth values for blocking DDOS attacks. Finally, the constants K1–K8 can be determined analytically using various mathematical criteria.
Calculating this standard deviation statistic requires the computer 10 to buffer T samples for each bin. As T must be statistically significant in order to represent an adequate measure of the degree to which a bin count can vary, a large amount of memory may be required. To alleviate this drawback, an alternate embodiment seeks to approximate σ in a less computationally intensive manner. Subsequent to the calculations of process (1) above, an approximation of the standard deviation is assessed:
for (i=1, N)
for (i=1, N)
Here, a standard error statistic is calculated for each bin as a function of the difference between the percent of current traffic falling into that bin, and the percent of traffic that has historically fallen into that bin. Note that this is similar to the standard deviation statistic for each bin, which is a function of the difference between the bin count and the average of all bin count samples for that bin. Note also that equation (4) requires the buffering of T bin counts for every bin, whereas equation (9) does not. The stderr(i) quantity can then be used as a less computationally intensive approximation of σ in equations (5)–(8).
The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the present invention are presented for purposes of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Obviously, many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical applications, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.

As someone who does regular testing, I'm wondering how different measuring devices compare in terms of accuracy - are specialized high-end devices really worth it compared to standard ones?	"Some expensive electronics or mechanical devices are designed to be shock-resistant. However, the manufacturers often market the level of shock-resistance in units of g-force (I know g-force is really a measure of acceleration). I'm not really convinced that that's the proper unit.
In fact, the Wikipedia article for mechanical shock describes shock as a sudden acceleration or deceleration. Here, the term ""sudden"" seems to imply that the acceleration or deceleration is not constant during a shock, which would mean that there should be a jerk component to the equation that describes the movement or position of the object as a function of time.
So here are my three related questions:
- Is shock better expressed as g-force per second? If not, why (i.e. why is g-force a better unit)?
- When you bang a smaller object that is reasonably rigid (e.g. a wristwatch with stainless steel case and bracelet) against another object that is reasonably massive, immovable, and rigid (e.g. a brick wall), how does the plot of position as a function of time actually look like, supposing we can record time and distances with extreme precision?
- Do common mechanical devices suffer mostly from high acceleration or from high jerk?
Update The ISO 1413 shock resistance standard seems to give some clues. The testing procedure consists of letting a 3 kg hard plastic hammer traveling at 4.43 m/s hit a watch. Which suggests that we really care about the instantaneous transfer of energy or of momentum. But how fast does the transfer happen? Is it in the millisecond or nanosecond granularity?"	<urn:uuid:b0658576-cc5f-4ebb-9826-d1c931dda370>	0.0
What advice did Ravana give before his death?	"So Ravnos from CbR is Dracian from WoD Gypsies, and ""Ravnos"" from WoD Gypsies is probably Ravana who was destroyed in Bangladesh, or possibly another 3rd generation Ravnos, if there are any others who have survived this long, or if there were any others at all.
Also, according to the Erycies Fragments, there were 6 of the Second Generation (the other 3, to my best guess, being Ravnos/Dracian, and the King and Queen of Nod, whom Haqim killed, and with whose blood he embraced himself). Also, in the prophesy of Ravana's death, it refers to the Wanderer, third Childe of Caine, whose descendants destroyed themselves in madness.
So, to conclude, Ravnos was Dracian, of the 2nd generation, he embraced his lover, Ennoia, aka Deanna, mother of the Garou and the gypsies. He also embraced Ravana, and possibly others. Ennoia was of the Ravnos Clan until Caine cast her out for orchestrating Ravnos/Dracian's (although according to WoD Gypsies she was not involved) death at the hands of the rest of the third generation, who ruled the Second City. She then founded Clan Gangrel.

I need strong glue for boats - super glue or resorcinol better?	"- Rub warm water on the glue stain
- Put the toothpaste over the glue and then rub gently with fabric to remove it.
How to Remove Super Glue from Glass Table
Removing super glue trace can be a challenge and sticky work. For the glass table, you may use acetone, as mentioned in previous points. However, you need to pay attention to the following things below:
- Never scratch the glue with nails, as it may damage and ruin your nails.
- Be cautious when using sharp objects such as razors or knives. They may cause scratches if they slipped and hit the glass surface.
- Use acetone as little as possible. There is no need to use the whole bottle of acetone to get rid of the stain. Besides, you may risk drying your skin as it is an alcohol-based product.
- Handle all materials and chemicals carefully. Make sure that you prevent spillage by being as careful as you can while working.
Glue trace is actually a hard mess that’s easy to solve. It can be cleaned easily by using the simple method to remove super glue from the glass above if you do it carefully and properly."	<urn:uuid:3aa41412-472a-45a2-9e2f-804fd0e14aa7>	0.0
How many tries did Jonah Lomu score in World Cup versus regular Tests?	"“It was like the United Nations – we had 11 players from 11 different countries. They called themselves a Band of Brothers,” recalls Dick Best.
“It was a good place to be and a very happy time.”
After back-to-back wins on the road, away to Saracens and Bedford, the Exiles started life at The Stoop with a bang, hammering 1997/98 champions Newcastle Falcons 56-8 in front of 3,951 spectators.
It sent the Exiles top of Allied Dunbar Premiership One for the first time in the club’s history. The Craic was certainly mighty at The Stoop that night.
“That created the momentum and drew people to come and watch us,” says London Irish and Ireland winger Justin Bishop.
For Best, it was a winning yet “bizarre” return to the ground he’d spent 23 years as player, coach and director of rugby, before taking over the reins at London Irish in 1996.
Defeats followed to Wasps, Leicester (by a point) and Northampton Saints, while there was a draw at Bath.
In the first of the season’s battle of landlords versus tenants, it was Quins who came out on top (17-16).
“It was strange,” says Justin Bishop. “When it was our home game the ground was branded up green, and then for their home game it was branded up as Harlequins.”
There were extraordinary revelations at hand after the Quins defeat, with Dick Best confirming that Irish were one of six Premiership sides interested in signing New Zealand World Cup star Jonah Lomu, no less.
The cups provided Irish with some of their sweetest moments that year – none more so than a 47-7 Tetley Bitter Cup Round 5 humbling of Leicester Tigers at The Stoop on 29 January 2000.
Kieran Campbell (2), Rob Gallacher, Neal Hatley and Richard Kirke all crossed, while a “near-faultless” Jarrod Cunningham kicked 22 points.
The Stoop reverberated to the sound of The Fields of Athenry and O’Shea, O’Shea, O’Shea.
“That ranks as one of the best results by that team,” reflects Dick Best. “We were riding high on the field, and it was very enjoyable off it.”
It was Leicester’s worst cup defeat for 28 years."	<urn:uuid:8386bdeb-2c2a-4279-9c2f-6997d6883fc1>	0.0
api separator refinery wastewater treatment purpose	"As a result of the growing fire, the valves controlling a water deluge system designed to cool the sphere became inaccessible to operators and could not be opened.
""The consequences of this accident could have been even more serious, under slightly different circumstances,"" Bresland said. ""Refineries should minimize the presence of hazardous substances near units where they may be exposed to fire hazards and should ensure that emergency systems remain operable if a disaster strikes.""
The CSB made recommendations to the American Petroleum Institute (API), a leading oil industry trade association that develops safety practices that are widely followed in the U.S. and overseas. The CSB called on the API to develop a new recommended practice for freeze-protection of refinery equipment and to improve existing practices related to fireproofing, emergency isolation valves and water deluge systems. The report also called on the refinery's owner to improve freeze protection, fireproofing, hazard analysis and emergency isolation procedures at its 16 North American refineries.
The CSB urged the refinery to implement its strategic plan to eliminate the use of chlorine for water treatment in favor of inherently safer alternatives such as bleach. The CSB also recommended that refinery staff work with United Steelworkers, which represents employees at the plant, to upgrade hazard analysis procedures.
The CSB is an independent federal agency charged with investigating industrial chemical accidents. The agency's board members are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. CSB investigations look into all aspects of chemical accidents, including physical causes such as equipment failure as well as inadequacies in regulations, industry standards and safety management systems.
The CSB does not issue citations or fines but does make safety recommendations to plants, industry organizations, labor groups and regulatory agencies such as OSHA and EPA. Visit the CSB Web site at www.csb.gov."	<urn:uuid:58c1d2cd-632a-423e-a6b0-c44279894836>	0.0
I'm interested in birds and wildlife. How does the dependence between species in tropical rainforests compare to what we see in the Pasvik forest in terms of how animals and birds interact with their environment?	"City of Long Beach prohibits feeding wildlife
June 26, 2014
Hang on for a minute...we're trying to find some more stories you might like.
Email This Story
After learning that birds may contract diseases from eating human food, the city of Long Beach now prohibits visitors from feeding the wildlife, particularly in El Dorado Park.
In a city council meeting on June 17, 5th district Councilwoman Gerrie Schipske discussed how birds play a role in the environment, and how people have a responsibility to maintain their existence.
The Winged Wonders Banner Project, a joint effort between Schipske and the 5th District Lakes, Ponds and Wetlands Taskforce to support birdlife, focused on wildlife in the El Dorado Park Duck Pond.
“I… traditionally thought it was okay to take bread and feed ducks,” Schipske said during the meeting. “What we found in the numerous years of research we did was that the food that we use as humans hurts the wildlife.”
To prevent people from feeding birds human food, banners with information were posted around the park, such as images of the 22 bird species living in the park, their calls and their diets.
“The focus of this project was to try to figure out a way to educate the public about the importance of the birds and the wildlife that live in the duck pond,” Schipske said.
Cornell Lab of Ornithology, a nonprofit organization that studies and conserves birds, also contributed to the cause by giving Long Beach the rights to use the information that is currently on the banners. The organization provided sounds of different ducks that people could listen to on their cellphone by calling a number located on a banner if they want to familiarize bird songs.
At the meeting, Schipske also showed a video clip showing wildlife, signs that were put up and her interviewing El Dorado Audubon Society member Mary Parsell.
“One thing that we did early is take a census to keep track of what birds are here,” Parsell said. “And really, we have birds that are here year- round, and we have migratory birds that come through.”
Parsell then mentioned that birds should be left to eat the plants and animals they find in the grass or water. Parsell said she is opposes feeding bread to the birds.
“I think they can’t digest it,” Parsell said."	<urn:uuid:2e7bebbb-d29c-44f7-b01d-9f43098e7058>	0.0
What led to the beginning of the Space Race?	"Q: You did the programming for 5 of Mattel’s earliest handhelds there: Auto Race, Baseball, Brain Baffler, Football, and Horoscope Computer. Were these the only handhelds (released or otherwise) you worked on? Did you work on any that weren’t released?
Mark Lesser: I also programmed Missile Attack, which was a variation of the Auto Race program. The game involved protecting a city from attack. Later this was changed to Flash Gordon which was just a different theme. I don't know if either was actually released (Ed. According to the info on this page - http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Mattel/FlashGordon.htm it was never released as Flash Gordon. However, it did see release as Missile Attack originally, and then Battlestar Galactica or Battlestar Galactica: Space Alert).
Missile Attack http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Mattel/MissileAttack.htm
Battlestar Galactica http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Mattel/Battlestar.htm
Plus a US Magazine version! http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Mattel/Proto.html)
Q: Auto Race has the distinction of being the first all-electronic game. How did Rockwell (and yourself) come to be involved with programming these? And did you write the programs or did you port code written by others (such as George Klose and Richard Cheng)?
Mark Lesser: Mattel approached Rockwell with the idea of converting a calculator into a handheld game, and George Klose and Richard Cheng came up with a one sheet description of an auto race game, using blips of light. They had the general idea of what the game should look like, but no one had any concept of how to implement the game, or even if it was feasible much less marketable. I started by consulting with the engineers at Rockwell to determine what chip we had that might be modified to implement such a game. We came up with one of the simple handheld LED calculator chips which had 511 bytes of ROM space for a program. This chip would need to be redesigned to allow for a display of the playing field and the score digits and to make sounds and read the input switches. It was up to me to do the actual chip redesign and to write the program from scratch."	<urn:uuid:04156b39-39fe-4f9d-adf1-f75ea9b3c8a7>	0.0
How many cuneiform tablets from Nippur are in the Hermitage collection?	"A history of Zero
|Ancient Indian Mathematics index||History Topics Index|
The first thing to say about zero is that there are two uses of zero which are both extremely important but are somewhat different. One use is as an empty place indicator in our place-value number system. Hence in a number like 2106 the zero is used so that the positions of the 2 and 1 are correct. Clearly 216 means something quite different. The second use of zero is as a number itself in the form we use it as 0. There are also different aspects of zero within these two uses, namely the concept, the notation, and the name. (Our name ""zero"" derives ultimately from the Arabic sifr which also gives us the word ""cipher"".)
Neither of the above uses has an easily described history. It just did not happen that someone invented the ideas, and then everyone started to use them. Also it is fair to say that the number zero is far from an intuitive concept. Mathematical problems started as 'real' problems rather than abstract problems. Numbers in early historical times were thought of much more concretely than the abstract concepts which are our numbers today. There are giant mental leaps from 5 horses to 5 ""things"" and then to the abstract idea of ""five"". If ancient peoples solved a problem about how many horses a farmer needed then the problem was not going to have 0 or -23 as an answer.
One might think that once a place-value number system came into existence then the 0 as an empty place indicator is a necessary idea, yet the Babylonians had a place-value number system without this feature for over 1000 years. Moreover there is absolutely no evidence that the Babylonians felt that there was any problem with the ambiguity which existed. Remarkably, original texts survive from the era of Babylonian mathematics. The Babylonians wrote on tablets of unbaked clay, using cuneiform writing. The symbols were pressed into soft clay tablets with the slanted edge of a stylus and so had a wedge-shaped appearance (and hence the name cuneiform). Many tablets from around 1700 BC survive and we can read the original texts."	<urn:uuid:36642d73-15f0-4d00-b82d-f3e3fb3b1a60>	0.0
buffer capacity fixed size expand overflow exception when happens	"Foxit fixed a vulnerability in its PDF reader product yesterday, eight days after it was discovered that an attacker could have leveraged to insert malicious code into documents.
Version 5.4.5 of Reader addresses a boundary error in the program’s Web browser plugin, “npFoxitReaderPlugin.dl.” If left unpatched the vulnerability could have caused a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing an overly long file name and allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code. Vulnerability firm Secunia classified the flaw as highly critical at the time, warning it affected all versions of Foxit.
The company initially fixed the issue last Friday when it released a patched version of the plugin, 184.108.40.206 for Firefox.

carolingian renaissance alcuin york contribution education literature language development	"Alcuin School, a leader in Montessori and International Baccalaureate education, hosted a successful turnout at its recent Open House on Sunday, Jan. 11. During the event, prospetive parents got an opportunity to learn how Alcuin inspires ""Passonite Learners and Innovative Thinkers"" to excel. Highlights included remarks from Walter Sorensen, Head of School, campus tours, and classroom visits with faculty. For more info visit www.alcuinschool.org.
Alcuin School provides a proven effective, progressive education for its students which begins in the Toddler program and extends into the high school years with the acclaimed IB Programme.
The IB Diploma Programme is an integrated curriculum with study in six subject areas, compared to a single-subject focus of other programs and assessments. Students must use their content knowledge to solve problems, make conjectures and inferences, and think deeply about the big questions of the disciplines.
In recent years, Texas has experienced tremendous growth in IB curriculum within the state. According to Texas IB Schools (TIBS), Texas has one of the highest concentrations of IB World Schools in the world. TIBS suggests that if Texas were a country, it would be ranked five out of 144 in total IB World Schools, behind the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.
Studies show that students who participated in the IB are better prepared for university studies, perform better when they are there, are more likely to graduate (and graduate sooner) than other students. In addition, they are also more likely to enroll in selective institutions.
In addition to hearing more about how IB gives students an academic advantage, guests learned how Montessori education serves as an excellent transition to the IB curriculum. Although there are more than 1,119,000 IB students enrolled at 3,747 schools in 146 countries, fewer than 10 schools combine the advantages of Montessori and IB in the way the programs are implemented at Alcuin.
About Alcuin School
A vibrant, nurturing, coeducational academic community serving students from toddler to 12th grade, Alcuin School uses the Montessori and International Baccalaureate program methods to foster critical thinking and a lifelong passion for learning. With faculty support, students at Alcuin School are eager to embrace change, question the status quo, and prepare for their future as leaders in a global society.

What's the relationship between extreme weather and food security, both historically and today?	"The need to address sustainability in the built environment is being accelerated by external concerns. Some of these are environmental and resource issues, rising energy prices, climate change, indoor environmental quality, international pressure, energy security, and natural disasters that seem to be happening more frequently than ever before. Sustainability focuses on the distant future. Resiliency focuses more on the present, e.g. How do we keep our buildings functioning during floods, long power outages, or protect building occupants from smoke and odors during wildfires?
There is a new chapter on Climate Change in ASHRAE’s 2021 Handbook of Fundamentals. I was pleased to be a member of the International Task Force that developed that chapter. Historically, designers and planners assumed a stable climate, and heating and cooling designs were based on statistics calculated from past weather data, typically for a recent 30 year period. We are now experiencing major global changes in climate at rates 10 times greater than seen since the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago – over decades instead of centuries or millennia.
Relative to indoor air quality (IAQ), a recent survey conducted by Honeywell Building Technologies between March and May 2021 revealed the challenges, concerns and priorities of facility managers. Globally, six in 10 respondents, for example, are now more likely to invest in technologies that optimize IAQ and other aspects of occupant health and safety, while 63% are more willing than pre-COVID-19 to implement smart building solutions that help drive efficiency or support sustainability.
Climate and Weather
Chronic changes in climate increase the stress or demand on buildings and systems. Acute events, e.g., heat waves/domes, sustained high night-time temperature and humidity, extreme rainfall, drought, wildfires, etc. affect near-term operational performance, occupant comfort and health, long-term energy efficiency, and productivity.
Mitigation reduces the impact of buildings and systems on the environment. It is relatively specific. Adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate that seeks to moderate or avoid harm, and exploit beneficial opportunities. Adaptation has an interconnected relationship with mitigation and resilience.
Mitigating Climate Change
- Periodic building audits and retro-commissioning need to be done frequently.
- Proper commissioning of retro-fitted systems in existing buildings, and all systems in new buildings must be done."	<urn:uuid:1a7a6333-b645-4c47-9a0f-61fad34a4ee9>	0.0

How are Newfoundland dogs and Maremma Sheepdogs different in terms of their traditional work roles near water?	"The Akbash dog is found today in rural Turkey, and as far as can
be determined, has been serving as a livestock protection dog
in Turkey for millenia.
The Maremma is directly descended from the first flock guardians
that migrated for the Middle East, probably across the Adriatic
from Greece. The Maremma has a solid, muscular build, thick white
coat, large head, black nose, and typically weighs between 65
to 110 pounds.
The Polish Tatra Sheepdog is a breed of dog introduced into the
Tatra Mountain region of Southern Poland by Wallachian shepherds,
probably in the 14th Century, and used to guard and herd sheep.
The Tatras are large white dogs with heavy dense fur, similar
in appearance to the Hungarian Kuvasz.
The Tibetan Mastiff is an ancient breed, descended from very early
large Tibetan dogs from which most of today's Mastiff dogs descend.
It is among the largest breeds and is found in a heavier mastiff
type and a moderately sized mountain type. Its double coat is
long and found in a wide variety of colors from solid black to
tri-color with the rarest being white.
The National Wildlife Research Center in Utah has imported several new breeds of livestock guardian dogs to see if they are more effective at deterring predation from ""bigger"" predators such as grizzly bears and wolves. The new breeds are larger and more aggressive, yet still people-friendly. One of these newer breeds is the Kangal from Turkey.
Rearing guardian dog pups with sheep creates an attachment or
bond between the dog and the sheep. As the dog matures, it spends
much of its time near the sheep and repels other animals that
enter its personal space. Its aggressiveness is limited by a decrease
tendancy to chase, a product of generations of selection for dogs
that do not chase. Even if the dog chases an intruding coyote
away, it soons stops the chase and returns to the flock.
Most livestock guardian dogs are large and imposing, weighing
75 to over 100 pounds. They are large enough to startle or intimidate
Livestock guardian dogs should be taught basic commands, such
as come, sit, and stay, and should learn to walk on a leash. However,
the should not be allowed the privileges of a pet. Their job is
to bond with the sheep, not the shepherd."	<urn:uuid:d8bc11a0-ca63-403e-b35d-fd0d471a9fb1>	0.0
How do Arctic Ocean methane releases compare between gas hydrates and pingo-like features?	"Japan is celebrating a groundbreaking science experiment in the Arctic permafrost that may eventually reshape the country's fragile economy and Tokyo's relationships with the outside world.
For an unprecedented six straight days, a state-backed drilling company has managed to extract industrial quantities of natural gas from underground sources of methane hydrate - a form of gas-rich ice once thought to exist only on the moons of Saturn.
In fact, the seabeds around the Japanese coast turn out to conceal massive deposits of the elusive sorbet-like compound in their depths, and a country that has long assumed it had virtually no fossil fuels could now be sitting on energy reserves containing 100 years' fuel. Critically for Japan, which imports 99.7 per cent of the oil, gas and coal needed to run its vast economy, the lumps of energy-filled ice offer the tantalising promise of a little energy independence.
Can't really fault the Japanese for wanting to get at this stuff, but there are lots and lots of environmental problems associated with methane mining, which I have written about here. My favorite is the (admittedly small) possibility to a catastrophic release of methane, a nasty if short-lived greenhouse gas. To ask ""Can we mine [methane hydrates] without triggering a disaster that makes the K-T event look mild by comparison""? may overstate the danger, but even Japanese scientists are worried that drilling into the unstable deposits off their country's coast might trigger ""massive landslides"" on the ocean floor, thus setting hydrates loose in the atmosphere.
A couple of points in conclusion. Firstly, the Palaeocene/Eocene thermal maximum was a time of mass extinction thought to have been caused in part by a vast release of methane hydrate, so doomsday warnings like the one above are not entirely ungrounded. Secondly, the ""underground source"" noted in the piece is almost certainly the Mallik research well, located in the Mackenzie Delta in the Northwest Territories. This experiment is a Japanese/Canadian co-venture. Your tax dollars at work."	<urn:uuid:19133527-29d2-4775-9bc4-69ce239ce10b>	0.0
how does royal bc museum research endangered species and what is their role in conservation tourism	"Working with Peruvian and Bolivian partners, including Asociación Ecosistemas Andinos (ECOAN) in Peru, and Asociación Armonía, and Instituto de Ecología in Bolivia, ABC has helped to reduce the extinction threat these birds face. Those efforts include:
- In the Vilcanota Mountains of the Peruvian Andes, ABC has worked with ECOAN and more than 20 communities to protect and restore threatened Polylepis woodlands for the Royal Cinclodes, White-browed Tit-Spinetail, and Ash-breasted Tit-Tyrant. As a result of this work, we have planted more than 650,000 Polylepis trees, established seven community-owned and managed Private Conservation Areas covering more than 15,500 acres, and established a $2 million endowment to aid Polylepis forest conservation in this area.
- In Bolivia, ABC has supported work by Armonía and the Insituto de Ecología to protect and restore Polylepis woodlands for the Royal Cinclodes and Ash-breasted Tit-Tyrant.
- In both Peru and Bolivia, ABC has assisted our partners in providing fuel-efficient stoves to communities to reduce their demand for fuel wood and reduce pressure on habitat for endangered birds.
- At Lake Junín, ABC has supported ECOAN’s work to improve the management of wetlands for the Junín Grebe, Junín Rail, and other wildlife, resulting in the production of a management plan for the lake, available for download at ECOAN’s website.
- In northern Peru, ABC and ECOAN provided training on bird monitoring, tourism, and other skills to staff at the Bosque Pomac Historic Sanctuary, benefiting management and monitoring for this reserve’s population of Peruvian Plantcutter.
Currently, there are about 600 foreign species listed under the ESA, compared to about 1,390 species native to the United States, including 90 birds.

I've been looking into ALS treatments and wondering about food interactions with medications. What's the deal with meal timing when taking riluzole, and are there any specific foods to avoid?	"They may improve your feelings and may lower your variety of doctor's visits.
Unlike canned produce, fresh vegetables and fruit contain various nutrients. Though you wish to eat a balanced diet, you need to consider getting a quality multiProbiotic and/or Prebiotic supplements to improve your daily diet.
Supplementing nutritional Probiotics is more important now than before. Many of the things in a supermarket are over-processed, removing most of the nutrients inside the original ingredients. Going for a good, natural multiProbiotic will replace what your food may be lacking.
When taking calcium carbonate, which will help with bone and tooth health, carry it with meals. Calcium citrate may be ingested on empty stomachs, but calcium carbonate requires food to become eaten by using it. When taken alone, it won't absorb easily and become wasted.
Lots of medications, store-bought or prescription, can react negatively when taken in tandem with Probiotic supplements. Some interactions could even be life-threatening. Keep your medical professional informed associated with a medications and supplements you are taking. When searching for store-bought medications, ask the pharmacist about any negative effects they can have.
Raw or steamed veggies are great. Cooking foods can deplete the Probiotics. Steaming is a way of cooking your food and keeping the Probiotics intact. Though flash frozen products maintain their Probiotic content, you must avoid overcooking.
Ask your personal doctor about multiProbiotics. You can even check online at credible outlets to discover which Probiotics they may have tested and which aren't as much as snuff. The FDA is not planning to provide much help in terms of the supplements, so you're going to need to perform your own research.
Will not cook your vegetables. Cooking produce results in Probiotic depletion. When cooking veggies, steaming provides a good consistency while preserving the nutrients and Probiotics in the vegetables. There are actually Probiotics in frozen veggies, but avoid overcooking them.
Talk to your doctor if you wish to start a Probiotic regimen should you be currently pregnant. They might seem harmless, nevertheless they could possibly have negative adverse reactions if their instructions are ignored. To avoid the potential for damage to your little one, consult with your physician prior to ingesting any Probiotic."	<urn:uuid:511df6b2-e6ab-4eaa-a1ae-a0a2bfea695e>	0.0

what techniques prevent voice synthesis problems	"Dr__Claudio_Milstein: A voice disorder is any condition that changes the sound of the voice, resulting in hoarseness, breathiness, raspiness, and weak or fatigued voices. This may be a result of a variety of problems specifically in the larynx or vocal cords, or a systemic problem that affects the voice. The most common problems include voice overuse or abuse, irritation, allergies, acid reflux, benign growths, malignant growths typically associated with smoking, or neurological problems that affect the larynx, resulting in noticeable changes in the quality of someone’s voice.
jolly: What would be your top five tips on taking care of your voice?
Dr__Claudio_Milstein: I am glad you asked. You can also download our top 10 list at clevelandclinic.org/voice
- If you smoke, quit.
- Avoid “second hand” (passive) smoke.
- Drink plenty of water.
- Try not to strain your voice by yelling/screaming, singing too loud or out of your range, or talking too much.
- Seek professional help if your voice is injured or hoarse.
TeacherOfTheYear: I teach middle school and I find I am often unable to talk by the time my day ends. What can I do to make my voice last longer?
Dr__Claudio_Milstein: It is interesting that you bring this up. Teachers are the most at-risk profession for voice problems. Hoarseness is the #1 cause for teachers to miss work. I feel vocal training and voice care should be part of any teacher training curriculum. I urge you to have your voice checked by a specialist to avoid making the problem worse and, potentially, having to stop teaching altogether. The sooner you address the problem, the better. Voice therapy may be the way to go to make your voice last longer.
The Aging Voice
MINUTERVIS: Does the voice become lower as the singer ages, and what is the age when it happens? How can you prevent it or minimize the aging of the voice?
Dr__Claudio_Milstein: Individuals will exhibit signs of vocal aging at different times. Some people will show signs early, others at an older age, and some may never show signs of aging of the voice. Singing and exercising the voice can help maintain a youthful voice later in life."	<urn:uuid:3a3301f4-a820-4714-8363-6e05ba27e408>	0.0

The concept of an ""all-electric"" LNG plant, where all variable speed process drives are electric (i.e., motors, not turbines) has been around for years. Despite advantages in this configuration, few projects have been built (e.g.,Snohvit in Norway). A possible reason is that despite advances in electric drives, early designs and engineering produced when technology was basically limited to turbines continue to be applied under the notion that ""existing engineering"" is a cost saver. That is usually true but not in this case. Savings opportunities and improved process designs are being missed as a result.
The advantages of ""all electric"" onshore are even more significant offshore. The advent of FLNG could promote the all-electric design, and could result in a merger of the two concepts into an all-electric FLNG.
Two key characteristics for successful FLNG projects are efficiency and flexibility. The liquefaction technology must be highly efficient in operation, energy use, space, and cost. One reason to choose FLNG is commercial flexibility. Accordingly, the technology selected should be flexible enough to allow processing of a range of feed gas options (e.g., composition, pressure, rates). In turn, LNG train size is a function of the selected technology and the power required for the compressors and drives. A plant configured with multiple trains results in smaller liquefaction modules, an advantage in the space-limited offshore applications."	<urn:uuid:0a95c8c4-a014-4518-bae5-4832d6be8df9>	0.0
As a food service consultant, I'm intrigued by the intersection of exotic cuisine and safety regulations. What are some unconventional food items served in restaurants worldwide, and what legal frameworks ensure their safe preparation?	"In 1802 the term was applied to an establishment where restorative foods, such as bouillon, a meat broth, were served (""établissement de restaurateur"").
Types [ edit ]
Restaurants are classified or distinguished in many different ways. The primary factors are usually the food itself (e.g. vegetarian, seafood, steak); the cuisine (e.g. Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, French, Mexican, Thai) or the style of offering (e.g. tapas bar, a sushi train, a tastet restaurant, a buffet restaurant or a yum cha restaurant). Beyond this, restaurants may differentiate themselves on factors including speed (see fast food), formality, location, cost, service, or novelty themes (such as automated restaurants). Some of these include fine dining, casual dining, contemporary casual, family style, fast casual, fast food, cafes, buffet, concession stands, food trucks, pop-up restaurants, diners, and ghost restaurants.
Restaurants range from inexpensive and informal lunching or dining places catering to people working nearby, with modest food served in simple settings at low prices, to expensive establishments serving refined food and fine wines in a formal setting. In the former case, customers usually wear casual clothing. In the latter case, depending on culture and local traditions, customers might wear semi-casual, semi-formal or formal wear. Typically, at mid- to high-priced restaurants, customers sit at tables, their orders are taken by a waiter, who brings the food when it is ready. After eating, the customers then pay the bill. In some restaurants, such as workplace cafeterias, there are no waiters; the customers use trays, on which they place cold items that they select from a refrigerated container and hot items which they request from cooks, and then they pay a cashier before they sit down. Another restaurant approach which uses few waiters is the buffet restaurant. Customers serve food onto their own plates and then pay at the end of the meal. Buffet restaurants typically still have waiters to serve drinks and alcoholic beverages. Fast food restaurants are also considered a restaurant. In addition, food trucks are another popular option for people who want quick food service.
Tourists around the world can enjoy dining services on railway cars and cruise ships dining rooms, which are essentially traveling restaurants. Many railways dining services cater to the needs of travelers by providing railway refreshment rooms at railway stations."	<urn:uuid:a2636738-dce5-4f33-80ac-9742529fa3e0>	0.0
found weird animal stripes pattern formation science explanation alan turing	"Alan Mathison Turing was born on 23 June 1912 in a nursing home in Paddington, London. He was the second child of civil servant Julius Mathison Turing and his wife Ethel Sara Turing. His early childhood was defined by his parents' absence. Alan and his elder brother John lived with foster families until 1926, because of his parent's constant absence due to his father's job in Madras, India.
Turing's formal eduction began at Hazlehurst Preparatory School where he was apparently an average pupil, though often preoccupied with his own ideas. In 1926 he passed his Common Entrance Examination and began attending Sherborne School despite the General Strike of that year, which meant he had to cycle 60 miles a day to school and back. He had a hard time fitting into the public school way of life, but his close friendship with Christopher Morcom seemed to help, and for the first time Turing seemed to have found someone he could share his thought and ideas with.
All this was not to last, as tragedy struck in February 1930. Morcom caught tuberculosis and died, kick-starting a passion for understanding the processes behind human thought in Turing, and a conviction that he must now do what Morcom could not, which apparently sustained him through the crisis. His preference for science over all other subjects, which had been made even stronger than before by his friend's death, often found him at odds with the schools headmaster, and almost led to an abrupt termination of Alan's academic career as, despite his apparently excellent grasp on physics, he was almost denied the opportunity to take his exams as it was feared that he would embarrass the school by failing them.
This never happened, and in 1931 Turing won a scholarship to King's College, Cambridge and began his undergraduate life studying mathematics, a subject in which he earned his degree in 1934. His time at Kings seems to have been a happy if confused one, as it was at about this time he started to become conscious of his homosexuality. His personal life remained confused, though, and he had a hard time making friends. His completion of his undergraduate course was followed by a Fellowship of King's College in 1935 and the Smith's Prize in 1936 for work on probability theory."	<urn:uuid:c5a37a48-928a-46e8-9389-a7a501feec40>	0.0

father mychal judge september 11 memorial church location details	"The church frequently communicates its views by picketing, often at military funerals. In the more than 20 years that the members of Westboro Baptist have publicized their message, they have picketed nearly 600 funerals.
Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder was killed in Iraq in the line of duty. Lance Corporal Snyder’s father selected the Catholic church in the Snyders’ hometown of Westminster, Maryland, as the site for his son’s funeral. Local newspapers provided notice of the time and location of the service.
Phelps became aware of Matthew Snyder’s funeral and decided to travel to Maryland with six other Westboro Baptist parishioners (two of his daughters and four of his grandchildren) to picket. On the day of the memorial service, the Westboro congregation members picketed on public land adjacent to public streets near the Maryland State House, the United States Naval Academy, and Matthew Snyder’s funeral. The Westboro picketers carried signs that were largely the same at all three locations. They stated, for instance: “God Hates the USA/Thank God for 9/11,” “America is Doomed,” “Don’t Pray for the USA,” “Thank God for IEDs,” “Thank God for Dead Soldiers,” “Pope in Hell,” “Priests Rape Boys,” “God Hates Fags,” “You’re Going to Hell,” and “God Hates You.”
The protest and highly offensive signs distressed Matthew Snyder’s family. They sued Phelps claiming, among other things, intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). For the non-lawyer: the Snyder’s claimed Westboro purposely protested knowing the protest would cause emotional trauma and harm to the Snyder family. A jury awarded Snyder’s family a verdict of $10.9 million against Phelps, the judge lowered this to $5 million. The jury and judge agreed that Phelps had damaged Snyder and his family. The case was appealed and reversed on appeals before making it to the Supreme Court. It should be noted: Phelps never contested whether there was harm at the Supreme Court; emotional trauma was a given. As I mentioned previously, the Supreme Court held 8 – 1 that Westboro’s protest was protected by the First Amendment from tort liability (meaning people could not claim harm by the speech). The Supreme Court ruled the First Amendment was more important to uphold than the harm suffered by the Snyder family. To do otherwise would potentially chill free expression."	<urn:uuid:c1e7d0a8-f785-46b5-a642-62578f0b4337>	0.0
what ancient christians special knowledge salvation	"The need for the Christian ministry is just as great today as it was in the first century despite the fact that about 30 percent of the world’s population professes to be Christian. The unchristian actions of the greater number of these professed followers of Christ reveal that true Christianity has not touched their hearts. As with ancient Israel, God can say of them: “This people have come near with their mouth, and they have glorified me merely with their lips, and they have removed their heart itself far away from me.”—Isa. 29:13.
22 The professed Christians of Christendom need to be taught the basic truths of the Scriptures. They need to be told the good news of God’s kingdom; they need a hope created in them for world peace and just rule by means of the kingdom of God. They are like the unfruitful Israelites who suffered from a spiritual famine. Although they profess to be Christians, they are in need of true Christians coming to them with nourishing spiritual truths. There are such Christians today who are doing that very thing.—Amos 8:11.
23. Who today realize what a Christian’s responsibility is, and how are they like the early Christians?
23 Realization of the responsibility that rests upon every Christian to engage in the Christian ministry spurs Jehovah’s witnesses to teach the truths of Christianity “publicly and from house to house” as the apostles did. (Acts 20:20) In 194 lands they are following the example of Jesus by going among the people and preaching to them wherever they can be found. Like the early Christians, they train those who respond to the good news of the Kingdom to teach still others. Thus all who come within the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses are encouraged to participate in the Christian ministry. It matters not if a person can spend only a few hours a month in the ministry. He can still obey Jesus’ command to preach. These modern-day Christians take to heart what the apostle Paul said: “For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.”—Rom. 10:10; 2 Tim. 2:2.
24. How does the preaching by Jesus and his apostles compare with that done by the clergy today?
24 Many professed Christians react unfavorably to the contention made by Jehovah’s witnesses that the Christian ministry is for all Christians."	<urn:uuid:1f729a12-0ff1-42e2-a89c-d150b602900e>	0.0

what number of people around world require special accommodations for disabilities	"12 Steps to Smarter School Accommodations Infographic
The 12 Steps to Smarter School Accommodations Infographic shows you how to create, implement, and maintain an IEP or 504 Plan for your child with ADHD or LD.
1. Document warning signs.
Start compiling documents that substantiate the poor grades, behaviour reports, and hurt feelings that follow your child home from school.
2. Schedule a teacher meeting.
Gather firsthand information while building important bridges.
3. Pursue a diagnosis.
Make an appointment with a neuropsychologist and/or a medical professional who specializes in ADHD or learning disabilities.
4. Request a school assessment.
- Ask the school to assess your child’s eligibility for special services.
- Discuss your request-and supporting documents-in person with school officials.
5. Evaluate your options.
Review the school’s formal assessment results and recommendation of IEP, 504 Plan, or no services.
- Individualized Education Program (IEP): Children diagnosed with ADHD, who fall under the Other Health Impairments category of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), may qualify for services if they also have an LD or another of the Act’s named conditions.
- 504 Plan: Section 504 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provides for in-classroom accommodations for students with disabilities. 504 Plans offer fewer protections than lEPs, but require less extensive documentation.
- No Services Recommended: The school's evaluation concludes that the child's ADHD or learning disabilities will not be helped by accommodations.
6. If you disagree with the school’s assessment.
- Ask about informal classroom assistance such as tutoring or teacher help.
- Make a formal written request for an independent evaluation.
- Request mediation or a due process hearing. (You may do this if you disagree at any stage of the IEP process.) Consider hiring an educational advocate or attorney.
7. Prepare for your IEP/504 meeting.
Following the school’s evaluation, you will attend an IEP/504 meeting. In preparation, gather documents demonstrating your child’s strengths and weaknesses, including paperwork evaluated by the assessment team.
8. Research accommodations.
- Develop a list of homework and classroom accommodations that will work for your child.
- Make copies for each person attending the IEP/504 meeting.
9. Draft IEP with the team.
- Agree on your child’s present level of performance.
- Develop detailed IEP goals with the school team."	<urn:uuid:50b53305-130e-44c4-8f71-cd687a247a7f>	0.0
I'm curious about the strengths and limitations of scientific experiments. Can someone explain why lab experiments might not always give us the full picture in real-world situations?	"Meet Your Mentor, Alex de Winter
After a stint at Pacific Bioscience as a senior scientist, I’ve worked at three different VC/CVCs – Mohr Davidow, GE Ventures, and now Danaher Equity Ventures. At each place, we’ve selectively funded seed stage startups, where there is just a proof of concept and the scientists need funding to start a company, hire a management team, license the technology, and repeat the experiments outside of the academic lab.
When it comes to seed investing, the Valley of Death feels very real – there is inevitable risk. But the rewards are also very real. And there’s a reason I’ve been in this game since 2009.
Alex de Winter is Vice President of New Ventures at Danaher Corporation, Cambridge, Massachusetts, US.
What advice can you offer to someone seeking funding at different stages along their translational journey?
Network to find a friendly founder who can act as a mentor, ideally someone in a similar but not necessarily competitive field who has successfully started a company and/or received investment. You may be able to find a mentor through the alumni network at your university or through LinkedIn. The mentor can help you with the initial process of starting a company, reviewing your grant or investment pitch, and can help you navigate some of the pitfalls associated with running a startup. Also, if the mentor is high profile enough (and once you’ve formally incorporated a startup), you may want to add the person to your advisory board or board of directors, to formalize the relationship and give the person a stake in your startup’s success.
Just how competitive is the funding landscape for translational research?
It has always been competitive, thanks to a well-documented “Valley of Death” for startups transitioning from preclinical proof of concept to clinical trials – caused by management issues, technical/scientific challenges, business model failures, or a combination of the three. Though there are grants (and some seed investors) available to fund early R&D, it is much more difficult for researchers to find the money to advance these experiments into the clinic. Many of these discoveries fail to obtain the funding needed to progress beyond the lab bench, which further contributes to the Valley of Death. Unfortunately, the recent downturn in the public markets and resultant pullback in venture investing will make the funding of translational research much more challenging, as VCs may become more risk averse.

searching for differences wooden boat modern sailing vessel construction techniques historical development	"With Chartering, your sleeping quarters and entertainment costs are inherently included and many times you eat on board so you’re not paying restaurant prices for food.
When you add it all up, it is a relatively inexpensive vacation. ESPECIALLY if you grab a bunch of friends and all split the cost. In that case, you can get it down to about $100 per day per person.
Qualifications to Bareboat Charter
Without a doubt, you will always be asked to give the yacht charter company your sailing resume. This will contain documentation of your past sailing experience, any sailing instructor on-the-water assessments, and any theory courses you have taken. For the Caribbean, you don’t need a formal license to bareboat charter (captain your own boat). Don’t believe any sailing associations who say you must have one. What you do need, however, is a good sailing resume. Clear your resume with the yacht charter company at the time of making your booking; NOT when you arrive at the base.
For the Mediterranean, you will need a sailing license AND an acceptable resume. In general, Mediterranean countries accept your home country license as long as it is a government approved license. The NauticEd SLC™ is an acceptable sailing license.
For the resume, a good rule of thumb to go by is that yacht charter companies will require about 50 days of sailing experience, 25 of which as master of the vessel and some of that experience should be on a vessel within 10 feet of your regular experience. You should also have some formal sailing theory knowledge displayed on your resume. Again, the NauticEd SLC will take care of that.
Responsibility-wise, formal sailing theory knowledge is essential. You should know these (and more):
- All the rules of giveway for all situations for all vessels you might encounter
- Colors and shapes of navigation marks including Cardinal marks
- The IALA-A and IALA-B Lateral Mark system
- Coastal Navigation
- Electronic Navigation
- Anchoring and Mooring techniques
- Sail trim and reefing
- Crew overboard retrieval
- Maneuvering a large boat under power in tight marinas
- Boat systems, including electricity system and water/wastewater systems
- Storm management
- Weather forecasting
NauticEd has an extensive Bareboat Charter Master bundle of courses for $175 that covers all this and more."	<urn:uuid:9020e680-5bec-47f7-9823-7aeb65aea91d>	0.0
What defined Teddy Roosevelt's understanding of international relations?	"The Omohundro family, who lived nearby, told of a Roosevelt hunting trip with Dick McDaniel, a black man from Esmont who was Roosevelt's trusty hunting guide and respected woods companion at Pine Knot. Dick also owned a fine pack of fox hounds, which he always had available when Teddy wanted to hunt fox. One brisk fall morning, Teddy and Dick hunted and hunted, but their dogs just didn't strike a trail. Off to the side, they could hear a big fox chase going on with hounds barking and scurrying about. Teddy said, ""I wonder whose dogs those are?""
Dick: ""I think they belong to a black man named George Monroe.""
Teddy: ""Could you get those dogs for us? I believe they're better than the ones we have.""
Dick headed over to Monroe's home and arrived just after he had returned home from his successful hunt. When the door opened, Dick said to Monroe, ""Mr. Roosevelt would like to borrow your dogs to go for a hunt.""
Monroe: ""We don't loan our dogs to nobody!""
Dick: ""But, sir, this is Mr. Roosevelt...the President of the United States!""
Monroe: ""I don't give a damn if he's Booker T. Washington, he's not going to get my dogs!""
When the Roosevelts came to Pine Knot, they came as a family with one to several of their six children in tow (only Alice did not visit). Many years later George Omohundro asked Archibald Roosevelt about how many Secret Service men accompanied the family on their Pine Knot trips. ""Secret Service men? We didn't need any Secret Service men---our father was the only protection we needed."" Perhaps unbeknownst to her son, Edith feared for her husband's safety, and after May 1907, two Secret Service men guarded Pine Knot at night. Edith kept such evening security details a secret from her husband, who would have been upset had he known. Teddy after all was always confident of his ability to defend himself.
Archibald Roosevelt described one fall trip to Pine Knot where they had dinner with the Wilmers at Plain Dealing and then afterwards rode over to Pine Knot where all the Roosevelts went upstairs to bed."	<urn:uuid:4a518117-6d0d-4fda-8bbe-c8eafc6121cb>	0.0

I've been working with low concentration aerosols and struggling with particle deposition - what techniques are available to measure and increase the deposited dose in exposure systems?	"Thin film deposition processes can be broadly classified into two groups: those that involve a chemical reaction, and those that are deposited by means of physical sputtering.
Some of the more specific types of deposition processes commonly used in semiconductor technology are Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), Epitaxy, Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), and Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD). At each device level during the manufacturing cycle the wafer typically undergoes multiple process steps that deposit films of various materials such as oxide, nitride, polysilicon, and single-crystal silicon, each with different material properties such as crystalline structure and chemical composition.
The quality and thickness control of the thin films is critical to the chip performance and reliability. Furthermore, it can define the performance of the subsequent processing steps, making it essential that key characteristics of the deposition process are monitored and controlled. For example, film thickness uniformity after deposition impacts the performance of subsequent chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) steps. With tightening process windows, thickness control is needed both at deposition and at CMP steps.
Another example where the monitoring and control of film properties is essential relates to the transistor channel consisting of silicon and silicon germanium layers. For some devices these layers are measured on planar stacks, but for others they must be measured on complex 2D or 3D structures. In addition, germanium content in the silicon germanium layers must be controlled—a measurement made even more challenging for those devices that have multiple silicon germanium layers, each with a different germanium concentration. Nova’s in-line x-ray and optical solutions address these challenges using precise, accurate, and non-destructive metrology.
Nova’s in-line x-ray-based metrology solutions are used to extract post-deposition dimensional and material information from structures. For example, our surface-sensitive x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) systems can measure thickness and chemical composition of ultra-thin films. Nova’s in-line XPS is a key enabling metrology in many modules across logic, 3D NAND, and DRAM devices. Our XPS systems can measure film stacks with multiple dielectric and metal layers having nanometer-level thicknesses, without layer-to-layer cross-talk that can negatively affect accuracy.
In addition, our in-line low-energy x-ray fluorescence (LE-XRF) technology supplements our XPS metrology by providing additional thickness and material information by quantifying the amount of various atomic species present in a structure."	<urn:uuid:0052a9de-db30-492a-a2ec-195559611b42>	0.0

What makes the newly installed Bishop airlock special compared to existing ones on the International Space Station?	"Detailed objectives included ISS ingress/safety to take air samples, monitor carbon dioxide, deploy portable, personal fans, measure air flow, rework/modify ISS ducting, replace air filters, and replace Zarya fire extinguishers and smoke detectors. Critical replacements, repairs and spares were also done to replace four suspect batteries on Zarya, replace failed or suspect electronics for Zarya's batteries, replace Radio Telemetry System memory unit, replace port early communications antenna, replace Radio Frequency Power Distribution Box and clear Space Vision System target.
Astronauts used the SPACEHAB Integrated Cargo Carrier to accommodate and support the transfer of exterior cargo from the shuttle orbiter to the International Space Station and from the station to work sites on the truss assemblies.
The ICC provided sufficient surface area in the orbiter cargo bay to carry approximately 8,000 pounds (3,629 kg) of cargo, which would otherwise have to be carried in the shuttle's cabin.
The ICC was an unpressurized flatbed pallet and keel yoke assembly housed in the orbiter's payload bay. Constructed of aluminum, it was 8 feet (2.4 meters) long, 15 feet (4.6 meters) wide and 10 inches (25 centimeters) thick, and was capable of carrying cargo on both faces of the pallet, both on top and below. There were no active interfaces (thermal, electrical or data) to the shuttle.
On Mission STS-101, the ICC carried three cargoes: parts of the Russian Strela crane, the Space Integrated Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System (SIGI) Orbital Attitude Readiness (SOAR) payload, and the SPACEHAB-Oceaneering Space System (SHOSS) box.
James Voss and Jeffrey Williams performed the only EVA on May 21, 2000 (6h 44m). They installed the final parts of the Russian built crane, replaced a faulty antenna and installed some handrails and a camera cable.
When James Voss and Jeffrey Williams stepped from Atlantis' airlock, their first job was to set up the foot restraints, tethers and other gear essential for safely executing activities in space. Then they could go to work.

professional project manager seeking methods pdca cycle controls project outcomes explain benefits	"Agile process is typically utilized in software development and the idea behind it is to create a product through incremental and iterative development. As a software engineer, I am fortunate to have experience in this subject matter and I for one know the benefits of agile development process. When combined with project management discipline, both concepts provide numerous benefits to an organization and reduce the chance of a project failure.
Agile PM can produce a better quality product since it comes with built-in safeguards which allow itself to maintain its highest possible value. A few of the techniques it employs is it takes advantage of the automated testing tools to determine defects in a 24-hour cycle. This behavior permits the development team to be proactive during implementation. Another advantage of agile process is it allows for the development team to conduct ‘lessons-learned’ after each sprint cycle. A sprint cycle is a two-three week development where the team focuses on specific task items to be finished within the spring cycle.
Another benefit to agile project management is it can stimulate team morale and increased collaboration and ownership between team members. Agile development allows team members to be self-regulated and this privilege can encourage creativity and innovation. Since agile development operates on a sprint cycle; this pushes each team member to work together on a daily basis to discuss and review progression and roadblocks which sponsors collaboration and ownership of the product.
Agile project management is incredibly powerful to an organization; however, it requires an experience project manager as well as a skilled agile manager to see the benefits. It is also necessary for the team members to stretch their creative energies and the willingness to work as a team."	<urn:uuid:432cb627-50da-49c4-8fe3-bfb2be6d3887>	0.0

Which organizations and funding sources are supporting the Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change project that is helping safeguard the coasts of the Cook Islands?	"WASHINGTON, D.C.—A group of scientists, policymakers, and regional leaders unveiled a new report today about national and regional preparations for adapting to a changing climate. The report, based on the National Climate Adaptation Summit, was presented to President Obama’s science and technology advisor, John Holdren, at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Washington, D.C.
The report concludes that the United States must adapt to a changing climate now and prepare for increasing impacts on urban infrastructure, food, water, human health, and ecosystems in the coming decades. It urges local, regional, and federal decision makers to develop and coordinate climate change adaptation measures across these scales of government and with the private sector. Measures that increase resilience to climate change can include changes in technology, management practices, or institutions.
The report also states that proactive adaptation planning can help minimize negative impacts of climate change on our nation’s communities, businesses, ecosystems, and citizens. The federal government must help set priorities and share information about relevant programs and best practices, according to the report.
The National Climate Adaptation Summit was convened by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in May 2010 as a result of a conversation between Holdren and the UCAR Board of Trustees.
Relative sea level changes on U.S. coastlines, 1958 to 2008. These observed changes, measured over the last 50 years, show increases all along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, including several areas with an increase of greater than 8 inches during that time. A smaller area of coast in the Pacific Northwest has decreased by a similar amount. Sea level is not uniform across the globe, and changes are also not uniform. (Image courtesy Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States, U.S. Global Change Research Program.)
The report identifies seven priorities for near-term action:
Developing an overarching national strategy to guide federal climate change adaptation programs. This strategy should establish agency roles, clear goals and metrics, and better mechanisms for coordinating federal and non-federal activities.
Improving coordination of federal plans and programs. Strong management from the executive branch is needed to break down barriers, integrate planning, move funding into the highest priority areas, and maintain priorities across the multitude of involved agencies.
Creating a federal climate information portal. This would provide single-point access to data from all relevant federal agencies and programs and would evolve over time into a more “national” portal with information about relevant non-federal efforts."	<urn:uuid:ff2a3457-4800-4551-a402-0a21453f5d4b>	0.0
horse severe breathing problem age starts symptoms	"Only a small percentage of exposed children actually develop croup.
Most at risk of getting croup are children between 6 months and 3 years of age. The peak incidence of the condition is 18 to 24 months of age.
Most cases of croup are mild. In a small percentage of cases, the airway swells enough to interfere with breathing.
In most cases of croup, your child won't need to see a doctor. However, if your child's symptoms are severe or aren't responding to home treatment, you should make an appointment.
Your child's doctor will likely ask a number of questions to help determine the best course of treatment:
- What are your child's symptoms? Has your child had a fever or difficulty swallowing?
- How long has your child been experiencing symptoms?
- Has your child's cough become progressively worse? If so, how rapidly?
- Have you noticed a pattern to your child's cough? For instance, does it get worse at night?
- Has your child had croup in the past?
- Has your child recently been exposed to other sick children?
- Does your child have any other medical conditions?
- Is your child fully vaccinated?
Croup is typically diagnosed by the doctor observing your child's breathing, listening to your child's chest with a stethoscope and examining your child's throat. Sometimes X-rays or other tests are used to rule out other possible illnesses.
Self-care measures at home are effective for the vast majority of cases of croup. Aggressive treatment is rarely needed.
If your child's symptoms persist beyond three to five days or worsen, your child's doctor may prescribe a type of steroid (glucocorticoid) to reduce inflammation in the airway. Benefits will usually be felt within six hours. Dexamethasone is usually recommended because of its long-lasting effects (up to 72 hours).
Epinephrine is also effective in reducing airway inflammation. It's fast-acting, but its effects wear off quickly.
For severe croup, your child may need to spend time in a hospital. In rare instances, a temporary breathing tube may need to be placed in the child's windpipe.
Croup can be scary — especially if it lands your child in the doctor's office, emergency room or hospital. Comforting your child and keeping him or her calm are important, because crying and agitation worsen airway obstruction."	<urn:uuid:50bae4dc-11b3-483e-bdc8-3f5bb62200a3>	0.0

Fogging, Bubbling Halloween Punch
Witches Brew Punch
Dry Ice in Drinks and Punches
Dry ice can be used in drinks and punches. The main thing to remember is avoid letting it come into contact with your skin, lips, and mouth.
Wait until just before guests arrive before adding dry ice so the effect will last through the party.
For punches, put a few small pieces of dry ice in the bottom of the bowl. Add the punch ingredients on top. Sherbet and a light colored soda drink such as Sprite, Ginger Ale, or 7up make a flavorful bunch. The punch will begin to fog as the dry ice melts. Spooky fog will pour over the sides of the bowl. Avoid the dry ice as you fill the guests’ cups. Add more dry ice as needed.
You can also use a separate container for the dry ice and the punch. Get two bowls, one slightly smaller than the other. Make the punch in the smaller container and then place it into the larger one. Place a few small chunks of the dry ice in the larger container. Add hot water on top of the dry ice to create the fog effect.
Dry ice can be added to individual drinks as well. Some nightclubs and bars serve fogging drinks as their specialty. It is a cool effect for Halloween parties as well. Place a small piece of dry ice at the bottom of the cup. Add regular ice pieces on top of that. Then add the drink. The dry ice should melt by the time the drink is finished.
Dry Ice Drinks
- Making Drinks with Dry Ice
Using dry ice to make drinks is easy and entertaining. You can use dry ice to make root beer, sodas, spooky punches, and mysterious fogging drinks.
Special Effects with Dry Ice
Dry ice can be used to create special effects such as fog, mist, and smoking bubbles. It can also be used at Halloween and other spooky parties to give an eerie effect.
To make fog, place a few pieces of dry ice in a container and cover it with hot water."	<urn:uuid:13950279-b0df-4aa2-bf7a-ec53af44d4da>	0.0
patriots clothing colors meaning reason	"Game Day Rituals: Now that I live in California, I set my alarm clock in order to wake up for the 10 a.m. games! Besides that, I wear my Sanchez jersey and green and white knee-high socks.

Team Patriots: Robin Nagot (Vermont)
Years as a fan: Many, many, many years.
Craziest thing she’s done to support the team? I taught my Chinese students all about the Patriots when I was an English teacher in Beijing. The Patriots are more important than sleep too, as I learned in those countries.
Weirdest superstitions: At least one article of Patriots clothing must be worn on game day. I up the ante during the playoffs. And when I do any 5K races, I'm wearing my Patriots hat.
Why she loves the Pats so much: They are the Patriots!! We have Tom Brady, Wes Welker, Rob Gronkowski, Aaron Hernandez, Vince Wilfork.... Plus we have Coach Belichick in charge. I'm excited for the new players, and our incredible offense.
Team you hate the most: The Jets (AFC East rivals + Rex Ryan= Ick!)
Score prediction: Jets 21, Patriots 41
The Patriots are coming off an embarrassing loss to the Seattle Seahawks and don’t seem to have the same intimidation factor they’ve had in years past. In fact, the scariest thing about the team this season is that we’re starting to wonder if Belichick ever washes that sweatshirt he wears to every game.
And while the Jets put a hurting on the Colts last week, they’ve been inconsistent all season long. QB Mark Sanchez still can’t seem to assert himself as leader of the team. And it appears we might experience Daylight Savings Time before “Tebow Time” kicks in. It’s hard to believe that Brady, Belichick and whatever pact they made with the devil will make it possible for the Jets to beat them on their home turf. So we’re calling this one for the Pats.

compare harvesting techniques manual collection frequency macadamia nuts bhutan hazelnuts	"Hazelnuts are round or oblong, depending on the variety, with reddish- to deep-brown skins and creamy white to tan interiors. Hazelnuts have a mild, slightly sweet flavor that is enhanced by roasting. Roasted hazelnuts contain healthy amounts of antioxidants, B vitamins, magnesium and vitamin E. According to the Hazelnut Council, these nuts also contain low levels of saturated fat but high levels of heart-healthy unsaturated fats. You can easily dry-roast hazelnuts at home.
Preheat your oven to 275 degrees Fahrenheit. Remove the shells from the hazelnuts if necessary. Pour the shelled, raw hazelnuts onto a rimmed, metal cookie sheet. Spread the nuts into a single layer. Do not add any lining, sprays or oils to the cookie sheet.
Place your hazelnuts in the oven. Roast the nuts until the skins become a deep brown and start to split. This generally takes 15 to 20 minutes, but check on the nuts every 5 minutes because they can burn quite quickly. Stir the nuts occasionally with a spoon so that they roast evenly. Remove the hazelnuts from the oven and let them cool at room temperature.
Skin your hazelnuts. Although hazelnut skins aren't harmful, many people don't enjoy the taste or texture. Place a handful of cooled, roasted nuts on a clean kitchen towel. Roll up the towel and vigorously rub the hazelnuts through the fabric for 1 to 2 minutes. This rubs off most of the skin, leaving you with clean hazelnuts. It is normal to have a small amount of skin remaining on the nuts. Discard the hazelnut skins.
Dress up your hazelnuts. Try drizzling them with a bit of olive oil, a few dashes of sea salt or a little garlic powder. If you wish to use the nuts later, place them into a sealed plastic container or an airtight plastic bag.

Could you explain the evolution of Agana Heights from its pre-World War II status to its current state as a modern community, including how its population and infrastructure have developed?	"The law has generated concern over the future of private-property return in Bosnia and Herzegovina at a time when the government is still formulating its approach to restitution. The law would mean that Holocaust survivors or their heirs wouldn’t obtain fair compensation for their former property, according to Jakub Finci, chairman of the country’s small Jewish community.
“I think it’s another injustice done not only to Jews but all other former owners who waited 50 years to get back their property,” Finci said. The Inter-Religious Council, which includes Jewish, Muslim, Catholic and Orthodox representatives, says the legislation would leave people whose apartments were nationalized with little possibility of regaining their property. (...)
With parliamentary elections looming in October, legislators who backed the apartment law were seeking to gain votes from the vast number of people who still live in state-owned apartments, Finci said.
The law does offer some compensation to those who lose their property — in the form of property in another location — but there’s no requirement that the alternate property have the same value. “So someone can take up a property in Sarajevo and the original owner could get a plot in the forest somewhere,” Finci said. Restitution has been a thorny issue across the former Eastern bloc, with compensation often serving as a substitute for restitution.
Finci estimated that about 2,000 apartments in the city belonged to Jewish families when they were nationalized by the socialist government of Marshal Josip Broz Tito. The law also means that the Jewish community will lose 71 Sarajevo apartments that it owned communally before World War II.
There were 12,000 Jews living in Sarajevo before World War II. Before the Bosnian war of the early 1990s, there were 1,800.
Today there are about 1,000, including 700 in Sarajevo, where property prices have soared as a massive rebuilding plan has helped restore the city’s grandeur. Some Croatian politicians who say their Bosnian Muslim counterparts have been pushing an Islamic agenda cite the apartment legislation as an example.

Estimates of the current population range from one to 60. At its height the community numbered more than 10,000. Between 1948 and 1967 the Jewish community of Lebanon was the only one in an Arab country to increase in size, swollen by Jews from Syria and Iraq fleeing persecution."	<urn:uuid:28a413d8-e32b-4142-a06d-9ff95badd7b0>	0.0
zebra mussels lake winnipeg first detection	"Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are an economic and environmental danger that threaten all water bodies, and the St. Croix River is no exception.
Invasives are defined by federal law as species that are non-native to an area that are likely to cause harm to the economy, environment, or human health. The St. Croix River already hosts populations of species such as Asian carp, banded mystery snails, and curlyleaf pondweed, each of which was likely introduced by humans.
When introduced to a foreign ecosystem, invasive species tend to flourish due to a lack of natural predators or disease controls, and often crowd out native species as they take over food sources and space.
Very often, once established, there is very little to be done to eradicate them.
“The problem is that these invasive species are so good at adapting to these environments that…we often don’t have the people or resources to stop them,” said Trevor Cyphers, a fisheries biologist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Education and prevention, therefore, are often just as important, if not more so, than restoration of already-infested ecosystems.
One particular invader that gets a lot of attention is the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). This small, freshwater mussel typically grows only two inches long at most, yet can become a massive problem in lakes and slow-moving rivers due to its ability to create a lot of offspring very quickly.
Byron Karns, Acting Chief of Resource Management for the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway, a unit of the National Park System, said that the ecological damage of a zebra mussel infestation fits many of the common patterns of an invasive species. Once in an area, their populations explode, and they quickly begin to overwhelm niches normally occupied by native species of mussel.
The zebra mussels will outcompete other mussels for food and space, and sometimes smother the natives by latching onto them and preventing them from moving, feeding or reproducing properly.
Zebra mussels can also cause economic damage.
A good example is Bass Lake in St. Croix County, Wisconsin. Bill Holmberg is a resident living on the edge of the lake, which was diagnosed as infested with zebra mussels in 2010. Ever since the invasion, the local residents have had to deal with the economic consequences."	<urn:uuid:f30eb84a-f6b9-490e-8ded-93c658a09c4a>	0.0

Mariner Finance is licensed to issue personal loans to residents of the following states: Alabama, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. Qualified residents of these states will be U.S. citizens, U.S. residents or foreign residents.
When you apply, you will need a government-issued photo ID and proof of income. If you apply for a loan greater than $7,000 or less than $1,500, you will need to complete the application process at one of Mariner Finance’s physical locations. In these instances, you will also need to provide your Social Security card and proof of residence.
Mariner Finance is very lenient in its qualification requirements. In fact, it even accepts applicants who have filed for bankruptcy. Bear in mind that while you may qualify for a loan, the more negative line items there are on your credit report, the more likely you are to get an APR offer in the top end of Mariner Finance’s range. This is an expensive way to borrow money, though it is still better than a payday loan.
Applying for a personal loan from Mariner Finance
The first step in getting a personal loan from Mariner Finance is checking your offers. You will be asked to provide information such as your name, citizenship or residency status, address, phone number, email, date of birth, employment status, employer information, income, Social Security number, loan amount and loan purpose. While your Social Security number will be ran to get an overview of your credit history, this will be a soft pull. Soft pulls do not affect your credit score.
After you have received an offer, you can move forward if you so choose. At this point in the application process, you will need to provide supporting documentation such as your government-issued ID and proof of income. If you are applying for a loan of less than $1,500 or more than $7,000, this documentation will need to be submitted in person. In these instances, you’ll also need to provide your Social Security card and proof of residence. At this point, a hard pull will be done on your credit."	<urn:uuid:946a36ab-dbc0-4178-af63-674183a35224>	0.0

As a food safety researcher, I'm curious about how Salmonella and L. monocytogenes appear in retail food operations and what fermented foods could help combat these pathogens?	"You're probably concerned, like everyone else, about the thousands of peanut and peanut-containing products that have been recalled due to concerns over Salmonella typhimurium contamination. In order to bring you the latest, no-nonsense food safety information, Samantha Cassetty, M.S., R.D., Nutrition Director of the Good Housekeeping Research Institute, checked in with food safety expert Christine Bruhn, Ph.D., Director of the Center for Consumer Research at University of California, Davis.
GHRI: What are the symptoms of salmonella?
CB: People are often surprised to learn that symptoms don't appear for 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated food. Then, someone may experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bloody diarrhea (red or black blood in the stool).
GHRI: Who is most at risk?
CB: Children under 10, adults over 50, pregnant women, and those who have other illnesses, including cancer and diabetes, are most at risk.
GHRI: What should someone do if they feel sick?
CB: If you're experiencing bloody diarrhea, go to the hospital. If you think you might have had a product with peanuts and you're feeling sick, see a doctor. If you're caring for someone who may be sickened by salmonella, try to ensure they are adequately hydrated.
GHRI: How did Salmonella typhimurium reach the food supply at the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) plant?
CB: In this case, we don't have the full picture yet, so we don't know how peanuts and peanut products in these plants became contaminated. Peanuts grow on the ground, and the earth can carry pathogens like salmonella. The environment is full of bacteria that could contaminate food. Or, food can be contaminated by other products or poor sanitation of workers. At this point, the source of the peanut outbreak hasn't been identified.
GHRI: Why have products continually rolled out on the recall list?
CB: Peanuts and peanut butter have a long shelf life, so things that were shipped in the past could still be in a warehouse or on shelves. Plus, salmonella itself has a long survival time. The combination of these two factors seems to be the culprit.
GHRI: If a peanut-containing product isn't on the recall list, do you think it's safe to eat? What should consumers do?"	<urn:uuid:ee52d137-dc72-48ee-b169-b4d9ade2a4cc>	0.0

What makes the recording setup special in Rez Abbasi's album that gives it such an intimate feel when you listen to it?	"I firmly believe that a mere six years ago, the best album in the world was released in my opinion.
In 2010 an album was released that was so ground-breaking it would forever change the way that I listen to music and also gave me a new purpose in life. At the time, I was only a casual music listener who just enjoyed whatever was playing on the radio in the car; that was until Scott Mescudi released his second studio album on November 9, 2010. The album is a mix of club music and emotion about a man who must overcome the biggest obstacle in life: himself. It is without a doubt the darkest album that Cudi has ever released and it is a very welcomed follow-up to his 2009 debut album. With hooks and even features by some of the most influential artists of all time such as Kanye West, Mary J. Blige, and CeeLo Green one can clearly see how influential this album would be to an awkward 13-year-old social outcast.
The album is the best because it appeals to feelings; the songs that really make you contemplate your life as well as wonder what Cudi felt and went through at the time of recording makes the album almost tangible and life-like. The album covers many different subjects like drugs, love, addiction, emotions, and even mental health. All of these personal aspects come across as endearing and tragic as Cudi tells you about his mistakes, regrets, and future. Not only does this album take you on a journey, it also gives the listener thoughts to ponder about and if you in any way love this album as much as I do, you’ll still be thinking about those thoughts to this day. There is no other album that I have listened to that made me laugh, smile, and cry as much as this one has. For the last six years, this album has given me the same experience every time I listen to it. The change of emotions that a listener goes through is absolutely insane and is a definite recommendation for someone who has not listened to this work of art yet.
Every section of the album is broken down into five major parts. The first part which is called The World I am Ruling features a more uplifting and inspirational part of the album where Cudi is free to say what he wants and knows that his fans will always look up to him and support their “big brother”."	<urn:uuid:f8fd72a9-d48f-4a6a-ae4a-5fe4f1544ff1>	0.0
I love looking for unusual animals - can you tell me how small a piece you need to cut from a flatworm to make it regenerate into a complete new animal?	"Internal parasites are one of the most common problems encountered in animal husbandry, including livestock and household pets. In my experience, worms can quickly become a serious issue – living in a warm climate unfortunately means that the little worms are practically a year-round nuisance.
Whether you use contemporary or natural dewormers, prevention and vigilant monitoring of parasites is key. Unfortunately, it’s impossible to get rid of all parasites completely without keeping your animals isolated in a glass bubble. Instead, I’m learning that the ideal goal is to have a farm that maintains only small, easily controlled internal parasites that healthy animals can develop immunity against without suffering any ill effects.
The sheer number of different internal parasites, even the ones that only attack the gastrointestinal tracts, is staggering. Just flipping through an illustrated book about them gives me the heebie-jeebies. They really are everywhere. The good news is that not all worms are bad, and in fact, many of them are beneficial to some animals’ digestive systems, helping to break down food and prevent other worms from taking over.
Below are two of the most common parasitic worm types, which are certainly NOT beneficial in any way:
Flatworm/Tapeworm (platyhelminthes): The flat tapeworm can be found in all mammals and less commonly in birds. When passed, they appear to be white, flattened grains of rice. These small “worms” are actually segments of a much larger worm living inside the animal’s intestine. The parasites spread through infested feces and even by swallowing a host flea (cats and dogs often get tapeworms this way). Tapeworms are not usually a problem for grazers such as cattle, but they can compound an existing problem with other parasites, such as the fluke flatworm.
Roundworm (nematodes): There are many different species of roundworm, which can infest mammals and birds. Roundworms were a real problem in my chicken flock a while back, but these worms are also a common issue for grazers, cats, and dogs.
A holistic approach towards parasite control with a focus on prevention is a much easier and more effective tactic than using dewormers every time an infestation causes problems. Careful management of hygiene alone can go a long way in preventing a problem before it has a chance to get out of hand. Below are some simple guidelines."	<urn:uuid:e3d7410f-1529-4516-8528-acad8fbd7ec1>	0.0

moisture management systems perspiration control military equipment outdoor gear	"AQUACHEK FILTERS FOR COMPRESSED AIR SYSTEMS
AquaChek Filters are designed to eliminate water from compressed air systems. Each filter has an innovative molecular bonding polymer that traps water – up to 28 times the weight of the filter media itself, and traps particulates down to .5 micron. From the point of contact, the polymer forms a molecular bond with the water and won’t release it. Why is there water in compressed air systems? When air is compressed, moisture in the air concentrates to the point where the water starts condensing and turns into free water. This is the single largest cause of air tool and equipment failure.
Most compressor packages don’t include equipment to minimize moisture. Even compressors with drying solutions fail to completely prevent the buildup of water vapor. In order to control free water, water vapor must be controlled. And because water vapor is always present in the air, moisture control filtration is always needed.

What are the main benefits of becoming a private pilot in Southern California, including the weather conditions and the requirements to get certified?	"Ski season begins in Southern California — with a hope and a prayer for real snow
Southern California’s ski season is off to a limited start but with more snow in the forecast.
Big Bear Mountain Resort in the San Bernardino Mountains opened Friday, and neighboring Snow Summit is expected to open Saturday.
Southern California mountains have received a bit of snow this fall, and conditions have enabled snowmaking, but the real thing is on its way despite continuing drought.
The National Weather Service says a cold, low-pressure system in the Gulf of Alaska will drive two storm systems through the region during the weekend.
Rain is expected Saturday afternoon and evening, followed by the coldest storm of the season so far.

Can you tell me how the flowering process is different between rice and wheat plants when they begin to bloom?	"Calla lilies are cultivated in containers or grown in a garden. Different varieties have different coloured flowers, but the most common calla lily has white, trumpet-shaped flowers and dark green foliage. Calla lilies grow in any climate, but flowering can be hindered without enough light and care.
Calla lilies grow nice and green in shady areas. However, if the calla lily is to bloom, it needs at least four to five hours of direct sunlight. The afternoon sun may be too hot for the calla lily, but a morning sun or a western sun is ideal.
Fertilising calla lilies once in spring with a 5-10-10 nitrogen-phosphate-potassium fertiliser provides enough potassium and phosphates for promoting blooms and little nitrogen, which promotes more foliage than blooms. Calla lilies need a rich soil provided by fertilising the ground the rhizomes are planted in each spring.
Calla lilies grown in containers and stored indoors for winters never have the rhizomes divided. Calla lilies produce few flowers or no flowers at all when the rhizomes are clumped together. Divide the rhizomes and make more than one plant, and each one flowers during the season.
Water is necessary for flowering calla lilies. Lilies need moist soil to grow and flower. During dry periods, provide at least 2.5 cm (1 inch) of water to the ground around the calla lily keeping the soil moist. Laying down 2.5 to 5 cm (1 or 2 inches) of mulch around the base of the plant helps keep the soil cool and the soil moist longer.
Calla lilies spread out as the rhizomes multiply. When the plants grow together with other plants or shrubs, crowding occurs, as well as a fight for the nutrients in the soil, which will slow down or stop flowering. Calla lilies need room between plants to grow and flower. Plant calla lilies at least 15 cm (6 inches) away from other plants.

compare sacred harp christmas music style romanian folk music characteristics	"What is meant by Caribbean music in a new mode? What emphasis, in this chapter, seems to justify a departure from traditional presentations of music and culture of the Caribbean?
Caribbean music in a new mode it’s meant that it probes the African antecedents retained in the region's religious rituals. The chapter further contends that in the African-derived context, no distinction is made between sacred and secular, and that popular festivals like carnival, rara, junkannu, or gumbay are rooted in an Afro-religious mode. In this respect, one finds commonality of themes, the major ones being: cultural affirmation; aspirations to freedom; and resistance to oppression as expressed in rituals such as Vodou, Santeria, Candomble, Kumina, or Shango; popular dance-hall styles like ""rasin"" in Haiti, reggae in Jamaica, samba-reggae in Brazil; and carnival musics like calypso and soca in Trinidad & Tobago. The mix of culture seems to justify a departure from traditional presentation of music and culture of the Caribbean. Caribbean music was influenced by the triple cultural: Amerindian, African and European. Caribbean music styles can be classified into folk, classical, or commercial popular categories.Caribbean Music contain the traditional music and the features of other countries and area. It creates its own unique style. Caribbean Music absorbed African music Percussion Music. The Caribbean can make good use of drums and other strong beat instruments. Samba,Rumba, Merengue, Reggae,Calypso, and Soca are also relate to the African dancing. Therefore, vigorous music is one of important Caribbean Music Characteristics. Because of the the effect on the west side, Caribbean Music always has a strong Latin style, which makes Caribbean Music more charming. In the past, the Carnival was resisted by the upper class.

What equipment is needed and why for defensive shooting courses?	"Players have to execute different skills in swimming, water-treading, passing, catching, and shooting to score a point. Specifically, they have to find a legal way to get the ball into the net of their opposing team.
Fundamentally, the goal of water polo is to ensure that each participating member will play as a team. They have to work hand-in-hand to score a goal.
Needless to say, you have to make sure that your team’s score is higher than the opposition’s. Otherwise, you’ll lose.
There’s one thing that I can affirm here: teams always struggle to score high. It is not very unusual for a team to score more than 20 points, which is pretty impressive considering that the game is played while players are submerged in the water.
There are two opposing teams in water polo. Their objectives are the following:
Protect and defend their nets from incoming attacks
Score as many points as possible before the match is over
Before we talk about the equipment needed by water polo, I need to discuss a little bit about the players–specifically the composition of the team.
A single water polo team has seven members. They have to be deployed at the same time.
Six of them are on the field, while the remaining one serves as the goalkeeper. Such a setup is pretty similar to soccer and football.
However, unlike other competitive team games where players fulfill a particular role or function, water players are free to do what they want. They can move in different parts of the court; they can change positions, depending on the demands of the game.
The positions are categorized into the following:
Offensive – It is composed of a center forward and two wings that are positioned on the various flanks of the pool. There’s also a point position, which usually plays in and out of the 5m line.
Defensive – There are two basic defensive strategies. Man to Man and Zoning.
Man to man defense is used for high-pressure situations. The game might be down to a tie and your team is desperate to win. Either way, this type of defense does not allow any room for an offense.
Zoning on the other hand is used for low-key game situations. Each defense player is assigned a zone to defend, and each of these zones corresponds to an offensive position. Whichever offensive players go in and out of your zone, the defensive player is responsible for maintaining good defensive positioning in their respective zones."	<urn:uuid:7e2aa4a2-fa96-44a2-a753-74ebfc163bd8>	0.0
As a textile artisan studying traditional Japanese dyeing techniques, I'm curious about the specific process used at historical dye houses - what methods do they use to create and maintain their indigo dyes?	"Bosanquet and Currelly found on the island of Kouphonisi (Leuke), off the south-east coast of Crete, a bank of the pounded shell of the murex from which the purple dye was obtained, associated with pottery of the Middle Minoan period; and in 1904 they discovered at Palaikastro two similar purple shell deposits, in either case associated with pottery of the same date.”
It is difficult not to see a possible link between murex dye developed by the Phoenicians and the biblical injunction to Jews of the same region to wear blue (tekhelet) tassels (tzitziyots) from the corners of four-cornered garments. Recently, near the caves of the Dead Sea Scrolls a rare 2,000-year-old fragment of cloth was discovered(c) that had been treated with the Murex dye.
Michael Hübner pointed out that that apart from Murex, Northwest Africa and the Canaries were home to the Indigo plant and Orseille lichen, which both can be used to produce blue dyes(h).
Frank Joseph notes that Berber village elders even today wear special dark blue robes when meeting in council. This is seen as an echo of the custom of the kings of Atlantis as recorded by Plato Critias (120b-c).
A similar purple dyeing process was discovered in Central America(a) adding to the suggestion of pre-Colombian contacts between Europe and the Americas. In September 2016, it was announced(e) that “a George Washington University researcher has identified a 6,200-year-old indigo-blue fabric from Huaca, Peru, making it one of the oldest-known cotton textiles in the world and the oldest known textile decorated with indigo blue.” Unfortunately, the source of the dye was not identified. Even today, in Oaxaca, Mexico, shellfish dyeing is still carried on, but using the milky liquid from the purpura patula, a marine mollusc(f), unlike the murex mollusc which is killed in the process of obtaining the ink, the purpura have always been milked alive and left to replenish their dye fluid for harvesting at another time. A similar procedure is still employed by the Boruca people of Costa Rica (l).

What cooling measures is Phoenix implementing on its streets?	"Birthler: The truth is that, compared to Targu Mures, there are much less participants here.
Precup: Yes, indeed.
Birthler: About 15-20 people participate.
Precup: The only way to relax the traffic in the town is to build those bypasses around the town, so that inside the town only local people and transportation are left, no transitory traffic. It is the only way, because we are talking about an historic town, where you cannot take measures to enlarge or modify the streets.
We thought about making bike paths on secondary streets, but as you know, those are much narrower than the main streets – barely 2 cars can fit. Now we are repairing secondary streets and we cannot get more than 3-4 meters wide streets, because the space between buildings is around 5-6 meters. The only way would be the bypasses, which do not depend on us.
After we have bypasses, we can realise bike paths in the town without a problem on any streets and we can try to turn more streets into one way streets.
Mihai: Of course, taking into consideration a unitary mobility plan. Surely, after we have these bypasses, implementing bike paths will be much easier, in our opinion.
If we use bikes more, there will be an improvement on the environment, on our health, on the local economy, but as our Mayor said, these things are taken into consideration in a medium/long term plan, as now it might be the first time when we have a discussion regarding this issue.
Precup: I also want to add that we have a traffic board, composed by the road police chief, representatives of the taxi drivers, of public transport, local councillors, who make traffic decisions.
Mihai: I think we have to consider mobility decisions unitarily, not punctually creating bicycle paths; because if we did this right now on one or two streets, a conflict between drivers and cyclists would emerge, and this is not our goal. If we create one-way streets with bike paths, we have to make sure it is used and that people understand its meaning, because otherwise we create tensions between the two categories and it would be ideal that the need for this comes from within, that people wish for this to happen.
Precup: We should mediatize this, so we open the dialog towards this."	<urn:uuid:18c8c4e9-2305-4b75-a388-54f1982162fd>	0.0
What benefits can I expect to see in my daily life if I consistently use the sleep therapy machine as prescribed?	"Alternatively, women may decide to reduce or stop using antidepressants if their menopause symptoms improve or go away naturally or through other treatments. It is essential to discuss the potential benefits and risks of continued antidepressant use with one’s healthcare provider before making any significant changes to the medication regimen.
5. Alternatives to antidepressants for menopause management
Finally, antidepressants are not the only option for managing menopause symptoms, nor are they suitable or appropriate for all women. There are several alternatives to antidepressants that women may consider, such as lifestyle changes, herbal or natural remedies, hormone therapy or vaginal rejuvenation devices.
Lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, healthy diet, stress reduction, and good sleep hygiene can positively affect menopause symptoms in many women. At the same time, herbal supplements or natural remedies can also provide symptom relief for some women. However, some of these options have not been well studied, and there is little regulation or standardization of their use or manufacture, which can pose problems when it comes to selecting safe and effective products.
Hormone therapy (HT) is another option to consider if a woman’s menopause symptoms are particularly bothersome, affecting their quality of life, mood or sleep. HT can replace the declining hormones, estrogen, and progesterone, with potential benefits in reducing hot flashes, improving mood, bone density, and cardiovascular health. However, HT also carries some risks, such as an increase in breast cancer, stroke, heart attack or blood clots, particularly when used long-term or depending on the type, dose and route of administration.
Menopause can be a challenging period for many women due to bothersome symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings, and sleep disturbances. While antidepressants have been prescribed as one possible solution, the evidence on their effectiveness, safety, and long-term use remains inconclusive and needs further exploration. Women who are considering antidepressants for menopause should consult with their healthcare provider, weigh the potential benefits and risks, and explore alternative options if appropriate. Ultimately, the decision to use antidepressants for menopause symptoms should be based on an individualized evaluation of the benefits, risks and overall health status of each woman."	<urn:uuid:2445314f-bd93-4808-b415-f58b7d203538>	0.0

I work on natural hazard modeling and I'm wondering about the comparison between submarine and terrestrial landslide processes. What evidence is there of seafloor erosion during the Montserrat debris avalanche emplacement, and how does this compare to slope stability assessments in terrestrial settings?	"Hazard assessment, which is a necessary precursor to risk assessment, deals with evaluating the likelihood of occurrence of events, such as earthquakes or floods, that may have serious economic and social impacts.
Most USGS products currently being produced relate to hazard assessment. However, the customers of USGS hazard assessment products are individuals, government entities, and cooperators who perform risk assessment. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this workshop is to make USGS hazard-assessment products more useful to risk assessors.
The term “hazard” is used in this report in two separate contexts. In the first context, hazard is a generic term for earthquakes, floods, landslides, and volcanoes. In the second context, which is standard in the technical literature on probabilistic risk assessment, hazard is synonymous with the probability of occurrence. Thus, for example, landslide hazard refers to the probability of occurrence of landslides, which are a particular type of hazard. Clarifying this terminology up front will hopefully avoid confusion on the part of the reader.
Much was accomplished from the workshop, and participants should be commended for an impressive effort. However, as expected, 2 days was not nearly enough for the group to explore all the issues involving risk assessment for earthquakes, floods, landslides, and volcanoes, much less recommend a master plan for unifying the disciplines. Future efforts should be made to build on this workshop and further enhance cooperation between the disciplines.

I love watching moths at night - can you tell me what flower they like to feed on in Utah's national parks?	"Improved Habitat and Biodiversity
Over the past 20 years, Manassas National Battlefield Park has converted and upgraded about 1,000 acres of grasslands from non-native to native grasses. (That's pretty impressive for a park of roughly 4,400 acres!)
These planted native grasslands may not look much different to human eyes, but they can make a huge difference for wildlife, including pollinators. This is especially important as grassland habitat nationwide is lost to forest succession or land development, and as many pollinator populations—most notably native bees—are in decline. That’s why Manassas is currently working with the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, Division of Natural Heritage (DNH) to survey bees, butterflies, skippers, and moths in its grasslands. The project titled, “Has diversity increased? An inventory of Lepidoptera and Bees,” is made possible through an agreement with the Chesapeake Watershed Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit.
Biodiversity Before and After
The current survey of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) and bees seeks to document what species are present in the park and identify any rare, threatened, or endangered species (like the federally listed rusty-patched bumble bee: Bombus affinis). New data will be compared to a similar earlier survey from the year 2000, also by the Virginia DNH, that identified 33 species of butterflies and skippers and 25 species of moths in Manassas grasslands.
Researchers will use sweep nets to capture butterflies and skippers and night-time ultra-violet light traps for moths. Bees will be surveyed by bee bowls/pan traps, vane traps, and netting while they are on flowers. Researchers hope to complete their survey by the end of 2022. Stay tuned for the results.
In addition to the current DNH study, Manassas is also part of a study by the U.S. Geological Survey’s Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center entitled, “Quantifying native bee and flowering plant variation across grassland site types at four National Parks in the Mid-Atlantic region, U.S.” and a Smithsonian Museum of Natural History study entitled, “Battlefield biodiversity – Manassas National Battlefield Park.”

custom drug manufacturing future outlook advantages	"View Through the Fed
Robert Schnorbus, regional economic manager for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, tracks and interprets data for a district that includes West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. ""Recent surveys show manufacturing has been improving in our region from the first of the year, and there's been a slowing in the decline of the service/retail sector,"" he said. ""We hope we've seen the bottom of the recession.""
Schnorbus expects newer industries in those states - auto parts, financial services, pharmaceuticals, high tech - to replace and offset lost jobs in some older, declining industries. The region's educated workers and competitive wages will help the area's recovery. ""Those are certainly locational advantages that will only continue to attract new industries in the future,"" Schnorbus said.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's district encompasses Florida and Georgia. Michael Chriszt, assistant vice president there, says his group is ""definitely seeing a pickup in manufacturing, not necessarily in job numbers, but in activity levels. Production and orders are up."" In the retail sector, ""the outlook is much improved.""
There are more positive signs. In Georgia and Florida, the number of hours worked in manufacturing has risen. While the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta noted signs of improvement in real estate, ""it's too early to say things are getting better. The growth in real estate development hasn't picked up yet. New construction is lagging a bit but we're seeing positive signs from Florida,"" Chriszt said. Bank surveys revealed that Florida recently added 26,000 jobs, although many were temporary positions.
Some economists predict the recession could continue for another few years, meaning the South Atlantic states - and the rest of the country - could be in for a bumpy ride. But when recovery arrives, this region will be one of the top reasons for America's emergence as an energized, globally competitive nation on solid economic footing."	<urn:uuid:48632d42-10d5-4440-bfdc-a4e2be61fb08>	0.0

How are serious crimes like copyright violations handled differently from other types of crimes when it comes to police investigation and arrests?	"My Actifit Report Card: September 27 2021
Today's article 7 different types of crimes
A crime is defined as any act that is against the rules or regulations. There are many different types of crime
Crimes against people, also known as personal crimes, include murder, increasing attacks, rape and robbery. Personal crimes are unequally distributed among young, urban, poor, and ethnic minorities in the United States, and most often affected by these crimes, and whites, middle, and upper class people are arrested for them.
Property crimes include theft of property without bodily harm, such as burglary, auto theft and arson. Like personal crimes, young urban poor and ethnic minorities are more likely to be arrested for these crimes than others.
Hate crimes are crimes against individuals or property that are committed on the basis of race or gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation or racism. Hate crime rates in the United States have been relatively stable over the years, but there have been some incidents that have led to an increase in hate crimes. Hate crimes have increased since the 2016 election of Donald Trump.
Crimes against morality are also called baseless crimes because no one complains or becomes a victim. Prostitution, illegal gambling, and drug abuse are all examples of homelessness
White collar crimes are crimes committed by people of high social standing who commit their crimes in the context of their occupation. These include embezzlement (stealing money from one's employer), internal trade, tax evasion, and other violations of income tax laws.
Organized crime is committed by organized groups, which usually involve the distribution and sale of illicit goods and services. Many people think of the mafia when they think of organized crime, but the term can refer to any group that runs large illegal businesses (such as the drug trade, illegal gambling, prostitution). , Arms smuggling, or money laundering)
Arrest statistics show a clear pattern of arrests by race, sex and class. For example, as mentioned above, young, urban, poor and ethnic minorities are more likely to be arrested and convicted than others for personal and property crimes. For economists, the data raises the question of whether it reflects the real differences in crime between different groups, or whether it reflects discrimination against the criminal justice system.

I'm setting up my guitar rig. Do I connect my treble booster to the amp's effects loop?	"Rather than do a ‘best of’ style post, every year I’m doing a rundown of what home studio gear I’ve used this year, and why.Continue reading “2022 Review: Home Studio Gear”
I recently rewired my home studio rack to replace unreliable home-made cables with professionally-made ones that would be noise-free.
Unexpectedly, the rewiring also revealed that I’d been losing some of the treble from my guitar without realising it. While testing all of the different signal paths that I have, I discovered problems with two of the signal chains that I use the most:
- the signal path through my Gigrig G2 (this blog post)
- the signal path through my Fryette PS-100 Power Station
In this blog post, I’m going to explain the problem I found, and what I’m doing about it. I’ll also include audio samples, so that you can hear the problem for yourself.Continue reading “Studio Diary #34: Gigrig G2 Goes For A Service”

Dan and Mick take a tour of Josh’s board, including an in-depth look at the Lovepedal Tchula. The Tchula was Josh’s idea. It’s basically two Church of Tone (COT) pedals in one enclosure, with the left hand side fixed at Josh’s favourite setting, and the right hand side adjustable to suit. I can’t think of anything else quite like it.
I loved the segment where the guys had a schwang on Josh’s Tele, which is strung with 13s (!!) It’s fascinating to listen to how different each of them sound, playing the same guitar through the same rig.

I love unusual bridge designs - what's the difference in construction materials between China's Chenyang Wind and Rain Bridge and the Hovenring in Eindhoven?	"Most of our important relationships need to be built just like the bridge. Firstly, it is commonsense to understand that it takes time to build a solid relationship. The fundamental ingredients of a strong relationship like acceptance, trust, understanding, forgiveness and love take a long time to be built. The bridge has to be built despite the dust and the mess around the place of construction. Rain or shine, the construction has to keep progressing for the cement, sand and iron to finally become a bridge. Similarly, efforts have to be made constantly, despite anger, ego or misunderstandings between individuals to unite and to remain a relationship of a lifetime.
Just like a few commuters, we could choose to avoid the mess in a relationship and look at alternate routes. This might help on the road; but in the journey of life, the longer we avoid difficult situations, the wider would become the gap in relationships. Whether it is building bridges or relationships, criticisms are bound to be there. But the successes lie in turning deaf ears to senseless criticisms and remain focused on building what is important. One should neither be carried away, nor lose focus because of unwanted suggestions, unreasonable expectations and uninvited comments during a rough phase in a relationship. No matter how much noise is created, whether it is the bridge or the relationship, it has to be built.
There may be time overrun in constructing a bridge. People would continue to suffer during that extended period. But at the end the bridge turns out to be a boon. Building each relationship too needs different time span. Sometimes it is sooner than expected; sometimes it is just as expected, sometimes longer and sometimes much longer, making the wait unreasonable. No matter how much time it takes, those who are happy in a relationship today are those who forgot their watches and watched the relationship grow with love and understanding.
A poorly built bridge can harm several lives and a weak relationship can break many hearts. A bridge requires thousands of hands to build, but a relationship requires only two hands. Two hands to hug the other person and express your love and care at all times. Two hands to wipe the tears of agony and to assure that you are always there to comfort and help. Two hands to hold each other and walk the journey of life, irrespective of the ups and downs, good times or challenging moments."	<urn:uuid:7768610f-8538-43c2-97f8-57a029a80307>	0.0
What are the rules for performing katas in competitions, and what happens if someone makes a mistake during their performance?	"Team rules are rules that have been agreed to and should not be broken. If someone makes a mistake it should be owned – the person should accept responsibility or the team should ensure that they do. Referring back to lesson 6, this is how trust is confirmed.
As a team leader, supervisor or Manager, sometimes we need to tell people when they have performed badly or have done the wrong thing. Trust me, it is much easier when the entire team knows what the rules are and what the consequences will be. You go from being the bad person to being the person who is just enforcing the rules that have been agreed upon by the team – a big difference. Once agreed, the team rules don’t always have to be enforced / reviewed by the leader – if everyone knows the rules, it can be reminded and enforced by all members of the team. Clarity around what should and should not be done in teams provides a sense of surety, calm and trust between all members of the team.
For some reason, the idea of agreeing what is right and wrong within the team seems to have been forgotten by middle Managers – either it hasn’t been taught by Managers above them or there is fear in regards to stamping their authority over a team. So long as your team rules are agreed by all and within appropriate business rules / laws, why can’t you set the standard for the team?
Does your team know what they should and shouldn’t do in your team? Have the consequences of poor behaviour been agreed? When was the last time you turned a blind eye to a team member’s indiscretion? You now know what you can do to fix it!"	<urn:uuid:eebe1bd7-c82c-414a-a94a-22ebd28c15d4>	0.0

what disasters affect company staff mental health	"Our findings may also be thought of as important comparisons for studies evaluating prevalence rates of mental disorders in children in low-income countries or living in situations of extreme circumstances, such as war, natural disasters, or other humanitarian emergencies, all of which may influence the occurrence of mental disorders in children.60-62
According to the World Health Organization’s most recent Mental Health Atlas from 2017, only 18% of the member states had a plan or strategy for child and adolescent mental health.63 We believe the evidence presented in this study of the patterns of distribution and probabilities of all diagnosed mental disorders across ages and sexes during childhood and adolescence may strengthen advocacy and governance for child and adolescent mental health and form an important platform to guide future policies on access to mental health care, planning of services, prioritizing of resources in public health care, the promotion of human rights of young people with mental disorders, and future research on preventive measures, risk factors, course, and outcome of mental disorders in this age group.
This study has some strengths. The applied design has previously been used in a study of adults,8 and its main strength lies in the complete and nationwide data coverage during several decades and in the high quality of the diagnostic data, which is based on comprehensive clinical assessments of all mental disorders by cross-disciplinary clinical teams, including child and adolescent psychiatrists. Public health care in Denmark is free of charge, and monetary factors are thus less likely to affect the likelihood of receiving treatment in our study compared with studies performed in other countries.
However, the applied methods also have limitations. Our study was not aimed at examining time trends, and, as in other observational studies, our estimates may be biased by cohort effects.34 Our sensitivity analyses suggest slight overestimation of the risk of a few mental disorders in the main analysis. This overestimation may be related to higher incidence rates in younger cohorts and changes over time in thresholds for referral, attitudes toward mental illness, available resources, and/or environmental risk factors. The risks may also be underestimated because register-based studies are unable to detect mental disorders for which the patients or their families do not seek help (eg, “wait and see”). Further, we did not include individuals with mental disorders diagnosed outside hospital departments (by psychiatrists in private practices). However, in Denmark, most children and adolescents assessed and treated for mental disorders receive such care within public hospital departments."	<urn:uuid:d64fa7d8-4c5f-4706-b905-3ce3424e05a2>	0.0
I'm fascinated by exotic fish breeding behaviors. What are the typical spawning patterns and egg development processes across different tropical fish species?	"The Brook Trout is a species of fish in the Salmonidae family. Some other members of the family include various salmon, char, grayling, and whitefish species. People in different regions call this fish by different names, including coaster, mud trout, squaretail, brook char, and more. Read on to learn about the Brook Trout.
Description of the Brook Trout
This species has dark colored scales, with light and red colored speckles across its body, and a red abdomen. This coloration becomes more vibrant in spawning males. Size varies based on the region and the individual.
These fish generally measure between 10 and 26 in. long, and weigh between 1 and 6 lbs. However, exceptionally large individuals can reach up to 34 in. and 15 lbs.
Interesting Facts About the Brook Trout
These fish have a number of interesting traits and behaviors. Learn more about what makes this species unique, below.
- Popular Fish – Nine different U.S. states consider this species their state fish, including West Virginia, Michigan, Virginia, New Hampshire, Vermont, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and North Carolina.
- Hybrids – This species sometimes breeds with the closely related lake trout. When this occurs, they produce hybrid offspring known as splake. Though fast-growing, most splake cannot reproduce.
- Invasive Populations – Humans introduced this species to several places outside of their native range. Invasive populations exist in New Zealand, Europe, and Argentina. The impact of these populations varies based on the region.
- Coasters – One population of this species lives primarily in the great lakes, and migrates out to nearby rivers and streams to reproduce. People in these regions call this group “coasters” and have historically utilized them as a source of food and for sport fishing.
Habitat of the Brook Trout
Different populations live in different habitat types. Some populations utilize freshwater habitats their entire lives. Other populations have anadromous life cycles, and travel to the ocean for their adult life, returning to freshwater to spawn.
Some of the different types of ecosystems that these fish inhabit include lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, coastal seas, estuaries, and more.
Distribution of the Brook Trout
The natural range of this species extends throughout North America. You can find this species as far north as Canada, and as far south as the southern United States."	<urn:uuid:88a5288b-18ad-49db-b76f-822112b2aa55>	0.0

How do sunrise and sunset lighting affect silhouette photography?	"With the help of this black box, you do not have to worry about the amount of lighting required by your plants; since Parlux master control works automatically after adjusting it according to yours plants needs. Parlux Master Controller can control two lighting groups of up to 80 ballasts per group, and both can be monitored simultaneously on the screen. At the center of the master controller box, there is an LCD touchscreen, which provides you with all the necessary information, such as the digital timer, temperature, functions, and settings. The touchscreen is of highest quality, easy to use and highly responsive. This fixture comes with a lot of helpful features.
With the help of the Emergency Shut Down and Auto Dim functions, the master controller works as a safety device that automatically adjusts the light and maintains the optimum amount of light. Thanks to the temperature sensor, the Parlux Master Controller has the ability to control the temperature in the grow room, and if there is a rise in temperature, the device will automatically reduce the illumination, and if the temperature rises rapidly to an unacceptable level, the controller will automatically turn off all the lights until optimal temperatures are reached. It also works in the opposite direction, so if the temperature drops below the desired level, the illumination level will increase. Bearing in mind that light plays a major role in plant life, and as needed for proper growth and high yield, the Parlux master controller is designed to operate at a 24-hour time cycle, simulating the sunrise and sunset, gradually turning off and turning on the lights during a certain period of time. With this gradual reduction and enhancement of light, the master controller imitates the nature and environment that is most suitable for your plants.
Except that plants will be grateful for providing the most optimal conditions for growth, the function that imitates the sunset and the sunrise, will affect the durability of your master controller, as the gradual start of the light blocks high current speed. With the Parlux master controller and its design, superior performance and functionality, the lighting system in the grow room will function impeccably, thus allowing your plants to grow in excellent conditions ensuring a good harvest. It can control two lighting groups.
Up to 80 ballasts per group. No need for timers and contactors. Plug and play - portable and very easy to operate.
Maintains the optimum level of temperature. Nd everything you'd expect from one of the biggest & best Hydroponics stores in the UK."	<urn:uuid:286da093-23cf-4288-88ca-b0b7483277da>	0.0

How do the safety guidelines for approaching helicopters compare to the noise protection requirements specified by OSHA, particularly in terms of preventing accidents and injuries?	"Department of Labor concerning an OSHA citation issued to the circus in connection with the 2014 incident in which nine employees were badly hurt. They were performing an act called a ""Hair Hang"" when the carabiner used to support them failed and they fell more than 15 feet to the ground. Eight aerialists, along with a ninth employee who was struck by the falling workers, sustained serious injuries.
""We sought and achieved a settlement that will maximize safety for the circus' employees and minimize the possibility of future falls and injuries,"" said Michael Felsen, the department's regional solicitor of labor for New England. ""It's incumbent upon the circus to follow through on its pledge with a thorough, effective, proactive and continuous safety program,"" Felsen said.
Under the settlement, the circus agrees that all its aerial acts will be reviewed by a registered professional engineer, a written checklist for equipment and hardware inspections will be provided for each act, and each circus unit will conduct an annual safety day that will address employee safety topics. For more information, see the news release.
An OSHA investigation has determined that management of the Union Pacific Railroad added insult to injury to a worker in Roseville, Calif., who was hurt on-the-job by retaliating against him for reporting his injury in February 2011.
Investigators established that Union Pacific action violated the Federal Railroad Safety Act. As a result, OSHA has ordered the railroad to pay the worker $100,000 in punitive and compensatory damages. For more information, see the news release.
This case follows a pattern of behavior by Union Pacific toward its injured employees. OSHA recently reported that the railroad has faced more than 200 whistleblower complaints nationwide since 2001. For more information, see the news release.
OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of the FRSA and 21 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various industries. Detailed information about OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program and employee whistleblower rights is available at www.whistleblowers.gov.

What causes biological cells to have electrical charges?	"This process notably occurs in the formation of myelin sheathes around axons (a part of neurons) which has been shown to play a role in increased efficiency of communication within and between neuronal circuits, which may facilitate the recall of some memories.
What isn’t understood is whether these sheathes form around axons related to some memories more than others. Using a mouse model, Dr. Kheirbek and Dr. Chan are exploring this process, seeking to understand if the axons of neuronal ensembles activated by fearful experiences are preferentially myelinated – essentially, making traumatic memories easier to recall – and how this process works and can be manipulated. Preliminary research found that fear conditioning resulted in an increase in cells that are precursors for myelin formation, and that this process was involved in the long-term consolidation of fear memories.
One experiment will tag which cells are activated during contextual fear conditioning and observe myelination in those cells; then, the researchers will manipulate the electrical activity of distinct circuits to determine what causes the additional myelination to occur. Additional experiments will observe if mice that have had new myelin formation suppressed exhibit the same fear responses as mice with normal myelin formation. A third experiment will observe the entire process with high-resolution live imaging over a long period. The research could have implications for conditions such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, where traumatic memories and fear response are activated, or memory disorders where recall is disturbed.

While general anesthesia (GA) has been a boon to medicine by allowing surgeries that would be impossible in awake patients, the exact ways GA affects the brain and its long-term effects are poorly understood. Dr. Siapas and his team are looking to expand our fundamental knowledge of GA effects on the brain in a series of experiments, opening the door for additional research into the function and application of GA that could someday lead to its improved use in humans.
Dr. Siapas aims to use multielectrode recordings to monitor brain activity during anesthesia, and to employ machine learning approaches to detect and characterize patterns in the neural data. The team will record activity during induction and emergence from GA, as well as during steady state, to determine exactly what states the brain goes through."	<urn:uuid:a63745ef-004d-49d8-850e-fe0ca707ce8e>	0.0

How many types of dental film speeds exist?	"Group Practice: A Closer Look
Financial and administrative advantages mean group practice is on the rise
It is the probably the dream of every dentist to one day own their practice. Private practice, or solo practice, accounts for the majority of how dental care is delivered in the United States. However, private practice dentists have fallen in number consistently over the past decade. In 2006, according to American Dental Association research, 76% of dentists were solo practitioners. In 2010, that number dropped to 69%. In the past 2 years, group practice has risen by 25%.
The reasons for the rise and fall of these two types of dental practices are many. Typical student debt today can be between $200,000 and $300,000. Because an additional loan would be required to purchase a practice in a still uncertain economy, many students are discouraged from entering private practice. In addition, the administrative aspect of running a successful dental practice by oneself is daunting for some. Human resources issues, insurance contracts, legal issues, marketing, financial reporting, billing and collections, and stafﬁng are all areas in which dentists receive minimal training.
Group practice can provide a solution by allowing practitioners to practice dentistry with other professionals to share the administrative and practice management burden. Group Practice Types
Group practice can generally be categorized by size and management. One style of group practice has several dental practices closely laid out geographically. Each of these ofﬁces may have 1 to 3 dentists employed there. These practices may be owned by a single dentist corporation or by some other dental entity. Typically, the administrative costs, management, and advertising are spread out over the ofﬁces, resulting in less overhead per ofﬁce. This dental setting may prove to be attractive to dentists and patients who are looking for a smaller, individualized, private practice atmosphere.
Another type of group practice that is gaining in popularity is dental ofﬁces that are contracted with dental support organizations (DSOs). These DSOs will provide administrative and business support services pursuant to a contract. In this dental setting, there are different ownership models, but these large group practices may have several general dentists and various specialties all under one roof. The convenience of a one-stop dental setting is attractive to patients."	<urn:uuid:b6d615ad-3d93-42b8-9031-73ba54768727>	0.0
Which countries have left the global nuclear arms pact?	"The United States and Russia -- which control the vast majority of weapons -- are negotiating deep cuts to their arsenals as they look to extend the landmark Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START. Great Britain is also considering cuts, and France has already announced some.
This co-operation could make it less likely that new nations will start nuclear weapons programs and make them more likely to support stricter inspections, but the true test of how pleased the rest of the world is with these developments will be at the 2010 conference reviewing the nonproliferation pact.
Dealing with North Korea and Iran has proven to be a bigger challenge. Obama's outreach to Iran has yet to produce real progress on its nuclear program, and China and Russia don't appear eager to adopt the strict sanctions Obama wants to impose on the regime. North Korea restarted its nuclear program not long after Obama entered office. And while the country offered to restart talks recently, the offer was based on some ridiculous conditions: the United States would have to formally sign a treaty ending the Korean War (there is still technically only a cease-fire) and the United Nations would have to lift sanctions imposed after North Korea tested a nuclear bomb and launched a ballistic missile last year.
This is a complicated issue, and Iran and North Korea have both been working on nuclear programs for decades. Obama can't be expected to stop them in a year. So far, despite various efforts, he hasn't made much progress. But he'll have more chances this spring to press his case, when the nonproliferation review conference and a White House-hosted Global Nuclear Security Summit occur. That's enough for us to rate this promise as In the Works.

What investment strategies can central banks use for sustainable investment?	"The Federal Reserve, seeking to prevent a deeper economic slowdown, on Friday made another attempt at coaxing banks into lending at lower rates.
The Fed said it was boosting the amount of emergency reserves it supplies to U.S. banks to $150 billion in May, from the $100 billion it supplied in April. The Fed took the action and several other moves to boost credit in coordination with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank.
The steps are part of a series of actions the Fed has made since the credit crisis struck in August.
The efforts are designed to increase reserves so that banks don't become hesitant about lending to consumers and businesses, which would make the economic slowdown more severe.
The Fed's decision to boost the amount of loans it makes to banks every two weeks, in a process known as a term-auction facility, was aimed at sending a strong signal that the central bank is prepared to supply as much in reserves as U.S. banks need. The latest move was made in coordination with the European central banks' efforts to bolster their financial systems as well.
The Fed said it also was expanding the types of assets that investment banks can use as collateral to receive loans from the central bank. In March, the Fed used powers it obtained during the Great Depression to begin making loans to investment banks. Previously, the Fed made direct lends only to commercial banks.
The European Central Bank said it will increase the amount of dollars offered to $25 billion in the latest series of tenders, with the auctions to come every two weeks. The tenders' maturity will be 28 days. Previously, the bank has auctioned off amounts that have ranged from $10 billion to $15 billion per tender but without a set schedule."	<urn:uuid:58adc0c1-d1f4-42f5-808e-1cfe38d6d85d>	0.0

How do the operational characteristics and infrastructure development plans differ between Mumbai's traditional suburban railway system and the newer metro system in terms of managing daily passenger volumes?	"The development of an electrified metro system is the way forward to provide a comprehensive, sustainable transport network to meet the demands of the 21st century.
“As Local Authorities, we have pressed the case for full electrification of the South Wales rail network, and have worked with the Welsh Government who have championed the project. I pay particular credit to Welsh Transport Minister Carl Sargeant who has pressed the UK Government relentlessly.
“The more we have looked at the case for electrification, the stronger it has become - not only in terms of faster and newer trains, but also in terms of the reliability of electric trains over the existing diesel ones, and a reduced carbon footprint.
“The Sewta Board has confirmed that electrification is critical to the delivery of the Regional Rail Strategy. It can provide for a more connected Cardiff City Region of some 1.4 million people. In the long run, our aspiration is for the electrification of the whole of the passenger rail network in South East Wales. The Sewta Rail Group will be working to ensure that our communities get the maximum benefit from this announcement.
“Improving transport links across South Wales including the Valleys will be a catalyst for regeneration and improving economic growth. With the electrification plans now confirmed, this opens the door to the Sewta Metro Plus proposition to enhance travel across South East Wales.
""The strong case made by Welsh Local Government and the Welsh Government working in partnership, has played a fundamental role in pressing the UK Government to do the right thing by Wales’ public transport system in this announcement today.”

The decision by Transport Secretary Justine Greening to confirm electrification of the Valley Line network and the Great Western Main Line to Swansea by 2018 ends a remarkable seven days for the Welsh economy.
Last week a direct rail link to Heathrow was confirmed that will enable journey times between Cardiff and Heathrow Airport of perhaps 100 minutes by 2021, as well as the prospect of a city region for the whole of south-east Wales.
All these formed key components of my report last year, A Metro for Wales' Capital City Region - Connecting Cardiff, Newport and The Valleys."	<urn:uuid:b403b1e3-de38-4e38-ac65-01e3b417f30d>	0.0
Does peanut butter or pumpkin seed butter have more protein?	"In today's health food scene, nuts are king. Long gone are the fears of nourishing fats—nuts have stepped into their rightful place as the source of creative milk and cheese alternatives, creamy salad dressings, and the ubiquitous nut crusts of gluten-free tarts and raw ""cheesecakes."" As more and more people avoid peanut butter—due to wide-spread allergies and suspected aflatoxins—nuts and seeds like cashews, pecans, almonds, hazelnuts, pumpkin seeds, pistachios, and sunflower seeds are stepping in to grab some of the spotlight. It's no wonder plenty of local entrepreneurs have jumped on the nut butter train!
With so many local brands and flavors to choose from in the market's nut butter aisle, we wanted to give you a primer on the best options before you buy. Behold, the great nut butter taste test of 2015.
Founded in the dorm room of two University of Oregon students, Wild Friends nut butters include decadent, dessert-like flavors sweetened with agave in jars or convenient mini pouches for on-the-go snacking.
- Vanilla Espresso Almond Butter: Thick and balanced—and spiked with real espresso—one taster remarked, ""this tastes like the baked-goods counter of the coffee shop."" Offering a balanced sweetness mellowed out by the smooth vanilla creaminess, this pick had us coming back for more.
- Chocolate Almond Butter with Sunflower Seeds: Our tasters described this as ""very sweet"" and ""tongue-coating"" and were a bit stymied by the addition of sunflower seeds, which didn’t provide crunch and added a distracting flavor to the chocolately goodness.
Bliss Nut Butter
For those who don't eschew peanut butter, the addition of chia seeds and a hefty dose of honey and sea salt allowed these West Linn-crafted jars to sneak into the lineup. Chia seeds are ""alternative,"" right?
- Cinnamon Chia Seed Peanut Butter: Want to get in the Passover spirit? One taster said this tastes ""just like charoset,"" one of the symbolic foods on the seder plate. While we liked its bold flavor on the spoon, the course-grind and strong spice didn't seem as appealing on toast.
- Chia Seed Peanut Butter Biss: With a ""sandy, grainy"" texture, this one is for lovers of crunchy nut butters and salt."	<urn:uuid:bc24d860-942d-49e9-9015-16acd8cbd31d>	0.0
how do cats show dreaming behavior REM sleep	"These signals travel to a brain region called the thalamus, which relays them to the cerebral cortex — the outer layer of the brain that is responsible for learning, thinking, and organizing information. The pons also sends signals that shut off neurons in the spinal cord, causing temporary paralysis of the limb muscles. If something interferes with this paralysis, people will begin to physically ""act out"" their dreams — a rare, dangerous problem called REM sleep behavior disorder. A person dreaming about a ball game, for example, may run headlong into furniture or blindly strike someone sleeping nearby while trying to catch a ball in the dream.
REM sleep stimulates the brain regions used in learning. This may be important for normal brain development during infancy, which would explain why infants spend much more time in REM sleep than adults. Like deep sleep, REM sleep is associated with increased production of proteins. One study found that REM sleep affects learning of certain mental skills. People taught a skill and then deprived of non-REM sleep could recall what they had learned after sleeping, while people deprived of REM sleep could not.
Some scientists believe dreams are the cortex’s attempt to find meaning in the random signals that it receives during REM sleep. The cortex is the part of the brain that interprets and organizes information from the environment during consciousness. It may be that, given random signals from the pons during REM sleep, the cortex tries to interpret these signals as well, creating a ""story"" out of fragmented brain activity.

Circadian rhythms are regular changes in mental and physical characteristics that occur in the course of a day (circadian is Latin for ""around a day""). Most circadian rhythms are controlled by the body’s biological ""clock."" This clock, called the suprachiasmatic nucleus or SCN, is actually a pair of pinhead-sized brain structures that together contain about 20,000 neurons. The SCN rests in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus, just above the point where the optic nerves cross. Light that reaches photoreceptors in the retina (a tissue at the back of the eye) creates signals that travel along the optic nerve to the SCN.
Signals from the SCN travel to several brain regions, including the pineal gland, which responds to light-induced signals by switching off production of the hormone melatonin. The body’s level of melatonin normally increases after darkness falls, making people feel drowsy."	<urn:uuid:c09d6be2-fd3f-43ba-b55b-7ff7180cafec>	0.0

How does African art connect to tradition, and what's driving its market growth?	"Middle East and Africa Precision Medicine Market (2018-2023)
- Netscribes (India) Pvt. Ltd.
- October 2018
- 75 pages
The precision medicine market in the Middle East and Africa region is expected to grow at a significant because the adoption of IoMT and healthcare technologies has picked up over the last few years. Pharmaceuticals and biotech companies are trying to enhance medication and precision medicine solutions in the region Diagnostic companies are trying to improve the healthcare sector by adopting various technologies. The adoption of technologies like new-generation sequencing and gene therapy are creating opportunities for the growth of precision medicine market in the region. According to Netscribes, the Middle East and Africa precision medicine market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.96%, leading to a revenue of USD 2.51 Bn by 2023.
The Middle East and Africa precision medicine market is classified into three primary segments: based on ecosystem players (pharmaceuticals and biotech companies, clinical laboratories, diagnostic companies and healthcare IT specialists/big data companies); based on therapeutics (cancer, cardiovascular, central nervous system, psychiatric disorder and infectious diseases); based on technology (big data analytics, bioinformatics, gene sequencing, pharmacogenomics and companion diagnostics).
Diagnostic companies hold the largest share in the segment for ecosystem players and are also expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecasted period of 2018-2023. Rising incidences of cancer globally implies that cancer therapeutics will be sought for its prevention as well treatment, because of which it will have the largest share of the therapeutics segment. Due to technological advancements, big data analytics is expected to grow at the highest CAGR with regard to technologies for precision medicine.
Key growth factors
In the African countries, the rising prevalence of diseases like HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, etc., warrant the use of precision medicine, which will in turn, propel the market. The Middle East populations ability to afford precision medicine is another factor that can be attributed to its growth. Increasing demand for the customized medicine along with the adoption of technology in the region are driving the growth of precision medicine market.
Threats and key players
In the Middle East and African countries, out-of-pocket spending accounts for nearly half the total health-spending. Thus, many people have health insurance coverage, particularly in rural areas and among those who work in the informal sectors."	<urn:uuid:cc53dc63-54ae-4626-8901-5abb66060a16>	0.0
What were some of the biggest safety challenges faced by race car drivers at Le Mans during the 1960s?	"There have been many recent developments in the world of sports car racing over the past few months, with important announcements coming from a large number of major automakers. This leads me to believe that we are on the cusp of something great, and something historic. Sports car racing has always been defined by manufacturer involvement, and I believe that is beginning to return on a large scale.
Sports car racing is one of the oldest forms of racing, and it has a long and illustrious history of manufacturer involvement. The prestige of many manufacturers is tied to their efforts and accomplishments in sports car racing in the past, especially at Le Mans, with major marques such as Porsche, Ferrari, BMW, Mercedes, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Bentley, Renault, Toyota, Mazda, McLaren, Nissan, and Ford all having a storied and celebrated history in the sport. These manufacturer efforts defined the racing, the rivalries, and the sport.
Unfortunately, after 1999, manufacturer involvement became sparse. Mercedes pulled out of sports car racing indefinitely after an aerodynamic design flaw caused Peter Dumbreck's CLR to spectacularly become airborne during Le Mans in 1999 (Mark Webber's CLR also experienced this during warm-ups). Toyota stopped their GT-One program and transitioned into Formula 1. BMW also made a transition to Formula 1, but ran the BMW V12 LMR for one more year in the American Le Mans Series. BMW took the win at Charlotte and Silverstone, but the V12 LMR could not match the pace of the new Audi R8, and BMW retired their LMP effort before the last race of the season.
Audi prototypes went on to define sports car racing and Le Mans throughout the 2000's. There were short lived and unsuccessful prototype efforts from Chrysler, Cadillac, and Panoz, and none of these efforts could match the Audi R8's performance, and the car won at Le Mans five times in six years (The one year an R8 did not win was 2003. Audi provided an engine, staff, and drivers to Bentley, a fellow member of the Volkswagen Auto Group, and Bentley won with the Speed 8). After another successful year for the R8 in 2005, Audi introduced its successor, the R10 TDI, which in 2006 became the first diesel to win at Le Mans."	<urn:uuid:928e460b-2ff7-47a2-ba32-523e7afd14ee>	0.0
What's similar about signals in marching band and African drumming?	"And Billy Zoom, I don't think he ever made an album for Rolling Rock, but I know he cut a handful of tracks that came out on various compilations.
And he would be part of the, sort of a revue. There would be a Rolling Rock Revue with Ray Campi and his Rockabilly Rebels and uh, oh God, there were several others and I can't remember them. Whoever Rockin' Ron could find, that would sing rockabilly, would be part of this.
And Billy Zoom was one of them. And Billy Zoom was, at the time, was termed ""The Eddie Cochran of the '70s,"" because he sang a little bit like Eddie Cochran. And he played a lot like him.
So Billy Zoom was in X the first time I saw X. And I had met Exene before that, before they had played. And I may have even met John Doe before that. And I definitely met DJ Bonebrake, the drummer, because he was drumming in several bands before that. He was in the Flesh Eaters and he was in the band Charlotte Caffey of the GoGo's was in, the Eyes.
So, he was drumming in the Eyes, he was drumming in the Flesh Eaters he might have even been in the Plugs and a couple of other bands. But one day I saw him in X, drumming for X. And I go, ""Man, you're in all these bands what's goin' on?""
He goes, ""This is my band, man.""
And he stayed with X.
And X, the first time I saw them, it was just...it reminded me of rockabilly riffs. A lot of Billy Zoom's riffs were rockabilly riffs, just louder and faster. You know what I mean?

russian higher education investment returns	"A Ponzi/Pyramids scheme is a fraudulent investment scheme in which an individual or organization pays returns to its investors from new capital paid by new investors, rather than from profit earned through legitimate sources.
The scheme promises high returns with little or no risk involved, but in reality, generates returns for older investors by acquiring new investors.
CHARACTERISTICS OF PONZI SCHEMES.
- They never make legitimate investments or assets sufficient to sustain the promised payouts.
- They require the entrance of new investors to pay existing investors. These new entrants are likely to lose their investment as they will not be able to recoup their investment before the collapse of the scheme.
- They promise high returns on investment, usually higher than the prevailing Central Bank of Nigeria’s Monetary Policy Rate (MPR).
- They are not registered by the appropriate regulatory agencies.
- Their promoters are not known to the investing public.
WHO ARE FUND/PORTFOLIO MANAGERS?
Fund/Portfolio Managers are registered by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) and are members of the Fund Managers Association of Nigeria (FMAN). These firms have displayed sufficient expertise/professionalism and the capacity to manage money on behalf of their clients for a fee. They have the mandate/professionalism to safeguard and maximize returns on investment, as well as to assist investors diversify their risk.
Fund/Portfolio Managers perform the following functions among others:
- Investment advisory services
- Selection of securities for the fund/portfolio
- Management of fund/portfolio on behalf of investors
BEFORE YOU INVEST IN ANY SCHEME, PLEASE ENSURE THAT THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED:
- Do you understand the nature of the investment?
- What type of business is the scheme into?
- Is the product or service the company is purporting to sell genuine and tangible?
- Is the rate of returns sustainable? Is it lower or higher than the CBN Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) of 14 %?
Prospective investors should avoid any investment they do not understand. Find out how and in what product your money will be invested. Where the promised rate of returns is abnormal e.g above 20% per annum, the genuineness of the investment is in question. Ensure that the guarantee of your returns is not based on recruiting new investors.
- How do you keep track of your investments?
- Request for documentary evidence of your investment."	<urn:uuid:c71792b2-7d8c-4943-93b0-6ff741746a00>	0.0
new mexico acequia irrigation system purpose benefits	"What is a smart irrigation system
A smart irrigation system allows for users to establish a watering schedule. The system works automatically by collecting environmental data or meteorological data. Users can also manually input information to regulate their smart irrigation system. Smart irrigation systems were designed to be convenient and efficient. This article will go over how a smart irrigation system works, the different types of smart irrigation systems and the benefits of installing a smart irrigation system.
How it works
A smart irrigation system adjusts a user’s lawn watering schedule based on a variety of factors. These factors can include soil condition, the weather, plant types and the rate of evaporation. Using any of these measurements allows a smart irrigation system to adjust accordingly to any changes in precipitation or temperature. Most smart irrigation systems can be divided into two categories. There are Weather-based smart irrigation controllers and then there are smart irrigation systems that measure the amount of moisture in the soil. Weather-based smart sprinkler controllers are often called evapotranspiration. The word Evapotranspiration comes from two weather factors, Soil-surface evaporation and transpiration. Transpiration is the process by which water travels through a plant and is evaporated from the plants through its stem, leaves or flowers. To measure soil-surface evaporation and plant transpiration, a smart irrigation system measures humidity, solar radiation, temperature and changes in the wind. This information is normally collected on-site, but this data can also be collected from public meteorological data available on the internet. A soil-based smart controller collects data from sensors buried in on-site soil. If the controller detects enough moisture in the soil it will reschedule the irrigation process.
Which system should you use
The decision to use a weather-base controller versus a soil base controller depends on user preferences. Weather-base controllers are easier to set up but not considered as accurate as soil base controllers by some experts. Soil-based controllers are considered very accurate because they take measurements directly from the soil. The Potential downside to soil-based controllers is that they have to be adjusted and require wiring or need multiple sensors connected to the controller.
A good system would be the Rachio 3, which has been reviewed in this article: Techimperatives.com – Spice up your garden with a smart irrigation controller.
But there are also quite a few youtube videos that showcase how it works.
Benefits of a smart irrigation system
Installing a smart irrigation system can benefit users in multiple ways."	<urn:uuid:011454aa-7978-486b-8541-9e5d0fa69a41>	0.0
Which publications showcased Futurist typography between 1913 and 1918?	"As you can read in the title , Willem Sandberg experimented with typography and designs.
During the occupation by the Germans he published experimental books with his own typography. Mostly a combination of very original and personal lay-out and torn out letters, making these publications unique. Unique because of their chosen size, material, printing ,their design and the very limited numbers in which they were produced.
Sandberg produced nineteen pamphlets between December 1943 and April 1945, making a couple of copies of each one, all done by hand. They consisted of twenty to sixty pages of drawings, collages, and texts, which were either written by Sandberg himself or quoted from Confucius, Proudhon, Stendhal, and other favorite writers on themes like love, death, education, architecture, and typography. As Sandberg had no money and materials were scarce in wartime, he improvised by using whatever he could find: scraps of wallpaper, cardboard packaging, tissue paper, and wrapping paper together with photographs, drawings, and symbols torn from magazines for his collages.
The originals are very very rare and exceptionally hard to find. Luckily some of the dutch publishers decided to make some reprints and make them in this way available for other admirers. These reprints are getting more scarce every year now, but www.ftn-books.com still has some available."	<urn:uuid:df0da014-6bb8-4da8-b975-0c00bbb02c78>	0.0
How tall is the Temple of Kukulkan pyramid?	"The remains of the ancient Khmer capital of Angkor contain hundreds of fantastic buildings against a dramatic backdrop of verdant jungle, and the temple of Baphuon is one of the most interesting of them.
One of the greatest tropes in all of fiction is the temple that, when desecrated, dramatically collapses with the heroes rushing to escape. No temple from real life exemplifies this trope more than the enormous Baphuon, which was originally 50 metres tall and still stands 34 metres today. Originally dedicated to Shiva when it was built in the 11th century, the 16m bronze and stone altar at the top was disassembled and turned into a statue of the reclining Buddha on the west side of the second story. But the stones removed were not as ornamental as they seemed: they held back a massive wall of sand which flooded out, destroying the reclining Buddha and the entire western side of the pyramid. That is certainly one way to defend your temple from beyond the grave.
It wasn’t until 400 years later in 1960 when it was reassembled, and it wasn’t opened to the public until 2011. It’s got the reclining Buddha statue, only thankfully now the entire thing is reinforced with metal throughout.
The Red Queen Of Palenque
In another steamy, jungle-clad land filled with monumental buildings, but half a millennia earlier, one of the most dramatic booby traps of all time was being set in the tomb of the Red Queen of Palenque. Red, being the colour of blood, was of paramount importance to the murderous Maya – it coloured nearly all of their buildings, much of their clothing, and in the case of the Red Queen and Lord Pacal, their bones. These two Maya nobles were entombed in the base of two separate pyramid temples in stunning Palenque. The stairway from the altar to their death chambers were filled in with rocks and then sealed with another false floor, and when discovered it took years to unearth. But that wasn’t the trap. The trap was what was waiting inside their sarcophagi. Their bones had been painted red with cinnabar – a deadly neurotoxin made from ground mercury ore. The deadly paste covered not just their bones, but also all of the jade, pearls, and other treasures in there with them."	<urn:uuid:a9dd6789-d9e9-41a3-a1e7-d06cd4af746a>	0.0

four ways answering questions buddhism what are they	"Four Schools of Buddhism
An understanding of how Buddhist philosophical systems evolved allows us to see the ever-growing subtlety and refinement of view. As typically occurs both historically and logically, one school grew from another, and different views emerged gradually. Four schools of Buddhism are covered as follows:
The first two schools, the Vaibhashika (Great Exposition) school and the Sautrantika (Sutra) school, searched for the basic building block of the universe, and because these basic particles were seen as truly existent, these two schools are known as realist schools. These two schools assert only the selflessness of persons, not the selflessness of phenomena.
With the third school, the Chittamatra (Mind Only) school, the intrinsic reality of external objects is questioned. It is argued that whereas the mind is real, the objects perceived by the mind cannot have independent existence because of that very reliance on the mind to ascertain them.
Finally, there is the Madhyamaka (Middle Way) school, the fourth and “highest”, or most subtle school. The Madhyamaka view is the “middle way” because its position lies between what it sees as the eternalism of the first two schools that sees objects as existing from their own side, and the nihilism of the Chittamatra school that asserts that things and events have no reality at all.
The four schools are divided into the non-Mahayana schools of Vaibhashika and Sautrantika and the Mahayana schools of Chittamatra and Madhyamaka.

What's the story behind how doctors came to completely separate the acts of healing and killing? I've always wondered about the historical background.	"Image: Matthew Loffhagen
Period fiction is a surprisingly popular genre used to place stories in the time period and setting that works best for them. It’s not always completely accurate, but it does convey a spirit that’s hard to capture in any other way, and there’s a large readership out there who are ready to suspend their disbelief and dive in. Here’s how to help them.
What is period fiction?
Isn’t it just another word for historical fiction? Well, sort of. There’s a lot of crossover, but talking about the subtle differences can help us filter out what we’re not trying to do and polish what we are.
Historical fiction typically includes real historical places (London) and people (Winston Churchill). Period fiction emulates a certain period of history to create a certain feel. Maybe you just want to emulate a certain feel, maybe you want to include some anachronistic details to make the plot sing, or maybe the real history is a bit too turbulent, and you want your story to unfold without it being interrupted or upstaged by real events.
You’ll find that much of the advice in here applies to both styles, but it’s geared toward period fiction. When writing period fiction, your grasp of history doesn’t need to be excruciatingly detailed and deeply philosophical. Most people read the story for the story, not for the history lesson. (There’s always Tolstoy for that.) Still, even the average reader will notice if your Roman centurion suddenly jumps in a tank. That’s why research is so important.
Rule #1 – Research is king
Pause for a second and imagine something with me: you’re thumbing through your friend’s photo album, enjoying the candid shots of her son’s bar mitzvah, and you come across a professional portrait. The background is the sandy shore of a lake in town, and it’s clearly a perfect, sunny day for taking pictures.
Unfortunately, there’s someone in the background. Actually, there are a few people – some are really far away, part of the background, actually helping the impression of a genuine, captured moment, but one’s closer, and they’re pulling a stupid face. As much as you don’t want it to, that stupid face spoils the picture. It’s so patently obvious that they don’t belong in the photo!"	<urn:uuid:2f102783-539a-43b4-bab4-671d0a7f505b>	0.0

What protects gas in different galaxies from destruction?	"Back to the Space Place Index
So Little Time,
So Many Galaxies
Fourteen billion years ago, just after the Big Bang,
was an expanding fireball, white hot and nearly uniform. All of
space was filled with elementary particles and radiation.
""Soupy"" is how some cosmologists describe it.
Today the universe is completely different. It's still
expanding-even accelerating-but there the resemblance ends. The
universe we live in now is ""lumpy."" Great cold voids are sprinkled
with glowing galaxies. In galaxies, there are stars.
Around stars, there are planets. On one planet, at
How we got from there to here is a mystery.
Finding out is the goal the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, ""GALEX"" for
short, a small NASA spacecraft launched into Earth orbit
2003. GALEX carries an ultraviolet (UV) telescope for
galaxies as far away as 10 billion light-years.
""GALEX is a time machine,"" says astronomer Peter Friedman
Caltech. Because light takes time to travel from place to place,
pictures of distant galaxies reveal them as they were in
""GALEX is investigating the evolution of galaxies over 80%
history of our universe.""
The Hubble Space Telescope can see faraway galaxies, too,
has an advantage: While Hubble looks in great detail at
regions of the sky, GALEX is surveying the entire sky,
millions of galaxies during its 2-year mission.
GALEX is a UV mission for a reason. Friedman explains: ""UV
radiation is a telltale sign of star birth."" Stars
when knots of gas condense in interstellar clouds. The ones we see
best are the big ones-massive stars that burn hot and emit lots of
UV radiation. ""These stars are short-lived, so they trace
recent star formation.""
Understanding star formation is crucial to studies of galaxy
evolution. When galaxies collide, star formation surges.
galaxies run out of interstellar gas, star formation wanes.
galaxies like the Milky Way, spiral arms are outlined by

difference norse finnish folklore explanation northern lights what causes	"Mikko had the camera on the tripod poised and ready to capture each moment the Northern Lights appeared. On this particular hunt were tourists from Germany and Malaysia who had travelled specifically to see the Northern Lights in Finland. One by one we jumped in and out of shot to get snapped with the Aurora Borealis swirling in the background. The phrase ‘like a child in a sweet shop’ springs to mind! Ecstatic!
COLOUR IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER
Now, this paragraph may come as a surprise (or shock) to most of you…but here goes! Aurora Borealis photographs always look unbelievable on the WWW, full of colour and splendour. Unfortunately, in real time; the Northern Lights may actually look a tad different. Try and imagine a vapour trail in the sky, that’s pretty much what my naked eye saw, whitish-grey but no colour. Mummy on the other hand saw an abundance of colour! Colour depends on your own vision, the night and other scientific circumstances. Rarely do you see intense colour within the Aurora Borealis unless they appear as a ‘big show’, then the colours are vivid and intense. Of course, that also depends on where in the world you’re viewing the Aurora Borealis from. The further North or South you are, the more vibrant the colour. And…well, let’s just leave it there and say it’s complex…very complex!
LIGHTS THAT ILLUMINATE THE SOUL
As the hunt progressed through the evening the Northern Lights became much stronger. The cavorting lights put on a show worthy of an appearance at the West End. As our group stood looking at the Aurora Borealis, a silence fell and we simply allowed the various colours to light up our souls. Magical, peaceful, enigmatic! In our opinion, there aren’t that many places better than Finnish Lapland to catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights. With crystal-white snow, the stark winters of the northern hemisphere provide the perfect backdrop for seeking out the Aurora Borealis. Our Aurora Borealis hunt with Mikko is one of the most memorable experiences of our March 2019 holiday to Ruka and Rovaniemi. Witnessing the Northern Lights in Finland often tops people’s bucket lists, but for now, we are ecstatic to cross this one off ours."	<urn:uuid:da91e343-4662-40e6-9ada-23d4a73d0a91>	0.0
What concerns did early political thinkers like Weber and Tocqueville have about bureaucratization in modern mass societies, and what solution did they propose?	"Location: New York City
Title: Capitalism and the Future of Democracy
Dates: November 10, 2014 – November 21, 2014
What is the relationship between capitalism and democracy? Does economic liberty serve and strengthen political freedom, or does the pursuit of self-interest undermine the moral qualities necessary for political freedom? Does modern democracy ensure a free and flourishing economy, or do the egalitarian ideals of democratic man require limitations on market competition and an ever-expanding welfare state? In the modern age, capitalism and democracy emerged together as two ideas of how human beings should govern themselves. It is no coincidence of history that Adam Smith’s classic The Wealth of Nations, the foundational text for the modern idea of the free economy, was published in the same year (1776) that a new democracy was founded in America. This vision of the good society was dedicated to protecting the rights of man to choose one’s leaders and to pursue one’s economic interests. The role of government was to ensure that all citizens could exercise these self-evident rights and liberties forever and always.
From the beginning, democratic and capitalist societies have inspired great moral and political opposition. Modern welfare-state democracies have chosen to set significant limits on the free economy and to redistribute wealth in the name of equality. We have also seen many democratic societies whose origins were not capitalist at all—like modern Israel; and we have seen societies attempting to combine the wealth that only capitalism creates with autocratic governments that no friend of liberty could ever condone. This institute aims to explore the fundamental questions of political economy, by drawing upon classic texts of modern economic and democratic thought, and then looking at key modern debates and policy dilemmas now facing the advanced democracies of the world.
Week One will be led by Yuval Levin, founding editor of National Affairs and one of the leading public intellectuals in the U.S. Through the study of Aristotle and John Locke, Adam Smith and Karl Marx, we will explore the relationship between the pursuit of wealth and the quest for the virtuous society. Week Two will be led by Christopher DeMuth, former president of the American Enterprise Institute and Distinguished Fellow at the Hudson Institute. Turning to modern thinkers who help us understand the relationship between democratic politics, public policy, and economic prosperity, we will study Hayek, Shumpeter, Irving Kristol, and selections from Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century."	<urn:uuid:74def23d-7fe9-46ec-88d8-d62bd0e33604>	0.0

How did Russia's role differ in the two world wars?	"""Lord of this Rings"" trilogy, authored by John Ronal Reuel Tolkien between 1937 and 1949 is an epic book, emerge the imaginary Middle Earth, by which a brotherhood of humans, elves and dwarves battles against a mighty force of evil, Sauron and his minions to guard the no-cost globe from destruction and slavery. Although the writer denies the book is an allegory of war, people believe he was affected considerably by the very first and 2nd World Wars. My study question was ""exactly how did the Two World Wars Influence John Ronald Reuel Tolkien During the Creation of “ god of the Rings” Trilogy ?"" . I am going to analyze the similarities amongst the activities into the novel as well as the events during two globe wars and make an effort to point out just how Tolkien had been influenced by these. The main allegory may be the struggle amongst the ultimate evil of Sauron (ie. Nazism and Fascism) and the free individuals of Middle Earth. Although evil is a lot more powerful and aggressive initially, the dedication and valor of a coalition of unlikely allies wins ultimately. Many points exist in the novel being straight pertaining to the events throughout the globe conflicts. Nazi Germany, defeated and repressed following the First World War, rises once more as an over-industrialized, dangerous nation, wanting to spread its influence worldwide. It is just like Sauron and the forces of evil, beaten when you look at the Second Age because of the coalition of elves and people, rises all over again to jeopardize Middle Earth and enslave its folks. SS soldiers, performing unspeakable deeds throughout the Holocaust remind united states of mindless orcs whom complete the requests of the masters without thinking. The uneasy alliance created because of the democratic capitalist nations utilizing the communist Russians through the Second World War is a lot like the alliance of elves and dwarves; even though they aren't keen on each other, they unite against a standard enemy. Geographic similarities; the role of the Nazgul and V2 rockets; the similarity of Sauron's military aided by the German war machine; Saruman's similarity to Mussolini; the likeness of Dead Marshes to your battlefields of Somme are also small but essential things."	<urn:uuid:b19251f2-3646-4d1f-847c-2776a36bfbd6>	0.0

What different observations require a thorough sputum specimen collection?	"We received acceptability questionnaires from 471/480 study participants (98%). Overall, participants expressed a high level of acceptance of self-sampling as shown in Table 3. Most participants (92%) expressed willingness to self-collect a pharyngeal specimen at home. Given an option between clinician collection and self-collection, 54% of participants expressed no preference, whereas a few more preferred self-collection. The majority of participants agreed or strongly agreed that instructions were easy to follow (89%) and that the specimen was easy to self-collect (80%). A few participants expressed some discomfort with self collection, but the overall level of acceptability remained high (average score = 2.64). Among those who expressed difficulty or self-reported problems with specimen collection in the questionnaire, we found no significant differences in test results by method of specimen collection (data not shown).
This study of self-sampling for the detection of pharyngeal NG and CT infection among MSM in San Francisco showed excellent agreement22 between self-collected and clinician-collected specimens using NAATs. Among those who agreed to participate in the study, acceptability was high. Consistent with these findings, previous studies have shown self-sampling to be acceptable and feasible using various noninvasive collection methods, including self-taken vaginal,18 as well as pharyngeal and rectal swabs.21
Among asymptomatic MSM in the United Kingdom, Alexander et al. observed high sensitivity but a statistically significant difference in specificity of self-taken compared to nurse-taken pharyngeal specimens.21 Among patients who had a false-positive self-collected pharyngeal specimen, 90.9% (10/11) had a concurrent NG infection at the urethra and/or rectum. In our evaluation, we observed a lower but not inconsequential rate of coinfection at a different anatomical site: 38.5% (5/13) of patients with self-taken NG positive, clinician-negative pharyngeal results had NG infection elsewhere. Our written instructions did not ask patients explicitly to wash their hands before collection, and as such, contamination of collection materials when handling specimens could account for our finding."	<urn:uuid:9e2beddb-cdca-4bf4-ac97-0da861207f4c>	0.0
I'm interested in how access to water affects women's lives - how does the water crisis impact women's ability to work and take care of their families?	"Willen said he's still trying to get permission from Barton to transfer the records electronically, access that he thinks he should have by the end of March.
""We'll get through it. But I'm not going to let any patient that comes to me suffer for it. It won't affect the level of care,"" Willen said.
Sciuto stated in an email that, like Willen, the Barton Women's Health physicians don't need prior medical records to see a patient and that there are no delays regarding Tahoe Women's Care access to their electronic records.
""While it is helpful to have these records, it is not necessary to get an appointment and start care right away ... Barton Women's Health would be happy to work with patients to get the required forms filled out and sent to Tahoe Women's Care or any other prior provider for the acquisition of their files,"" Sciuto wrote.
As a California nonprofit and under the Corporate Practice of Medicine Act, Barton cannot legally employ physicians. Instead, it contracts with a number of physician groups to treat patients at the hospital, physician offices, the community clinic and the surgery center.
Barton entered into contract renewal negotiations with Tahoe Women's Care and Emerald Bay Center for Women's Health in January 2012, but was not able to come to an agreement with the physician groups. According to obstetrician and gynecologist Dr. Kris Kobalter, Barton told Tahoe Women's Care that the practice was losing too much money and they would need to downsize the number of doctors and decrease costs.
Barton was offering competitive, fair market value salaries, Barton Health's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Clint Purvance told the Tribune in October, but the groups couldn't come to an agreement."	<urn:uuid:cbf18474-f1ae-410c-9f12-bb6f63e7227d>	0.0

During the celebration of the Marine Corps birthday at McGarvey's bar, what special piece of military equipment was missing from their traditional cake-cutting ceremony?	"Coleman to lead Vets Day celebration
Padres broadcaster, Marine veteran will speak at museum
Padres broadcaster Jerry Coleman will be the keynote speaker at a Veterans Day ceremony aboard the USS Midway Museum in San Diego on Wednesday.Coleman, a former Marine lieutenant colonel who flew in World War II and the Korean War, will be on hand at 3 p.m. PT when a World War II F4-U Corsair will be craned onto the flight deck as part of the ceremony. Coleman flew that same model in his Marine Corps squadron during the Korean War while the model of aircraft he flew during World War II -- the SBD Dauntless dive bomber -- is already on display on the hangar deck of the Midway. The 85-year-old broadcaster, who just finished his 37th season as the voice of the Padres, is expected to share with the audience his recollections of flying the Corsair and other anecdotes from his Marine Corps and baseball life. It's all part of the Veterans Day celebration at the USS Midway Museum with festivities beginning at 10 a.m. PT. Some highlights of the celebration will be a skydiving demonstration with the skydivers landing on the deck of the Midway, the Park View Little League champions leading the crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance before the ceremony and a blood drive hosted by the San Diego Blood Bank. General admission is $17 for adults, $13 for seniors and $9 for students and youth over the age of 5 with $1 of every paid admission donated to the Veterans Village of San Diego.

body language importance real life versus experiments findings	"Cell-free microRNAs: potential biomarkers in need of standardized reporting
- Asbestos Diseases Research Institute, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia
MicroRNAs are abundantly present and surprisingly stable in multiple biological fluids. These findings have been followed by numerous reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)-based reports revealing the clinical potential of using microRNA levels in body fluids as a biomarker of disease. Despite a rapidly increasing body of literature, the field has failed to adopt a set of standardized criteria for reporting the methodology used in the quantification of cell-free microRNAs. Not only do many studies based on RT-qPCR fail to address the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) criteria but frequently there is also a distinct lack of detail in descriptions of sample source and RNA isolation. As a direct result, it is often impossible to compare the results of different studies, which in turn, hinders progress in the field. To address this point, we propose a simple set of criteria to be used in conjunction with MIQE to reveal the true potential of cell-free microRNAs as biomarkers.
In recent years, a number of studies have shown that cell-free microRNAs are readily detectable in body fluids, such as plasma or serum. The surprising stability of cell-free microRNAs in these body fluids has been attributed to encapsulation of microRNAs in microvesicles such as exosomes (Cortez and Calin, 2009; Kosaka et al., 2010), and association with protein complexes, like high density lipoproteins (Vickers et al., 2011) and argonaute 2 (Arroyo et al., 2011; Turchinovich et al., 2011). These findings led to numerous studies aiming at the identification of microRNAs, mainly in plasma and serum, as potential diagnostic and/or prognostic markers for a variety of diseases (Reid et al., 2011; Creemers et al., 2012; Mo et al., 2012). However, although most studies are using reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for detection of microRNAs, there is still a lack of consensus regarding isolation procedures, optimal quantification methods, reference genes, and quality control of samples."	<urn:uuid:2addf8ad-6804-47ed-b1ce-9fcf25cc1ca1>	0.0
How do safety requirements compare between balconies and fire barrier door assemblies?	"The specific tests, and the most efficient order of testing, depend on the:
Type of system
Number of systems
Progress of new construction or remodeling
Relationship between building systems and specific tenant work
Degree of interaction between other systems
Complexity of the controls sequence
Impact of system failures on fire or life safety and other factors.
Determining the procedures for periodic inspection and testing is a critical component of the overall process. One option is to locate an existing inspection procedure that has already been approved by the AHJ. If an existing procedure exists, it must be followed implicitly. If a procedure cannot be located or does not exist, one must be developed by a qualified professional whose credentials are acceptable to the AHJ. Some AHJs provide the testing and inspection procedure.
Establishing and approving an inspection procedure involves research, including:
Obtaining any existing inspection documents, including any previous inspections or testing reports
Locating relevant information from the overall building design, including design objectives and construction documents
Determining the specifications and location of every life safety damper that is installed in the building.
Once the inspection and testing have been completed, meticulous records must be maintained. Records verify that the proper inspection and testing have been completed and that the building complies with local inspection requirements. These records should contain key information about each damper, such as make or model number, ratings, date installed, observations made during periodic inspection and testing, and any corrective actions taken. Whether handwritten or in electronic format, the records of all inspections and tests must be maintained on-site for at least 3 years, as stated in the codes.

setting up first fish tank how many times day feed fish remove uneaten food after feeding	"If they are siblings of the breeders, they will be tolerated and become part of the colony, helping to guard the perimeter. If they are not siblings of the pair, you might find them up near the surface trying to hide in a corner. It is best to remove these fish, as they will never be accepted into the colony. Once fry begin to appear, add extra food for them. Using a baster, gently add a squirt of newly hatched brine shrimp right into the fry group once a day. Add extra finely ground flakes at feeding time, too. As they grow and disperse, you can eventually start feeding them the same foods as the adults.
The colony will grow and ultimately take up as much room in the tank as it can, and there will be nowhere else for the fish to go. At this point, the pair usually stops spawning. Before you reach this point, it’s a good idea to thin out the tank. Many fish breeders do this once or twice a year. One caveat I will have to add is that it is nearly impossible to remove fish from a tank with a rock pile! Once it is set up, you won’t want to be tearing it down too often. But be aware that you will have to thin out the population at some point.
Remember, in the wild, predators would be removing some of the fry and juveniles. That doesn’t usually happen in our aquaria. So once or twice a year, plan an afternoon to give the tank a makeover. I’ve found the easiest way to do so is to carefully remove the entire rock pile from the tank and then net the fish you want to remove. If you try to chase them around with a net without removing the rock pile, all you will do is spook the fish and waste your time. You might get one or two, but most will dive for the safety of the rock pile. By removing it, you will remove their hidey holes and make them much easier to catch with much less stress on both you and the fish. After removing as many fish as you feel adequate, reset the rocks in a similar arrangement. The remaining fish will figure things out on their own.
I find that most of the fairy cichlids are in high demand, and local shops usually love to get locally raised fish in trade."	<urn:uuid:d2d0d6f9-2dfa-4a19-9402-6b0d7c1385ad>	0.0
required steps joining catholic church new member	"In those cases, state law says, clergy may withhold a report if the clergy member feels it is “reasonable and necessary within the concepts of the religion.”
Thirty-two states besides Arizona have such exemptions, commonly called the ""clergy-penitent privilege."" They are a necessary protection of the First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom from government dictates, say attorneys who have represented religious institutions.
Keeping confessions confidential is a key tenet of many faiths. Historians believe it originated with the seal of confession in Roman Catholic canon law, tracing it back centuries, to the origins of the Christian Church.
In the ninth century, Catholic church law added punishment for any priest who violated the confessional seal. Today, that punishment would likely be excommunication, church officials say.
Other faiths also recognized the confidentiality of confessions. That secrecy is necessary to make a penitent feel free to confess his or her wrongdoing and seek forgiveness.
To force a clergy member to report a confidential communication ""changes the whole nature of the confessional,"" said state Sen. Eddie Farnsworth, R-Gilbert, and a member of the Mormon Church. Earlier this year, he declined to give a hearing to a bill that sought to further narrow the clergy exemption.
Piercing the confidentiality that surrounds confessions would invite a First Amendment clash, said Ron Johnson, executive director of the Arizona Catholic Conference.
“Basically, it’s the government regulating a sacrament,” he said.
Courts have largely upheld the clergy exemption.
A January decision from the Montana Supreme Court concluded that Jehovah’s Witness elders who learned of a member’s repeated sex abuse were not required to report the abuse to authorities “because their church doctrine, canon, or practice required that clergy keep reports of child abuse confidential.” The man had for nine years abused two of his stepchildren as well as his stepgranddaughter.
Calls for change
In recent years, adult survivors of child abuse and others have pushed to overturn these exceptions. They argue the laws allow child abuse to continue, when in other circumstances — such as a teacher who reports abuse — there is the opportunity to stop the perpetrator before further harm is done.
Legislation introduced this year in Arizona and Utah, and last year in California, sought to remove or modify the clergy-penitent exception. The bills failed, but the sponsors say they'll try again."	<urn:uuid:d9def403-3e65-48b4-9463-5e8b42319f3b>	0.0
original purpose chicago river flow reversal history reason	"In 1976 the Churchill River water flow was diverted into the Nelson River at Missi falls at the mouth of South Indian Lake. This diversion, caused the Churchill River to have 15% of the original flow and created controversy stemming mainly from Cree and aboriginal groups concern over their native lands resources.
Affects on wildlife habitat and communities along the river to the north have never been adequately measured so affects on fish and the beluga whale population are relatively unknown. In Churchill, a weir and marina was constructed as part of the mitigation process by Manitoba Hydro. Although the observation tower the marina gives a nice view of the inlet off the river, the marina gets minimal usage. The weir allows the regulation of water levels south of that point for fishing and boating excursions. The beluga whale population ventures shorter distances up-river in summertime due to the tidal flow and shallow water. This might have had some affects on the population or it may have caused some whales to change habitat location and venture to other estuaries with warm rivers flowing into them. When belugas give birth and nurture their young they have an easier time with the moderate temperature warm waters flowing from the south.
I can’t imagine what the flow of the Churchill River would be like at 85% more pressure. Guiding over a decade of Churchill Arctic summer seasons I have experienced just about every type of conditions on the river and in the Hudson Bay. Although higher water flow would not have a profound affect within the main part of the river, the mouth and inlets would be very different at tidal changes. It’s very tricky at times to maneuver through the mouth of the river due to the currents and topography below. With more flow this could be easier or harder but would most likely have a bearing on fish and whales. Inlets and calving/ nurseries would be larger and deeper farther up-river…that is a surety.
The affects on southern communities associated with the diversion have been quite harmful in many instances. South Indian Lake was forced to relocate and has since lost most of their original one million pound whitefish production…down to 100,000 pounds at last count.In the end, the benefits of the diversion and Nelson River power plants output have not been without issues. Having to ship the power to far southern communities has taken more resources and money than originally planned."	<urn:uuid:2683e06e-6af7-4c3c-a27d-4de09549117d>	0.0

However, time and time once more, many entrepreneurs find themselves hitting a brick wall and shedding momentum when it comes time to really supply products. For expert chemists, it’s also possible to manufacture chemical substances for corporations that use them in numerous products and processes, though you may also nonetheless likely need to take care of loads of rules.
Any effort by the Division of Justice to sever these companies by product group is silly as a result of it cuts across the grain of their manufacturing group. By specializing in mature actions, you reinforce your basis of operational excellenceâ€”excessive performance in all areas contributing to buyer satisfaction: product high quality, lead time, on-time supply, technical assist.

daily minimum cobalamine dosage kidney disease	"Kidneys, the pair of bean-shaped organs in the lower abdomen, help remove excess water and waste from the body. Kidney diseases such as kidney infections, kidney stones, renal failure and kidney cancer affect the healthy functioning of these organs. In fact, the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse estimates that more than 10 percent of the American population 20 years or older has chronic kidney disease. Apart from medications and surgery, garlic may also help manage kidney diseases. Talk to your doctor to find out if garlic is right for you.
Garlic as Medicine
Garlic, or Allium sativum, is a small, perennial plant native to central Asia. The cloves from the bulbs of the plant are traditionally used as a spice and flavoring agent in many cultures around the world. Garlic contains a chemical compound known as allicin that gives it immense medicinal value. The common cold, infection, heart disease and certain cancers are just some of the conditions that may be treated using fresh garlic or garlic supplements, available in powder, capsule, oil and liquid extract form. Their appropriate form and dose varies, depending on your age and overall health. Talk to your doctor to establish a regimen that is right for you.
Role in Kidney Health
The biologically active components of garlic can inhibit the production of blood pressure-enhancing hormones by the kidneys. They can also lower the reabsorption of salts by the kidneys and increase urine production. All these mechanisms may help reduce high blood pressure, says Dr. James Scala, author of the book “Twenty-Five Natural Ways to Lower Blood Pressure.” A study published in a 2008 issue of the journal “Pharmacological Reports” also reveals that garlic can significantly lessen kidney damage associated with mercury chloride exposure in laboratory animals. Mercury chloride -- used in disinfectants, insecticides, batteries, wood preservatives and other products you may come in contact with daily -- is a potential carcinogen, although its effects have not been proven conclusively in humans. Another study in the February 2001 issue of the journal “Food and Chemical Toxicology” points out that low doses of garlic may increase the antioxidant status of kidneys and protect them from free radical-mediated damage. The authors of the study, however, point out that high doses of the herb may have the opposite effect, and thereby emphasize that more research has to be done determine a safe dosage range for garlic."	<urn:uuid:3dd179b9-080f-499b-a224-9e73c049be27>	0.0
vr technology applications aerospace industry education sector development differences similarities	"Inspiring innovation in aerospace with Zimmermann and Kingsbury
KYOCERA SGS helped to support innovation in the aerospace sector at a hugely successful Technology Day organised with Zimmermann and Kingsbury in November.
Held in Neuhausen, Germany, the event focused around the machining of structural aerospace parts and provided a unique opportunity for leaders in the industry to view Zimmermann’s FZH400 machine in action. The FZH400 is a horizontal-spindle machining centre for the efficient production of structural components in the aerospace industry. It is a quantum leap in the machining of structural aerospace components and has been shown to achieve a metal removal rate of 13 litres per minute!
With Zimmermann recognised for manufacturing the most advanced portal milling machines on the market, KYOCERA SGS known as leaders in the tooling industry and Kingsbury valued for providing manufacturers with innovative machining solutions, the event brought together a huge amount of engineering expertise. It came about thanks to the strong working relationship and history of collaboration between the three companies.
The team from KYOCERA SGS involved with helping to organise the day in conjunction with Zimmermann and Kingsbury was made up of Ray Gibbs, Aerospace Technologies Manager and Steve Neale, Senior Applications Engineer, with support from Antony Theaker, UK Sales Manager, David Colton, EU Sales Director and Joao Alves, European Application Engineer.
As well as impressive high-speed roughing, high-speed finishing and other technical demonstrations, the packed agenda included company and partner presentations, factory tours and networking.

I'm interested in healthcare careers with regular schedules. How do the work hours compare between being an athletic trainer in a DME department and a phlebotomy technician?	"Choosing a Phlebotomy Technician Course near Yorklyn Delaware
Picking the right phlebotomy technician training near Yorklyn DE is an essential first step toward a gratifying career as a phlebotomist. It might seem like a challenging undertaking to evaluate and compare each of the training options that are available to you. Nevertheless it’s necessary that you do your due diligence to ensure that you obtain a superior education. In fact, a large number of potential students start their search by considering two of the qualifiers that initially come to mind, which are cost and location. An additional option you may look into is whether to attend classes online or commute to an area campus. We’ll talk a bit more about online schools later in this article. What’s important to keep in mind is that there is a lot more to comparing phlebotomy training programs than finding the closest or the cheapest one. Other factors including accreditation and reputation are also important considerations and should be part of your selection process too. To assist in that effort, we will provide a list of questions that you should ask each of the phlebotomy schools you are evaluating to help you choose the best one for you. But before we do that, let’s cover what a phlebotomist is and does, and afterwards resume our conversation about online training.
Phlebotomist Job Summary
A phlebotomist, or phlebotomy technician, collects blood samples from patients. While that is their primary responsibility, there is in fact so much more to their job description. Before drawing a blood sample, a phlebotomist needs to verify that the tools being used are sterile and single use only. Following the collection, the sample must be properly labeled with the patient’s information. Afterward, paperwork has to be properly completed in order to track the sample from the time of collection through the lab testing process. The phlebotomist then transports the blood to either an in-house lab or to an outside lab facility where it may be tested for such things as infectious diseases, pregnancy or blood type. A number of Yorklyn DE phlebotomists in fact work in labs and are accountable for ensuring that samples are tested correctly utilizing the highest quality control procedures. And if those weren’t sufficient responsibilities, they might be asked to train other phlebotomists in the collection, delivery and follow-up process.

‘For geographers across the globe this book provides the arguments for a return to the teaching of geography and why they should reject the politicisation of the subject by education policy makers and politicians. Standish’s careful critique shows the necessity of a depoliticised geography curriculum the irony of which would be that it would ensure that every child could point to Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan on a map.’ Prof. Dennis Hayes – Oxford Brookes University, UK 'A prescient and critical analysis of the changing face of geography teaching. This book deserves to be widely read and debated. Alex Standish's book puts current trends in geography teaching in historical and critical context. It comprises a forthright and timely defence of geographical education for its own sake.' Dr Jim Butcher, FRSA, Department of Sport Science, Tourism and Leisure, Canterbury Christ Church University. Since the early 1990s, educational policy makers and some subject leaders have been seeking to fundamentally change the teaching of geography in UK and US schools, from a subject which encourages students to explore spatial concepts, ideas and skills, to a more ethics based subject concerned with the promotion of environmentalism, cultural diversity and social justice. In this book the new approach is critically examined, within a historical and ideological context, addressing a number of fundamental questions: Should geography be used as a tool for the delivery of citizenship ideals? How does this affect the intellectual and moral value of geographical education for young people? If the state and teachers are taking more responsibility for the values, attitudes and emotional responses of students, how will they learn to develop these qualities for themselves? If global perspectives shift the focus of education from learning about the outside world to learning about the self, what is its vision of social progress and conception of social change? This book advocates a return to liberal models of education, arguing that the new approach to geography currently being promoted for schools fundamentally undermines the educational value of the subject, and the freedom of young people to shape the world in which they live. A vital resource for teachers and student teachers alike, Global Perspectives in the Geography Curriculum makes a significant contribution to the growing debate about the future direction of the discipline itself."	<urn:uuid:0577abfb-9161-41a9-b6c4-acc8463d0baa>	0.0

What national recognition did TCU Chemistry Club receive in 2020?	"06 Oct Building Your Brand: A 4-part Series / College Football Shows Us How
It seems like every year we see a blue chip program, a college football team everyone expects to win, beaten by a relative unknown. How is this possible? The public just didn’t recognize the second team’s brand. People like what they know—that doesn’t mean unknown teams can’t be any good. It all is a part of building your brand.
Let’s take Texas Christian University (TCU), for example. While the TCU program had success in the past, they came on the scene in a huge way in 2014. Out of the Big 12 Conference, it was Oklahoma and Texas everyone expects to win, because they had the name recognition. Why was TCU doing all the damage?
But can an unknown team stay on top, year after year? Unlikely. Without that name recognition, a football program can’t attract and keep the top coaches and won’t pull in the most promising players. A popular college football team translates into better enrollment and more donations from graduates. That ultimately means a bigger budget and more options for the team. For an up-and-coming program, the challenge is first to succeed on the field without the advantages of the bigger programs—and then to create a strong brand capable of supporting consistent success.
Of course, winning does generate buzz. A good product or service gets people talking, and there are companies that do well on word-of-mouth alone. But most of us need more than that. We need to think about our image, build our brand. So let’s take the next three blog posts and talk about branding, on and off the field: how to get on the score board by trying something new; what to do about negative publicity; and how look and style contribute to long-term success."	<urn:uuid:5c6587e8-e41b-43f6-b7c1-378e48607305>	0.0

I've been studying the relationship between maternal mental health and pediatric outcomes - what's known about how maternal depression affects infant development, and what screening protocols are currently recommended to identify at-risk mothers?	"(13) Although there are kinks and coils to iron out, this is a win for Black women that is derived from a rich history of reproductive agency and the traditions of Black granny midwives. Other programs like the Philadelphia Alliance for Labor Support at the University of Pennsylvania and the Maternity Care Coalition should be applauded and funded for their efforts to train community doulas and extend services to clients free of charge, empowering mothers of all backgrounds to exert their reproductive rights.
At its core, city planning curriculum in universities around the country can do a better job of linking policy and plans to real people, real places, and real problems. There is no better place to explore innovative, blue-sky, and radical approaches to some of our countries biggest problems than inside the walls and with the resources of an academic institution. JeffDESIGN is a collaborative academic program between Philadelphia University and Thomas Jefferson University. This program teaches design and creative problem solving methods and it aims to equip the next generation of doctors with the skills and confidence to transform healthcare systems, services, spaces, and devices.(14) The way our current healthcare system is designed has greatly affected the health disparities we see today. Have you seen the inside of a labor room at your local hospital lately? How did it make you feel? Were you satisfied with your experience? The physical aspects of labor and delivery rooms and encounters with medical staff are a crucial component in addressing infant and maternal mortality. Studies analyzing women’s childbirth experiences and obstetric outcomes found that satisfaction with childbirth is considered the most important qualitative outcome in assessing childbirth experience, given that women’s satisfaction with this experience affects their health and their relationship with their infant.(15) Despite this research, the United States is a country with the shortest hospital stays and hardly any postpartum follow-up for mother, a very sensitive window for maternal mortality. While we appreciate the role our hospitals provide for moms-to-be, we also know that there is room to improve especially in areas of design, client comfortability, and even some medical practices.
City Planning directly effects the built environment around us. Pressing for incentives and policies to allow different kinds of real estate and infrastructure development is an elemental component of the profession. Creating housing programs specifically catering to the needs of at-risk pregnant women and mothers could really impact the way maternal and infant mortality is experienced in America."	<urn:uuid:f0a9ebe8-8ae2-4ba9-a24a-7f2eea4ca553>	0.0
How many electrical receptacles can you have on a regular 15-amp breaker when the voltage is 120 volts, and how is this number calculated?	"Troubleshooting and Repair of a Standard Electric Water
No Hot Water
""Replacing A Heating Element""
It may take several hours for a newly installed electric water
heater to reach normal operating temperature. If you don't have hot
water after two hours (water not even warm), first check to make
sure the water heater is getting electrical power. Not getting
power is a common reason new water heaters don't work.
Checking for Electrical Power
You can check for power with a simple ""circuit tester,"" but for
a more complete diagnosis of electrical problems, you'll need a
meter that measures voltage.
To check for power, turn the circuit breaker marked ""water
heater"" off (or remove fuses). Remove the water heater's upper
access panel. Carefully remove the insulation and plastic cover.
Identify the power supply wires. Usually, these connect to the top
two screws of the upper thermostat. Turn the circuit breaker back
on and check for voltage on the top two screws of the upper
The label on the water heater indicates what voltage the water
heater requires. Most residential units are 220/240 volts (but some
are 110/120 volts). Verify your water heater is getting the correct
voltage. If it is not getting the required voltage, there are
probably issues with your home's electrical system. A qualified
electrician may be needed to fix your electrical problem. Turn the
circuit breaker off, replace the plastic cover, insulation and
Testing Thermostat for Power with Voltmeter
If the unit is powered with the correct voltage, and still does
not produce any hot water, the upper heating element has probably
burned out. A water heater must be completely full of water before
electric power is applied or the upper heating element will burn
out (this is called Dry Fire). The Installation Instructions
require that a hot water faucet be opened and the hot water allowed
to run full for at least three minutes before turning the power on.
This is to make sure all of the air has been removed from the tank,
and the tank is completely full of water. If the upper element has
burned out, it can be replaced. Replacement heating elements are
inexpensive and widely available. After the heating element has
been replaced, make sure the tank is completely full of water
before turning the power back on."	<urn:uuid:9ae613e6-701d-4820-a50b-56cc8a7f9979>	0.0
mud kitchen outdoor learning setup requirements	"The table can be your kitchen and water table so that your picnic table is free for meals and card games.
- Hammock—I like those little packable hammocks. String it up and take a nap. If you’re extra adventurous, sleep in your hammock overnight (just be sure to make a plan on how to stay warm)!
- Fishing gear and mud bug traps—Toss in your mud bug traps as soon as you’re setup at camp and go fishing at dawn and dusk. Check your mud bug traps and have a crawfish feast for dinner!
- Easy-up—These are great if you are camping in a very sunny campsite or in the rain or snow. Bring one for your camp kitchen and one for your picnic table.
- Mobile propane heater—There are some really slick heaters on the market. If you are camping in the snow, or in a colder environment, bring a mobile heater. Be prepared though, those things chug propane super fast.
- Totes—I like to have all my gear organized and compartmentalized into totes. One tote for the kitchen, one tote for the tent, and one tote for the food. Staying organized will help things go smoothly.
- Collapsible sink/bowl—Bring two of these for your camp kitchen. They are designed to hold a lot of warm water and are perfect for cleaning dishes.
- Camp Shower – If you like to stay extra fresh and clean, here are some great camp shower ideas to include in your camping packing list.
- Games and toys—You are bound to have some downtime while camping. Bring some card games or other fun activities. For ideas, check out my things to do while camping list.
As you put your family camping packing list together, go over this list and consider your personal needs. There are some things that can be used as a substitute, so don’t panic if you feel like you need to go on a shopping spree to go camping.
Have fun with it. The more you camp, the more you’ll learn what you really need and what you can’t live without. For your first time, its a good idea to over pack a little.

What makes reinforced PTFE a better choice than molecularly enhanced PTFE (TFM) for valve seats in temperature-varying systems?	"However, with extreme amounts of stretching in either direction, the pore size of such membranes eventually increases as the mass of PTFE nodes is depleted. At this point the bulk material behaves more plastically and further stretching simply elongates the fibrils and increases the distance between nodes until macroscopic holes are produced.
PTFE dispersion grade resin is approximately 95% crystalline, and has a very high melt viscosity. When heated to temperatures above 327° C., the PTFE crystallites deform into an amorphous polymer. When cooled below 327° C., some of the liquid structure remains; thereby increasing the amorphous content of melted PTFE in comparison to virgin PTFE. Such heating and subsequent cooling of the polymer is called sintering. The sintering of shaped microporous PTFE structures produces a thermosetting effect upon the polymer, thus enabling shape retention and thermal stability. Microporous PTFE membranes are typically sintered by creating a high temperature zone in the final stages of the tenter frame apparatus.
In the prior art process of producing PTFE extrudate, difficulties arise in attempts to produce uniform extrudate having satisfactory molecular orientation to facilitate adequate transverse stretching. The molecular orientation of the extrudate ribbon is highly influenced by the Theological properties of the polymer formulation, the pressure applied to the system, and the design of the die. Various grades of PTFE resin provide distinct Theological conditions during extrusion due to different physical and molecular characteristics, therefore different grades of resin produce different degrees of molecular orientation even under the same extrusion conditions. PTFE extrusion systems are complex and difficult to control. Examples of these difficulties are found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,187,390.
In U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,125, there is disclosed a process of producing fibrillated IPNs of PTFE and polyorganosiloxanes. The IPNs are formed by either a sequential method or a simultaneous method. The simultaneous method involves the pre-blending of polysiloxane compositions with the organic lubricant used for extrusion. The siloxane/lubricant blend is then dispersed into the particulate PTFE resin, which is then extruded under similar conditions as those of the prior art."	<urn:uuid:a5a624ea-0508-4dfe-b5aa-7ee8e8df9c4d>	0.0

what capabilities does facial coding technology have for analyzing emotions in crowds during live events	"February 20, 2008
Thought-Controlled Gaming Headset Coming Soon
A new neuro-headset that reads the electrical impulses of brain neurons will be brought to market later this year. The new device will allow gamers virtual interaction via thoughts and emotions.
""It picks up electrical activity from the brain and sends wireless signals to a computer,"" Tan Le, president of Emotiv, told BBC News.
""It allows the user to manipulate a game or virtual environment naturally and intuitively,"" she said.
The company said the headset, called the Epoc, is capable of detecting over 30 unique expressions, emotions and actions. At a price of $299, the headset comes with a movement-detecting gyroscope and wireless capabilities to communicate with a computer.
The average brain is made up of over 100 billion neurons that send electrical impulse when interacting. The technology behind the Epoc is called non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG), allows these neural impulses brain's to be interpreted by the headset.
""Emotiv is a neuro-engineering company and we've created a brain computer interface that reads electrical impulses in the brain and translates them into commands that a video game can accept and control the game dynamically,"" Ms. Le explained.
Although headsets that interpret neural activity are not new, Ms. Le said the Epoc was the first consumer device that can be used for gaming applications.
""This is the first headset that doesn't require a large net of electrodes, or a technician to calibrate or operate it and does require gel on the scalp,"" she explained. ""It also doesn't cost tens of thousands of dollars.""
The medical use of Electroencephalography dates back to the early 20th century, but it's only been within the last thirty years the technology has been used to explore interfaces between the human brain and a computer.
The headset can interpret a wide variety of emotions, such as excitement, tension, meditation, and frustration. Facial expressions such as smiles, laughs, winks, raised eyebrows as seen in shock, furrowed brows in anger along with cognitive actions such as push, pull, lift, drop and rotate (on six different axis) are also interpreted by the Epoc.
For gaming applications, the Epoc can be used to give authentic facial expressions to game avatars. For example, if a gamer smiles, the headset will translate that expression to the avatar seen in the game."	<urn:uuid:c0445fd7-acbf-48c1-8e5b-bb795059afbb>	0.0

why are gamma waves dangerous	"The Basics of Brain Waves
""...this dynamic system is the self in each of us.""
W.J. Freeman in How Brains Make Up Their Minds
Brain waves are generated by the building blocks of your brain -- the individual cells called neurons. Neurons communicate with each other by electrical changes.We can actually see these electrical changes in the form of brain waves as shown in an EEG (electroencephalogram).
Brain waves are measured in cycles per second (Hertz; Hz is the short form). We also talk about the ""frequency"" of brain wave activity.
The lower the number of Hz, the slower the brain activity or the slower the frequency of the activity.
Researchers in the 1930's and 40's identified several different types of brain waves. Traditionally, these fall into 4 types:
- Delta waves (below 4 hz) occur during sleep
- Theta waves (4-7 hz) are associated with sleep, deep relaxation (like hypnotic relaxation), and visualization
- Alpha waves (8-13 hz) occur when we are relaxed and calm
- Beta waves (13-38 hz) occur when we are actively thinking, problem-solving, etc.
Since these original studies, other types of brainwaves have been identified and the traditional 4 have been subdivided.
Some interesting brainwave additions:
- The Sensory motor rhythm (or SMR; around 14 hz) was originally discovered to prevent seizure activity in cats. SMR activity seems to link brain and body functions.
- Gamma brain waves (39-100 hz) are involved in higher mental activity and consolidation of information. An interesting study has shown that advanced Tibetan meditators produce higher levels of gamma than non-meditators both before and during meditation.
Are you wondering what kind of brain waves you produce?
People tend to talk as if they were producing one type of brain wave (e.g., producing ""alpha"" for meditating).
But these aren't really ""separate"" brain waves - the categories are just for convenience.
They help describe the changes we see in brain activity during different kinds of activities.
So we don't ever produce only ""one"" brain wave type.
Our overall brain activity is a mix of all the frequencies at the same time, some in greater quantities and strength than others.
The meaning of all this? Balance is the key. We don't want to regularly produce too much or too little of any brainwave frequency."	<urn:uuid:d39de297-9931-4bc0-9d34-d2623361dccd>	0.0
I've heard people talk about the difference between APIs and web services - could you explain how these two things are different from each other?	"Plus, when we're finally reunited, things get steamy. More importantly, though, this little game allows us to keep our own sense of independence, which is crucial for us to staying happy with ourselves.
5. Don't Answer To Anyone But Each Other
A therapist I once worked with told me that worrying a lot about what other people think can be very destructive to a relationship. She suggested my boyfriend and I forget about what the people around us want for us, and instead jot down what we want from each other and from our lives.
Now, when we feel pressure from the outside to get married or have kids or a certain type of job, we come back to these promises and remind each other that we're the only ones we have to answer to at the end of the day.
6. Cool Down Before You Sit Down For A Serious Talk
Nine times out of ten, when something nearly unforgivable is said, it's done out of hot and heavy anger. To avoid spouting the worst possible things at one another, someone once told me to walk away when I'm mad and only come back after I've calmed down. When put into practice, it works wonders. Getting all the strong emotions out of the way before we talk helps us move through the conversation quicker than we would if we came to the table boiling with anger.
7. Never Put Each Other Down In Public
Although there's nothing wrong with innocent teasing every now and then, it's a different beast entirely to embarrass each other when you're in social settings. You should be each other's biggest fans, not one another's enemies. Even if you're not having the best day together, my mom taught me that the worst thing you can do is treat each other like crap in public. Not only does it make everyone else feel uncomfortable as hell, it makes things way, way worse between the two of you.
8. Don't Take Things So Seriously
If there's no laughter, there's no life to the relationship. I doubt there are very many happy, longterm couples out there who don't joke around with each other often and keep things light. I've heard from multiple people that laughing is the key to any healthy romantic relationship, and science agrees. Studies have shown that couples who laugh together more often are happier and more likely to stay together for a long, long time."	<urn:uuid:89e1971e-33d9-4498-a44e-92f7770dede8>	0.0

When it comes to cutting gaskets there are several ways to get the job done. Traditional ""clicker presses"" are great for larger quantity jobs and have been the standard in the industry for years. The biggest down side to using clicker presses is tooling must be made to produce a gasket. Just as CNC lathes revolutionized the machining industry, laser cutters, routers and water jet are all computer controled ways of cutting a gasket with out the need for tooling or dies.

HUR SmartTouch - Rehabilitation, testing and analysis
Explore HUR SmartTouch - the brand new computerised exercise solution for active ageing, rehabilitation, inclusive wheelchair exercise, and wellness. With premium exercise equipment and a modern online software.
HUR GYM – HOME-BASED ALTERNATIVE EXERCISES
As the COVID-19 pandemia spreads around the world most exercise facilities have shut their doors. While social isolation and staying at home is recommended, we wish to strongly encourage everyone to exercise. While the benefits of the progressive resistance provided by HUR equipment cannot be fully replaced, it is still important to keep active with some home-based exercises to maintain most of the strength gains you have made.
HUR Australia teamed up with My Active Attitude to create some home-based exercises that can be easily and safely done at home. You will find some useful tips, exercise samples and videos on how to stay fit. When exercising at home, remember that the same safety precautions apply as at the gym – listen to your body, remember to breathe, do not rush your exercise.
Download this handy guide for your home based exercise routine. In this document you will find warm-up, strength and balance exercises you can do to engage the same muscle groups as when using HUR gym equipment.
Leg Strength Exercise
Leg muscles are often called the “muscles of life”. Your leg muscles are some of the biggest muscles in our body and their strength is a key to function such as getting up and walking, but also to your metabolism. We recommend doing some leg muscles every day.
Balance ability is a key component as we get older. With these simple exercises you can practice different aspects of your balance. Remember that you can do the exercises next to a chair or a table for support.
Upper Body exercise
Exercising your upper body will keep up your muscle tone, but also help to keep up a good posture.

how scientists track monitor bee movement behavior research methods	"The field of behavior change suffers from significant fragmentation and poor reporting. Here, we describe two large-scale initiatives — the Human Behavior Change Project and Science of Behavior Change program — that aim to introduce complementary systematic and rigorous methods to advance the science of behavior change.
The burden of disability-adjusted life years, prevalence of chronic health conditions and existence of other global challenges such as pollution are common, costly and often preventable . Behaviors are critical targets of intervention to improve physical and mental well-being, longevity and the environment. However, the science behind, and findings of, behavior change interventions are frequently fragmented and inconsistently reported, and interventions are often unsuccessful in initiating and/or sustaining behavior change. As a result of fragmentation and poor reporting, much research wastes opportunities to build forward momentum, limiting opportunities to harness and synthesize findings to systematically improve behavior change interventions, and the science informing them. Here, we describe two recent initiatives on behavior change — one from the United Kingdom and one from the United States — that were developed specifically, albeit independently, to tackle these problems. Although by no means the only international behavior change initiatives, we highlight them here because they both aim to advance behavior change science through an emphasis on common, systematic and rigorous methods, and they take different, but complementary, approaches in this pursuit. We believe that uniting these and other initiatives will cultivate a more cumulative science of behavior change that can inform policy, practice and scientific progress. The UK initiative Funded by the Welcome Trust and led by researchers at University College London, the universities of Aberdeen and Cambridge, and IBM Dublin, the Human Behavior Change Project (HBCP) is a collaboration of behavioral scientists, computer scientists and system architects (www.humanbehaviourchange.org). HBCP is developing a method and user interface to enable policymakers, practitioners and researchers to answer variants of the ‘big question’ in behavioral science: What behavior change interventions work, compared with what, for what behaviors, how well, for how long, for whom, in what setting and why? HBCP researchers are harnessing advances in behavioral and information science to build a behavior change intervention ontology (BCIO) and interactive knowledge system to organize the existing and accelerating evidence about behavior change interventions. The BCIO aims to establish a controlled vocabulary and connections between behavior change techniques and behavioral outcomes via underlying mechanisms of action, while taking into consideration moderation by intervention exposure (reach and engagement) and context (population and setting)."	<urn:uuid:88e61c26-60ec-46ba-be50-bd3521d4b95d>	0.0
I've heard that dogs evolved from wolves, but I'm curious about how such aggressive animals became so friendly towards humans. Do scientists know how this transformation happened?	"Wolves are pack animals and want to snuggle when they sleep, especially the pups. In the wild, the pups would sleep in a pile on top of each other, so it's only natural that the babies would pile onto humans when brought into captivity. People keep these animals like dogs, but they are in no way dogs. They are wild animals and will eventually act as such.
As with the tigers, the wolves become hunters around the time of puberty. This time frame happens much faster than humans; it only takes wolves a year to become mature. Like the tigers, the wolves need a wide hunting range to keep themselves psychologically satisfied. When humans keep these animals in pens or, worse, in a house, it's only a matter of time before they will suffer a psychotic break and attack someone. When tigers and wolves are kept indoors, it's not a question of if they will attack, it's a question of when.
Monkeys make the list because there are simply too many stories of primate attacks. People adopt these animals due to their likeness to humans and their ability to interact with us, often on a higher level than domesticated animals. However, chimps, macaques and other primates of this genre are just a bad idea to keep as a pet.
These animals can be very loving and a part of the family for decades before attacking someone. This is why the attack is often a heartbreaking surprise. The animals don't always attack their loved ones; they might attack someone else, but they will eventually attack. The reasons for their aggression varies by the animal's class or breed, but many scientists believe the aggression comes from illnesses commonly caught by monkeys. The monkeys can't tell the humans they are hurting so they get aggravated and driven to lash out. Unfortunately, they don't realize their own strength and must often be killed to be stopped.
WARNING: VIDEO MAY BE GRAPHIC WATCH AT YOUR OWN RISK
Yes, bears. People keep bears as pets because they're exotic and exciting. They are sweet as babies and their fur actually stays soft as they get older. They are attractive because they are outside of the box, furry and soft to the touch.
They are also far more dangerous than many other animals on this list. Bears, like the wolves and tigers, need a wide berth for their hunting grounds."	<urn:uuid:f5e51f58-b0fa-421b-9575-ac9af617e242>	0.0

naval tactics boarding grappling vs speed agility massilia jutland differences	"Background Concussions can lead to cognitive or neuromotor impairments which may influence skill performance. No published research has investigated the effect of previous concussions on sport-specific skill performance. Skill performance may be an important component of injury prevention strategy development in youth ice hockey.
Objective To investigate the effect of previous concussion or injury on sport-specific skill performance in elite youth ice hockey.
Design Cross Sectional pilot study.
Setting Winsport arena in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
Participants: A sample of ten teams (n=131, 84 males and 47 females, ages 13-17) representing the most elite 20% of players by division of play (“AA, AAA”).
Risk factor assessment Players completed a preseason baseline questionnaire including history of previous concussion and/or injury in the past year.
Main outcome measurements On-ice skills testing was based on the Hockey Canada Skills Test (HCST) battery which included forward agility weave, forward and backward speed skate, forward to backward transition agility, and a 6-repeat endurance test.
Results Comparing players with a history of concussion and those without, there were no differences in HCST component scores. There were also no differences in HCST scores between those reporting a previous injury within 1 year and those without. Males were faster than females on all HCST timed skill components, except for forward agility weave without the puck. Midget players were faster than Bantam players for transition agility with and without the puck, forward speed with the puck, and backward speed with and without the puck.
Conclusion There were no apparent associations between history of concussion and/or injury and sport-specific skill performance. Our results provide reference values for HCST component scores that can allow assessment of risk and provide a foundation for prevention studies.

How much did it cost to send a letter before 1840?	"This article needs additional citations for verification. (April 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
Philately (//; fi-LAT-ə-lee) is the study of postage stamps and postal history. It also refers to the collection, appreciation and research activities on stamps and other philatelic products. Philately involves more than just stamp collecting or the study of postage; it is possible to be a philatelist without owning any stamps. For instance, the stamps being studied may be very rare or reside only in museums.
The word ""philately"" is the English transliteration of the French ""philatélie"", coined by Georges Herpin in 1864. Herpin stated that stamps had been collected and studied for the previous six or seven years and a better name was required for the new hobby than timbromanie (roughly ""stamp quest""), which was disliked. The alternative terms ""timbromania"", ""timbrophily"" and ""timbrology"" gradually fell out of use as philately gained acceptance during the 1860s. He took the Greek root word φιλ(ο)- phil(o)-, meaning ""an attraction or affinity for something"", and ἀτέλεια ateleia, meaning ""exempt from duties and taxes"" to form ""philatelie"".
As a collection field, philately appeared after the introduction of the postage stamps in 1840, but did not gain large attraction until the mid-1850s. Some authors believe that the first philatelist appeared on the day of the release of the world's first postage stamp, dated to May 6, 1840, when the Liverson, Denby and Lavie London law office sent a letter to Scotland franked with ten uncut Penny Blacks, stamped with the postmark “LS.6MY6. 1840."" In 1992 at an auction in Zurich, this envelope was sold for 690 thousand francs.
Already in 1846, cases of collecting stamps in large numbers were known in England. However, without reason for collection, stamps at this time were used for pasting wallpaper. The first philatelist is considered to be a postmaster going by Mansen, who lived in Paris, and in 1855 had sold his collection, which contained almost all the postage stamps issued by that time."	<urn:uuid:291b9906-b7b8-411b-a0cf-a1c49090b788>	0.0
muslim marriage contract hibah document rules difference	"In addition therewith if Divorce is given by husband, then also she is entitled to claim her Dower money, maintenance till Iddat period and any amount or gift given to her either through Marriage Contract or by any other means.
2. JUSTIFICATION UNDER PAKISTANI LAW APPLICABLE TO EVERY MUSLIM PAKSITANI CITIZEN WHETHER LIVING ABROAD OR IN PAKISTAN:
a.UNDER MUSLIM FAMILY LAW ORDINANCE 1961:
The Exception laid down in Section 10 of West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 also lays down that wife has to forgo her right of dower if not taken by her but in case she has already taken that Dower amount from her husband she is required in case of Khula to return the same. The relevant Exception of Said Section is reproduced for the convenience of this Hon’ble Court as follows: “Provided that notwithstanding any decision or judgment of any court or tribunal, the family court in a suit for dissolution of Marriage, if reconciliation fails, shall pass decree for dissolution of marriage forthwith and also restore the husband the Haq Mehr received by the wife in consideration of Marriage at the time of marriage”
b. UNDER DISSOLUTION OF MUSLIM MARRIAGE ACT, 1939 APPLICABLE WITHIN THE TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF PAKISTAN:
However under Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act 1939, if the wife seeks divorce on certain grounds specified in its Section 2, from a Pakistani Court, then under Section 5 of the said Act, on confirmation of such grounds she will be only entitled to get her Dower money and nothing extra.
While the relevant section 5 is reproduced as under: “Nothing contained in this Act shall affect any right which a married woman may have under Muslim law to her dower or any part thereof on the dissolution of her marriage.”
Keeping in view the above contentions, we are of the view that a Pakistani Muslim can be divorced in accordance with the laws as mentioned above and not in accordance with the laws prevalent in UK.
UNDER THE CHRISTIAN LAWS
Divorce Act, 1869 is relating to the divorce of persons professing the Christian religion, and to confer upon certain Court jurisdiction in matters matrimonial."	<urn:uuid:2ff8468a-2afd-48ad-b4ae-cc9d9cda22a8>	0.0

What tools are used in Yoruba divination and what does Ogun use iron for?	"All these were put together, dissected and processed by our hard working rapporteurs headed by a respected Professor from Harvard who used the combinations of computers, words processor and other forms of modern communication gadgets to give us and acceptable resolution, declaration and communique which was dutifully placed before the general Assembly of Yoruba people by me in form of a motion and seconded by Chief Kehinde Sofola SAN and adopted by the General Assembly without any dissent.
Of course, the outsiders who still don’t understand the strength of unity of the Yoruba world wide tried unsuccessfully to play the religious card to cause division a day before the summit.
They posted on the internet that the gathering was that of Christians. We laughed them off when our attention was drawn to the publication.
Firstly, Chief Sofola SAN the leader of Yoruba council of Elders is a Moslem, and he is a prime mover of the summit. Governors Aregbesola, Ajimobi and Amosu , strong supporters of restructuring are devout Muslims, Alhaji Wale Osun the leader of Afenifere Renewal Group ARG another mover of the summit is a Muslim leader from Ogun State and so also is one of our resource persons at the summit, Alhaji Taofeeq Akinwale ,a highly cerebral Muslim cleric and SA to the Governor of Oyo on Muslim Pilgrimage.
They also tried playing the political card by saying that it was going to be the gathering of PDP but we quickly reminded the proponents of the satanic view that most members of ARG are APC members, The VP who was represented is APC, five of the six South West Governors are APC, most of the members of the State and National Assemblies going to be present are APC, most of the Professionals, Clergies, Academics and students’ bodies going to be present are a political.
I had gone this far to show the likes of Pa Yakasai that the train of Restructuring is taking off in the Southwest with all the gatekeepers and crtical stakeholders in Yorubaland on board. Any one left out in Yoruba land will have himself/herself to blame.
I know the Yakasai of this world are still wondering why and how such huge and unprecedented crowd could have gathered in Yoruba land for the purpose of taking a common stand by a supposedly divided ethnic nationality."	<urn:uuid:c1954761-9e0e-4c5f-b772-13ed58cd96af>	0.0
As a mechanical engineer, how can I show moving parts?	"CRP Technology, a leading company in the creation of prototypes and final applications in professional 3D printing, launches Windform P2 material.
Windform P2 is a glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic polyamide material with excellent mechanical properties for the High Speed Sintering (HSS) process.
Engineer Franco Cevolini, CRP Technology CTO and VP, states: “Windform P2 is the second polymer from P-LINE, the new Windform range of materials for high speed production-grade 3D printing, introduced on the market less than a year ago. ”
Compared to Windform P1, Windform P2 is distinguished by increased stiffness (Windform P2 Tensile Modulus is 2925.20 MPa ; Windform P1 is 1960.60 MPa), combined to high tensile strength (39.24 MPa, Windform P2).
Engineer Franco Cevolini adds, “Most of the reinforced materials for similar technologies currently on the market show a decrease in the tensile strength property. My staff and I have been able to preserve the high tensile strength in Windform P2.”
As Windform P2 is glass fiber filled, it is an insulating material (CTI rating of 600). Windform P2 is also suitable for manufacturing components with detailed resolution.
Windform P2 is suitable for production of small functional prototypes, end-use parts requiring high stiffness across a variety of sectors, e.g.: Electrical (enclosures and housing for electronics), Consumer and household goods, Industrial products (furniture parts, presentation models, fixtures and tooling), Automotive (rigid parts for interior design)"	<urn:uuid:de135e77-b9e2-46be-a32d-2048a93ced71>	0.0
As an event organizer working with accessibility initiatives, I'm curious about the features and design considerations of RAC Arena's new Quiet Room for people with sensory sensitivities. Can you describe its purpose and amenities?	"Located on a triangular site wedged between the existing church steeple and the education building, the building form that rises from three-stories below grade is carefully chiseled to fit within its urban context. The architecture of the new building is contextually contemporary with finely detailed brick façade punched with glazed openings, cast stone and steel, and comfortably fits in with the existing church steeple, the education building and other nearby development. The building steps back on the upper floors to create a gradual transition between the single-family residential neighborhood on the north and the commercial development abutting other sides of the property. The interior of the building is filled with natural light, which is achieved by strategically sized and placed windows. The attractive elements of the building’s design and the streetscape improvements complement and enhance nearby revitalization and redevelopment initiatives.
It is extremely rare that sustainability and affordability go together. At vPoint, sustainability was an integral part of the project design process. Located at the heart of Arlington—a transit oriented development (TOD), yards away from the metro station, bus lines and various other amenities, the project is imbued with green amenities like hi-performance mechanical systems, high-performance windows, energy efficient/water saving appliances, energy efficient lighting, reflective roof, electric car charging stations and green power. These are just a few examples of how this development pushes the green envelope. The most sustainable quality is the diversity of use on site from church to day care, office to education, along with affordable and market rate units.
In addition to the green features mentioned above, vPoint is abound with amenities like designer kitchens, stainless steel appliances, in-unit washing machines, high-end fixtures, wood flooring, a resident’s lounge and business center, an outdoor space that includes grill and lounge seating, and a conference room that can transform into a mini-event space. The existing onsite amenities like the church and day care center adds to the appeal.
The project recently earned the LEED Gold Certification. It also won the Urban Land Institute Smart Growth Award, and the 2012 Washington Building Congress Craftsmanship award.
With minimal amenities and less than inspiring design of their buildings, affordable housing has never been fully integrated with their neighbors, and this has been the status quo for decades. vPoint is clearly a game changer for affordable housing that co-exists with market rate units and other civic uses, offering features, location and amenities that used to be the exclusive domain of high-end condos."	<urn:uuid:b0ec931b-be8c-4e51-a080-6f7476cd0ee1>	0.0

How can I make sure I'm getting accurate and reliable results when measuring application launch times on my computer?	"Hiding out in my clinic is an extraordinary health screening tool. I just got it back from being totally upgraded.
Computer regulation thermography (CRT) is a tool used to get a functional picture of all the organ systems in the body. Testing is performed by measuring many different points on the skin which correspond to specific internal organs and tissues through viscerocutaneous reflexes. Thermography has been used in Europe for more that 20 years, and has recently been computerized to make interpretation easier and more accurate.
How does CRT work?
The autonomic nervous system, which controls automatic body functions, determines circulation to internal organs as well as the skin. It does this by altering the amount of dilation and constriction in blood vessels. Environmental temperature impacts the autonomic nervous system and, therefore, affects blood flow. By measuring the temperature of many different points on the skin before and after a cold stimulus, we can monitor changes in circulation. The actual temperature, as well as how it changes in response to the cold stimulus, provides information about the function of organs and tissues that correspond to the points being measured.
What will the thermography test be like?
After adapting to room temperature, the first set of measurements is taken. A ten-minute cooling phase follows before measuring the points a second time. After the results are interpreted, they will be explained during a follow-up appointment. Treatment will be based on the test's results, the patient's specific situation, and the doctor's assessment.
Why is CRT important for you?
Regulation thermography is effective in the early detection of many physical imbalances and diseases. Often times symptoms are affected by areas of the body that may not at first seem directly related. Thermography can help determine what additional lab work; if any; may be needed to determine the source of ill health; and can help avoid many unnecessary, expensive lab tests.
What can be determined by CRT?
CRT can discover possible sources of chronic disease and infections. Breast, ovarian, and prostate health can also be assessed. Possible cardiovascular, stomach, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder problems can be detected using the CRT. Unknown causes of infection and inflammation, allergic or toxic reactions to food, the presence of intestinal mycosis or dysbiosis, and possible correlations between dental health and disease can all be determined using CRT. Your overall vitality can be estimated by CRT.
How much will CRT cost?"	<urn:uuid:7a1ab9b8-db85-4654-9254-924f8b345039>	0.0
I want to visit Cairo for a few days and I'm curious about both its historical importance and what modern tourist attractions I can see during a short stay. What's the city's historical significance, and what main sights can I explore if I only have a couple of days there?	"Moscow is a whole new city in the summer, from the beginning of June onwards the temperatures rise into the low thirties. Many locals will tend to take this chance to get out of the city either vacationing or spending weekends at their dacha, which is a second or seasonal home.
A lot of theatres tend to close for the season or will go on tour although there are shows prepared for the tourist season.
The summer months are a great chance to visit the Golden Ring and other attractions surrounding Moscow. If you do go exploring in the countryside, make sure to bring insect repellent!
What should I do?
As Summer tends to be a little more tourist focused in the city it's a great chance to see the arena surrounding Moscow, such as the Golden Ring which is one of Russia's most beautiful interesting areas.
With the flowers in full bloom, it's a great time to visit Moscow's many beautiful parks and gardens such as the Hermitage Garden and Sokolniki Park.
Best Summer Excursions:
3 day Golden Ring Tour
The Golden Ring tour will show you round the historical Golden Ring, Vladimir, Suzdal, Yaroslavl, Orstov, Veliky and Sergiev Posad. It is a chance to visit and explore a variety of UNESCO heritage sights, learn about many historical Russian towns, and you can visit the largest Orthodox monastery in Russia.
You'll feel like you're in a fairy tale with its intricate stately architecture, beautiful coloured onion domes and breath-taking natural scenery.
Relaxing River Cruise on Radisson Boat
Take the chance to cool down and relax taking a beautiful sightseeing tour along the serene Moskva river aboard the luxurious double decker Radisson river boat. From the view of the floating bridge of the park Zaryadie to the scenic landscape of the Sparrow Hills, you'll miss nothing on this spectacular cruise.

As a chemistry researcher studying both dental health and ionic compounds, I'm curious about fluoride's dual nature - how does it function in dental treatments, and what chemical properties make it dangerous in high doses?	"What cosmetic dentistry procedures will give me the best-looking smile?
At The Dental Studio in Flower Mound, Texas, Dr. Yasi Sabour is approached by her patients regularly about the smile makeover process. Individuals with imperfections of the smile or extensive tooth loss or damage may want to talk to a professional about how they can restore the smile for proper function and health. In situations like this, Dr. Sabour may consult with patients about the advantages of cosmetic dentistry and how the smile can be improved.
What is cosmetic dentistry?
Cosmetic dentistry refers to any dental treatments used to enhance the smile, and they may be used in helping patients achieve a full smile makeover. A smile makeover may be referred to as “full mouth rehabilitation” or “full smile restoration.” Regardless of the name, the goal is the same: repair the smile’s appearance, function, and overall health. This customized plan is designed to get you the best-looking smile with high-quality cosmetic and restorative dentistry treatments to help you smile again with confidence!
What cosmetic treatments might be included in a patient’s smile makeover?
Because Dr. Sabour customizes cosmetic dentistry solutions to a patient’s unique needs, no two smile makeover plans are the same. However, here are a few of the more commonly integrated procedures that can be part of one’s course of treatment:
- Professional teeth whitening. For some patients, teeth whitening is the first step and can often effectively address a dull or discolored smile. We offer professional-strength options that provide better results than kits available over the counter.
- Dental crowns. Crowns are caps made of porcelain that are fabricated for the patient to match their existing teeth. This allows the crown to be placed over a tooth to protect and seal it while blending in with the smile.
- Dental composite. Certain imperfections can be addressed quickly and easily in the office with dental composite, a unique resin material that can repair chipped, cracked, or gapped teeth (for mild imperfections with not bite issues involved).
- Porcelain veneers. Another way to cover imperfect teeth is with porcelain veneers, which are thin porcelain dental prostheses made from a strong and durable material that looks just like natural tooth enamel. These restorations are often used on the teeth near the front of the smile, referred to as the “anterior teeth.”

maximum indemnity period insurance importance business survival rates disasters	"Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII) is important for contractor/individuals who are engaged in some form of professional service or provide professional advice to their clients. Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII) is necessary as it protects a contractor/ individuals from the risk of getting into a dispute or being challenged by AN unsatisfied client. Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII) will provide a contractor/individual with professional representation, and pay for indemnity in case a client effectively sues for mistakes made as a contractor. These mistakes could be in the form of:
If an individual opts to start working as a contractor, there might be chances that he / she is obliged to take some kind of business insurance. Usually, clients expect third party contractors to have necessary professional insurances and be covered for business legal responsibility and professional indemnity. Most umbrella companies in the UK make available blanket insurance cover for their employees, however, in case of a limited company contractor, the responsibility for taking the correct insurance policy is on the contractor.
As per the requirements of industry bodies' regulatory, numerous business sectors need PII. These business sectors could include, but not limited to, accountancy, surveying, engineering etc. Professional CONTRACTOR/individuals (such as business consultants, management consultants, and IT contractors) who opt to work on a contractual basis without doubt will need contractor professional indemnity insurance in order to be awarded a contract. Even if an individual is not officially obliged to have PII, without having it could cost thousands of pounds in reimbursement and additional legal charges to defend a claim. Irrespective of the size of a business, with no PII cover the financial position of an individual could be left susceptible if a claim is raised against them. Even though all professionals strive to provide exception service, there are possibilities of making a mistake; knowing that an adequate insurance is in place will give a professional peace of mind and keep the organisation covered for risk.
If an individual/contractor provide design, advice, or an addition professional service to a client, it is imperative to have PII. Professionals contractor that may need professional indemnity insurance cover encompass consultants, designers, IT professionals, dance teachers, fitness professionals, school professors and private tutors, and recruitment professionals.
Whether an individual is a self-employed IT consultant or operates through a small consultancy firm, it is he /she who will be accountable for counselling clients on how to improve their systems."	<urn:uuid:c45cf7a8-4675-4498-91ba-ef27715c3a9f>	0.0
How did black and white minstrel shows differ in blues clubs versus traditional venues?	"You need to be able to trust and be grateful for your process, otherwise you’ll never achieve “success” or when you do, you won’t be able to actually enjoy it.
Do you have any events or exhibitions coming up? Where would one go to see more of your work? How can people support you and your artwork?
The best way to support me directly though is to buy my album and merch on my Bandcamp, or come out and see a show! I play locally often and have been touring — sometimes in venues like House of Blues and other times on the Pacific Beach boardwalk!

what makes humor difficult translate between languages context importance	"Facts are Available Instantaneously, Everywhere
People can already look up information on Wikipedia from their smart phones; this has already changed the way people argue. Future technology will search information automatically on a device that is already monitoring the conversation or what you are reading (think smart glasses). The implication is that the memorization of facts will be much less valuable. Knowing where to get it, and how to validate it will be more important. That means teaching history must be focused on WHY and not what events occurred. Life is turning into an open book test, or more accurately open Internet access. This transformation is similar to the advent of the written language which eliminated the need for elders to orally pass information to others.
2. Science is Multi-Disciplinary
I applaud the effort to teach subjects in multi-disciplinary ways. This makes the content relevant. Science is often taught in a cold, isolated manner that is difficult to connect with the real world. We need to transform teaching science from word search (looking up specific facts in book) into active synthesis and idea generation. Hopefully, they'll also include computer science as part of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) or at a minimum, allowing computer science to fulfill the language requirement, since this is relevant to all fields in the future.
3. Babel Towers are Crashing
This is where I feel the proposed academy is short-sighted. Teaching ""world"" languages is a great pre-21st century skill. English is THE world language today. It’s not like Thomas Jefferson needing to learn other languages because everything important was written in non-English languages. Being able to read other written languages is a challenge already solved for free by Google Translate, Microsoft Translate, and many other providers. No one can learn all the languages these online services offer instantaneously. Writing in other languages is also becoming a commodity. Speaking remains a challenge, but it is a matter of when, not if, this is solved. We can then be trained and speak in all sorts of languages one phrase at a time. There's no need to waste thousands of dollars and hours to train a child to perform worse than what a free device will provide for a dozen languages before they graduate from college.
On a related note, requiring all high school students to devote 3 years to learning another language is a huge waste. People say it's important to learn other cultures."	<urn:uuid:00ba9bc8-f8a2-4a95-b8a3-ae1097303e14>	0.0

how virtual switches handle data plane without specialized hardware	"Command Line Interface (CLI) is Cumbersome: If you’ve been following the Federal Insights Tech Corner, then you may have read through the most recent Tech Corner post on how the CLI is dead. The piece explains why using CLI and point management tools are inefficient and operationally cumbersome. I’m not going to belabor the fact that this is correct, but want to present the current widespread use of CLI as another operational challenge agencies face.
Do any of these three challenges sound familiar? They do to me, painfully so. What I’ve been lacking in my career are really good tools that help mitigate the challenges of finding and fixing difficult network issues, like the examples above. Also, I need a way around the CLI, it’s just not an efficient means of looking at many network elements at one time.
So, now let’s look at options to simplify your life as an operator, enhance the customer experience and reduce mean time to resolution…all ultimately caused by a lack of network visibility.
A New and Improved Toolbag
The Brocade SLX Insight Architecture offers a resolution to these three challenges by providing the visibility necessary to quickly and accurately address the real issues on the network. This solution delivers unparalleled real-time visibility into network traffic with no impact to performance or reliability of the network data plane or control plane. How? As a platform within a platform with a 230 Tbps fabric capacity routing and switching platform, it can handle basic connectivity requirements for 10, 40 and 100 Gbps Ethernet.
However, the hardware is not the cool part (although our hardware developers would certainly disagree).
What makes the SLX platform stand out is its Insight Architecture. Experts who have run a network or two built the architecture from the ground up with DevOps-style automation in mind (think NETCONF, OpenFlow, REST).
Inside the system reside two virtual machines running on KVM hypervisors. The first one, the System Virtual Machine, is for the system and only accessible from the CLI. The second virtual machine, the Guest Virtual Machine (Guest VM) is for the network operator. The system comes with pre-installed tools on the Guest VM, including Wireshark, Google Chrome and TCPDump (for you security types reading, yes, they are disabled by default).
Here’s what this means in action: Remember the previously mentioned outage in North Dakota? You can go ahead and cancel your flight as built-in tools enable remote troubleshooting."	<urn:uuid:2394aabe-b86c-49d6-b977-30086a63cb56>	0.0
When it comes to ensuring safe driving, how do the recommended precautions differ between elderly drivers and teenage drivers?	"You share the road with motorcyclists in Cleveland every day when you are driving in your car. If you are thinking about parking your car to ride your motorcycle to experience a bit of freedom and excitement, you may want to brush up on some safety tips first.
Motorcycles may be a cool alternative to regular automobiles, but they are not as safe. For instance, they do not offer as much protection as most motor vehicles, and the stakes are much higher in accidents. Besides the risk of falls, motorcyclists are in danger of sustaining serious and life-threatening injuries in motorcycle accidents. You should always wear proper safety gear and follow all traffic laws and courtesies. Here are a few hazards that motorcyclists encounter every day on the roads that you should keep watch for:
1. Inexperienced motorists
New drivers mean more driving errors. Because such drivers lack proper experience behind the wheel, they are likely to make crucial mistakes that make the roads more dangerous for others, especially bikers. Common errors that inexperienced motorists make that cause motorcycle accidents include failing to yield the right of way, not checking for motorcyclists when driving, changing lanes, making left-hand turns and traveling too closely behind motorcycles.
2. Distracted and drunk/intoxicated drivers
Defensive driving is a must, especially when you are on a motorcycle. Distracted and intoxicated drivers are a danger to everyone, not just bikers. People who drink, use drugs and medications that cause impairment, text and other activities that impact driving behaviors often fail to identify potential hazards. This often results in them operating their vehicles recklessly, making it harder for bikers and motorists to safely anticipate and avoid dangers and situations that lead to avoidable accidents.
3. Commercial vehicles
Bikers must pay extra attention when sharing the roads with commercial truck operators. Semis, trailers and other large trucks have blind spots that cars and SUVs do not have that make them extremely dangerous to motorcyclists. Keep in mind that if you are on your motorcycle around commercial trucks, drivers may not be able to see you.
With proper precautions and sufficient distance between your bike and other vehicles, it is possible for you to steer clear of the above dangers and remain accident- and injury-free."	<urn:uuid:f0c0907a-d619-4d6c-8a57-8128faa3a24e>	0.0
Who sang lead vocals on Big Brother's album Be A Brother?	"Bunny Wailer was a giant of reggae music who co-founded the Wailers along with Bob Marley (1945–1981) and Peter Tosh (1944–1987).
- Died: March 2, 2021 (Who else died on March 2?)
- Details of death: Died of complications of a stroke at a hospital in Kingston, Jamaica at the age of 73.
- We invite you to share condolences for Bunny Wailer in our Guest Book.
Wailer was born Neville Livingston, and he became close to Marley at a young age as they grew up together in Kingston. They began playing music with Tosh and formed the Wailers in 1963, adding other members later in the year. Playing ska music in the pre-reggae days, the Wailers had early hits including 1964’s “Simmer Down.” Wailer tended to sing harmonies to Marley’s and Tosh’s lead vocals, though he wrote and sang lead on songs including “Dreamland.” The Wailers played a central role in popularizing ska and, later, reggae to an international audience, with later hits including “Stir it Up,” “Get Up, Stand Up, and “I Shot the Sheriff.” But as their fame grew, Marley was placed more in the forefront of the group. Their management placed Wailer and Tosh in the background – and booked a U.S. tour of rock clubs that felt problematic to Wailer’s and Tosh’s Rastafarian values. The two left the Wailers in 1974.
Wailer released his solo debut, “Blackheart Man,” in 1976. Marley and Tosh both contributed backing vocals and played on the record, as Wailer sang backup on Tosh’s “Legalize It” that same year. As his solo career developed, Wailer branched out into other styles including dancehall and disco over the course of more than two dozen albums. He won three Grammy Awards for Best Reggae Album in the 1990s, and he was honored with Jamaica’s Order of Jamaica in 2012 and Order of Merit in 2017.

What are the essential tools needed for basic electronic construction, and how should you properly maintain the soldering iron tip during use?	"Stained Glass Soldering Temperature
Stained glass soldering temperature is something I get asked about a LOT. Here are answers to common questions.
Stained Glass Soldering Temperature Questions
Temperatures For The Hakko FX-601
The temperature you need for soldering a bead with the Hakko FX-601 is normally between 360C and 410C (680-770F).
I say ‘normally‘ as it depends on a couple of factors including tip size, solder type and how quickly you move the iron along the seam. Those who are quicker have their stained glass soldering temperature set at 410C but if you solder more slowly you need to reduce the temperature to 360C.
360C is a good temperature for starters as it gives you more time.
How Tip Size Affects Stained Glass Soldering Temperature
Some say the size of the iron tip is more important than either the wattage or the temperature. My feeling is that they work in tandem and all feed into the optimum soldering experience. The most important thing is consistent temperatures and no cold spots.
The Hakko FX-601 comes with a small tip – 3/16″ – which is good for decorative soldering and delicate operations but not so good for running a bead. I’d suggest buying 1/4″ and 3/8″ for more control over your beaded seams.
You don’t have to worry that the larger tip will cause your solder to spill over. It sounds obvious but the width of the bead depends on the outer edges of the foil joint. The solder is not going spread out onto the glass if you use a wider tip.
How To Use The Iron Tip To Control The Temperature
The front edge of the tip is the coolest area, next is the side edge, the hottest area is the flat sides. You can control the melting solder by how high off the work you keep the iron.
If you want more heat change the angle of the iron tip – hold it flatter so that more of the iron tip is exposed to the solder.

Hi! I'm managing an old building that needs renovation. What are the best ways to preserve its historical features while making it more energy efficient?	"Old and ageing properties are crammed with history and contain a certain undeniable charm, but when planning on rejuvenating its looks, the most challenging decision to make is whether to renovate or demolish.
When deciding whether to demolish or renovate, there is no right or wrong decision as both options have their pros and cons. Deciding on whether to demolish or renovate is dependant on several factors, including what is optimally suitable to your needs and requirements.
Before moving on with your decisions to either renovate or demolish, you will have to keep in mind the building rules in your area. There are laws or by-law, in many areas, that prohibit the demolition or renovation of a house which is deemed to be of historical value or a certain age. A council can also forbid any work on the property should they feel that renovating will alter the overall look of the particular area.
Various factors need to be considered when deciding whether a renovation or demolition project in Brisbane is the best option for you. We look at them below;
- What Is Your Goal?
The goal of your project is the most critical aspect to consider. If you are looking to add an extra room or make alterations to the plumbing, your best option will be to renovate than pulling the entire building down.
It will be a more prudent decision to demolish the entire house, should you be looking to make substantial changes that will affect the structural integrity of the whole building.
- The Condition Of The House.
You will need to find an outstanding demolition company in Brisbane to entirely demolish an old property that you have purchased at a bargain price. Old buildings are usually in poor condition, and a renovation is a waste of your money as it is just masking the cause of the problem and not fixing it.
The best solution, in this case, would be demolishing the entire house and using your tailored layout to build a new one. A demolition in Brisbane allows for you to create a home that accommodates your specifications, such as living areas that are facing a north-easterly or northern direction to maximise on sunlight, or installing solar panels.
- Your Budget.
Money talks. A small scale renovation is a more affordable option than demolition. It is important to work your budget out first when you intend to have something done on a grander scale. Speaking to contractors about your plans will make you understand whether a renovation, or a demolition will cost more."	<urn:uuid:ecd6b1e3-5e84-405e-9bbc-e4ea3f114ef7>	0.0

Assuming complete absorption of the ingested glucose during the 4.5-h postprandial period (47), net initial splanchnic glucose sequestration was reduced in diabetic subjects (14.8 ± 1.4 g or 19.7 ± 1.8% of ingested load vs. 22.0 ± 2.2 g or 29.3 ± 2.9% of ingested load, P < 0.02; Table 1).
Renal and hepatic glucose release.
Before glucose ingestion, diabetic subjects had greater renal (4.69 ± 0.69 vs. 1.12 ± 0.25 μmol·kg−1·min−1, P < 0.01) and hepatic glucose release (11.5 ± 0.9 vs. 8.34 ± 0.34 μmol·kg−1·min−1, both P < 0.01; Fig. 3), consistent with a previous report (42).
After glucose ingestion, patterns of renal and hepatic glucose release were similar in both groups; renal glucose release increased to peaks at 30–90 min and remained above baseline for 2–3 h, whereas hepatic glucose release decreased immediately and remained suppressed during the entire postprandial period.

What papers should I keep in a waterproof box?	"How to get my cat from peeing on the couch?
Lucy keeps peeing on the couch! I'm going crazy. Yes she uses her litter box daily and I am constantly cleaning it out every day. Both my cats have their own litter box. About one ever week or two, Lucy pees on the couch. I should take stock out in Nature's Miracle! This all started two years ago. First We got rid of our futon, then last year we moved in with my fiance, Lucy peed on our microfiber couch. We delt with it, professional cleaners, plastic, etc. We moved again last October and Over Christmas, My husband bought me a beautiful new leather sofa. Guess what... a week later, Lucy peed on it! I can't win! Three houses, three sofas, each in a different location. Leather is easier to clean, but this is ridiculas! I tried the no stay boundary spray, positive and negative reinforcement. She didn't have a UTI, I took her to the VET several times over the last year Nothing seems to work. Please help. I really don't want to get rid of her, but she is ruining our furniture
- Cast your vote for which answer you think is best!
It seems like Lucy doesn't like change, especially in environments. However, she shouldn't be urinating on the couch if you are keeping her litterbox as clean as you say. What about the cat litter you are using? Cats do not like scented cat litter. Does the litter need to be changed more frequently and not just scooped? Try adding a third litterbox. You should have one more litterbox than cats - in your case - you need three litterboxes. Keep them scrupulously clean! Scrub those soiled areas with Nature's Miracle and let it thoroughly dry. Lucy shouldn't want to go on that same spot. If it were my new couch, I would take it one step further and keep a blanket or sheet on the couch with a waterproof protector underneath (like you would use for a child who pees the bed). I always keep a sheet on my couch just to keep it clean from my cats, but they never pee on it. I hope this helps some."	<urn:uuid:4316fee6-f80d-42d7-bf39-b02c8741a34a>	0.0
I'm an x-ray technician trying to understand different injuries. Which scan is better for finding broken bones: regular x-rays of ankle fractures or x-rays of hamate hook fractures?	"Bone cancer X-rays
What does bone cancer look like on an X-ray?
Reading X-rays is a specialist job. Most of us can't make much out of them, unless it is something really obvious like a complete break in a bone.
Bone cancer may show up as a thinning of the bone, so the affected area may look paler and less dense on the X-ray. Cancer can lead to a break in a bone, called a pathological fracture. A pathological fracture happens in abnormal bone because it is weak. It can happen after a minor knock or when doing routine activities. Pathological fractures can show up quite clearly in X-rays, like any other break.
Most cancer cells in bones have spread there from another part of the body. These are called bone metastases, or secondary bone cancers. Primary bone cancer can look quite different and may show as an expansion on the side of the bone where the tumour has grown out from the bone itself. This may look like a shadowy area extending out from the affected bone. The tumour can lay down calcium deposits in this outgrowth and these may show up on X-ray as clearly defined white patches. Your doctor may call this sclerotic changes or sclerosis. Sclerosis means hardening. Secondary prostate cancer in the bones commonly has a dense, sclerotic appearance.
Sometimes the bone has a lacy appearance. The cancer causes holes to develop in the bone, making it look like lace or net. Your doctor may describe these changes as lysis or lytic changes. Lytic means cells that hat been broken down.
The type of primary bone cancer called osteosarcoma often looks dense (sclerotic) on X-ray. Or it may be a mixture of thickened areas and holes. Doctors call these areas sclerotic and lytic. You may see these terms used on the X-ray report.

What changes did Michigan's Funeral Representative Law from 2016 bring to funeral arrangements and who can be appointed as a funeral representative?	"Though our laws and perceptions of what it means to be a family are becoming more inclusive, it can still be challenging for those with non-traditional next of kin relationships when it comes to planning a funeral at a funeral home in Dublin, CA. The most common non-traditional relationships are same-sex couples, Common Law marriages, and separated but still married couples.
There are three criteria that have to be met in order to couples to be considered legally married under general Common Law. If you are married under Common Law, it’s important to know that it might be tricky for a funeral home or service to validate a Common Law Marriage after one of the people passes away. Unless a Declaration of Informal Marriage has been filed by a county clerk, many funeral homes will ask a different next of kin person to sign the necessary funeral documents as there are penalties involved in allowing a non-documented marriage to serve as legal standing to be a next of kin. To avoid any concerns or issues after a death, Common Law couples should file with the county clerk before a death.
Thanks to modern legislation, legally married same-sex couples have the exact same rights and next-of-kin spouse status as heterosexual couples. However, the this is only the case if the couple is legally married at the time of death. Without proof of a legal marriage, the funeral home or service will have to look to a different member of the family to take on final disposition responsibilities and decisions.
Marriage is a complicated relationship, and oftentimes married couples are separated but not legally divorced. In this scenario, the spouse would be still be responsible for making all necessary funeral arrangements and paying for them. Unless there is a clear legal proof of divorce, the marriage is still valid, and the spouse is the next of kin. This is more common than you might think and is a confusing situation that causes a lot of delays in making funeral home or cremation plans.
These days, most states have a process in place for getting around difficulties with next of kin relationships. Depending on the state, there is usually a form that people can fill out, sign and file to give a specific person the responsibility of all death-related decisions. This form allows you to choose who you want to make your funeral arrangements and is valid at the vast majority of licensed funeral homes and cremation providers.
Be sure to look into the specificities of your state law or reach out to a lawyer for the most up-to-date information and guidance."	<urn:uuid:c2c43d4f-6023-4acd-bd5c-13f73b113577>	0.0
I'm trying to understand how research is done in libraries. What methods do researchers use to study library topics, and how do they ensure they don't expose private user data?	"Over the last three years these people have challenged me in ways that made me realise that there's a bunch of stuff I thought I knew about research that turns out not to be true.
And so I’ve changed the way I talk about user research. That's what I want to share with you today. Three ways - three research heresies - that I’ve used to explain to these people what it is to do their jobs.
This whole idea of finding the explanations leads me on to this. The Beginning of Infinity is a book by David Deutsch, a theoretical physicist.
He's got this theory that human knowledge doesn't advance by data and facts and evidence and what he would call empiricism. Instead, human knowledge advances through us coming up with better explanations to make sense of the data, the facts and knowledge.
And that the act of explaining things is fundamentally a creative act, not an analytical one. I am going to try and do some of that for us today.
The first unhelpful belief that we hold as user researchers is that ‘user needs’ is an important concept for training user researchers.
I think this is unhelpful. I do not agree with this.
I get where it comes from. One of the places is the first government design principle.
‘Start with user needs’ has been hugely important for government. I love this principle. It’s brought a lot of user centered design into government. It has been a rallying call for researchers and designers to come and work in government. Me included. I work in government because of this.
But when I work with researchers on our teams I've come to the conclusion that ‘user needs’ is actually a harmful concept for training researchers. Or teaching researchers what the job of a researcher is.
I know this is quite a big statement. So I want to explain myself.
This is me joining GDS and leaving cxpartners, a design agency I worked for. You can see I'm excited because there's a nice exclamation mark!
What you can’t see is I'm actually nervous and slightly scared. The reason I'm nervous and scared is that - in the job description, and in the job advert, and on the service manual, and even in my objectives - there’s this concept of ‘user needs’.
The truth is that I don't understand how to relate ‘user needs’ to my work."	<urn:uuid:bbe64f4c-6dda-44b2-b3cf-d969fb85c735>	0.0

Autism is not a single condition, but a spectrum of disorders that affect the brain’s ability to perceive and process information. Recent research suggests that too many connections in the brain could be at least partially responsible for the symptoms of autism, from communication deficits to unusual talents.
New research from the University of Maryland suggests that this overload of connections begins early in mammalian development, when key neurons in the brain region known as the cerebral cortex begin to form their first circuits. By pinpointing where and when autism-related neural defects first emerge in mice, the study results could lead to a stronger understanding of autism in humans—including possible early intervention strategies.
The researchers outline their findings in a research paper published January 31, 2017 in the journal Cell Reports.
“Our work suggests that the neural pathology of autism manifests in the earliest cortical circuits, formed by a cell type called subplate neurons,” said UMD Biology Professor and senior study author Patrick Kanold. “Nobody has looked at developing circuits this early, in this level of detail, in the context of autism before. This is truly a new discovery and potentially represents a new paradigm for autism research.”
Subplate neurons form the first connections in the developing cerebral cortex—the outer part of the mammalian brain that controls perception, memory and, in humans, higher functions such as language and abstract reasoning. As the brain develops, the interconnected subplate neurons build a network of scaffolding thought to support other neurons that grow later in development.
“The cortex is a very important region in the adult human brain that undergoes a complex, multi-stage development process,” said Daniel Nagode, a former postdoctoral researcher at UMD and lead author of the study."	<urn:uuid:53a6b41a-6122-4912-a418-0d7171cb07f1>	0.0

This design motif evokes historical predictions. There are several goods with these sorts of design patterns, which include sharp angles and intense colors (such as neon green and brilliant purple) (black, white, and gray). It is a fantastic 3bhk home design concept; especially for places like the kitchen and bathroom.

8. Big and Bold
Some of the popular trends in the interior design of 3Bhk home design at the moment are using vivid colors and striking patterns. Designers adore the tasteful use of extremely stunning hues and patterns, such as accent cushions in slightly different hues of a vivid burgundy or wall art with a design that differs from the rug but is yet related. The secret is to emphasize being strong and vibrant without going overboard. Bold colors may overpower a space, so start modest and use only a few pieces to serve as the room’s focal points. Consider taking a look at the beautiful realm of color blocking as well. The decision can be made of staying with “strong” colors over “bright” ones according to the choice of the client (4 Theme Ideas for Your Apartment Decorating Scheme | BetterDecoratingBible, n.d.).

- Manipulating wind and water flows
- Creating storms by manipulating pressure systems
- Affecting peoples' balance
- Thinning or thickening fluids to affect movement, breathing, or swimming
- Manipulating pressure to fly
- Attracting matter, applying Vacuum to compress it to a small area, then launching it out in a Vacuum Blast; this is not limited to air, although it is the easiest to compact

eLISA is a mission under development as the European Space Agency’s third Large class mission in its Cosmic Vision programme. The goal is to explore the science theme ‘The Gravitational Universe’ by studying gravitational waves emitted by compact objects in the near and distant universe. Gravitational wave observations offer a new and unique means of studying our Universe and probing the intricate details of General Relativity. As well as enlarging our understanding of physics and astronomy, they offer an unprecedented opportunity to discover completely new physics unprobed by electromagnetic observatories.
The evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (eLISA) is a satellite mission which will observe gravitational waves in the frequency range between 0.1mHz and 0.1Hz from a wide variety astrophysical sources. This will allow precision tests of General Relativity and a new means of doing astrophysics and cosmology.
More details about the project
eLISA will enable tests of General Relativity to unprecedented precision. In particular it will provide:
- A guaranteed direct detection of gravitational waves unless they propagate in a way not described by General Relativity. Stellar binary systems exist in the Milky Way which are guaranteed ‘calibration’ sources for the eLISA observatory.
- Test of propagation of gravitational waves at the speed of light
- Measurement of polarisation states of gravitational waves
- Mapping of the space-time metric around super massive black-holes by the tracing the gravitational signal generated by the inspiral of stellar mass compact objects.
- Detailed tests of numerical relativity predictions
eLISA will open up a new window on the universe for astrophysical observation:
- Population study of thousands of compact white-dwarf binary systems in the Milky Way. This will provide information about the evolution, life cycle and distribution of these systems which eventually give rise to Type Ia supernovae.
- Mergers of massive black-holes at the centres of galaxies will be observed from throughout the lifetime of the universe allowing a study of the progenitors of massive black holes, the galaxy merger history of the universe, as well as the energy loss processes associated with the merger coalescence and ringdown of SMBHs.
eLISA provides an opportunity to probe a stochastic background of gravitational waves originating in TeV scale processes in the very early universe."	<urn:uuid:7c2077b2-2fa9-4650-8f32-b78524428e7c>	0.0

Scientists had drawn up a complete road map of the human genome. The Human Genome Project, which took 14 years to complete, delivered a genetic blueprint for the 20 000 genes contained within the DNA code, giving scientists unprecedented insight into its complexity.
Over the last decade, several international projects have been launched to sequence and compare thousands of human genomes, spanning multiple ethnic and geographical populations. This technology fast-tracked the detection of genes, or more often, sets of genes, that are associated with disease traits.
Common genetic variants (known as polymorphisms) that could have a range of impacts on gene function- from none to major - were identified in individuals and whole populations at variable frequencies. This finding in particular represented a game-changer for medicine, in that a person’s DNA might be used to identify biomarkers that could predict disease course, and subsequently guide treatment according to that patient’s genetic make-up.
In recent times, the concept of harnessing this genetic roadmap to personalise medicine to an individual is becoming realised, and there is a major effort underway in medical research to translate this to the clinic (NHMRC 2011).
For instance, cancer is a complex disease that is largely determined by genetic mutations, which can be inherited ('germline mutation') or arise sporadically ('somatic mutation'). Different genetic mutations may be responsible for the same anatomical cancer, but genetic testing (based on DNA sequencing) can group these tumours into sub-types based on the exclusivity of gene variants to that tumour. For example, breast cancer is not a single entity, but exists in multiple forms depending on the gene/s and corresponding cell types that are disrupted. As such, prognostic genomic testing is available to characterise breast tumours into sub-types according to their genomic signature (Dai et al. 2015).
Based on genetic testing, pharmacogenetics specifically targets a medicine to a disease sub-type. The utility of personalised medicine to treat common cancers has been particularly promising in lung, melanoma, breast, thyroid and colorectal cancers, which are each driven by differing and multiple gene variants.
Pharmacogenetics is further used as a tool to predict patient sensitivity to a medicine. Common genetic variants present in drug-metabolising enzymes can significantly impact the level of enzyme function."	<urn:uuid:70a7ac1c-e352-426f-a8e6-3d735268d2d0>	0.0
What do recent studies say about how wearing a helmet affects reaction time and risk-taking behavior while skiing?	"Air pollution: How it affects your eyes? Helpful tips to protect your vision!
Studies have also linked high air pollution levels to increased occurrences of dry eye syndrome.
Zee Media Bureau
New Delhi: Air pollution, which is a mixture of natural and man-made substances in the air we breathe, can affect humans, plants and animals. Air pollution has been linked to a wide array of health effects. Among them are heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, both chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma.
The national capital, Delhi, has been witnessing high levels of air pollution for around two weeks after Diwali celebrations, putting its residents at high health risks, especially the elderly, children and people with respiratory illnesses.
But did you also know how air pollution impacts your eyes and vision? Polluted air can increase your risk of eye problems, ranging from simple irritation and burning to severe allergy, cataract and even cancer. The most common ones being redness, itching and burning sensation, watering eye, difficulty in vision, discharge, allergic reaction, including severe itching, eyelid swelling and risk of conjunctivitis.
Studies have also linked high air pollution levels to increased occurrences of dry eye syndrome. Dry eye syndrome is a chronic condition in which your eyes can’t produce the right amount of tears to stay wet. This lack of moisture makes your eyes feel gritty, scratchy, or itchy, or produces a burning sensation.
While you can’t always prevent dry eye syndrome as acquiring of this condition increases with age, there are many steps you can take to minimise your risk of infections. These include:
- Wearing sunglasses or goggles while outdoors.
- Avoiding vigorous eye rubbing in case of irritation.
- Taking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated - if you don’t have enough water in your body, you won't be able to produce the amount of tears you need for pain-free eyes.
- Using lubricating eye drops given by eye specialists.
- Not wearing contact lens and eye makeup if eyes are feeling sore.
- Not smoking since cigarette smoke quickly dries out your eyes and cause constant eye irritation.
- Installing a high-quality air filter at home to keep outdoor air pollutants out of your nest.
Besides following the above guidelines, you can reduce your risk of eye infections by minimising your exposure to outdoor air pollutants and staying indoors as much as possible."	<urn:uuid:77f9c49d-a04e-422c-b02f-3026484e703b>	0.0
What precautions should I take with water and dairy products when traveling to make sure I don't get sick, and how can these items make me ill?	"Hunters can't just load all of their hunting gear on your boat and go on their way. Firearms are dangerous enough just as they are. But toss them into boats (that comes with their own unique dangers) and you could be cooking up a recipe for disaster. So to minimize the risks in favor of boat safety, you need to make sure you're transporting your firearms the right way.
To maintain safety, see to it that you follow these safety precautions if you're boat hunting with one other person:
Exiting the hunting boat follows the same steps, with one owner exiting first and taking his firearm, and then the second exiting next and taking his firearm. Following these steps should help keep every hunter safe when hunting from a boat.
Tips for Hunting with More Than One Person
What safety precaution should you take when hunting from a boat with another person? It's enough work to figure out how to keep your boat safe when hunting alone, but what precautions should you take when hunting from a boat with a partner? Here are some tips.
Tips to Avoid Capsizing and to Keep Your Boat Stable
One of the problems with boat hunting is that the strength of your gun's recoil and the exaggerated movement of the water surface make for a highly unstable situation. So to avoid capsizing when you take a shot, consider these safety precautions from expert hunters:
What to Pack When Hunting From a Boat
It's easy to overload your boat with gear and other items when you're not used to packing light. Everything might seem like an essential when you're on dry land. But it's important that you keep your hunting boat as light weight as possible to prevent accidents.
There are two types of safety equipment you need to make sure you have on any boating trip- that which is required by laws of your state and that which is optional but may save you when things go wrong. Let's look at both and what hunters pack in more detail.
Required Safety Equipment
These are items that state or federal boating regulations require each boater to have onboard. Failure to do so may result in a fine if your boat is inspected by authorities. Of course, they are also items you may need in an emergency. Below is a list of the most commonly required items, although it may change slightly depending on where you are boating.
Optional Safety Equipment & Hunting Gear
These items may not be required by law, but they can be vital in an emergency."	<urn:uuid:312b06e2-e69c-4829-9de7-980c99889471>	0.0
I keep seeing news about 'the Cabinet' in different countries. What exactly does this term mean when talking about governments around the world?	"We also have teams here focused on the local market. We are seeing acceleration in the local market in terms of kinds of projects and the sophistication of those projects. India, by history, would be characterized as a very big, small business market but I think it is transitioning to becoming a large, business market.
In your emphasis on the local market, you were ahead of Indian IT firms.
We are a 100-year-old company. We see these patterns. All things tend to rise in the world but not at the same pace. There is a phenomenon around technology and its use. It's the enabler of modern society. Countries which make a commitment to become a modern society, a 21st century infrastructure /business, they are inherently going to make a big commitment to technology. IT tends to grow until it reaches a certain percentage of GDP, then it begins to slow. IT in India has easily grown two-times the GDP.
In the near term, what will be the focus areas for IBM in India?
We are seeing a shift in India towards more end-toend solutions. We see it in governments and in business. We see them taking on bigger, longer-term, transformational initiatives. There's new commitment to infrastructure. Businesses want to move to best practices, tighter integration, more comprehensive delivery of services with increasing focus on customer loyalty programme.
As the Indian middle class grows in size and the amount of disposable incomes rise, businesses of all kinds will be focused on how they service the growing populace of people who have money to spend. Discretionary funds affect banking, retail. These will be huge opportunities in these sectors.
IBM works closely with private Indian companies. Is the Indian government a big target for you?
Yes. Indian governments—both state and federal. States spend more money than the federal one. The government is our largest industry. Government tends to be many different entities around the world. We sell lots of technology to lots of government. Governments have been big clients of IBM's.
Will you give us Indiaspecific numbers, especially about your employee count?
We are working our way through to the first 1,00,000. India is our second largest country from a population perspective. I would anticipate we will get bigger but not at the rate at which we grew over the past five years. In the product areas we play in, we are typically No."	<urn:uuid:9ff5159d-694e-4e04-948b-c165b93ca960>	0.0
I've been reading about the relationship between attention and driving safety - what have studies discovered about where drivers focus their gaze when navigating curves on the road?	"Fleet managers have a lot on their plate when it comes to their fleet operations. This includes daily logistical planning, route planning and driver monitoring tasks. However, fleet managers must also ensure that fleet safety remains their highest priority. Luckily, evidence suggests that an effective fleet telematics policy holds the key to improving fleet safety.
A leading study published in September of 2020 notes and highlights the relationship between fleet telematics and fleet safety. It also addresses key risk indicators for drivers while out on the road as well as how organisations can use fleet telematics to reduce these.
This post condenses and summarises the key factors from the study that fleet managers should know.
Learn why a modern fleet telematics policy should be a priority.
The Most Important Fleet Driving Safety Indicators
The study concluded that driving behaviours themselves are a leading driving safety factor. In particular, the following driving behaviours were highlighted as being the biggest safety indicators:
- Vehicle speed (compared to the respective road speed limit)
- G-Force factors, namely harsh-braking and vehicle swerving from driving too fast
- Hard acceleration and aggressive cornering
Fundamentally, the study notes that identifying and analysing these safety indicators are key to improving driver safety. These should be at the forefront of the fleet manager’s safety strategy.
The study also points out that fleet managers should focus on a small number of safety indicators when it comes to communicating with and evaluating drivers.
This is because a high number of safety indicators can provide too much data to work with and prove confusing. It is also because these above-mentioned indicators were by far the biggest safety factors themselves.
Furthermore, the study also notes that implementing an effective fleet telematics policy is a great way to address such safety indicators.
Learn More: Reduce Fleet Driving Risk Factors
Organisations/Fleet Managers Should Assist Drivers
Fleet managers are also responsible for assisting their drivers in promoting safe driving habits. The study notes that inefficient driving on behalf of fleet drivers is unlikely to change by itself. Therefore, a fleet manager’s proactive feedback- and data-based approach is key in affecting driver safety indicators.
Implementing fleet telematics that specifically focuses on driver behaviour is an efficient way to assist drivers. A good fleet telematics policy promotes safe driver behaviour through data to highlight room for improvement as well as driver behaviour progression."	<urn:uuid:f12bf1f2-fda6-4f51-827b-0e84ea1e8a57>	0.0

U.S. Department of Education
Office for Civil Rights
Revised September 1998En español PDF (154.16K)
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973
In 1973, Congress passed Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), a law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of physical or mental disability (29 U.S.C. Section 794). It states:
No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance . . . .
The Office for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education enforces regulations implementing Section 504 with respect to programs and activities that receive funding from the Department. The Section 504 regulation applies to all recipients of this funding, including colleges, universities, and postsecondary vocational education and adult education programs. Failure by these higher education schools to provide auxiliary aids to students with disabilities that results in a denial of a program benefit is discriminatory and prohibited by Section 504.
Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) prohibits state and local governments from discriminating on the basis of disability. The Department enforces Title II in public colleges, universities, and graduate and professional schools. The requirements regarding the provision of auxiliary aids and services in higher education institutions described in the Section 504 regulation are generally included in the general nondiscrimination provisions of the Title II regulation.
Postsecondary School Provision of Auxiliary Aids
The Section 504 regulation contains the following requirement relating to a postsecondary school's obligation to provide auxiliary aids to qualified students who have disabilities:
A recipient . . . shall take such steps as are necessary to ensure that no handicapped student is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination under the education program or activity operated by the recipient because of the absence of educational auxiliary aids for students with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills.
The Title II regulation states:
A public entity shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to afford an individual with a disability an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a service, program, or activity conducted by a public entity."	<urn:uuid:f22c7c21-20cc-40a8-828b-a27408f330f0>	0.0
how to file insurance claim after natural disaster first steps process	"In many cases, you may be able to sue your insurance company for diminished value as a result of a car accident. In a situation where the other driver was the one at fault for the crash and their insurance company is willing to pay for the repairs on your vehicle, they might also be required to cover any diminished value that occurs as a result of the repairs. Diminished value is the amount of money that your car is worth after it has been repaired, which may be less than its pre-accident value. You’ll need to check the law for the state you live in, but you can file a claim with your insurance company for this money. If you need a free consultation to better understand diminished value, we suggest that you contact our auto accident lawyer on Long Island at Winkler Kurtz, LLP. For more information on this topic, please continue reading this article.
It’s important to note that not all states allow diminished value claims, so be sure to check with your local laws before filing a claim. Additionally, you may need to provide evidence that the repairs caused the diminished value of your vehicle. This could include receipts for the repairs, photographs of the damage, and any other proof that may be required by your state’s laws.
To file a successful claim for diminished value after a car accident, there are a few steps that you should take. The first is to obtain an estimate of the diminished value of your vehicle from an auto appraiser or another qualified professional. This will help you determine how much money you are entitled to receive in compensation for the diminished value of your car.
The next step is to contact your insurance company and let them know that you would like to file a claim for diminished value. Be sure to provide all the necessary documentation, such as receipts for repairs or photographs of the damage, to help make your case. Keep in mind that it can take some time for insurance companies to process claims, so be patient throughout the process.
Finally, if your insurance company refuses to pay for the diminished value of your car, you may be able to take them to court. An experienced auto accident lawyer on Long Island from Winkler Kurtz, LLP can help you prepare for a legal battle and ensure that you receive fair compensation for the damage done to your vehicle. Contact us today for more information about filing a diminished value claim."	<urn:uuid:84bfb383-5246-4fce-a57f-733c30ca33ba>	0.0

What makes Mozart’s Requiem unique?
Mozart’s Requiem is a choral masterpiece whose genesis is shrouded in mystery – one that makes the piece all the more fascinating and emotionally stirring. He was only able to complete the Requiem and Kyrie movements, and managed to sketch the voice parts and bass lines for the Dies irae through to the Hostias.
Who really wrote Mozart’s Requiem?
Requiem in D Minor, K 626, requiem mass by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, left incomplete at his death on December 5, 1791. Until the late 20th century the work was most often heard as it had been completed by Mozart’s student Franz Xaver Süssmayr.
What is the theme of Requiem by Mozart?
Mozart Requiem – Analysis. A Requiem is a Roman Catholic mass for the dead: while it includes movements that are part of the daily mass (Kyrie, Sanctus and Agnus Dei), there are several other movements with texts of mourning and remembrance.
Who killed Mozart?
But today Antonio Salieri is best remembered for something he probably didn’t do. He’s remembered for poisoning Mozart.

I've heard about famous naval battles and I want to know - which ship had more successful battles: George Dewey's USS Olympia or HMS Victory?	"Leaving the Old North Church follow Hull Street toward Charlestown. About a block from the church you will be at Copp’s Hill Burying Ground.
Copp’s Hill Burying Ground
Founded in 1659, it was the largest cemetery in the Colonies at that time. Copp’s Hill is the final resting place for two puritan ministers that were involved with the Salem Witch trials. Also buried here is Robert Newman, the Sexton of the Old North Church, who is believed to have been the one that hung the lanterns for Paul Revere in the church’s steeple. Edmund Hartt the builder of the USS Constitution also lays at rest here. In Copp’s Hill Burying Ground it is believed that close to 1,000 free African-Americans are buried there, one of which is Prince Hall who formed the countries first Black Masons Lodge and was instrumental in ending slavery in the Bay State. During the battle of Bunker Hill, because of its height, Copp’s Hill was used by the Red Coats to train their cannon on Charlestown.
Continue on Hull Street to Commercial Street, turn left and head over to and across the Charlestown Bridge. Once you are across turn right along Constitution Road toward the tail ship docked at the Boston Navel Shipyard- The USS Constitution, “Old Ironsides.”
The USS Constitution is the oldest commissioned ship in the US Navy. She was launched in 1798, and was made famous while helping to defend our nation in the war of 1812. It was during the naval battle with the HMS Guerriere that a British sailor, seeing their cannonballs bouncing off her sides, gave her the famous nickname “Old Ironsides”. Her unique construction of a three-layer wood sandwich of american hardwoods gave Old Ironsides her strength. The copper fastenings for the ship where made by Paul Revere. When she was in service the USS Constitution had a crew of 500; Today the she is manned by a crew of about 70.
After you leave the USS Constitution your next stop will be the Bunker Hill Monument. It’s not hard finding this site because of its 221 foot granite obelisk that towers over Charlestown. We crossed over Chelsea Street, under the Tobin Memorial Bridge and climbed up Tremont street to the monument."	<urn:uuid:a949b681-9775-41d6-81e9-b7527fb538c8>	0.0
largest fire arizona history where how many acres burned	"The California wildfires for the 2018 season have been dubbed the most destructive in the history of California. A total of 7,579 fires have burned 1,667,855 acres of land, a new record according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the National Interagency Fire Center. Fiscally, these fires have caused $2.975 billion in damages.
Some of the most destructive fires ever recorded have happened this season, like the Mendocino Complex Fire, burning more than 459,000 acres to become the largest complex fire in the state’s history. A complex fire is two or more individual incidents located in the same general area which are assigned to a single incident commander or unified command, according to the National Park Service’s Fire Terminology glossary.
Camp Fire in Northern California, which started on November 8th, has claimed 83 lives, making it the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California’s history. 536 people are still missing; this number is down from past weeks. The fire decimated whole towns, like Paradise, California. The fire destroyed homes, buildings, cars, parks, basically everything in sight; 18,000 structures were burned to the ground. As of November 21st, the fire was 80% contained.
The Woolsey Fire in Southern California also started on November 8th and was highly publicized due to the region it engulfed. The fire destroyed buildings, houses (including those of celebrities), and highways in the Los Angeles area; 1,500 structures destroyed and 341 damaged. This fire is 98% contained as of November 20th. In both fire cases, the Camp Fire and the Woolsey Fire, mandatory evacuations took place.
How do these fires start? Why are they so bad?
Wildfires can start in a number of ways, as long as there’s a spark. From there, the fire needs oxygen, heat, and fuel to expand. Because California has the oxygen in the form of wind, heat in the form of summer weather, and fuel in the form of trees and other plants, the fires explode in size and spread rapidly.
Scientists have said that increased amounts of natural fuel (dead trees, grasses) and atmospheric conditions (global warming) have contributed to California’s fire susceptibility. Global warming has led to higher temperatures and less rain, which means there’s more dryness in the environment."	<urn:uuid:c514c48c-f85a-4ca9-84f1-7d9274a13e7c>	0.0

As a reproductive biologist, what mechanisms does the Animal Reproductive Biology Group study?	"The influence of male age and simulated pathogenic infection on producing a dishonest sexual signal
Abbreviated Journal Title
Proc. R. Soc. B-Biol. Sci.
trade-off; dishonest signal; infection; residual reproductive value; reproductive acceleration; sexual conflict; TERMINAL INVESTMENT; OLDER MALES; FEMALE PREFERENCE; FIELD CRICKETS; IMMUNE DEFENSE; EVOLUTION; FITNESS; SIZE; DROSOPHILA; PARASITES; Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology
In recent years, studies have shown that reproductive effort decelerates in response to pathogenic infection. If infection substantially reduces a host's residual reproductive value (RRV), however, then an acceleration of effort may instead occur (e.g. terminal investment). Reproductive acceleration would theoretically allow hosts to maintain or exaggerate their sexual signal upon infection. This would create a deceptive message from the perspective of the chooser, who may unwittingly copulate with an infected mate to their detriment. Using the cricket Allonemobius socius, we assessed the potential for reduced RRV to accelerate male reproductive effort and create a dishonest signal. RRV was manipulated through male age and simulated pathogenic insult. Reproductive effort was measured as calling song energetics, mating success, latency to mate and nuptial gift size. We show that males adopted either an accelerated or decelerated reproductive strategy upon infection, and that this decision was probably mediated by RRV. Moreover, males who accelerated their effort produced a dishonest signal by increasing their song energetics while providing fewer paternal resources (i.e. smaller gifts). Our study is one of the few to document the existence of dishonest signals and relate dishonesty to a potential reduction in female fitness, underscoring the conflict inherent in sexual reproduction.

carciofi alla giudea history jewish ghetto rome	"Poets and painters, sociologists and rabbis, businessmen and doctors, Zionists and Bundists, and even the young leaders of what would be the first armed uprising anywhere in Nazi-occupied Europe—they were, by Ringelblum’s design, a cross-section of the rich diversity of Polish Jewish life before the war. For three years, the group met secretly each Saturday, hence the name, Oyneg Shabes which means “the joys of Shabbat.”
Ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto, 1943.
For the Oyneg Shabes no subject was taboo. No detail too small. Under Ringelblum’s meticulous direction, members of the secret society tried to create a portrait of all aspects of Jewish life in the Ghetto. They wrote essays about corrupt Jewish police and collaborators, about young smugglers, underground schools, religious affairs, the secret economy, and prostitution. They collected poetry, Ghetto humor, songs and folklore. The Archive recorded statistics on deportations and deaths. They collected issues of the dozens of underground newspapers circulating in the Ghetto. And, because Ringelblum had close relationships with members of the Zionist youth movements, he was also able to support and document the emergence of their plans for armed resistance.
Ringelblum encouraged everyone, not only Oyneg Shabes members, to write. He ran essay contests for children to write about their lives in the Ghetto. The Archive also collected artifacts: armbands, official Nazi pronouncements and Judenrat issued IDs. Candy wrappers, tram tickets, theater posters, announcement of concerts and lectures—the stuff of daily life was also included. Moreover, in an ongoing effort to make sense of what was happening beyond the Ghetto walls, Oyneg Shabes members debriefed eye-witness survivors of destroyed Jewish communities who managed to straggle into Warsaw.
At first Ringelblum believed he and his collaborators were collecting the raw material from which, after the war, they would write volumes of history. As the stark truth of the Nazi machine for total annihilation of the Jews emerged, it became increasingly clear that they themselves would probably not survive, but rather that they were collecting the raw data from which others would write their history after the war."	<urn:uuid:26f5eaf6-920b-4405-b034-178caf27f86b>	0.0

But what it did do was give all of us- gamers who had been playing games for a very long time now, as well as non gamers, who were usually intimidated by game controllers- a new way to play games, and to have fun while doing that.
Yeah, the series has had its share of downs (Wii Music comes to the mind), but on the whole, games like Wii Sports Resort demonstrated that even these ‘casualized’ games were made with the typical Nintendo veneer of quality, and that, most of all, they would be fun to play through- with everybody.
Online gaming may have ultimately been the driving force in the rise of multiplayer gaming, but as far as social multiplayer gaming is concerned, nothing beats a quick session of Wii Sports.
13. Fire Emblem (NES, SNES, GBA, GCN, DS, Wii)
Fire Emblem still remains a bit of an enigma. The SRPG franchise never saw a release outside of Japan for nearly twenty years, with the NES and SNES installments of the series skipping out on western releases entirely. In fact, the first taste that western audiences had of Fire Emblem wasn’t even in a Fire Emblem game- it was in Super Smash Bros."	<urn:uuid:cdd276f4-5ec2-470a-b842-a40c8e676ddc>	0.0

What's the best type of mortar mix for strong brick walls?	"A great deal of time can be saved in ensuring that each row of bricks is level if a brick is laid at each end of the row-first of all and, when completely straight and level, a length of strong twine is run between these two bricks, across their tops, to serve as a level along the length of the wall. This twine can be attached to two long nails inserted in a course of bricks lower down. Use a plumb line to keep the faces of the wall vertical.
Where high walls are required, it is not advisable to construct dry walls, as sufficient strength and rigidity can only be supplied by a concrete or mortar bonding. Walls more than 5 ft. high require buttresses every 15 ft. along the wall."	<urn:uuid:d916e7a9-f860-42e2-b736-c4900f4ed5ca>	0.0
What research methods are scientists using to study coral survival, and what specific threats have they discovered through their investigations?	"Chapter 3. Psychological Science & Research
Psychologists study the behaviour of both humans and animals in order to understand and improve the quality of human lives.
Psychological research may be either basic or applied in orientation. Basic research and applied research inform each other, and advances in science occur more rapidly when both types of research are conducted.
The results of psychological research are reported primarily in research reports in scientific journals. These research reports have been evaluated, critiqued, and improved by other scientists through the process of peer review.
The methods used by scientists have developed over many years and provide a common framework through which information can be collected, organized, and shared.
The scientific method is the set of assumptions, rules, and procedures that scientists use to conduct research. In addition to requiring that science be empirical, the scientific method demands that the procedures used be objective, or free from personal bias.
Scientific findings are organized by theories, which are used to summarize and make new predictions, but theories are usually framed too broadly to be tested in a single experiment. Therefore, scientists normally use the research hypothesis as a basis for their research.
Good theories are falsifiable. This means that the relationships between the variables that are predicted by the theory can be shown through research to be incorrect.
Scientists use operational definitions to turn the ideas of interest — conceptual variables — into measured variables.
It is important for psychological research using humans and animals to be ethical. Our ethics codes are developed from the moral principles of weighing risks against benefits, acting responsibly and with integrity, seeking justice, and respecting people’s rights and dignity.
Researchers must follow specific ethics codes, providing rules for how to conduct studies. Some historical events that impacted our ethics codes today are the Nuremberg trials, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Belmont Report.
Decisions about whether psychological research using human and animals is ethical are made using established ethical codes developed by scientific organizations and on the basis of judgments made by the local Ethical Review Board. Informed consent, deception, and debriefing are all considered when deciding if research will be approved.
Psychological studies start with a research design that vary according to its strengths and limitations, and it is important to understand how each differs.
Descriptive research is designed to provide a snapshot of the current state of affairs. Descriptive research allows the development of questions for further study but does not assess relationships among variables. The results of descriptive research projects are analyzed using descriptive statistics."	<urn:uuid:ceda3fe0-3ee3-46fb-9513-b212a3ec051e>	0.0

how to measure tv screen size diagonal corner bezel screen difference	"LONDON South Korean electronics giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. claims to have developed the world's first 40-inch display panel made from a single sheet of organic light-emitting diode material. The OLED prototype has a wide screen format of 1,280 by 800 pixels and is driven by an active-matrix backplane of amorphous silicon transistors.
Samsung launched an OLED development initiative in 2001, and the 40-inch panel follows Samsung's development of OLED prototypes at 14.1-inch diagonal size and 21-inch diagonal size in 2004 and January 2005, respectively.
This latest prototype has a maximum screen brightness of 600 candela per meter2, a black-and-white contrast ratio is 5,000:1. The ultrathin shape of the panels will allow future TV set designers to create televisions with a total thickness of only 3 cm or less, Samsung said.
Samsung said it plans to exhibit the 40-inch OLED panel at the Society for Information Display conference and exhibition in Boston from May 24 to 27."	<urn:uuid:6c579bfc-f961-48f9-8202-2d624159e75f>	0.0

Farm fuel exemption
Marked farm fuels are exempt from the carbon levy. This means that the carbon levy does not apply to dyed diesel or gasoline used in farming operations. Agriculture is the only economic sector with a levy exemption.
The farm fuel carbon levy exemption uses the same eligibility criteria as the Alberta Farm Fuel Benefit (AFFB) fuel tax exemption. The AFFB program registration number will also be used for the carbon levy exemption certificate.
Carbon levy exemptions
In addition to marked farm fuel, some other fuels are exempt from the carbon levy, including the following:
- purchases of fuel on-reserve or at other prescribed locations by eligible First Nations and individuals for personal and band use
- marked gasoline and diesel used by farmers in farming operations
- biofuels, including biomethane, biodiesel and ethanol
- inter-jurisdictional flights
- fuel sold for export
- industrial exemptions in cases where fuel is used in industrial processes but not combusted
- natural gas produced and consumed on site by conventional oil and gas producers (until Jan 1, 2023)
- the use of heating fuels on sites subject to the Specified Gas Emitters Regulations (SGER)/output-based allocation regime
For a full list of carbon levy exemptions, see pages 94-96 of the 2016-19 Fiscal Plan (3.0 MB)
Large industrial emitters
Large Industrial Emitters will continue to be subject to the SGER framework until the end of 2017, when the province will transition to an output-based allocation approach. Further details will be available after stakeholder engagement.
The new framework, which is endorsed by energy leaders, is designed to reduce the amount of carbon pollution in every barrel of oil."	<urn:uuid:2ff3d45d-fec9-4e96-bafe-4a8a0f54eb4e>	0.0
I'm doing some home renovations and need to sand both my floors and countertops. Which sanding technique is recommended when working on edges - does it differ between wood floors and quartz surfaces?	"The short answer is Yes, you can refinish engineered wood floors because the top thin layer is made of real hardwood. However, before you begin refinishing, you need to understand the engineered wood floor more deeply so that it can be confirmed whether your engineered wood floor can be refinished or not.
The base of an Engineered Wood Floor is made of high-quality plywood, and the top surface (also called the wear layer) is a layer of real hardwood. That’s why engineered wood flooring looks almost identical to hardwood flooring.
So whether you can refinish your Engineered Wood Floors or not depends on the thickness of the wear layer of the Engineered Wood boards. If the wear layer is thick enough, then you can finish; otherwise, refinishing is not recommended.
Generally, the thickness of the board is 10-20mm, and the thickness of the wear layer is about 1-3mm. The thickness depends on the company, quality of the boards and construction type of boards.
If the thickness of the wear layer of your engineered wood blocks is more than two mm, then you can refinish. Because when sanding, It takes one millimeter off the surface of the boards. Thus if your wear layer is around 3 mm, you can refinish it twice.
Why You Shouldn’t Refinish Engineered Wood Floors?
There are some situations and considerations where you should not refinish engineered wood floors. Here are some reasons:
Limited Thickness of Wear Layer
If the wear layer on your engineered wood floor is too thin, it is not enough thickness to refinish. Or if refinishing of your same floor has already been done earlier, you should not do refinishing. By this, you can damage your floor.
Risk of Damage
If the sanding process is not done by a professional or in the right manner, there is a high chance of uneven surfaces, scratches or dents on the floor, as the top layer can handle wear and tear less than solid hardwood.
Engineered wood floors come with factory-applied finishes designed to be durable and last. Refinishing removes this and affects the durability and stability of the floor.
Mold or Rot
If you are refinishing your floors to remove mildew or rot, check to see how far the mildew has spread. Refinishing a floor only removes mildew from the top surface. If the core of engineered wood blocks has mold, you should replace the entire block instead of refinishing."	<urn:uuid:b9c9c5e2-e67f-4f8c-ad60-66247ab6daaa>	0.0

What are the main features of ars subtilior music?	"Ars Lyrica Houston
""Award-winning American mezzo-soprano Jamie Barton, whose assured and eloquent vocalism provided a strong start to Ars Lyrica Houston’s 2015 ̶16 Zilkha Hall season on Sept. 13, probably doesn’t sing much medieval or Renaissance music. Her potent voice is more suited to the opera stage or recital platform than to the choir loft. But the rest of Western classical music seems to be her oyster.
Winner of the Metropolitan Opera’s National Council Auditions in 2007, the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Competition in 2013, and the Richard Tucker Award last April, the Houston Opera Studio alumna has sung in opera houses and concert halls all over the world. Her repertoire ranges widely, from Monteverdi, Bach, and Handel through Mozart, the bel canto era, Verdi, and Wagner on up to Honegger, Menotti, Poulenc, Bernstein, Previn, Rorem, Hoiby, and Heggie. But like many mezzo-sopranos of recent times — think Cecilia Bartoli, Joyce DiDonato, and Vivica Genaux — she seems to have a special affection and affinity for Baroque composers.
Thus, she has become something of a house mezzo for Ars Lyrica Houston, which specializes in historically informed performances of music from the 17th and 18th centuries. Her work with the ensemble — founded in 1998 by harpsichordist, conductor, and University of Houston Moores School of Music professor Matthew Dirst — has focused on some rarely performed pieces. The group has used her as soloist on its recordings for Sono Luminus of Domenico Scarlatti’s comic intermezzo La Dirindina and Hasse’s Antonio e Cleopatra, the latter garnering a Best Opera Recording Grammy nomination in 2011. But Barton and the 13-member Ars Lyrica ensemble climbed a little further out of the musical weeds on Sept. 13 with a program devoted to Vivaldi, Gluck, Handel, and Haydn.
Conducting from the harpsichord, Dirst got the Baroque ball rolling with the Ouverture, Allegro, and Gigue and the opening aria “Ombra mai fu” from Handel’s Serse."	<urn:uuid:c4b34b01-1e8e-4fa5-84cc-a7b02ab3e07a>	0.0
My uncle keeps saying he doesn't have a gambling problem, but we're all worried. I've heard there are special meetings where family members can talk to him about it - what's involved in making that work?	"Letting It Outwell ,im falling in love with a good friend.... i don't know what to do. in a way, i want to let him know how i feel.. but thats always hard.
the feeling of getting rejected and never seeing him again. and i know that everything takes time but sometimes i can't stand it. I've heard the saying that if he's a real friend, then he'll understand. maybe he will maybe he won't. people are wierd. when i first came out to people, they said that i'm confused and i don't know who i am.. but i know exactly who i am and how i feel. i want to be with him forever but i don't want to lose a friendship. we talk about everything together, hang out all the time. and sometimes i feel like he knows me more than my family does even though he doesn't know that im gay.
i wish these things weren't so damn complicated.
i know he's straight and i wish he wasn't. but maybe i'm just greedy. i respect him and his feelings so thats why i don't want to let him know. i remember everyone's reaction when i told them i was gay. it always surprised them. sometimes they laughed, denied it, or didn't really care.
or they would say ""i know my brother isn't gay"", ""how do you know your gay"", and its hurtful. i don't want to go through that again. i wish they would just know.
i have really good friends who understand me. most of them know that i'm gay and it doesn't bother them anybit. and sometimes they would even joke about it. but i've also heard stories of how people get beat up and even die for the way they are. one of my best friend told me that it doesn't matter if im gay or not because its not him so it doesn't matter. i wish more people would think like that.. well i don't really know where im going with this story but i've heard this is the place to let it all out... thanks jimmdean001

benefits drawbacks peer mediated instruction discipline school settings	"The relationship between parent and peer attachment: The role of affect regulation
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between parent and peer attachment. It was hypothesized that aspects of affect regulation (Neuroticism, Emotional Sharing, and Positive Affect) would account for some portion of the relationship between parent and peer attachment. ^ Parent-child relationships are generally children's first (and formative) relationships: As such, parent-child relationships are likely to serve as models for all future social and emotional experiences. Affect-regulation has been implicated as influential in the link between parent and peer relations. Affect regulation can be characterized by the capacity to label affects, to contain emotional distress, and to respond behaviorally with adaptive emotional coping. Parent attachment style may exert an indirect effect upon peer attachment through specific coaching and nonspecific modeling of affect-regulation skills. ^ The participants in this study were 114 undergraduate psychology students from the subject pool at Fordham University. Participants demographics were as follows: 78 female, 22% male, mean age of 19 years, 77% Caucasian, 9% Hispanic, 6% Asian, 2% African-American, and 4% described themselves as “Other.” ^ Four inventories were used in this study: The Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment; the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; the Emotional Sharing subscale of the COPE; and the Neuroticism subscale of the NEO-Five-Factor Inventory. Note that all scales were administered intact, in their entirety. ^ Standard multiple regression analyses were used to test the direct effects of parent attachment on peer attachment. The indirect effects of parent attachment on peer attachment, mediated by measures of affect regulation, were examined using simultaneous-entry multiple regression strategies in accordance with Baron and Kenny's (1986) criteria for establishing a mediated relationship. Analyses indicated that aspects of affect regulation mediate the relationship between parent and peer attachment. More specifically, this study found that Neuroticism and Emotional Sharing mediated the relationship between Mother and Peer Attachment, while Neuroticism and Positive Affect mediated the relationship between Father and Peer Attachment. Study limitations, as well as various research and clinical implications are presented. Several directions for future research are suggested as well. ^

dust collector box design requirements proper airflow considerations	"Tracking can also be accomplished using time-clock mechanisms or, e.g., two-dimensional arrays of photosensitive devices for determining the sun's position with an attendant feedback control mechanism.
The collector area should be selected in accordance with the energy requirements for a particular utilization device and the solar intensity in the geographical region of interest, generally up to 1.9 kw/m2, as affected by the geographical climate, desired periods of use during a year, typical usage periods during a day, etc. In general, collector areas of approximately 1-3 m2 will suffice for a number of household applications. As an example of the usefulness of such readily achievable collector areas, it should be considered that a typical electrical cooking unit has a power rating of less than or about 1 kw. Accordingly, a collector of an area of about 1 m2 could supply sufficient energy to replace or supplement the conventional energy supply of such a cooking unit depending on time, location and conditions. Other conventional energy using devices have similar ratings, i.e., in the few kilowatt range, e.g., normal hot water heaters, space heaters and many other devices, some of which are discussed below. Collectors having effective areas in the mentioned range could capture sufficient solar radiation to provide the energy requirements for a wide range of such existing devices with, using this invention, minimum interruption of their existing environment.
The degree of beam concentration effected in this component of the system is also not critical. Factors of convenience, cost, commercial availability of components, etc. will be prime considerations in this regard. Generally, the concentrated beam diameters will be in the range of a few cm.
The particular design of the collector/concentrator/collimator is not critical. Systems using lenses, mirrors or combinations thereof are all suitable. Preferably, all surfaces are appropriately treated so that the transmission of this component of the system is maximized, e.g., lenses should be coated with anti-reflection coatings, reflective surfaces should have maximal reflectivities and smoothness, etc. Larger components may be of unitary construction or can be of segmented design wherein several lenses or mirrors are so situated as to act as a single large lens or mirror. Non-limiting, exemplary systems include lens systems wherein a large collecting lens is situated with respect to the focal point of a smaller collimating lens such that the outgoing concentrated and collimated beam is of the required smaller diameter than the incoming beam of parallel solar radiation."	<urn:uuid:c1cca1eb-72ee-4159-9c17-31ca3720dbc7>	0.0
What solutions exist for wildlife conflicts in energy facilities?	"Last check: )
The Shulaveri-Shomu and other Neolithic/Chalcolithic cultures of the Southern Caucasus use local obsidian for tools, raise animals such as cattle and pigs, and grow crops, including grapes.
At least in the Caucasus Mountains, these people probably herd cattle.
In the best known of these elite tombs, a person is buried under a canopy held up by poles topped by gold and silver bull figurines that appear similar in artistic conception to some standards from the burials of Alaca Höyük in Central Anatolia.
Energy priorities of the Caucasus countries, therefore, are two-fold: to diversify their energy supplies; and to cash in on transit revenues as their neighbors develop export facilities which traverse their territory.
In the Southern CaucasusArmenia remains a close ally of Russia, whereas Georgia and Azerbaijan increasingly cooperate with NATO and other international organisations, distancing themselves from Russia.

In the Caucasus - and generally in the Caspian area - the objective of the U.S. until recently was primarily to maintain access to the region, particularly to its oil and gas resources, while at the same time avoiding involvement in regional conflicts or direct confrontation with other major powers.
The major threats to biodiversity in the region are illegal logging, fuel wood harvesting, and the timber trade; overgrazing; poaching and illegal wildlife trade; overfishing; infrastructure development; and pollution of rivers and wetlands.
As a result, CEPF investment in the Caucasus is focused on conserving the hotspot's globally threatened species, the majority of which are found in specific sites in five target conservation corridors: Greater Caucasus, Caspian, West Lesser Caucasus, East Lesser Caucasus, and Hyrcan.
It is possible that the Mountain Jews are descendants of Persian-Jewish soldiers who were stationed in the Caucasus by the Sasanian kings in the fifth or sixth century to protect the area from the onslaughts of the Huns and other nomadic invaders from the east.
It is thought that the Jewish Tats of the Caucasus are their direct descendants; however, this remains not very likely because the Tats speak an Iranian language."	<urn:uuid:dde3a0ad-ee53-4a22-83a1-38c5550d9342>	0.0
accessing medical care via telehealth virtual consultations benefits and impact on healthcare providers during covid19 pandemic	"As an integral part of the healthcare ecosystem, the medical device industry has experienced uncertainty and significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Along with many other stakeholders, these companies are now seeking strategies for remaining financially viable.
During this crisis and beyond, medical device manufacturers are becoming painfully aware of the weaknesses in the traditional fee-for-service payment model. At the same time, they are being introduced to value-based care and its significant advantages. With value-based care, providers receive payments based on measures, such as quality, efficiency, cost and positive clinical outcomes from private payers or government programs. This approach is about taking the long view to care—from the initial provider visit to months or years into the future. As a result, providers are incentivized to focus on long-term outcomes and the costs of a treatment or medical device.
To achieve success in this market, device manufacturers should consider working with providers to help contain costs and enhance outcomes. Stakeholder alignment is critical for value-based care, especially with payers that focus on the cost and impact on population health. When determining a target market, device manufacturers must consider the benefits, assume accountability for delivering better patient outcomes at a lower overall price and offset the potential profit decline early in a product’s lifecycle by partnering with a healthcare technology company with expertise in population health.
With rising pressure to curb healthcare costs, it has become important for device companies to demonstrate effectiveness and assume a certain amount of risk. Finding the right technology partner can empower better outcomes using real-time data aggregation, EHR connectivity and dynamic dashboards and quality reporting.
Before choosing a healthcare technology partner, however, its important for manufacturers to understand the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the healthcare system, the opportunities inherent to value-based care initiatives and the importance of quality measures and data reporting.
Pandemic Exposes Healthcare System Weaknesses
Impact on Physicians
Given the precipitous drop in elective and other nonessential care due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as many hospitals and private physician practices struggle financially, the limitations of fee-for-service models have never been more evident. Industry experts believe that, post-pandemic, the gradual shift towards a larger share of patient care organization revenues coming from value-based contracts will continue. Organizations making this shift are moving carefully and thoughtfully, building systems that encompass quality benchmarks and risk-adjustment rules."	<urn:uuid:d1abbfe6-ad6e-4518-a50e-34780178b8ef>	0.0

- Scanner duties and missions - whether it's a search and rescue (SAR) mission or an airborne photography mission or something else, the scanner's main job is to... well, scan! This is the reason the airplane is up in the air on most missions.
- Basic aircraft and navigation familiarization - this was particularly helpful to the non-pilots in the class and a good reminder for everyone.
- Survival and urgent care issues - we talked about both survival and urgent care issues related to the people we might be searching for on a SAR mission and survival gear for ourselves as air crew. Can you guess what the most important survival tool is if you find yourself in an emergency situation after a crash or other off airport landing? If you don't know, you'll just have to take the next MS Ground School and find out...
- Air to air and air to ground communications - besides talking about proper communications technique, we took at look at some of the communications equipment we might expect to find in CAP planes, which are not all the same.
|Capt Johnson Discussing Grid Searches|
- Weather and how it affects search planning and scanning effectiveness - whether it's fog, smoke, dust, rain, haze, clouds (or lack thereof), the position of the sun, etc., all of these factors impact how effective we are on any given mission. Some of these factors we can work with, others ... sometimes it's best to call it a day and come back later when the weather has changed.
- High altitude and terrain considerations - not only does high altitude affect aircrew (and survivor on the ground) safety, the presence or absence of higher altitude terrain also impacts search patterns and how best to be effective."	<urn:uuid:2a909201-19cf-4a84-9899-75fcc3f34f36>	0.0

how are modern vinyl floorcloths made	"Vinyl Laminate Flooring Special Offers » You will discover three main types of floor constructions, generally found in modern construction. Included in these are framed, truss surfaces Vinyl Laminate Flooring and manufactured joist systems. Of all, the mostly installed floor coverings system are framed floor surfaces. They consist of dimensioned lumber, bearing on outside and interior weight bearing surfaces or beams called “floor joists”. Usually the floor joists are installed, spaced 16″ apart. All joists must stretch at least 1-1/2″ on to a bearing assemblage, of either a beam or full height wall, unless material hangers are installed to provide proper bearing support against other structural components. Beams, which support the floor joists over higher spans, are designed in the form of laminated joists also known as built up beams, or one piece solid insert bearing beams, trim from logs or manufactured. Electricians and plumber may often lower or drill in to the joist work to install utilities, Vinyl Laminate Flooring which is accepted, so long as they don’t remove more material than what’s required by codes. This sort of floor system is usually the least expensive to install.

Vinyl Laminate Flooring Special Offers » Truss floors are simply that. These are made of small dimensioned lumber, interconnected in a webwork routine by the use of metal or wood plates. In the case of long span truss work, bearing measures of at least 3″ are very common. Trusses course greater distances than framed floor assemblies and can be made to span the entire building, eliminating centre load bearing works with. They are moderately more costly than framed floor assemblies, but provide a remarkably strong floor with little deflection or “bounce” to it. Another advantages to this type of structural system, is that tool installations can be run between the webwork components. Never allow investments to trim or drill into the members of the truss, Vinyl Laminate Flooring for they are created specifically for the launching conditions they’ll undergo through the life of the building."	<urn:uuid:aa6acba3-4efa-47c9-b896-c0eccf5b684a>	0.0
reframing negative thoughts psychological therapy methods low versus high income	"Patients with eating disorders have also been found to have problematic personality traits such as perfectionism, neuroticism, obsessionality, negative emotionality, harm avoidance, low self-directedness, low cooperativeness, avoidant personality disorder, high constraint, high persistence, low novelty-seeking, high impulsivity, sensation-seeking, and borderline personality disorder (Vitousek and Manke, 1994; Cassin and von Ranson, 2005). The disordered eating behavior seems like one more comorbid symptom of a complex psychological disorder.
Of course, psychological factors matter. It is trivial to acknowledge that behavioral disturbances like eating problems may sometimes arise in response to complex or stressful situations which also generate psychological disturbances. It is equally obviously true that an individual will not engage in treatment at all without making a decision to pursue recovery, and that this decision-making is in part a psychological act. Given the ambivalence with which most people with eating disorders view both their illness and the possibility and desirability of recovery (Williams and Reid, 2010), this decision must not be taken for granted, either prior to the start of behavior change in treatment or at any point in the ongoing decision-making required to sustain change through treatment and in post-treatment life. But acknowledging the significance of these psychological factors is quite different from claiming that the “real” and “underlying” problem is a psychological one, for example at the level of enduring traits, and that treatment must proceed accordingly. As described above, the stronger claim has not yielded effective psychologically based treatments. In the rest of this section, therefore, we investigate five specific forms of reasoning that underpin it, and what makes these approaches both attractive and problematic.
Correlation Versus Causation
One reason why the psychological story persists despite its failure to generate effective treatments may be a confusion of correlation and causation. As noted, a multitude of correlations have been observed between eating disorders and other psychological problems. Once a correlation has been observed, a sensible next step is often to investigate possible causal links. Anxiety in general, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as a specific expression of anxiety, are amongst the most common focal points for research on the causes of eating disorders (Matsunaga et al., 1999; Levinson et al., 2019)."	<urn:uuid:d77f9b2c-d8d2-42d8-bb2f-b1ab4cad1bdd>	0.0
turkey cooking time per pound and safety precautions	"To keep the burgers juicy, don't pack the meat too tightly.
Makes 4 servings
Combine spinach, scallions, garlic, turkey, and cumin in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Using a fork, mix gently just to combine. Form turkey mixture into twelve 1/2""-thick patties.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in 2 batches, cook patties until golden brown and cooked through (resist the temptation to press down on patties with your spatula while cooking), about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.
Serve turkey-spinach patties on buns with mayonnaise, onion, and pickles.
DO AHEAD: Patties can be formed 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before cooking.

Was pretty skeptical about this recipe that they wouldn't be juicy and that they'd hold together with all of the spinach sticking out in every direction. I followed the recipe exactly, they held together and are juicy and delicious.
I've made these many times, always to rave reviews. I usually follow the exact recipe, except I use thawed, well-squeezed spinach instead of fresh. They're even better as regular sized burgers. I think they stay moister that way.
Very tasty! I had them bunless and still very good. I saved to use again and again and RIGHT after I had them for dinner I forwarded the recipe to a friend - they were that delicious and such a nice change to the same old ground turkey meals.
Definitely the best turkey burger I've made at home. I usually don't like ground turkey because it's both bland and overly-turkey flavored at the same time. But these easy-to-make (I used thawed, well-drained frozen chopped spinach) sliders were delicious with sharp cheese and barbecue sauce on pretzel buns.
SF Bay Area
Probably the best turkey burger I've had. We made these as full-size burgers and they were juicy, flavorful, and just as satisfying as a classic beef burger. In an effort to get more veggies into our diets, I increased the spinach quite a bit—using a half pound for a double-batch. Made 8 large patties and grilled over charcoal."	<urn:uuid:6b8949dd-92c1-4d80-9a03-e442b8a31a6d>	0.0

As someone deeply interested in religious studies, I'm curious about how traditional Judaism views the relationship between human moral development and divine commandments. Can you explain their perspective on this?	"In his first speech as a Knesset member, Habayit Hayehudi
Chairman Naftali Bennett defended to Torah studies of the ultra-Orthodox community, but also stressed that ""serving in the army is a mitzvah.""
During his speech on Tuesday, Bennett focused on religious affairs and Jewish education. ""Let's admit to the truth: The religious services sector has become a machine that creates alienation. It's no wonder that one-third of all Israeli couples wed outside the rabbinate. Let's turn the religious services into a focal point that will illuminate the real Judaism to all of the people of Israel,""
he told the plenum.
""We must bring the beauty of Judaism to all the people of Israel. If children do not know who the forefathers of the nation were – Avraham, Moshe, David – and who Israel's heroes were – such as Yoni Netanyahu, Hannah Senesh, Judah Maccabee and Roi Klein – or what Friday night Kiddush is or how to recite ' Shema Yisrael,' – we will turn out next generation into a generation that has no compass, no path.
""Let's bring back the Jewish-Zionist education to all of Israel's children,"" Bennett said. ""These are our core studies, just as much as mathematics and English are. This is not a religious mission. It is an Israeli mission.""
The Habayit Hayehudi leader said Israelis must believe in the righteousness of their path, and alluded to the ""two states for two peoples"" paradigm. ""We must know that the land of our forefathers is not a piece of real estate, and that there is no need for me to speak of geo-strategic depth to explain why this is important to me.
""I live in Ra'anana and feel safe because my brothers protect me from the mountains of Binyamin and Samaria. There is no room in our divine little piece of land for another country. It won’t happen, but friends, before any discussion on the territories, it must be said that the Land of Israel belongs to the nation of Israel.""
Bennett continued to say that the next government has a ""historic opportunity to bring about real cooperation"" between all segments of Israeli society with regards to equal share of the national burden.
Addressing the universal draft debate, he said ""Studying Torah is an existential interest of the entire nation of Israel."	<urn:uuid:de1318ad-334f-4c16-8d5d-a2bb8c4e1935>	0.0
software development lead need comparison between integration testing error metrics vs quality metrics framework hierarchy for decision making	"The Proper Metrics
One of the major topics I teach at our financial analysis workshops and every Efficiency Sales Professional Boot Camp is how to use proper financial metrics. The difference between the simple metrics that most efficiency salespeople use and the proper metrics that efficiency sales professionals use can often mean the difference between hearing a “no” and a “yes.”
Unfortunately, your prospects may be very attached to popular, substandard metrics like simple payback period, return on investment, and internal rate of return. In some cases, they may even be resistant to proper metrics like net present value, modified internal rate of return, or savings-to-investment ratio because they don’t understand the calculations and would rather use what they already know.
When a prospect is using substandard metrics to drive capital budgeting decision-making – especially with expense-reducing capital projects – it's your job to play the adult in the relationship and to share with that person (in a “tough love” way if necessary) that those metrics are not going to serve them best.
Unless you know for a fact that your prospect is already using the right metrics to evaluate projects, it’s a good idea to include both “popular” and “proper” metrics on your financial summary spreadsheet. This will allow you to compare the metrics they are used to seeing with the ones you recommend they start using, and through that comparison, demonstrate why they should be using more advanced metrics to evaluate the project.

drywall repair versus primer application which process requires more coats for optimal results	"Read Roof Restoration Melbourne – The Complete Guide.
Peeling of Painted Colorbond or Metal Roof Tiles
Metal is more durable than any other roof material but also has a slightly different set of rules for painting. For metal roofs, the correct installation makes a much bigger difference than with tile roofs because they’re harder to repair. When one or more tiles crack, they can be replaced at practically no cost, but damage to a metal roof means the entire section should be replaced.
Why Metal Roofs Flake
In the best case scenario, the cause is merely that the primer and/or paint are incorrectly applied or that they had expired. Repainting a Colorbond roof requires experience and correct preparation to ensure the coating will not flake off.
In the worst case scenario, the cause is structural weakness of the roof or that it has approached the end of its usability cycle.
Even the slightest dents in the structure of the roof might mean that’s where water will pool. As soon as you have pooling water, it’s only a matter of time before it starts seeping beneath the paint, leading to flakes.
What To Do When Your Metal Roof Flakes
We suggest you don’t spend too much time or money on quick fixes. When a metal roof experiences flaking paint, it’s time for a serious do-over, not a quick fix that will again fail in a few months’ time. Metal roofs do not tolerate patch jobs, since the patching lines are where water can easily seep through the roof.
The roof should be stripped bare before applying a primer and then repainting. However, we recommend replacing the roof completely. This is because modern metal roofs are imbued with several durable coats of paint by the manufacturer, who regularly gives a lengthy warranty on the colour and the structural quality.
How To Prevent Flaking Metal Roof Paint
A good primer is the key to preventing metal roof paint from flaking but also the correct application of it.
The primer shouldn’t be thinned too much or the paint won’t stick. It should also complement the metal type by chemical composition to ensure the tightest possible bond. When the primer is done right, almost any kind of paint will stick to the roof, giving you unparalleled flexibility and durability.
The primer should dry out completely before paint is applied. The manufacturer’s instructions will often explain how to calculate drying time."	<urn:uuid:141d8f2a-c346-4ccf-9b63-d417f939fdf6>	0.0
Which dessert is traditionally eaten during Chinese New Year and Epiphany?	"Drinks / Dessert
16. Coconut Ice cream
Made from Thailand’s favorite ingredient coconut milk, this creamy, icy confection is best eaten on a hot day at Chatuchak. There are many vendors around Chatuchak which serve this, with a variety of toppings like sticky rice, corn, and crispy mung beans.
17. Mango Sticky Rice (Khao Niao Mamuang)
Mango Sticky Rice is a signature Thai dessert. We heard Platinum food court sells a kick ass one. Best eaten drizzled with coconut cream on top.
18. Belgian Waffle
Can be found at several BTS stations, we got ours at Platinum food court. Fresh off the griddle, the waffles are soft on the inside and slightly crisp on the outside encasing a generous amount of fillings. It’s so good (and cheap!!) that I’ve heard people pack these back to Singapore in large boxes.
19. Red Ruby (Tub Tim Krob)
Best eaten after a hot and spicy meal, this sweet and refreshing dessert is also found at street food stalls. The red rubies are actually crunchy water chestnut pieces and can be eaten with a variety of other ingredients like sweet potato pieces and tapioca. Commonly eaten with coconut milk, best with shaved ice.
20. Durian Sticky Rice (Khao Niaow Tu-rean)
Though not as popular a dessert as its mango counterpart, this is a definite must eat for durian lovers. Unlike the mango version, this is generously drowned in coconut milk so forget about your waistline for once and eat to your heart’s content.
21. Thai Iced Tea (Cha Yen)
Forget the pseudo versions you find in Singapore. The kick ass ones are found in Thailand, with a rich creamy unique flavor which Thai tea leaves impart. We LOVED the ones sold at Rod Fai night market, near the beef noodles stall at the food section near the main road. (Stall name: Bangkok Tea)
22. Toast with coconut custard
23. Butterfly Juice
Made with butterfly pea flower which is nutrient rich, this aesthetically pleasing drink is slightly sweet and tastes like the lemon barley we have during CNY. Great for quenching your thirst. This natural food coloring sauce is the same as the ones used to color nyonya kuehs/glutinous rice dumplings."	<urn:uuid:b35e31f8-6acd-4334-a5bb-a83211be6aab>	0.0
health benefits head covering brain function explained	"While the former refers to our ability to process the information fed to our mind, the latter is about the ability to express what we feel after processing the information. Mental health is about grabbing the best out of your brain. It’s about optimizing your brain to function the best under pressure. Mental health in simple language is a wholesome term to define our brain health. Emotional fitness is one of the aspects that regulate mental fitness.
Importance Of Emotional Fitness
Emotional fitness is an essential part of our overall health. When they say, a healthy mind and body perform the best in the hours of disparity, they are no wrong. Emotional health impacts the way in which we perceive information. The overwhelmed mind makes our subconscious mind chaotic and we fail to control ourselves. It affects our decision-making ability because we fail to process the information accurately.
Being emotionally sick, we wouldn’t be able to cope with life’s challenges. Every new hardship would be a setback to use. Being healthy emotionally, we can control our thoughts, behaviors, and feelings. It is thus, the need of the hour to work our way towards attaining optimum health physically, mentally, and emotionally.

Benefits Of Emotional Fitness
Mankind is a selfish being. It never does things without benefits. Exercise is a powerful tool that could reap the effects that the best medicines fail to do. The benefits which induce can never be found anywhere else. Some of the benefits of emotional fitness are as follows:
- Reduced stress
- Sleep better
- Optimistic thoughts
- Increased happiness
- Increased self-confidence
- Alleviation of anxiety
- Increased cognitive function
- More energy
Mental Exercises To Improve Emotional Fitness
When practiced regularly, a set of simple exercises can pave the way for a better life. Given below is a list of a few easy exercises that will lead you toward a healthier, stronger, and balanced emotional life.
- Attention Training: Improving attention is the first and foremost task in hand for an emotional health regime. It is because attention is the doorway to the mind. Not just attention, we need to learn to keep our attention on optimism not otherwise. The best way to train attentional muscles is mindfulness.
- Eliminate Negative Thinking: We see things the way we think. Try to focus more on the light than the darkness."	<urn:uuid:841f3b45-f6d0-4fcf-86de-134d247ab547>	0.0
What is the required body length proportion for male Great Danes?	"One of the joys of this breed is the variety of styles seen in the breed, but any variations must always be assessed in consideration of the breed standard. This is a hands-on breed, requiring careful examination under the coat for structural reference points in order to adequately assess qualities that may be altered by creative grooming or obscured by excessive coat. Judges should ensure they place hands under the coat to feel for the forechest, tip of shoulder blades, length of upper arm, depth of body to the elbows, tight fitting elbows, good length and spring of rib, short, deep loin, bend of stifle, hindquarter muscle mass and correct tail set and length.
Size, Proportion and Substance
The judge’s initial impression of the Golden Retriever should be a dog of moderation and over-all balance. There is a disqualification for size, with no exemption for puppies. The standard has a disqualification for deviation in height more than one inch over or under the prescribed size range. Many puppies do not reach the minimum size by six months of age and judges should not hesitate to measure suspected over-sized or under-sized exhibits.
The standard calls for a proportion ratio of 11:12 based on the height from withers to ground and length from prosternum to seat bone. To the average eye, this is only slightly off square. The distance from withers to elbow and elbow to ground should be approximately equal. Many Goldens today are lacking the correct proportions and appear long and lower to the ground than what the standard requires. Length in the body should come from a well developed rib cage which extends well back, as the Golden should be relatively short-coupled and not long in loin.
The head is one of the hallmarks of the breed. Correct head structure is important to the retrieving function of the breed, relating to vision, scenting and carrying of the game. The head should be clean cut with a broad, slightly arched skull and a definite stop. The skull and the deep, wide, slightly tapering muzzle have nearly parallel planes, with the muzzle nearly as long as the skull. Strong muzzles and back-skulls are necessary for carrying heavy game, as a large goose can weigh 10 to 12 pounds.
Full dentition is preferred, with a scissors bite. Undershot or overshot mouths are a disqualification."	<urn:uuid:47d7f7c8-2cba-4f91-a8fe-eb17ee9c865f>	0.0

I've been reading about unexplained phenomena in cosmic ray detection, and I'm wondering what's currently known about the mysterious high-energy cosmic rays that go beyond the 'knee' in the spectrum?	"Direct measurements of the EBL are very difficult due to the intense zodiacal light and the Galactic foreground emission. High-energy gamma rays may interact with photons of the EBL and generate positron-electron pairs. This introduces an attenuation feature in the spectra of distant gamma-ray sources that has been used in the past to set upper limits on the opacity of the Universe and the energy density of the EBL. In this talk, we will report the first detection of an absorption feature seen in the combined spectra of a sample of gamma-ray blazars detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) out to a redshift of z>1.6. This feature is caused by attenuation of gamma rays by the EBL at optical to UV frequencies, and points to a minimal level of EBL, consistent with the observed star formation rate and with low-opacity EBL models. We will present the Fermi observations and discuss the implications for the generation of a diffuse UV background at high redshifts. We will also discuss recent measurements of the (nIR) EBL and present the prospects for a refined measurement of the EBL up to higher redshifts.
Successes and Limitations of Cosmological N-body Simulations
In this talk I will discuss recent advances in simulating the spatial distribution and properties of galaxies in the Universe. I will start by showing how numerical simulations will help us to understand and exploit the precise measurements of upcoming galaxy
surveys. As an example of this, I will discuss the predicted distortions in the baryonic acoustic oscillation signal when it is measured in the galaxy distribution. In the second part of my talk, I will discuss some limitations of N-body simulations and how some
results might be misleading due to numerical artifacts. As an example of this, I will discuss the case of Warm Dark Matter cosmologies and I will present a possible solution to these problems.

What are the main symptoms of IBS?	"Releasing Anger To Ease Your Symptoms
Anger is a funny thing. It's useful by letting us know that something’s happened that we’re strongly displeased about. But holding onto anger for any length of time has little benefit. That's because it keeps us stuck in a place of negativity that holds us back and prevents us moving forward.
This same pattern happens when you get angry because something triggers your IBS. And it doesn't matter whether it was caused by something you did or by someone else.
Now I’m not saying that you should never get angry or annoyed about IBS. Severe gut symptoms, overwhelming pain, and the impact this has on your life are certainly annoying. So feeling angry is normal.
And sometimes the anger can even be helpful, at least after it first happens. Anger is a primal emotion that can help you to judge the severity of the situation and the importance of an event. So feeling anger after your IBS is triggered focuses your attention and forces you to reflect on what may have triggered your symptoms. And if you can work out what the trigger was, you can then take steps to avoid this trigger in the future.
So, anger can be a useful emotion for helping you to manage IBS.
But anger is only useful if you release it after it’s served its purpose.
Using anger wisely
The problem with anger arises when you hold onto it for longer than is necessary. When you keep replaying the cause of the anger over and over in your mind, refusing to let go of the frustration. It’s especially problematic when it goes on for hours or days after the event is over. When this happens, anger doesn’t serve you, but instead becomes a hindrance.
Since IBS can be made worse by stressful emotions, the negativity of anger can impact your symptoms and make them worse.
This is something I’ve experienced firsthand many times. Most of my anger used to be directed at myself. Back when I used to believe that I was causing my IBS, I would get angry at myself every time it got triggered. I’d berate myself for first causing the symptoms, then I’d get angrier because I couldn’t stop the symptoms either. The anger would spiral out of control and things would get even worse.
But even after I realized that my IBS was not all in my head, I’d still get angry at myself if my symptoms were triggered."	<urn:uuid:9107fb0c-3a66-47db-97e9-c7c4f5250942>	0.0
How do traffic conditions affect fuel usage and driver anger?	"For media companies, a reliance on the company as a driver of traffic has proved an unreliable business model, given that it can change what it prioritizes in its News Feed at any time.

drug delivery nano systems cardiovascular disease treatment	"“Global Nano Chemotherapy Market and Clinical Trials Outlook 2022” report highlights the current development in the in the field of nano chemotherapy. Report gives comprehensive insight on various clinical and non-clinical parameters associated with the expansion of global nano chemotherapeutics market. The clinical and pricing insight on chemotherapeutics nanoformulations of approved drugs helps to understand the current market scenario of the nano chemotherapeutics.
Nano chemotherapy is emerging as an important anti-cancer modality by supplementing the traditional chemotherapy. The main aim of nano chemotherapeutics is to improve the therapeutic efficacy of currently available chemotherapeutic agents by combining it with a nano scale delivery component. The majority of the cancer nanodrugs in the market are liposomes and polymer based nanoformulations which lower the toxicity and enhance the delivery of chemotherapeutics through the passive targeting. It is based on enhanced penetration and retention effect to reduce the lymphatic drainage in tumor tissue.
Conventional chemotherapeutic agents are distributed non-specifically in body where they affect both cancerous and normal cells and thereby it limit the dose availability with in the tumor and also results in suboptimal treatment due to excessive toxicities. To overcome the limitations of chemotherapy treatment, many more therapies has also been emerged.
The use of nanoparticles by both passive and active targeting strategies can enhance the intracellular concentration of drugs in cancer cells while avoiding the toxicity in normal cells. When the nanoparticles bind to a specific receptors and then enter the cell, usually enveloped by endosomes through receptor mediated endocytosis and thereby bypassing the recognition of P glycoprotein.
Nanomedicine has already met with success in oncology domain with various product commercially available in the market. By releasing the efficacy of nanomedicine in oncology, it increases the interest of the market players to commercialize the products in the field of nanotherapeutics and helps to increase the global market. The future of nanotherapeutics is bright and especially for the reversible cross linked nano carriers which are decorated with the cancer targeting ligands and it promote the endocytic uptake in tumor cells. The approach has the potential to overcome the drug resistance which is often with conventional chemotherapies.
For the next generation cancer nanotherapeutics, the complexity is higher which are under clinical development in terms of hybrid structures, surface physiochemical characteristics and mechanisms of delivery and action. There have been rapid advances in the nano therapeutic field in the past decade."	<urn:uuid:1df1800d-4899-4991-b9be-b4b54c557408>	0.0
What are the immediate environmental effects of hurricanes on coastal marshes, and how do these areas help reduce financial losses from storm damage?	"First, although the intensity of a hurricane depends on many factors, warmer seawater tends to promote stronger storms. Average sea surface temperatures have been rising, and some parts of the North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico are warmer than average at the moment, which is a key reason why both Harvey and Irma became so strong so quickly.
Second, a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapour, which can result in heavier rainfall. That is true not only for hurricanes but also for weaker storms across the world. Even relatively mild tropical storms can cause great damage by dropping huge volumes of rain over one area.
Third, apart from strong winds and heavy rainfall, hurricanes cause damage through storm surges as their winds push seawater ahead of them. Storm surges can inundate extensive low-lying coastal areas, sweeping away everything in their path. Sea levels have been gradually rising globally, making storm surges bigger and deadlier.
Scientists are still not sure about the other ways in which climate change may be impacting hurricanes. The main reason Harvey created such extreme flooding around Houston was that it stalled over the city and dumped rain for several days without moving on. We do not know if climate change played a role in creating the atmospheric conditions that made that happen.
Nor can we yet predict whether climate change will affect the number of hurricanes that occur every year. Some studies have suggested that while numbers will drop, strengths will increase.
Also uncertain is how natural climate variability affects hurricanes. Numbers have increased markedly in the North Atlantic since the 1990s, but this seems to be due, at least partly, to large-scale changes in ocean circulation that occur over many years or decades.
However, it is clear that the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans will be at risk if Trump and his administration continue to deny the existence of climate change and its impact on the threat posed by hurricanes.

trying to save my houseplants need help what color light wavelengths do plants use	"Everything you need to care for your houseplants
When you have a beautiful houseplant, you want to keep it beautiful and for that it is important that you use the right products. There are handy moisture meters, for instance, that help you water your plants in time. But also think about plant food, potting soil, substrate and pest control. Some accessories actually make taking care of your plants easier, while others contribute to growing healthier houseplants.
To this day, most houseplants always die from excess water. This is a shame and often very simple to prevent with a handy water meter.
The best soil
Not every houseplant thrives on universal houseplant soil; succulents like airy soil, orchids thrive on bark and most other houseplants prefer a substrate like Lechuza-Pon. The soil you put your plant in, that is the base and that is where it should take root. The better the base is, the stronger your plant will become. We have written a blog about Zeoponic, a professional substrate with great advantages, which is suitable for almost all houseplants.
In nature, old leaves swirl off plants and fall to the ground, where they slowly decompose. This creates new nutrition for the plants and you actually have a kind of cycle. Unfortunately, this doesn't work in the home and plant feeding is often necessary to keep your houseplants in good condition.
Did you know that many planters are not waterproof at all? This often results in moisture penetration after a while, causing circles on your floor, cupboard or table. When you buy a new flower pot, it often comes with a label that tells you whether your new acquisition is 100% waterproof or whether you need to use an insert sleeve."	<urn:uuid:825abde9-62fe-4c12-8080-21e9956d2546>	0.0
military expert wondering what role battlefield smoke from musket gunpowder influenced development standardized army uniforms	"Army uniforms of the Wehrmacht in the Second World War.
In the German army there were two kinds of uniform: standard uniforms, which were issued by the Wehrmacht, or from the wearer personally at their own or state-cost tailor-made uniforms.
During the peace period and even during the first year of the war, tailor-made uniforms were often used by officers, but as these were found to be impractical, uncomfortable, and expensive to replace in combat, more and more standard uniforms were used.
The field-gray standard uniform was standardized in the army and consisted of the basic components steel helmet, side cap, field blouse, covering coat, trousers and march boots.
Mountain troops were given the same uniform, but the side cap was replaced by a mountain cap, as well as the pants and boots by long, baggy trousers with elastic leggings at ankles and mountain boots.
Mounted members of the army were represented not only in the cavalry, but mainly in the mass of the units, which still depended on horses for transport or reconnaissance. These men were given leather riding pants and heavy riding boots.
A special black uniform for the crews of closed combat vehicles was also introduced in 1935. This uniform consisted of a black, padded beret, which also served as a protective helmet, a two-breasted jacket and long baggy trousers.
This uniform, which was worn at first just with the vehicle, was at the same time practical and popular. The black color, which was supplemented by a silver skull insignia on the beret, had a dramatic appearance and added a little bit to the esprit of the young arm. Thus from the beginning of 1940, this uniform was issued to the crews of the self-propelled guns in a field-gray version.
Nevertheless, there were not enough uniforms to completely equip the strong-growing German army. This led to the Germans using the captured uniforms of the Austrian, Czechoslovak, and Polish armies. These were sorted, stored, released from the respective national insignia and temporarily issued to German conscripts in order to bridge the deficiency.
The most important method of determining the rank of a member of the German army was through the system of the shoulder straps, which showed not only the rank of the wearer, but also the arm of service, formation, and status.
In addition, officers were recognized by their headgear, the peaked cap with silver chin cords, or a side cap with silver piping and the brown leather equipment."	<urn:uuid:51c7908d-2ea8-4955-8ce9-f6becae20648>	0.0
bpmn epc rules events notation difference	"For human style BPM which uses diagram to depict the actions of organizational members, instead of servers, may find that the additional complexity of BPMN 2.0 only adds additional complexity without sufficient benefit to the users. I guess that is what Jim means by “Burn Baby Burn”.
Time will tell, but Jim Sinur points to the most likely and reasonable solution and that is that products will continue to offer multiple modeling notations to meet the needs of the various users.
Are Business Users Too Lazy?
It would be arrogant to suggest that business users just need to hunker down and learn BPMN to be effective. This would be like arguing that a graphical user interface is not needed if only users would take the time to learn to use a command line interface.
The counter point is that business people are so busy taking care of business, that they don’t have time or inclination to learn a programming language. The point that Jim is making is that the capabilities that BPMN is providing, is simply not fit for use by business people. Not that business people are too dumb or lazy. About thinking that everyone wants to become a programmer, he says “It is this IT arrogance that could sink BPM technologies.”
In light of the discussion that has resulted from the above post, let me add a few clarifications for the readers encountering this post fresh:
- I used the term “Business Professional” to mean a typical worker in a typical office. Clearly there are many specialties including process analysts and programmers. Process analysts and programmers are not typical business professionals. I mean to speak about the vast majority of business professionals, and not the relatively few exceptions.
- I never say that BPMN is useless. To the contrary, I say that it is useful for programmers and other specialists like business process analysts. I have traditionally been one of the biggest supporters of BPMN. Since 2005 I have been regularly giving presentation and tutorials on the benefits of BPMN. Still, the preponderance of the evidence is that the majority of business professionals do not gain enough benefit to make it worth their while to learn about it.
- When I say that BPMN is not useful to the typical worker in the workplace, that is not necessarily a bad thing, nor is this an insult. Everything that has a purpose, has such only in specific situations. I am simply pointing out that BPMN, contrary to a lot of the misinformation spread around, is not useful for a typical office worker."	<urn:uuid:c317804c-c09a-419b-a931-f60dfc068364>	0.0
advantages draining water pipes versus leaving faucets running winter vacation home	"No Water Dispensing From Hot Side of Faucet? (Here's a Fix)
Whether you’re doing the dishes, taking a shower, or simply washing your hands, having hot water in your home is essential. If there’s no hot water coming out of your faucet, you could be facing a major dilemma.
The main reason that water won’t come out of the hot water tap is that the water heater is leaking. Hot water won’t come out of your faucet if your pipes are frozen or if the diverter valve is stuck and damaged. Your faucet may not dispense hot water if you haven’t flushed your water tank in over 3 years.
We’re going to take a look at all of the different things that could be causing this issue. There are easy fixes to get hot water up and running again in your home. Let’s dive into the factors that could be causing the disruption.
Check Every Faucet
The first thing you’ll want to do is check all the faucets in your home to see if hot water will come out of any of them. Sometimes a single faucet can get clogged, causing a block in the flow of water.
If the water temperature is fine, the problem lies in your faucet itself. If it’s a major problem, calling a plumber to get the job done for you may be the easiest solution.
Just Getting Cold Water
If there’s no hot water coming out of the designated side of the faucet, it could be your water heater. This is especially true if the cold side is working just fine. Water heaters malfunction for a number of different reasons.
There could be a leak, a sediment build-up, or it could’ve just come unplugged. Flush the water heater, allow it to heat up, and try the faucet again. No worries, there are details on how to flush the water heater later on.
Look for Frozen Pipes
If you live in a state that experiences brutal winters, you’ll be well aware of what frozen pipes can do. They can stop water from flowing to all of the faucets in your home. If you’re not getting hot or cold water or just lukewarm water, this could be the culprit.
You’ll need to have the pipes thawed out before the water will start coming out of the faucet again. To unfreeze the pipes, you could use a hairdryer or a heat gun."	<urn:uuid:c99743f1-d2eb-49cd-858a-be8eb1dc6433>	0.0
behavioral health researcher looking for gender differences depression workplace burnout stages treatment methods	"The efficacy of depression treatment while treating addiction
Many people who are addicted to drugs are also diagnosed with co-occuring mental health disorders… and vice versa. So, with depression fast becoming the #1 mental health issue in the U.S., can you treat depression and addiction at the same time?
How does treatment for depression work in tandum with treatment for addiction? Are the current methods effective? More insight here, with a section for your questions at the end.
What is depression treatment?
Treatment for depression usually involves a combination of medicines, talk or psychotherapy, and self-help. Therapies help by teaching new ways of thinking and behaving and changing habits that may be contributing to the depression. Therapy can also help you understand and work through difficult situations or relationships that may be causing your depression or making it worse.
Again, depression is a treatable illness. The majority of people diagnosed with depressive disorders improve when they receive appropriate treatment. The first step to getting treatment is a physical examination by a doctor to rule out other possible causes for symptoms. Next, you’ll need a diagnostic evaluation for depression. Depending on the type of depression diagnosed, medication and psychotherapy may be recommended.
What is depression treatment like?
Most likely, depression is caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Therefore, depression treatment is usually a combination of intensive talk therapy and medications.
Many studies have shown that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a particularly effective treatment for depression. CBT is usually administered in one-on-one counseling sessions, once or twice per week that last about one (1) hour. Lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise will also be a part of the regimen.
Further, there are almost thirty (30) different kinds of antidepressants currently used to treat depression. Treatment may be a series of trials over the period of weeks or months until you find the right combination of medications for your needs.
Benefits of depression treatment for addiction
The main benefits of addressing depression and addiction at the same time include resolving some of the main symptoms assiciated with these mental disorders."	<urn:uuid:7e0748f9-bb5a-4dcb-9686-029613658352>	0.0

What security measures should be taken for parking and vehicle safety?	"Improving school security
There’s no sure way to put a cost on a human life, yet we attempt to put a price to it almost daily; whether determining the extent of medical treatment; engineering vehicles we drive; or taking steps to thwart the actions of a sick man like the one who mowed down 20 children and six adults at the Sandy Hook School.
At some point we question that, while extra treatments and medication may lengthen a life, whether what is gained in time is offset by what is lost of quality of life. Cost enters this discussion, too.
Cost is often the driver in motor vehicle engineering. Safety is a valid marketing consideration, but there’s a point where we’re prepared to take the risk even as we know the possible consequences. Otherwise, we would all be driving tanks.
The same can be asked of the safety of our children.
In response to the Newtown massacre, the National Rifle Association CEO, Wayne LaPierre, suggested all schools should have armed guards. At least one community in Arizona has followed his advice and armed parents, on a volunteer basis, to watch over schools.
Here, the response has been more tempered. Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney, Mayor Scott Avedisian and acting School Superintendent Richard D’Agostino don’t favor armed school guards, whether they are members of the Warwick Police Department or contracted security personnel.
D’Agostino implemented a policy of locking elementary school doors and has been reviewing security at secondary schools. This is a reasoned approach, and one within the existing capabilities and resources of the department.
Will it stop a Newtown tragedy?
There’s no way of knowing, although, as those who want more security will point out, the doors at Sandy Hook were locked. An armed guard would have probably made the difference in that case. That said, we agree with Pilgrim Principal Marie Cote that, regardless of all the measures that can be taken, someone who is determined will find a way to do it.
In weighing the options, we need not only consider child safety and security, but also the environment we are creating. Schools need to be safe places, not forts. Vigilance is a part of the equation. We all need to be sensitive to what is happening around us and how it impacts us. Good drivers do that all the time. But, do we seriously want to drive tanks to make us safer on our highways? Do we seriously want our kids attending armored schools? That’s not a direction for our schools."	<urn:uuid:52847589-3984-498e-abab-1bf0208df4cb>	0.0
human body systems movement expression creative dance compare metabolic effects sedentary behavior	"As outlined in the aims of the present study, the primary outcomes will explore the effects of the intervention on postprandial glucose/insulin responses (pre–post) and energy balance – reflected by changes in resting metabolic rate (pre–post), physical activity energy expenditure (monitoring–intervention) and postprandial thermogenesis (pre–post). Secondary outcomes will explore changes from pre- to post-intervention in body composition, substrate oxidation, lipid profile, leptin concentration, c-reactive protein concentration, adipose tissue gene expression, postprandial lipaemia and postprandial appetite regulation/perception. In addition, differences in physical activity intensity and dietary composition between the monitoring and intervention phases will be examined. As it is not the objective of this study to compare these differences between the cohorts, two sets of analyses will be conducted on a per protocol basis -– one for the lean cohort and one for the overweight/obese cohort. Both will centre upon a two-way mixed model analysis of variance featuring a factor for diet allocation and a factor for time-point. This will permit an examination of the effect of each diet on the outcomes of interest (i.e. pre vs. post/monitoring vs. intervention) and whether this effect varied between the three dietary conditions. Pre-existing differences between groups at baseline will be examined using a one-way analysis of variance featuring a factor for diet allocation. Significant differences emerging from these tests will be explored using appropriate post-hoc tests to adjust for multiple comparisons and isolate the source(s) of variance. In addition to these analyses at the group level, individual responses will also be closely scrutinised to examine whether outliers could be affecting the interpretation. Further analysis, such as sub-group analysis, may also be conducted in light of patterns emerging in the final dataset. Baseline characteristics of participants who withdraw during the intervention will also be compared against the final population using t tests. Statistical significance will be accepted at P < 0.05.
Despite the growing popularity of IMF , research exploring its effects on human metabolism remains scarce. The novel examination of postprandial responses and the components of energy balance being employed in this study will highlight the extent to which IMF regimes can impact human metabolism. The isocaloric contrast of IMF and daily calorie restriction will also add a further dimension by thoroughly benchmarking IMF against current nutritional strategies for improving metabolic health."	<urn:uuid:ef20cfe6-3f3c-45c0-b724-72966010a3b0>	0.0

After you have chosen the dental clinic or dentist you wish to visit, you should then schedule a visit for an initial consultation with the dentist Adelaide who will be taking care of your dental needs. This is the best time to get a feel for how easy they are when it comes to communication.
Ask them about any questions regarding the method of treatment and what type of procedures they offer at the clinic. Also, clarify if the dentist will be cleaning your teeth every time you go for a checkup, or it will be done only upon your request. The bottom line is getting a dentist who can take good care of both you and your family. Also, be sure to check if they offer emergency dental services.

The Business License Application costs $19 (one-time fee ). The registrations with the departments are free, however, the Business License Application also includes what are called Specialty Endorsements and City Endorsements. Those will cost extra and will also need to be renewed each year.
Does an LLC have to be renewed every year?
The LLC annual fee is an ongoing fee paid to the state to keep your LLC in compliance and in good standing. It’s usually paid every 1 or 2 years, depending on the state. This fee is required , regardless of your LLC’s income or activity. Said another way: you have to pay this.
What comes first LLC or business license?
Think of it this way: getting an LLC is the first step and creates a legal foundation for the business . A business license gives you the right to operate. Depending on what kind of business you have and where you live, you may need to get business licenses from your state, county, or town.
Does an LLC have to have insurance?

Should I form an LLC or sole proprietorship?
While the Sole Proprietorship is the simplest and most popular form of business start up, it may not provide entrepreneurs with the legal and tax advantages that an LLC does.

"The financial support of any children — both during marriage or after divorce — rests solely with the father. This is the children's right upon their father, and courts have the power to enforce child support payments, if necessary. The amount is open for negotiation and should be in proportion with the husband's financial means.
The Quran advises the husband and wife to consult each other in a fair manner regarding their children's future after divorce (2:233). This verse specifically holds that infants who are still nursing may continue to breastfeed until both parents agree on the period of weaning through ""mutual consent and counsel."" This spirit should define any co-parenting relationship.
Islamic law stipulates that physical custody of the children must go to a Muslim who is in good physical and mental health, and is in the best position to meet the children's needs. Different jurists have established various opinions of how this might best be done. Some have ruled that custody is awarded to the mother if the child is under a certain age, and to the father if the child is older. Others would allow older children to express a preference. Generally, it is recognized that young children and girls are best cared for by their mother.
Since there are differences of opinion among Islamic scholars about child custody, one might find variations in local law. In all cases, however, the main concern is that the children are cared for by a fit parent who can meet their emotional and physical needs."	<urn:uuid:9e07aa64-fd20-4848-a8fc-160c7f0da3dd>	0.0
What makes gophers come into people's yards and gardens in the first place?	"In the second overtime, the Wildcats (4-3, 2-2) scored once more, undramatically on Brandon Roberson's 6-yard run, but the Gophers came back to pull within one on a Weber option.
Here Gophers went for two points and the victory with Weber rolling right and eyeing the end zone as Wildcats linebacker Adam Kadela rolled with him and eyed his running back. Weber was Kadela's responsibility, so when he saw that back blocking, he charged and got a hand on Weber before he slipped off. But by then defensive tackle John Gill had come from the backside and he hit Weber as he threw a pass that nose-dived to the ground near none of his receivers.
""My team deserved to win,"" Gophers coach Tim Brewster said. ""That's why I went for it. I felt 100 percent we'd get two.""
But that triumph, implausibly, went instead to the Wildcats, who survived again behind Bacher and with a mettle that proved as unyielding as tempered steel.
He completed 41 of 58 passes for 470 yards and four touchdowns with no interceptions. The Wildcats, in turn, ran their overtime record to 7-0 in Big Ten games and 8-1 overall. He also produced when the heat was hottest and converted each of the three fourth-down situations he faced, twice for touchdowns.
""We don't really like [close games] until they're over,"" Bacher said. ""We've had a few now that have been fun. But we'd like to play better in the first half and not have to face those situations.""
Kadela was apologetic.
""It is a little stressful,"" he said. ""You know, it's fun to be part of these games. [But] we don't want to be part of them. But we have been, and you have to take them in stride."""	<urn:uuid:c7b0edf4-784c-46f2-beb6-0df8a04b09ae>	0.0
What's good about eating farmed mussels?	"Instead, a shift took place: Larger mussels and barnacles suffered, leaving smaller barnacles and some calcium-based seaweeds better off.
In nature, ""species are competing for space, they are eating each other, it's an incredibly dynamic system,"" said James Forester, a Harvard University ecologist who co-authored the study in this week's journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
""When you change the playing field—in this case by altering acidity—you can get unexpected responses,"" he said.
""Mussels usually dominate the ecosystem because they are good at overgrowing and crushing out other species that grow on the rocks,"" said co-author Wootton.
""But when the mussels decline, it means other species—no matter whether or not they have a shell—can do better,"" he said.
Nancy Knowlton is a marine biology professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, who was not involved in the study.
She pointed out the importance of adopting this ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" approach when trying to understand how various shelled species respond to ocean acidification.
An acidity-driven shift in coastal ecosystems could spell disaster for shellfish industries that rely on mussels and other similar species, Wootton warned.
A Wider Pattern?
While the field surveys did show an overall decline in mussels, the predictive models were needed to hunt for longer-term changes.
""There is inertia in the system because many of these species live for a long time,"" said co-author Wooton.
""The little changes we see in the dynamics of the ecosystem may magnify over time.""
These are the first data on ocean acidity from temperate—rather than tropical—waters. No one knows whether similar rapid changes are taking place elsewhere.
""The rules might be quite different on Tatoosh Island,"" Wootton suggested.
""There could be mechanisms going on in the waters around our island that are unique.
""We really need to get more data from other sites away from the equator to see what patterns are there,"" he added.
Marine biologist Knowlton said, ""This is typical of so many climate studies—almost without exception things are turning out to be worse than we originally thought.""

My basement feels damp lately. What problems could this cause?	"Let me tell you something, dear Internet. This summer? Been kind of rough. So by the time Pasha got sick and ruined the rugs, only to be followed by our basement flooding, I was well worn out. Lately, life feels too short and too fragile to be so fully occupied by such disasters. So, in a manner unfamiliar to me…
I bought a ticket to California.
(and new rugs).
I leave for a week next month. (J. will stay home to man the homefront, water the garden, care for the pup, and miss me terribly, I presume). Any recommendations for sight seeing in San Diego and LA?
I’m sure, oh so sure, that you have been awaiting news about my garden and summer crop yields and about what critters have returned to terrorize or be terrorized (yes?). It may be long neglected here on the blog, but in real life, the garden still claims a portion of my (ever-shrinking) free time and a larger portion of my should-be-doing-something-else-time (like writing papers!).
So here’s a quick (maybe?) summary of the Cottage’s Farm, although mind you that I wrote this more than a week ago, so things look slightly larger and a bit thirstier these days.
Before the heat wave melted our faces off, I’d spend the 5-6 PM hour weeding + watering + harvesting + hollering at John to look at this insert-something-amazing-here!, which he’d typically ignore, bless him, and then we’d do this:
But it’s been so hot that mostly I’ve been ignoring the dear plants until the sun goes down and then I would water them, usually while wearing my pjs, meaning I developed a charming habit of climbing into bed slightly damp, smelling of tomato plants. I’m lovely.
What are we eating, you’re asking? Well, we’re thigh-high in zucchini season. Despite best efforts, I can never spot my zukes until they are the size of my arm. And, oh my, the banana peppers! Always the over achievers. My green peppers will barely look at me, and here my banana peppers are simply spitting fruit all over the place. If I were in class and my garden were a dysfunctional family unit, I’d label the banana pepper plant the hero child.

Working in culinary education, I've noticed many students struggle with basic cooking skills. How do essential cooking techniques like knife skills and meal prep specifically support the nutritional needs of seniors?	"Being a chef is not the job for everyone. Chefs have to be passionate, practiced, and talented, and it can sometimes be difficult to know whether or not the culinary art is the career choice that you want. If you’re thinking about becoming a chef, here are the logistical steps you need to take.
- Find Out if the Culinary Arts is Your Passion
Whether you’re a young person trying to figure out your next step after high school or a person stuck in a career looking for a new one, it’s important to really find out if you’re passionate enough about cooking to work in kitchens for a long time to come. The first step is to practice cooking and experimenting on your own, and maybe even get a job as a cook in a restaurant that doesn’t require a culinary arts education.
- Decide Which Culinary Arts Program is Best for You
Once you’ve decided to pursue the culinary arts, it’s time to start looking at the various types of programs offered out there. You may want to specialize in a type of food, like sushi, or you may want a more well-rounded approach to cooking. Either way, do your research, and find the school for you.
- Attend Culinary Arts School
If you want to make cooking a profession rather than just a job, you need to actually get an education. Culinary Arts schools mold amateur cooks into highly trained professionals. You’ll learn all of the skills you need to work and run a kitchen, and at a top notch program, you’ll get the opportunity to learn from the best of the best.
- Get an Internship
Many culinary arts programs may require you to get an internship in a big restaurant. It’s important to not only learn about various culinary methods, but to also hone and refine your skills. Working in an actual restaurant while you’re still working on your education will help you do this.
- Get Certified
The American Culinary Federation offers standardized certifications for chefs practicing in the culinary arts. Chefs who go through a certification program end up earning 7% more than chefs who did not. An ACF certification will help you get better jobs, and it’ll ensure that your skills match the national standard.
- Look for Jobs
After you graduate from a culinary arts program, it’s time to look for a job."	<urn:uuid:82afc161-3098-44ad-865f-5560443109a7>	0.0
pilots landing gear canyon facts dangers	"Pointing to river rocks that Marines have taken from the Helmand and spread over the landing zone, Major Will Grant explains that the improvised surface has created better visibility for landing here.
Once all passengers and their gear have been stowed, the Osprey again rises straight up into the sky.
The Marines of VMM-261 understand their place in V-22 history. The squadron’s experiences, particularly combat deployments, will have far-reaching consequences, and the squadron’s suggestions will help determine not only what hardware gets used, but also potential software upgrades.
“We are going to write a whole new chapter in Osprey employment out here,” says Colonel George Amland, deputy commander of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade. He acknowledges the great strides made by the three MV-22 deployments to Iraq, but notes that the two theaters have many differences. As planners at VMM-261 develop a mission that will take the Osprey from Bastion to the Pakistani border, 850 miles round trip, Amland comments on the Osprey’s benefits.
“The Osprey can collapse the battlespace, and go into areas that are not suitable for landing a [KC]-130J,” he says. And because helicopters are transported to Afghanistan as cargo on a C-5, and the Osprey arrives there under its own power, it can free “a tremendous amount of strategic lift by self-deploying,” says Amland.
The squadron has 10 Ospreys, and missions usually run four to six hours, with some lasting as long as eight. Both aviators and ground crew serve either day or night shifts, but as missions change, flights are often extended, and day pilots often “hot seat” with night pilots, meaning the pilots and crew just swap places while the MV-22 refuels, and the aircraft never shuts down. The squadron is preparing for the coming troop surge, and that, along with the regular day-to-day resupply and delivery operations, keeps the Ospreys running round the clock, 18 or 20 hours straight, requiring maintenance crews to perform basic fixes in between “hops” with the proprotors spinning above them.
The history of the V-22 used to bother Staff Sergeant Brian Freeman. He rejoined the Marine Corps after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, hoping to return to a CH-46 squadron, but his only option was an Osprey unit."	<urn:uuid:00e8b1ab-7eb7-4a3b-a6a7-07ed3b22a3e1>	0.0
How did generational knowledge transfer work in religious versus secular institutions?	"In fact, in one of them, it is precisely stated that it shall be State’s responsibility to protect the choice of faith of every individual. This was in third century B.C. Tolerance as State policy was necessary in India not only because of religious diversity. It is necessary also because of the vast array of diversity that exists in terms of language, cultures, traditions etc. A definition of secularism, which is the most appropriate in the Indian context, is, thus, not confined only to the issue of separation of religion from the State and politics. While this is important in itself, secularism in the Indian context also should mean the right of equality and opportunity to all languages, cultures, traditions to co-exist and thrive without the fear of domination of any one by the other.
Looking at the issue in this manner would immediately suggest that secularism and democracy in India are inseparable. The protection of the rights of minorities of all variety (religious, linguistic etc) is an integral part of democracy. Religious or linguistic intolerance impinges, therefore, upon not only secularism but also democracy.
Hence, any attack on secularism in India is also simultaneously an attack on democracy and democratic institutions. It is, therefore, no coincidence that rabid Hindu communalism that today, albeit temporarily, controls the reins of power, targets not only the secular foundations by spreading the hatred of religious intolerance but also attacks democratic institutions. The efforts to re-write the Indian Constitution, the strident cries for a presidential form of government – all are part of the larger jigsaw puzzle to facilitate the establishment of a “Hindu Rashtra”.
The attempts to re-write Indian history and to doctor the educational system on communal lines must also be seen in the same light. Much of Dr. Zakir Husain’s life and work related to this field. He would have been aghast at the travesty of history that is currently being undertaken by the communal forces.
It is, indeed, unfortunate that this assault on India’s secular democracy comes in the name of religion. By now, it is clear that religious fundamentalism of all variety, Taliban or Saffron, has very little to do with religion or religiosity. It is purely an attempt to consolidate political power by misusing religion.
Seeking your indulgence, I think it necessary to digress and put at rest a great deal of controversy that has always existed regarding the Marxist understanding of religion."	<urn:uuid:08afe999-dab2-49e6-b891-667178fe61da>	0.0
sevastopol panorama crimean war damage ww2	"As has been already the case so many times in history, most of the victims are Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians.
The latest stroke in this picture is the ban by the Russian occupation authorities on the activities of the Mejlis, the self-governing body of the Crimean Tatar people.
Add to this the arbitrary detention of Ilmi Umerov, Deputy Head of the Mejlis, in a psychiatric facility for 20 days.
In fact, the outrageous practice of punitive psychiatry, which had been widely used by the Soviet repressive machinery, is now back in service for Russia.
We urge Russia to grant unimpeded access of international human rights organizations to both Crimea and Donbas, and implement the decision of UNESCO Executive Board on establishing monitoring in Crimea at the institutional level.
The residents of the peninsula must be protected from discrimination and repressions.
The genocide of the Crimean Tatar people who already experienced the tragedy of forced deportation 70 years ago must not repeat.
In Ukraine, we highly appreciate the contribution of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Human Rights Council to addressing the current human rights situation in my country, including in occupied Crimea.
This year, we intend to bring this matter to the attention of the UN General Assembly and to submit a respective draft resolution on the human rights situation in the territory of the occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.
This resolution shall become an impartial assessment of the human rights situation in the occupied territories by the entire UN family.
People in these territories have the right to be protected.
Their children have the right to be protected.
And it is our responsibility, as the United Nations, to protect them.
I appeal to all UN member states to support the initiative of Ukraine.
We also urge you not to recognize the legitimacy of the Russian elections, which were held a few days ago in the occupied Crimea.
If you do recognize them this will play into the hands of the aggressor and encourage further repressions.
One more problem, which emanates from Russia's occupation of Crimea, is its intentions to deploy tactic nuclear weapons and means of delivery in the occupied peninsula.
This would destroy the global system of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and brutally violate Ukraine's non-nuclear status.
Moreover, Russia uses temporarily occupied Crimea for projecting its aggressive policies not only in Ukraine but also in other corners of the world, including in Syria where these policies go hand in hand with war crimes and crimes against humanity."	<urn:uuid:39206bf0-58b3-41a4-b78e-057592ef5fd7>	0.0

How do urban wetlands manage nitrogen pollution and affect air quality?	"Signed into law by President Bush on November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 enhanced existing programs and created new regulatory initiatives. Historically, the Clean Air Act addressed only major sources of air pollution and areas with severe air quality problems. Three elements of the 1990 Amendments however may have serious impact on smaller emission sources and small business, in general. These include Title I provisions designed to remedy chronic non-attainment (""dirty air"") areas, Title III prohibitions on the emissions of hazardous air pollutants, and the Title V operating permit program.
Title I Non-Attainment Provisions
Ozone pollution, also referred to as ""urban smog,"" is the most prevalent air quality problem today. It is caused by emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides associated primarily with urban areas and heavy industry. The 1990 Amendments redesignated the ozone non-attainment areas based upon the severity of the ozone pollution. The ""non-attainment"" designation means that levels of ozone in a particular geographic area exceed the federal standard. At the top of the list, with the worst ozone problem is Los Angeles, which is the only ""extreme"" ozone non-attainment area. Four other classifications of more general application consist of ""severe,"" ""serious,"" ""moderate,"" and ""marginal.""
The redesignation by severity of pollution was accompanied by a reduction in the amount of emissions that will subject a particular source to stringent new control requirements. Before the 1990 Amendments, only sources with potential to emit more than 100 tons per year of VOCs were affected by the non-attainment program requirements. Much smaller sources of VOC emissions are not included within the regulatory program. In ""moderate"" and ""serious"" non-attainment areas, facilities that emit 50 tons of VOCs will now be subject to emission controls. In ""severe"" areas, which include the Chicago metropolitan area, sources that emit 25 tons of VOCs per year will become regulated.
In the ""extreme"" non-attainment area of Los Angeles, sources that emit as little as 10 tons per year of VOCs will be included.
New sources that intend to locate in ozone non-attainment areas, and which emit VOCs in amounts exceeding specific thresholds, are subject to the most stringent requirements."	<urn:uuid:462735dc-6f11-4336-a66f-6a979e002e58>	0.0

I'm studying plant evolution and I'm curious about what makes mosses unique in their life cycle - what's the critical developmental change they need to complete their life cycle?	"When the cycle is charged, the charging voltage is 2.40-2.50V/ cell (the set value at 20℃) to carry out constant voltage charging. When the temperature is below 5C or above 35℃ for charging, the starting point is 20℃, and the charging voltage is adjusted to -4mV/cell for every change of 1 ℃.
The battery for electric scooter is the power source of electric vehicles, is the lead-acid power battery, lead-acid battery cost is low, cost-effective. Because this battery can be charged, can be used repeatedly, because it is impossible to charge in time in the process of riding an electric vehicle, often more than 60% of the depth of discharge, deep discharge, lead sulfate concentration increase, vulcanization will be quite serious.
It is also a large current discharge. The cruising current of a battery car at 20km is generally 4A, which is higher than the working current of the battery in other fields, and the working current of Overspeed and overloaded electric vehicles is even greater. Have carried out 1C charge 70%, 2C discharge 60% cycle life test, can reach the charge and discharge cycle 400 times life of a lot of batteries, but the actual use of the effect is far from the same.
This is because high current operation increases the discharge depth by 50%, which accelerates battery vulcanization. In addition, the battery life of three-wheeled electric vehicles is shorter, because its body is too heavy, the working current is more than 6A, and electric vehicles a year charge and discharge cycle more than 300 times is very common, short-term charging, because electric vehicles are vehicles, charging time is not much, to complete 36 volts or 48 volts within 8 hours of 20 Amperes charging, This must improve the charging voltage (generally for a single section of 2.7~2.9 volts) when the charging voltage exceeds the single battery oxygen evolution voltage (2.35 volts) or hydrogen evolution voltage (2.42 volts), the battery will be due to excessive oxygen evolution and open valve exhaust, resulting in water loss, increase the concentration of electrolyte, battery vulcanization aggravation, the service life will be short."	<urn:uuid:176c8573-ef1c-4c6a-b1b4-52f77f0a7dc7>	0.0

I am sorry Carlisle, but IU think you are wrong. cDNA has a more general
meaning. You are referring to how cDNA is usually prepared from a mRNA
library, but cDNA stands for complementary DNA due to the fact that it is
the template strand for mRNA synthesis (wihtout introns of course).

What are the specific benefits that a developer gains from setting up an upstream branch in their daily coding workflow, and how does this relate to the fundamental concepts of version control?	"Many of the cis-regulatory motifs have been successfully identified by phylogenetic footprinting, which makes use of cross-species sequence conservation as a functional signature [2–6]. Based on this rationalization, we aimed to test if the complexity of transcriptional regulation depends on gene function, by looking at the sequence conservation at the proximal upstream region. This is the first whole genome study providing statistical evidence of significant conservation in upstream regions of human genes involved in certain biological processes and functions.
There have been studies on how gene function is related to degree of conservation and evolutionary rate in the protein-coding region. For example, Clark et al.  detected functional categories that showed accelerated evolution of the protein-coding region in human compared to chimp, based on site-specific dN/dS ratios. The functional categories include 'olfaction', 'signal transduction', 'cell adhesion', 'transport', 'developmental processes', 'ion channel' and 'extracellular matrix'. In , Dorus et al. reported that the protein coding regions of the genes linked to nervous system development show positive selection in the primate lineage compared to rodents, by using housekeeping genes as a control. Bustamante et al.  compared within-species polymorphism and between-species divergence to detect positively and negatively selected human genes. Functional categories with an excess of positively selected genes included 'sensory perception', 'defence/immunity protein' and in particular, 'transcription factor'. Some discrepancy exists among studies, since  detected 'ectoderm development', 'extracellular matrix' and 'voltage-gated potassium channel' as categories with an excess of negatively selected genes.
Little is known about how the proximal upstream regions evolve in those genes that are detected to be positively selected, even though it is an interesting question whether the noncoding regulatory regions will show a similar pattern as the coding regions. Interestingly, we detected a significantly higher upstream conservation in these adaptive genes, particularly those involved in development, cell communication, signal transduction, transcription factor and neurophysiological functions. One possibility is that there is opposite purifying selection on the upstream regulatory region and the protein-coding region. The other possibility is that a relatively high regulatory complexity exists in these genes and that their dense cis-regulatory elements provide higher promoter conservation. We speculate that the latter explanation is biologically more intuitive. According to , a complex network can rapidly achieve the ability to buffer mutations."	<urn:uuid:6ca40d73-2939-4668-b585-d1936fa8dc0a>	0.0

How do little tunnels made by worms in the ground help plants and the soil?	"One of the best companion plants for peppers is marigolds. These easy-to-grow flowers attract bumblebees, which are useful for pollination. They also serve as an effective barrier against the wind, preventing pepper plants from toppling over. Similarly, French marigolds are reputed to boost the flavor of peppers, while attracting pollinators to increase their yields.
Although it’s a good idea to plant cowpeas next to peppers, they may be incompatible. Cowpeas tend to attract Green Stink Bugs, which prefers hot pepper plants to other plants. While cowpeas may be beneficial, you’ll need to wait two years before you can plant them next to peppers. Another great companion plant is lettuce, which is unobtrusive in the garden and won’t compete with the pepper’s deeper roots. Additionally, lettuce will shade the ground surrounding pepper plants, which will prevent weeds from growing.
What Are Companion Plants?
Companion planting is an effective method to grow vegetables and other types of plants in close proximity to peppers. These plants will increase the health and yields of your pepper plants while at the same time attracting beneficial insects and pollinators to the garden. Peppers are sensitive to pests and diseases, so choosing companion plants that are not a threat to the pepper plant will ensure a healthy crop and less damage to your plants.
In the garden, lettuce, and spinach are excellent companions for peppers. These plants do not compete for nutrients and reduce weeds around pepper plants. The lettuce also helps peppers retain moisture and reduces the amount of shade that they receive. Tomatoes and peppers are part of the nightshade family, so avoiding plants in the Brassica family will prevent peppers from thriving. Lastly, peppers benefit from the shade of herbs.
Peppers thrive in moist soil, so pairing them with a variety of plants that benefit the soil and the peppers will help to prevent insect pests. Companion plants will also help to prevent dry summers. Some plants are ideal for this purpose: they will protect the pepper from slugs and cabbage worms, while other plants will help peppers to produce high-quality fruits and vegetables.
Best Companion Plants For Peppers
Among the many companion plants for peppers, basil and parsley are excellent choices. They help trap aphids and encourage predators. These are some of the best companion plants for peppers. Choose yours based on your personal preference! And don’t be afraid to experiment!"	<urn:uuid:d2930443-83ee-4db7-9ca1-3bb50c8f1d1d>	0.0

I'm worried about my premature baby in the NICU - what kind of tests and nursing care will they need to check their brain development?	"Forming a Bond With Your Baby -- Why It Isn't Always Immediate
Why Am I Not Bonding With My Baby? continued...
Bonding can be especially difficult if you had a C-section or couldn't see your baby right after the birth. It can also be difficult if your baby was premature and had to spend time in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), or if you adopted the child. It may take longer to bond in these instances, but it eventually should happen.
Some mothers develop postpartum depression, which prevents them from completely bonding with their baby. The pain and exhaustion from childbirth -- especially from a difficult delivery -- can also get in the way of the bonding process.
Sometimes, a mother's or father's situation can affect her or his relationship with the new baby. Any of the following can interfere with your efforts at bonding:
- A childhood that lacked a positive parental role model
- A history of depression or mental illness
- A past pregnancy loss or loss of a child
- Lack of a social network
- Life stresses such as a difficult job, unemployment, or other financial troubles
- Marital problems or abuse
Are There Tips for Bonding With My Baby?
Here are some suggestions that will make it easier to bond with your baby:
- Ask to room-in with your baby at the hospital. Sleeping in the same room will give you more time to get to know one another.
- If your baby is premature, ask the hospital staff if you can touch and hold him. Just talking to your baby can help the two of you bond. Visit the NICU often to see your baby.
- Once you get home, spend as much time as possible with your baby by wearing her in a sling or carrier, rocking her on your lap, or singing her a song. Your voice and touch can be very comforting.
- Try giving your baby a gentle massage. Research has found that massage can not only improve the relationship between parent and baby, but it also can relieve stress in premature infants and ease postpartum depression in the mother. To learn how to massage your baby the right way, get a video, read a book, or take a class at a local hospital.
- Try making skin-to-skin contact with your newborn. This practice, called ""kangaroo care,"" is often used in premature babies, but studies are finding that it's also calming to babies born full-term. It not only helps with bonding, but it also can improve your baby's ability to breastfeed."	<urn:uuid:38bb0472-923a-4475-a129-ea4fe7fef07b>	0.0
mental health trans youth empowerment barriers outcomes	"The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned about the potential negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the mental well-being of health and social care professionals. Symptoms of mental health problems commonly include depression, anxiety, stress, and additional cognitive and social problems; these can impact on function in the workplace. The mental health and resilience (ability to cope with the negative effects of stress) of frontline health and social care professionals ('frontline workers' in this review) could be supported during disease epidemics by workplace interventions, interventions to support basic daily needs, psychological support interventions, pharmacological interventions, or a combination of any or all of these.
Objective 1: to assess the effects of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic.
Objective 2: to identify barriers and facilitators that may impact on the implementation of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic.
On 28 May 2020 we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus databases and WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing. We also searched ongoing trials registers and Google Scholar. We ran all searches from the year 2002 onwards, with no language restrictions.
We included studies in which participants were health and social care professionals working at the front line during infectious disease outbreaks, categorised as epidemics or pandemics by WHO, from 2002 onwards. For objective 1 we included quantitative evidence from randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series studies, which investigated the effect of any intervention to support mental health or resilience, compared to no intervention, standard care, placebo or attention control intervention, or other active interventions. For objective 2 we included qualitative evidence from studies that described barriers and facilitators to the implementation of interventions. Outcomes critical to this review were general mental health and resilience. Additional outcomes included psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression or stress; burnout; other mental health disorders; workplace staffing; and adverse events arising from interventions.
Pairs of review authors independently applied selection criteria to abstracts and full papers, with disagreements resolved through discussion. One review author systematically extracted data, cross-checked by a second review author."	<urn:uuid:dad4d730-5454-4d16-9410-79aba24b3fc5>	0.0

What are the key differences between how a Property and Financial Affairs LPA and a conservator handle someone's financial matters?	"The Lasting Power of Attorney
The Lasting Power of Attorney Singapore
A Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) is a legal document which allows a person who is at least 21 years of age (‘donor’), to voluntarily appoint one or more persons (‘donee(s)’), to make decisions and act on his behalf as his proxy decision maker if he should lose mental capacity one day. A donee(s) can be appointed to act in two broad areas: personal welfare as well as property & affairs matters.
Benefits of an LPA
The LPA allows you to protect your interests by indicating a proxy – someone you trust to be reliable, competent and capable – to make decisions and act on your behalf should you become vulnerable when you lose the mental capacity to make your own decisions one day.
By having an LPA in place, it also alleviates the stress and difficulties faced by your loved ones should you lose your mental capacity.
For more information on The Lasting Power of Attorney, you can visit The Office of the Public Guardian website.
What you need to know to make an LPA
Donor : The person that appoints one or two individual(s) to make decisions/act on his behalf as his proxy decision maker if he/she should lose mental capacity one day.
Donee: The appointed individual(s) to make decisions/act on the donor’s behalf if the donor should lose mental capacity one day.
- Both Donor & Donee(s) must be 21 years old and above.
- There can be a maximum of 2 donees and 1 replacement donee to be appointed by the donor when necessary.
- All necessary documents (LPA application form & LPA Form 1) are provided at our clinic.
To make your Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA), visit us at Nuffield Medical Siglap.
Dr Lin Kai Wei, our resident doctor, is an accredited medical practitioner for LPA. The fees for making an LPA is $150.00 (per donor).
Please that note of the following requirements:
- All personnel involved must present their original NRIC or Passport.
- It is compulsory for all personnel involved to be present during the signing process of LPA with the doctor (witness).
An application fee may apply if you are:
- Singapore Permanent residents ($100.00)
- Foreigners ($250.00)

Could you explain in detail how the fact section of a case brief should be structured and what specific categories of legally relevant information need to be included?	"The SMART Goal-Setting Process
One of the most powerful methods of motivation is goal setting. The SMART method helps you set goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound. Management systems, such as management by objectives, incorporate goal-setting basics into the entire system.
Dr. Edwin Locke pioneered goal-setting research in the 1960s. Locke suggested that working toward a goal provided inherent motivation to reach that same goal. He also showed that employees are motivated by a combination of clear goals and specific, helpful, appropriate feedback. In 1990, Locke and Dr. Gary Latham published “A Theory of Goal Setting and Task Performance,” their seminal work, which reinforced the need for specific and difficult goals.
Your objectives usually fall into one of four categories: process, impact, outcome and personal. Process objectives describe who will participate, their interactions and activities. Impact focuses on the longer-term impact of your work. The RapidBI website reports that outcome objectives “let you know how you will change attitudes, knowledge and (short-term) behavior."" Personal objectives are used to measure and compare individual performance.
The SMART criteria require goals to be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound. Specificity keeps your goals straightforward, well defined and detailed. Making measurable goals prevents ambiguous statements such as “make new contacts” and replaces them with “talk to five new people each day.” Make sure your goals are reachable, since impossible goals simply set you up for failure. According to RapidBI, realistic goals don’t need to be easy--instead, they should be hard, but something toward which you are willing and able to work. Time-bound goals keep your work structured and add a sense of urgency to push you into action.
SmartER goals rely on some additional criteria including extending, exciting, rewarding and recorded. The goal should extend your abilities to keep it from seeming boring and purposeless. Exciting goals are most likely to be accomplished since they create a greater desire to do the work. According to RapidBI, for a goal to be rewarding, you should know what it will mean to you and what your outcome will be upon completion. You should record your objective and progress to increase your chances of completing the goal.
Steps for Businesses

What benefits do companies see when workers are more engaged?	"As CFOs are well aware, employment laws seem to favor workers against their employers, and they often cost firms money. But that’s not always the case.
COBRA (Health Insurance Continuation)
When the feds created those new model COBRA notices to account for the Obamacare exchanges, they also included some other key info — info that was easy to miss on first read.
Fact: Benefits are surpassing salaries as the most important perk to employees. But did these companies step out of line to enforce their benefits policies?
Here’s a compelling reason to review your ACA compliance efforts ASAP: If your firm slips up on any of the details, it could cost you big-time.
You never like to see a finance staffer leave (OK, maybe not never), but you certainly don’t want your top performer to say sayonara to your department. There may be good reason to be worried:
Granted, a generous severance package is probably the best way to give departing staffers some peace of mind when layoffs take place. But when that isn’t an option, there are other things you can do.
Companies are still waiting for answers on what will and won’t trigger Obamcare’s so-called Cadillac Tax.
After a series of extensions, it looks like the federal COBRA premium subsidy program will come to an end on Aug. 31 – unless some last-minute extension is passed.
Year-end will be here before you know it. So if Payroll has made any COBRA subsidy payments, you’ll want to make sure they’ve claimed credit on Form 941.
The latest move by the IRS suggests an increase in audits of employers’ COBRA procedures may be on tap in the very near future.
Due to the insurance exchanges created by the health reform law, the DOL felt the current model COBRA notices needed a makeover. And the changes it made could have a distinct benefit for Finance.
Still got some questions about what it is you are (and aren’t) required to report on workers’ W-2s under health reform? You’re not alone.
If you were planning on sending workers out onto the insurance exchanges with a lump-sum of cash for premium costs, you’ll want to read the feds’ latest warning.

I'm managing a team and want to know - what are the benefits of having employees who fit well with the company culture, and what are some effective ways to keep them from leaving?	"Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, you most likely opted to implement remote work. Because of the increasing number of coronavirus cases all over the world, many businesses felt obligated to create an emergency Work from Home policy as a safety measure for their employees.
Ready or not, you are now managing a team whose members work 100% from home. If you are used to your employees sharing an office, you will now face some new challenges.
For example, how can you keep the efficiency level as high as it was during office hours, how to communicate properly, or what will your employees consider micro-managing?
5 Steps to manage your new remote employees
1. Spell out goals and roles
If every team has their tasks, during the period of remote work, make sure to be clear about what your goals are. You can’t see what they are working on and suggest anything. That’s why now you need to spell precisely what the goals are. Make sure to focus on achievable tasks. You can do this once every week, or once a particular task is finished. Define roles inside of your teams. Make sure they each know what they are supposed to do. If you didn’t have any team-leaders, maybe this the time to appoint ones. A team-leader can organize calls in-between his team colleagues to talk essential and urgent things.
2. Keep people updated
At the office, you will announce a big sale or a new important signed client loudly, but while your team works from home, you can’t do that. When something like this happens, send a group message, you can even attach a screenshot as proof for it to be more engaging. Your employees still want to know what other teams are developing or how the company is doing in general. This can even be a motivation booster.
3. Avoid micromanaging
You may feel the need to check in regularly to make sure everyone is online and working on their task while at home. This can lead to your employees feeling like you don’t trust them. According to Brenna Loury, head of marketing at Doist, engaging you remote workers starts with a high-trust culture. Therefore, you can ask for a weekly report, but do not send messages twice a day asking about the same task.
4. Communication and connection
Communication is vital in a company, but this becomes of greater importance once you decide to work remotely."	<urn:uuid:2ac01cfb-3410-4e81-b92f-326576c0be39>	0.0

How did historical German flutes vary in their pitch levels, and what were the efforts made to standardize musical pitch across different regions?	"It’s undeniable that the way your voice sounds has a lot to do with how you come across.
As reported in the Wall Street Journal, people who hear recordings of rough, weak, or strained voices tend to label the speakers as negative, weak or tense. While people with strong voices are described as successful, sociable and smart.
Whether you’re speaking one-on-one, in a meeting or presenting on the big stage, here are 3 tips to help boost connection and credibility with your voice:
Changing your vocal habits is hard—but the good news is, you can change them!
Whip out your smartphone and use an app like Voice Memos to record your next pitch. Then, self-diagnose. Did you vary the pitch? Do you sound energized? Are you remembering to pause?
Blending connection and credibility through your voice is magnetizing. The more you give, the better others will perceive you as a leader."	<urn:uuid:d42734bb-fe3a-4914-ac01-a8ab0e83d11f>	0.0
What kind of legacy have the greatest Cincinnati Reds players left behind in terms of retired numbers and hall of fame recognition?	"As a sports fan, it’s common practice to say you’re team is THE WORST. But when I said that about the Cincinnati Reds 2016 pitching, I may have been right. Let’s start with FiveThirtyEight.com who pointed out in mid-September that the Reds’ pitching might be the worst of all time:
But it’s also symptomatic of a pitching staff that is, by another measure, the worst ever — and the only one in history that would have been better off being stocked with replacement-level players instead.
A day later, the Ringer offers Understanding the Plight of Cincinnati’s Historically Awful Starting Pitching Staff:
Even more troublingly, Reds pitchers have combined for negative 1.1 wins above replacement this season. The 1890 Pittsburgh Alleghenys — a team that went 23–113, finished 66.5 games out of first place, and featured a veteran pitcher named Phenomenal Smith — were the last team with a staff below replacement level over a full season.
The day after the season ended, FanGraphs proclaims The Reds Actually Did It:
To be absolutely clear about what we have here: By our numbers, the Reds just became the first pitching staff in modern history to finish with a negative WAR. It’s only slight, sure, and the difference between them and those 1915 Athletics is less than one win, but that negative symbol is conspicuous. It pushes the digits over to the right, so they can stand out. The Reds, as a collective, featured a major-league pitching staff that was a worse-than-replacement-level pitching staff. That’s almost unfathomable, is what that is.
Yeah, but what would Bill James say?
I didn’t do this to pick on the 2016 Cincinnati Reds; I was just doing the Reds as I was doing every team. Also, it should be noted that in a hitter’s year, in a hitter’s era, the numbers go up. If you’re 10% worse than league in 1930, that’s more runs than if you’re 10% worse than league in 1968. But the study concluded that the worst pure-pitching stats of all time by far belonged to the 2016 Cincinnati Reds.
So there you have it. The 2016 Reds pitching was THE WORST."	<urn:uuid:de5beefa-03cf-4203-8297-9b735d390eb0>	0.0
difference between large and small diaphragm condenser microphones frequency response high end	"7, this occurs because the sound arriving at 0° is delayed on its way to the rear face of the diaphragm by the path ts + t1. The length of ts varies with the angle of the arriving wave, reducing to a difference of t1 at 180°.
Using our previous models of the virtual figure 8 and coincident omnidirectional microphones, the difference to the same place on each side of the diaphragm from a point sound source is expressed in the following, adapted from a formula by Georg Neumann GmbH:
e8/eO= 1/cos α, and
tan α = λ/2 π r
e8 is the output of a figure 8 microphone,
eO is the output of an omnidirectional microphone of the same sensitivity,
λ is the wavelength in m, and
r is the microphone distance from a point source in m.
Fig. 9: Proximity effect measurements made on a cardioid microphone. Lower frequencies increase as the sound source moves closer to the microphone capsule. When the effect of the pressure differential on the figure 8 microphone is added to the omnidirectional microphone, a curve of the proximity effect on frequency response is produced, as shown in Fig. 9. The rise in response at 100 Hz — a frequency present in speech — could be 10 dB to 15 dB for distances of 0.1 m to 0.2 m (4 to 8 inches). The rolloff effect of cardioid microphones discussed above may tend to counteract this proximity boost at lower frequencies, resulting in an apparent “bump” in response near 100 Hz.
Some of this investigation was aided thanks to an excellent guide, “Microphones, Methods of Operation and Type Examples”by Gehart Boré and Stephan Peus of Georg Neumann GmbH, which is available on the Neumann website at neumann.com.

ships World War 2 launch date Pacific service	"""I think if the standards are going to be tougher, there should be more time to do PT,"" said Staff Sgt. Marc Taggart, 27, an 86th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron avionics specialist from Tucson, Ariz.
Airman 1st Class Michael Yee, 23, a C-130 crew chief, thinks the Air Force should still give airmen time during the duty day to work out, but it should be a balance of unit PT and individual exercise.
""You should be fit all year round, I do agree with that,"" he said. But the one-workout-fits-all group mentality of unit PT isn't always beneficial for airmen, he said.
The tougher proposed standards include testing airmen twice a year - instead of once - and giving commanders the authority to boot an airman from the service for two consecutive PT test failures. Right now, a discharge isn't considered until an airman has four PT failures in a year.
""I think that is a pretty significant impact,"" said Maj. Alex Garcia, U.S. Air Forces in Europe fitness program consultant. ""I think in the past folks thought if I fail a couple of times then I would get serious.""
Some trials of the new standards at Air Force bases have indicated the failure rate could skyrocket.

mobile phones recycling problems risks	"Increases risk of illness in your immune system
Another cell phone health risk is caused by the separation anxiety we have with our cell phones, which leads to the incessant need to have them nearby, and the constant touching causes a build-up of germs on the handset.
After one day of use, your cell phone can harbor more disease-prone germs than those found on a toilet seat.
A study by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and Queen Mary, University of London, found that 92 percent of cell phones they sampled out of a pool of 390 had bacteria on them and 16 percent of them had E.Coli present.
Increases risk of eye vision problems
Staring at your mobile device can cause problems in your vision later in life.
Screens on mobile devices tend to be smaller than computer screens, which means you are more likely to squint and strain your eyes while reading messages.
According to The Vision Council, more than 70 percent of Americans don’t know or are in denial that they are susceptible to digital eye strain.
Radiation leading to various cancers
Cell phones emit radio-frequency energy (radio waves), a form of non-ionizing radiation, from their antennas. Tissues nearest to the antenna can absorb this energy.
Three case-control studies conducted since 2010 have all been positive (an increase in gliomas were found) in the highest exposure groups.
Two studies found that the tumors occurred on the same side as phone use.
Although, these studies are subject to recall bias because people were asked about their cellphone usage and those with the tumor could have exaggerated their usage.
Maybe these health risks will make you think twice about your cell phone usage- perhaps try leaving your phone in the living room over night? This could be your first step towards a healthier lifestyle."	<urn:uuid:b9f981d0-2a0e-483d-92b1-929108e95fc3>	0.0

compare financial aspects long term maintenance google ads standard delivery versus solar panel system	"As solar panel and installation costs continue to become more affordable, you'll see more and more business turning to solar energy to lower their electricity costs long-term.
Choosing a Battery for Your Solar System
Once you decide to go green with solar, you should consult an expert on how many solar panels your home or business will need, along with the overall kilowatts that system will generate. Once you know the overall power that will be generated from your solar system, it’s time to choose a battery bank.
A good battery bank is at the core of every solar system, and without one it’s impossible to store the energy generated from solar panels. This makes choosing the right battery technology extremely crucial for retaining power during off-peak production periods (when the sun isn’t shining).
There are 3 different types of batteries used in off-grid solar systems:
-Flooded lead acid
-Sealed lead acid (Gel and AGM)
-Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4)
Flooded lead acid batteries are a wet cell battery that’s filled with electrolytes. While these are the cheapest batteries available, they have the shortest lifespan and require ongoing maintenance every 30-45 days. Regular maintenance includes refilling with water, venting, and cleaning the terminals. It’s important to handle these batteries with care because they contain highly toxic and corrosive lead/ sulfuric acid. Improper care of flooded lead acid batteries may result in the leakage of explosive hydrogen gas. Most manufacturers recommend to replace these batteries every 3-4 years or 500 discharge/ charge cycles.
Sealed lead acid batteries come in at a slightly higher price point and work better for very demanding off-grid power situations. AGM batteries are a part of this group, and feature thin glass mats that hold the electrolyte in place. For the most part sealed batteries are maintenance free but will need to be replaced every 5-7 years, depending on usage.
Battery cells with lithium iron phosphate technology (LiFePO4) are the best choice for modern solar systems of any type. Lithium-ion batteries are more reliable, more efficient at storing and supplying energy, recharge the fastest, and have the longest life cycle (3000-5000 cycles). Lithium Battery Power offers several large capacity lithium-ion batteries depending on your specific solar wattage needs. Our batteries require absolutely no maintenance and are backed up by a 10 year manufacturer’s warranty."	<urn:uuid:7ac374ca-fd71-426b-bae6-ede9a3e33d82>	0.0
When to plant ryegrass and what are its health risks?	"Chromosomal rearrangements differentiating the ryegrass genome from the Triticeae, oat, and rice genomes using common heterologous RFLP probes

An restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based genetic map of ryegrass (Lolium) was constructed for comparative mapping with other Poaceae species using heterologous anchor probes. The genetic map contained 120 RFLP markers from cDNA clones of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), and rice (Oryza sativa L.), covering 664 cM on seven linkage groups (LGs). The genome comparisons of ryegrass relative to the Triticeae, oat, and rice extended the syntenic relationships among the species. Seven ryegrass linkage groups were represented by 10 syntenic segments of Triticeae chromosomes, 12 syntenic segments of oat chromosomes, or 16 syntenic segments of rice chromosomes, suggesting that the ryegrass genome has a high degree of genome conservation relative to the Triticeae, oat, and rice. Furthermore, we found ten large-scale chromosomal rearrangements that characterize the ryegrass genome. In detail, a chromosomal rearrangement was observed on ryegrass LG4 relative to the Triticeae, four rearrangements on ryegrass LGs2, 4, 5, and 6 relative to oat, and five rearrangements on ryegrass LGs1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 relative to rice. Of these, seven chromosomal rearrangements are reported for the first time in this study. The extended comparative relationships reported in this study facilitate the transfer of genetic knowledge from well-studied major cereal crops to ryegrass."	<urn:uuid:0c8c78e3-6588-4f23-8d36-ade20dfc1180>	0.0
How do companies fake environmental claims and who checks their truthfulness?	"Viet Tan has questioned the efficacy of the government’s COVID-19 measures and the truthfulness of its COVID-19 reporting, and it has amplified suggestions that China is ultimately responsible for the spread of the pandemic. Viet Tan is a frequent critic of the regime, and long before the Amnesty International report, it spoke out against Facebook’s alleged complicity in taking down dissident voices. The Vietnamese government considers Viet Tan a terrorist organization, stemming from its origins as a violent revolutionary organization based in the United States.
Although it is suppressed within the country, Viet Tan continues to serve as an outlet and mouthpiece for dissident voices operating both within and outside of Vietnam, many of whom rely on Facebook and other social media platforms to get their messages out. Facebook’s latest act of cooperation with the government comes at a key moment in the country: the 2021 elections. In January, the Communist Party of Vietnam will hold its the 13th National Congress, and the National Assembly will hold its elections in May. Vietnam holds direct elections for its National Assembly, but the top positions in government are elected by the legislative body, not citizens. Those top four leadership positions, “the four pillars,” are the party secretary general, the state president, the prime minister, and the chairperson of the national assembly. Vietnam is no stranger to restricting free expression ahead of elections, and so this clampdown of COVID-19 “fake news” appears to be perfectly timed.
Key to these suppression is the April 15 decree outlawing fake news. In addition to banning COVID-19 related misinformation, it restricts all social media posts that share banned books and publications, documents deemed to be state secrets, or even maps and charts failing to show the Vietnamese claims in the South China Sea. The crackdown on COVID-19 fake news and Vietnam’s use of nationalism to unite the country against the virus have been the primary focus of much of the media attention surrounding this decree. But the broad terms by which “fake news” is being defined “provides yet another potent weapon in the Vietnamese authorities’ arsenal of online repression,” Tanya O’Carroll, director of tech at Amnesty International, told Reuters.
With a public health crisis as an excuse, the Vietnamese government is maintaining its suppression of dissident speech."	<urn:uuid:5d29ec7f-8871-4a36-afae-36d4a22d608b>	0.0

What makes Saturn physically unique among planets, and what interesting features does its largest moon Titan possess compared to other celestial bodies?	"Extract majestic document:
Relationships with extraterrestrial men presents no basically new problem from the standpoint of international law; but the possibility of confronting intelligent beings that do not belong to the human race would bring up problems whose solution it is difficult to conceive. In principle, there is no difficulty in accepting the possibility of coming to an understanding with them, and of establishing all kinds of relationships.
If these intelligent beings were in possession of a more or less culture, and a more or less perfect political organization, they would have an absolute right to be recognized as independent and sovereign peoples. Another possibility may exist, that a species of Homo sapiens might have established themselves as an independent nation on another celestial body in our solar system and evolved culturally independently from ours. Living conditions on these bodies let’s say the moon,-or the planet Mars, would have to be such as to permit a stable, and to a certain extent, independent life, from an economic standpoint.
Hypothetically other planets may have life forms. Water has been found on our Moon and Mars that can be separated into hydrogen and oxygen, using an electric current or the short wave radiation of the sun. The oxygen could be used for breathing purposes; the hydrogen night be used as a fuel. There is indication that the inhabitants of celestial bodies, or extraterrestrial biological entitle (EBE) desire to settle here.
1. If they are politically organized and possess a certain culture similar to our own, they may be recognized as an independent people.
2. If they consider our culture to be devoid of political unity, they would have the right to colonize. Of course, this colonization cannot be conducted on classic lines. A superior form of colonizing will have to be conceived, that could be a kind of tutelage, possibly through the tacit approval of the United Nations.
We cannot exclude the possibility that a race of extraterrestrial people more advanced technologically and economically may take upon itself the right to occupy another celestial body.
The division of a celestial body into zones and the distribution of them among other celestial states. A moral entity? The most feasible solution it seem would be this one, submit an agreement providing for the peaceful absorption of a celestial race(s) in such a manner that our culture would remain intact with guarantees that their presence not be revealed. It would merely be a matter of internationalizing celestial peoples, and creating an international treaty instrument."	<urn:uuid:31edbed7-8665-4cfb-b720-28205415ac6d>	0.0
How did early fossil discoveries in the 1800s change our understanding of prehistoric life and what role did fossils from the Jurassic period play in developing new theories about Earth's history?	"The Nothosaurus was a dinosaur that lived in the water during the Triassic Period. Nothosaurus means “false lizard.” It was approximately 10 feet in length and on averaged weighted between 150 and 200 pounds. The Nothosaurus had a long tapered body and at the send was a narrow head that contained sharp teeth. The fossils were found all over the world. The Nothosaurus also are known to be the earliest sea-living reptilian hunters of the waters. There have been many full fossil structures found; one rare species can be seen in the National History Museum in Berlin.
The Nothosaurs was able to defend itself with its sharp teeth and the ability to swim away from land predators. As this dinosaur evolved, it became even larger and more dangerous.
The fossil records of the Nothosaurus are vital to scientists. They were able to study this marine reptile and learn that there were over a dozen species of this dinosaur. The fossils have been discovered all over the world. They were found in Europe, Africa, and Asia.
What did they eat?
Table of Contents
It is said that the Nothosaurus lived in shallow warm rivers and seas, so scientist believes they would eat fish, crabs, other crustaceans, and possibly eggs.
Did Nothosaurus live in water?
This dinosaur was one of the first that was able to live in the sea and still come out on land.
Physical Features/Characteristics of Nothosaurus
They had very long necks, webbed paddle feet, long sharp teeth, and were about 10 feet in length. These were mammal-like dinosaurs. The Nothosaurus was able to breathe air; it had two nostrils that were found on the top of its face, kind of like the present-day alligator or crocodile. The body was designed for life in the water. The Nothosaurus had front and back feet as well as bendable knees.

whitey lockman babe ruth baseball career difference	"|# 80 Babe Ruth|
The 1933 World Wide Gum baseball cards were printed in two different variations: English only and French and English. Today, the French and English versions are slightly more expensive than the English only cards. The Goudey Gum Company was located in Boston, so at their peak of gum card manufacturing, they opened a factory in Granby, Quebec. Because World Wide Gum printed both English as well as English and French, it is suspected that these cards were sold in different parts of Canada based on local language preferences.

Population data indicates 3.9 million people lived in Oklahoma in 2015. People who were 65 or older made up 14.7% of the state population, while people under age 18 accounted for 24.6%.
In 2015, employment statistics indicate 26,060 residents were working in community and social service fields. Typical jobs within this group included licensed social workers, child psychologists, some types of clergy members, community health workers, or a marriage and family therapist. In Oklahoma, therapists and people in related social service fields made an average of $38,280 a year.
Mental Health America (MHA) investigates the mental health conditions and access to treatment in the District of Columbia and all 50 states annually. In the 2016 edition of this survey, Oklahoma was given an overall mental health rank of 26th, which falls in the middle of the list. The state was also assessed in a variety of more specific categories; Oklahoma was 40th in the overall adult mental health category, 33rd in the overall youth mental health category, 20th in the occurrence of substance dependence and mental health issues, and 42nd in access to professional mental health treatment.
Oklahoma was ranked 46th for adults with mental health issues—with 20.5% of the adult population affected. The state was 26th for adult misuse and dependence on alcohol and drugs; however, Oklahoma was ranked 5th for adolescents with similar substance abuse and dependence issues.
With a ratio of 285 residents per mental health provider, Mental Health America gave Oklahoma a 5th-place ranking in mental health workforce availability. This ranking suggests it is easier to find a therapist in Oklahoma than in most other states. The benefits of therapy are also highlighted in a 2014 survey from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)."	<urn:uuid:9f9619fa-864e-4b5f-818c-b2a3b673b9ba>	0.0
what qualities important when hiring business consultant attorney first meeting	"The California marijuana industry is extremely active these days with all sorts of interesting people pursuing the goal of finding a successful niche. Among these entrepreneurs are numerous cannabis consultants on-hand to help with a variety of tasks related to getting operators and investors ready to apply for a state marijuana license. As an operator, investor, or anyone else looking for assistance in traveling from start to finish, selecting a cannabis consultant might seem almost as hard as doing the job yourself… And then you ask yourself, why don’t I just do it on my own?
The most important reason to hire someone else is that they can get from point A to point B better than you can. Having confidence in one’s abilities is a great thing, but no one has all the answers and learning how to solve any problem could take a lot of time on your own. We have provided you with five key things to look for when hiring a cannabis consultant
#1 – Does your cannabis consultant have a vision for how they will help you?
Any cannabis consultant you talk to will tell you he or she is good at what they do. The opposite is simply not an option or they would be out of business. The first important element about whether they are right for you is if they have a clear vision for achieving your goal, whether you are setting up a marijuana dispensary, cultivation, manufacturing, or distribution business? If so, ask them what that goal looks like? Will there be any pitfalls once that goal is achieved? How would they recommend starting down the path toward that goal? What sort of guarantees or likely outcomes do they provide? They need to be able to identify and walk you down a clear path, or your time and money will likely be wasted on them.
#2 – Does their skill set match your specific need?
The second step in finding a cannabis consultant that fits your needs is determining why you need one and what they will do? What is the goal you are trying to achieve and with what part do you want or need help? If you haven’t performed any research, it may be worth it to learn at least a little about what you want someone you hire to do for you. Otherwise, how will you know they did a good job, or even finished?"	<urn:uuid:35ca535e-cd08-4d63-8338-97e6df9fcadc>	0.0
compare image processing tools performance cloud storage data security strength weakness explain both	"In the age of growing datasets and increased computing power, deep learning has become a popular technique for AI. Deep learning models continue to improve their performance across a variety of domains, with access to more and more data, and the processing power to train larger neural networks. This rise of deep learning advances the state-of-the-art for AI, but also exposes some challenges for the access to data and storage systems. In this article, we further describe the storage challenges for deep learning workloads and how Alluxio can help to solve them.
Data Challenges of Deep Learning
Deep learning has become popular for machine learning because of the availability of large amounts of data, and typically more data leads to better performance. However, there is no guarantee that all the training data are available to deep learning frameworks (Tensorflow, Caffe, torch). For example, deep learning frameworks have integrations with some existing storage systems, but not all storage integrations are available. Therefore, a subset of the data may be inaccessible for training, resulting in lower performance and effectiveness.
Also, there is a variety of storage options for users, with distributed storage systems (HDFS, ceph) and cloud storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob Store, Google Cloud Storage) becoming popular. However, practitioners interact with these distributed and remote storage systems in an unfamiliar way from simply using the local file system on the local machine. It can be difficult to properly configure and use new and different tools for each storage system. This makes accessing data from diverse systems difficult for deep learning.
Lastly, the growing trend of separating compute resources from storage resources necessitates using remote storage systems. This is common for cloud computing and enables on-demand resource allocation, which can lead to higher utilization, flexible elasticity, and lower costs. However, when remote storage systems are used for deep learning training data, that means data must be fetched over the network, which can increase the training time for deep learning. The extra network IO will increase costs and increase the time to process the data.
How Alluxio Helps Deep Learning Storage Challenges
While there are several data management related issues with deep learning, Alluxio can help with the data access challenges. Alluxio in its simplest form is a virtual file system which transparently connects to existing storage systems and presents them as a single system to users."	<urn:uuid:76624a50-35f0-498a-8fba-18daf7b4561d>	0.0
I'm new to student loans. What's the main difference between graduated repayment and IDR plans?	"PLUS Loans for Parents
Parents of dependent students are eligible to apply for their own federal loan to help pay college expenses. We do not assume parents want to borrow to pay educational expenses. If you and your parents are interested in this program you should contact the campus financial aid office at your school. A parent may borrow the difference between the Cost of Attendance and all other student aid received by the student.
You (the student) must apply for financial aid using the FAFSA. You must also submit a PLUS loan request form available at your CUNY college Financial Aid Office.
Interest rate and repayment for PLUS loans
Plus loans taken for the 2013-2014 academic term are charged a fixed interest rate of 6.41%. The interest will not change throughout the life of the loan. Repayment of the loan begins within 60 days after the date funds are disbursed. The interest rate varies each year on new loans and is adjusted each July 1st.
To receive a PLUS loan you must:
- Request the loan from the financial aid office
- File a FAFSA
- Parents must be able to pass a credit check
- Parents and students must meet general eligibility requirements for federal student aid
- Must not be in default of any loan or owe a refund to any Federal Student Assistance program
Frequently Asked Questions
How do my parents apply for a PLUS Loan?
After completing a FAFSA your parents complete a Direct PLUS Loan application and promissory note that you'll get from your school's financial aid office. They will have to pass a credit check. If they don't pass they might still be able to receive a loan if they can demonstrate that extenuating circumstances exists, or if someone they know, who can pass agrees to endorse the loan and promises to repay it if your parents don't.
When does PLUS loan repayment begin?
Generally, within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed (paid out). There is no grace period for these loans. This means interest begins to accumulate at the time the first disbursement is made. Your parents must begin repaying both principal and interest while you're in school.
What are the PLUS repayment periods?
The repayment periods for Stafford Loans vary from 10 to 30 years depending which repayment plan you choose. When it comes to repayment you can pick a repayment plan that's right for you. You can get more information about repayment by going to the U.S."	<urn:uuid:d4da0f62-0098-4250-a19b-052c06b28c22>	0.0
I work with machine tool standards and optical measurement systems, and I need to understand the relationship between measurement uncertainty and tolerance limits. How do different machine tool standards handle accuracy specifications, and what approach is used in optical shaft measurement to ensure measurement reliability?	"Rather than measuring the initial and final lengths (Li and Lf) of the test member, dilatometry measures the difference in length δL between the test member and the reference member. Because δL is generally much less than Li and Lf, the measurement accuracy is enhanced. Error sources in dilatometry include an imperfect knowledge of the reference member's CTE and inadvertent temperature differences between the test member and the reference member.
In interferometry, the expansion of a test member is measured relative to the wavelength of monochromatic light. A monochromatic light beam is split into first and second signals which are directed along first and second optical paths before being recombined. The optical paths are configured to include reflection from opposite ends of the test member. The difference in the optical path lengths causes a phase difference in the first and second signals which affects the amplitude of the recombined signal.
Expansion of the test member causes the first and second optical path lengths to change and this change is reflected in a change in the amplitude of the recombined signal. The measurement accuracy can be on the order of the radiation wavelength which is generally small, e.g., ˜1 micron for visible light. Interferometry measurement systems are typically complex and expensive. Error sources include the temperature sensitivities of optical equipment (e.g., lenses and retroreflectors) which must be exposed to the test temperature.
Dilatometry and interferometry measurement techniques are best suited for the measurement of homogeneous test members which expand linearly. Because their constituent parts may have different CTEs, composite members often bend or twist as they expand. Conventional dilatometry and interferometry techniques are typically not configured to correct for this complex expansion.
Exemplary composite members which are subjected to thermal stress are the solar wings 22 and 24 of the satellite 20 of FIG. 1. The satellite has a body 26 which carries various communication antennas, e.g., dish antennas 28, 29 and 30 and an array antenna 31. The solar wings 22 and 24 extend in opposite directions from the body 26 and they each carry a plurality of solar cells 32 on one wing face.
The satellite 20 is typically maintained in an attitude which directs the antennas at the Earth. The solar cells 32 convert solar radiation 33 to electrical energy for operation of the systems of the spacecraft 20."	<urn:uuid:a0aaed77-d576-41b3-abda-abcfdafc108b>	0.0

I'm curious about weather patterns - how do the computer models handle small-scale weather events in the North Atlantic compared to the longer-term global temperature predictions?	"Population growth is another factor in global warming, because as more people use fossil fuels for heat, transportation and manufacturing the level of greenhouse gases continues to increase. As more farming occurs to feed millions of new people, more greenhouse gases enter the atmosphere.
Ultimately, more greenhouse gases means more infrared radiation trapped and held, which gradually increases the temperature of the Earth’s surface and the air in the lower atmosphere.
The Average Global Temperature is Increasing Quickly
Today, the increase in the Earth’s temperature is increasing with unprecedented speed. To understand just how quickly global warming is accelerating, consider this:
During the entire 20th century, the average global temperature increased by about 0.6 degrees Celsius (slightly more than 1 degree Fahrenheit).
Using computer climate models, scientists estimate that by the year 2100 the average global temperature will increase by 1.4 degrees to 5.8 degrees Celsius (approximately 2.5 degrees to 10.5 degrees Fahrenheit).
Not All Scientists Agree
While the majority of mainstream scientists agree that global warming is a serious problem that is growing steadily worse, there are some who disagree. John Christy, a professor and director of the Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville is a respected climatologist who argues that global warming isn’t worth worrying about.
Christy reached that opinion after analyzing millions of measurements from weather satellites in an effort to find a global temperature trend. He found no sign of global warming in the satellite data, and now believes that predictions of global warming by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the 21st century are incorrect."	<urn:uuid:726ebf94-e36e-472a-af90-912aaa7a2b78>	0.0

How do temporary installations enable artistic experimentation and ensure accessibility standards?	"Web accessibility is one of the most critical components of the University of Iowa's web presence. At the same time, it is one of the most misunderstood. Following are some common questions about web accessibility at Iowa.
What is web accessibility?
Web accessibility means designing and delivering websites and content that present no barriers to users with disabilities. Accessible websites and content include design features that increase usability across a spectrum of abilities and technologies, including use by people with disabilities and users of assistive technology.
What is the University of Iowa's policy on web accessibility?
University of Iowa policy requires that all web content conform to accessibility standards described in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, version 2.0, level AA, as set forth by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Individual units are charged with developing and implementing a web accessibility strategy per the Implementation section of this policy.
The full policy is available at http://itsecurity.uiowa.edu/policy/webAccessibility.shtml.
Is accessibility required by law?
The University is subject to provisions of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and the Iowa Civil Rights Act.
- Section 504 prohibits disability-based discrimination by programs that receive Federal funds.
- Title II of the ADA requires that communications to people with disabilities be equally as effective as communications with non-disabled people in their timeliness, accuracy, and delivery method.
- The Department of Justice has stated that Internet and web sites are covered under both Section 504 and the ADA.
I don't have any people with disabilities in my audience—do I need to provide accessible web technology?
Yes. One tenet of accessible technology is that it is available to any qualified user. A user with a disability may access your website at any time, and must be able to make use of your content. Providing accessible technology from the beginning is the best way to ensure that all users can get the most from your site.
I hear about WCAG and the POUR Principles—what are these, and how do they relate to accessibility at Iowa?
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) describe a set of principles, standards, and techniques intended to provide a framework for web accessibility. WCAG version 2.0, Level AA is the content standard identified for compliance with the University web policy; all web content must conform to these guidelines.
POUR is an acronym for four high-level principles that describe functional accessibility."	<urn:uuid:d3f10fbb-e89d-417e-8293-5c6dd0e171e9>	0.0

Are solar pumps good for small farms?	"Tag Archives: NJ
New Jersey is turning eyesores into solar farms. The U.S. state has become a leader in solar energy capacity. Energy from the sun now comes from contaminated land not suitable for development.
Solis Partners, a leading provider of commercial solar power systems, has announced that it has completed the installation of a 243-kilowatt solar photovoltaic (PV) system at Riephoff Sawmill. Located in Monmouth County in the borough of Upper Freehold, N.J., the Riephoff facility is New Jersey’s largest hardwood sawmill.
The system was designed, engineered and constructed by Manasquan, N.J.-based Solis Partners and comprises of two ground-mounted systems — a 165-kilowatt array that generates power for the sawmill and a 78-kilowatt array that generates power for additional facilities on the property, which include a barn for livestock and an aquafarm.
Located at 763 Route 524, the Riephoff Sawmill is a family-owned business that has been supplying the Northeast with high quality lumber products for the industrial, construction and manufacturing industries for more than 45 years. The two solar systems are housed within the company’s 7-acre yard that is used for scaling and storing logs.
“We are thrilled to announce the completion of this innovative project,” said Jamie Hahn, co-founder and managing director of Solis Partners. “This project allows Riephoff to lower its operating costs and acts as a hedge against the rising costs of electricity, which is especially important in a state that has some of the nation’s highest electricity rates. The ability to produce clean, renewable energy is also very important to Riephoff as an organization reliant on the natural environment for raw materials.”
The 15,000-square-foot mill, which includes a 56-inch circular saw and a 20-foot frick carriage, a device used to pass large pieces of lumber through the saw, as well as the pumps needed for aquafarming, requires a lot of electricity. The solar PV system offsets approximately 100 percent of Riephoff’s electricity consumption, which equates to approximately $36,000 in annual savings.
Built with 1,036 solar PV panels, the solar system will produce approximately 300,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in the first year of operation."	<urn:uuid:c2971b9d-d32b-4401-a812-1c81626d4869>	0.0
I've been reading about living longer and healthier, and I'm curious about how our bodies age. What makes us get old and sick, and is there any hope for medicines that could help us stay healthy longer?	"The first few months of being a medical student were an encounter with the world of the hospital. In such a first encounter (with a new book, a new person, a new language), you can ignore the occasional troubling aside and focus on the big picture. But as you get used to things, you can't avoid the episodes that are harder to talk about.
As a beginning medical student, I was mostly confused. As a fourth-year student who's just completed his sub-internship (a sort of pre-residency), I've become less confused and more intimately involved in the contradictions of the hospital. Once I become a resident, I might become too overwhelmed by life and death to write at all. Now, at the end of this column's first year, I thought I should take stock of my reactions to what I've seen. ""Love"" and ""hate"" are the first words that come to mind for many things I've encountered this past year. Sometimes I hate and love the same thing in succession.
I hate going into rooms of people who are very sick. They lie in their beds, staring at the wall. What's the right thing to say to them? Most of the time, as little as possible: I already know this from visiting the sick as a layperson. But as a doctor-in-the-making, I'm no longer someone who visits the sick. I now intrude on them for their own good, asking them questions they would rather not answer and viewing their bodies in ways that they never would countenance when healthy. While I try to build rapport, strengthening the doctor-patient relationship through our basic human connection, more often than not our conversation doesn't exceed the bare minimum. I need to get my work done; they need to get their rest. So I leave the room feeling guilty, while they lie there feeling no healthier than before.
At the same time, there are patients I come to love even though I know them only slightly. An older, frum woman was admitted with pneumonia. The admitting team described her as demented. According to the technical meaning of the term, this was correct: She suffers from a constant, progressive decline in cognitive function. But too many assume that the demented patient is childlike, not deserving of the respect we would give anyone outside the hospital."	<urn:uuid:94057375-d477-42ec-b896-f18c2caae216>	0.0
how many minutes minimum per day breathing exercises combined with relaxation observation	"According to estimates, 14% to 18% of children are affected, but only 5% to 6% of adults and 3% of seniors.
Psychological stress encourages teeth grinding
In order to get closer to the cause of teeth grinding, some self-observation is advisable. Do I tense my jaw repeatedly during the day? Is my tongue really relaxed or is it pressing against something? Am I breathing calmly and deeply enough? Physical tension often indicates a deeper, mental and psychological stress. Negative emotional stress is regarded as the undisputed leader among the causes of night-time teeth grinding. Sleep bruxism is not uncommon, especially in people with anxiety disorders, but it can also occur temporarily in periods of intense emotional stress. A therapeutic approach is advisable if you develop e.g. chronic pain, or if dentition is permanently damaged.
How do I get rid of teeth grinding?
How can you actively do something about the grinding of your teeth? First of all, a dental examination is necessary. Sometimes one needs a precise analysis of the masticatory apparatus to clarify problems with the temporomandibular joint. Usually, however, an occlusal splint is prescribed. The grinding is only treated symptomatically, but at least the teeth and joints are being protected.
Since psychological stress is often the basis, stress management is particularly important. Behavioural therapy or psychological support can help especially with an increased perception of stress – relaxation techniques such as autogenic training or progressive muscle relaxation are considered promising measures. Medications for muscle relaxation will sometimes be prescribed, but usually only for a short time to avoid possible side effects. Sometimes, an injection of the neurotoxin Botox will be applied to loosen the jaw muscle, but is not recommended due to possible bone resorption. Physiotherapy is more advisable, such as massage or special stretching exercises for the jaw. Also, in the wider context, attention should be paid to the muscles and physiotherapeutic treatment be considered, since the cervical spine and the position of the head affects the position of the jaw: if the head is pushed too far forward, as is often the case with computer work or excessive use of the smart phone, then this may lead to tension in the muscles of the jaw. Summarizing, it can be said that almost everything that brings mental and physical relaxation can help prevent teeth grinding.

Longitudinal Biochemical Assay Analysis of Mutant Huntingtin Exon 1 Protein in R6/2 Mice.
Journal of Huntington's disease
2018; 7 (4): 321-335
Biochemical analysis of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregation species in HD mice is a common measure to track disease. A longitudinal and systematic study of how tissue processing affects detection of conformers has not yet been reported. Understanding the homeostatic flux of mHTT over time and under different processing conditions would aid in interpretation of pre-clinical assessments of disease interventions.Provide a systematic evaluation of tissue lysis methods and molecular and biochemical assays in parallel with behavioral readouts in R6/2 mice to establish a baseline for HTT exon1 protein accumulation.Established biochemical methods were used to process tissue from R6/2 mice of specific ages following behavior tasks. Aggregation states and accumulation of mHTT exon 1 protein were evaluated using multiple break and assay methods to determine potential conformational flux assay specificity in detection of mHTT species, and tissue specificity of conformers.Detection of mHTT exon 1 protein species varied based on biochemical processing and analysis providing a baseline for subsequent studies in R6/2 mice. Insoluble, high molecular weight species of mHTT exon 1 protein increased and tracked with onset of behavioral impairments in R6/2 mice using multiple assay methods.Conformational flux from soluble monomer to high molecular weight, insoluble species of mHTT exon 1 protein was generally consistent for multiple assay methods throughout R6/2 disease progression; however, the results support the use of multiple biochemical techniques to detect mHTT exon 1 protein species for preclinical assessments in HD mouse models expressing mHTT exon 1 protein."	<urn:uuid:37662c73-e6a5-4bde-8639-71aeb9384706>	0.0

workplace safety measures coal mines 1902 compared current nuclear waste facility rules protect workers public	"As workers continue to surmise the damage done to fuel assemblies in three of Fukushima Dai-ichi's six reactors, Japan has been set on a new energy course that, for the first time in its postwar history, sees a reduced role for nuclear power.
That policy shift came after the government ordered the temporary closure of the Hamaoka nuclear plant, considered the country's most vulnerable nuclear facility because it sits directly above an active seismic fault line in a region where seismologists say there is an 87 percent chance of a powerful earthquake striking in the next 30 years.
The facility will remain shut while a 50-foot wall is built to protect it from a massive tsunami of the kind that knocked out vital cooling systems in Fukushima Dai-ichi's reactors — a job that could take up to three years.
Some experts believe the crisis has exposed the administrative malaise at the heart of Japan's nuclear industry, quite apart from its obvious threats to the health of those living near atomic complexes.
Tetsunari Iida, executive director of the Institute for Sustainable Energy, says the traditionally close ties between the nuclear industry, politicians and safety agencies — what he calls Japan's ""nuclear village"" — have hidden the true costs of atomic power plants.
""On the outside we are told it's very safe and cheap, but inside it's rubbish,"" he said. ""That's the nature of the Japanese nuclear community.""
The reality of Japan's nuclear program, according to Iida, comprises aging plants and the perennial problem of how to safely dispose of spent fuel.
""Renewables are becoming the reality,"" he said. ""Even if in Japan solar and wind power are more expensive, nuclear needs higher safety standards and much higher liability coverage. And we have yet to come up with an answer to the question of where to store waste.""
But Keiji Miyazaki, professor emeritus at Osaka University and a specialist in the study of severe accidents, said renewables did not represent an energy panacea.
""Nuclear power is indispensable for Japanese industry and for solving the energy growth and environmental protection,"" he said.
The Japanese public is divided. According to a recent poll, 40 percent of respondents said that the nation's dependence on nuclear power was unavoidable, while 41 percent supported a cut in the number of plants. Only 13 percent said the industry should be shut down altogether."	<urn:uuid:f5f0d617-7a6b-461b-8591-a6b4c755fb0b>	0.0

eprocurement system categories benefits sustainability	"Services procurement is not a silo, but part of the bigger picture for managing wider enterprise spend complexities
The trend of “best of breed” sourcing, contract management and p2p solutions converging to suites, as well as the overall predicted growth of the services economy suggests it only makes sense that services procurement automation will be able to achieve new levels of savings and process efficiency by adopting a wider “source-to-pay” platform approach.
As we’ve addressed in recent blogs, it is clear that procuring services (i.e., people’s time/talent) is not the same as commodities and nor will it ever be — you can’t put people in a box. The need to manage complex features, such as time and talent, that get matched with the award, requires a lot of collaboration, and often third parties involvement.
To meet this need over the past decade, specific technologies have evolved in the eProcurement world to address the needs of managing spend related to a non-employment workforce, such as contingent labor. This evolution was primarily due to the differences in sourcing/purchasing services v. product and the overall inability of traditional eProcurement systems to go beyond managing traditional PO-based processes for receipt of goods and managing services — consider complexities like: complex resource selection process, resource vetting and performance monitoring.
The “niche” market often called Services Procurement is linked, but not directly associated, with wider S2P vendors like Determine. Since these providers are almost exclusively focused on managing the acquisition of talent for specific projects, these technologies are often an additional investment as part of their wider source to pay efforts. But the ability to digitize the process of managing services in terms of adoption has not been nearly as successful as that of managing products with eProcurement technologies.
Part of this is due to the focus of what these solution are designed to do. As Andrew Bartels of Forrester makes clear in his latest report on the subject of services procurement, temp worker are a small part of the purchasing services. For instance, based on the US Census Bureau Services Survey (2015), temporary workers was $119M compared to $2,455M related to professional business services. With spend in services increasing, this has translated into a huge opportunity for organizations to improve the way they capture the bigger fish of professional services spend (i.e. SOW/MSA based spend)."	<urn:uuid:3651fe4f-2981-46a1-8e0f-5868db8de9aa>	0.0
How should I maintain batteries, both for storage and cleaning?	"The need to completely transform our global energy system in response to the threat of climate change is an undertaking that demands technological, policy, and market innovation. It is easy during these times of unprecedented change to become fixated on equally unprecedented technologies. However, sometimes the best solution to a new problem is to simply rethink the tools already at hand.
Recently, I have been reminded of this fact by a remarkably unremarkable method of energy storage: gravity. Approximately 99% of grid-connected energy storage currently in use in the United States is pumped hydro, a system that uses gravity’s pull to draw water through a turbine. This method of storage is both cheaper and longer-lasting than batteries. That said, pumped hydro is constrained in its ability to meet the energy storage demands of a zero-carbon, renewables-dominated grid. It has relatively poor electrical efficiency, it requires many acres of land, and must be sited where there is a natural gradient in elevation. It requires an enormous amount of water, a precious and limited resource in many regions.
Fortunately, gravity is impartial, and our storage systems need not be limited to the movement of water. Two start-up companies—Gravitricity and Energy Vault—believe that the gravitational potential energy of solid mass may hold the key to sustainable and economical storage of energy. These companies have subtly different designs: one proposes dropping a heavy weight down old mine shafts; the other proposes stacking hundreds of concrete bricks into a tower. But the fundamental concept is the same: pull something up with excess energy, and then generate electricity through a winch and generator as it falls.
Many of us are inclined to think that the best solution to the immense challenge of energy storage has to come from a groundbreaking development in batteries or hydrogen production. Perhaps this is a foolish mistake. Based on the technology available to us right now, deceptively simple gravity systems may be one of our most versatile options and could solve many of the limitations inherent in other methods of storage.
- This technology is efficient. Energy Vault says that their system could reach 90% electrical efficiency, compared to approximately 70% for pumped hydro storage and ~35% for reversible fuel cell technology.
- This technology should last for decades, and individual components could be easily replaced should they fail. This is also true for pumped hydro storage, but is a serious limitation of modern lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells which typically last for fewer than 10 years, depending on usage."	<urn:uuid:1b710086-612f-49b1-a8a7-e9ff461769fc>	0.0
planning home repair work difference permanent join stronger stronger adhesive welding	"The high frequency welding process depends upon two phenomena associated with HF current, Skin Effect & Proximity Effect. Skin Effect is the tendency of HF current to concentrate at the surface of a conductor.
The second electrical phenomenon which is important in the HF welding process is Proximity Effect. This is the tendency of the HF current in a pair of go / return conductors to concentrate in the portions of the conductor surfaces which are nearest each other. The physics behind Proximity Effects depends on the fact that the magnetic field surrounding the go / return conductors is more concentrated in the narrow space between them than it is elsewhere. The magnetic lines of force have less room and are squeezed closer together. It follows that Proximity Effect is stronger when the conductors are closer together. It is also stronger when the side facing each other are wider.
Spume is the name generally given to the small particles of metal that are ejected from the welding “V” during the high frequency welding operation as a result of electromagnetic forces produced by the weld current. Stainless steel spume tends to be in the form of very small, spherical particles of metal and refractory oxides. It is extremely important to always have coolant directed at the weld point and in between the deforming wheels to prevent spume build-up.
The optimum weld power is the minimum power at which a satisfactory weld is obtained. Adjustment of the weld power is generally done by observing the spume which occurs at the apex of the weld. The spume, which appears as yellow or orange droplets of small diameter, usually spurts downstream from the weld area. A moderate, continuous spume is the best indication of adequate weld power and steady mill conditions. Uneven spume is an indication of uneven welding conditions and usually of poor weld quality. It can be caused either by mechanical irregularities in the mill, such as deforming wheels, fin tilt roller, tips or excessive weld power.

melanoma prevention vs physical activity benefits cancer patients which more supported by research	"A multidisciplinary team at Yale, led by Yale Cancer Center members, has defined a subgroup of genetic mutations that are present in a significant number of melanoma skin cancer cases. Their findings shed light on an important mutation in this deadly disease, and may lead to more targeted anti-cancer therapies.
The study was published July 27 in Nature Genetics.
The role of mutations in numerous genes and genomic changes in the development of melanoma—a skin cancer with over 70,000 new cases reported in the United States each year—is well established and continues to be the focus of intense research. Yet in approximately 30% of melanoma cases the genetic abnormalities are unclear. To deepen understanding of melanoma mutations, the Yale team conducted a comprehensive analysis using whole-exome sequencing of more than 200 melanoma samples from patients with the disease.
The multidisciplinary team—drawing on their expertise in genetics, cancer, computational biology, pharmacology, and other disciplines—also tested the response of tumor cells with specific mutations to anti-cancer drugs.
The researchers confirmed that a gene known as NF1 is a ""major player"" in the development of skin cancer. ""The key finding is that roughly 45% of melanomas that do not harbor the known BRAF or NRAS mutations display loss of NF1 function, which leads to activation of the same cancer-causing pathway,"" said Michael Krauthammer, M.D., associate professor of pathology and the study's corresponding author.
Additionally, researchers observed that melanoma patients with the NF1 mutation were older and had a greater number of mutations in the tumors. These include mutations in the same pathway, collectively known as RASopathy genes.
Yet mutations in NF1 are not sufficient to cause skin cancer, said Ruth Halaban, senior research scientist in dermatology, a member of Yale Cancer Center, and lead author of the study. ""Loss of NF1 requires more accompanying changes to make a tumor,"" she explained. ""Our study identified changes in about 100 genes that are present only in the malignant cells and are likely to be causative. This panel of genes can now be used in precision medicine to diagnose malignant lesions and can be applied to personalized cancer treatment.""
By testing the response of the melanoma samples to two cancer drugs, the researchers also determined that, in addition to loss of NF1, multiple factors need to be tested to predict the response to the drugs."	<urn:uuid:f9e58582-de5e-4a07-9caa-c66251a44be2>	0.0
I work with youth programs and want to understand the connection between organized group activities and professional counseling - how does the structure of the Bonkers game with its medics and stations relate to the various settings where school psychologists work?	"Professionals in the college counseling field help high school or college students make education and career decisions. Read on to learn about a career as a college counselor.
Is College Counseling For Me?
College counseling falls into two categories: counseling high school students who are looking to enter college, and counseling college students as they progress through college and seek to enter the working world. Both fields require you to be an excellent listener, to exhibit good interpersonal skills and to possess a broad base of knowledge concerning a variety of college and employment options.
In order to enter this type of work, you will most likely need to have a graduate degree in counseling. Most high school guidance counselors have an undergraduate degree related to education or educational psychology, and some states require counselors to have some teaching experience. Counselors working in higher education settings need to meet similar educational requirements. Along with a graduate degree, you may need to be licensed or certified in order to work in counseling, which will require passing exams and completing continuing education requirements. Licensing requirements may be different depending upon whether you work directly for a school or work independently or as part of a practice.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the field of counseling in educational settings was expected to grow by 12% between 2012 and 2022. The majority of counselors work in educational or vocational practices, and the median annual salary for school and career counselors in 2012 was $53,610. According to the BLS, elementary and secondary school counselors had a median annual wage of $60,560, university, junior college and professional school counselors earned a median annual wage of $46,630. Job prospects were expected to remain positive in this field as school enrollments increase.
How Can I Work As A College Counselor?
Requirements for working in this field will vary depending on where you want to work and the type of counseling you would like to do. College counselors in both high schools and colleges work with people to help them discern appropriate collegiate and employment paths. This requires meeting with students and helping them to develop approaches for college or job searches. Sometimes this may take the form of teaching students how to interview for jobs and fill out job or college applications.
Counseling at both the high school and college levels will also involve assessing personality traits that may help or disqualify students from a field of study or job."	<urn:uuid:44be68f3-8d66-43b3-9171-37f735bfb091>	0.0
I love haunted places! Which hotels are known for ghost sightings?	"Spirits/Ghosts inhabit certain locations for a variety of reasons and, in most situations, are tied to that spot. This seems
to be either because of choice or because the spirit is trapped, due to the fact that his/her life ended suddenly and left
them in confusion.
Do objects become haunted?
Yes, it has been known that certain things can become haunted.
Usually haunted items are antiques that the spirit or ghost was drawn too or used when they was living.
Are animals and children more sensitive to Ghosts/Spirits?
Yes. More animals than children are sensitive to seeing spirits or ghosts. Dogs and cats seem to be more sensitive than
any other animal on the planet. They often bark, whine or merely seem fascinated by what appears to be a empty hallway, room
Spirits/Ghosts do seem to be drawn to small children. Most researchers think this is because a child’s belief system
is not as developed as a adults. They haven’t learned about ghosts or spirits. This is why I think children end up with
imaginary friends that adults can’t see.
Are haunted places only active after dark?
No, and despite what Hollywood and the movies tell you, there is no time of day that is more active than another. The best

Why do some ghost/spirits manifest as smells?
There have been ghosts/spirits that as odors in various locations. Many ghost hunters have investigated, and have even
experienced, locations where ghostly odors are present. They often make themselves known through smells of flowers, cigars,
perfume, liquor, body odor, etc…..These are just a few of many smells that they can make themselves known. The list
I had one investigation where I was at a tavern and the ghosts/spirits favorite drink was whiskey. I suddenly became drunk
and had the whiskey taste in my mouth and actually vomited."	<urn:uuid:0c8f2dda-cb58-41b7-8cb5-543bcd331cbc>	0.0

breeding for disease resistance in floriculture crops limitations and biotroph pathogen characteristics	"Description of the topic
Tar spot complex (TSC) is a very important foliar disease of maize in many parts of the Americas. The disease complex involves three different fungal pathogens causing significant maize yield losses in tropical and subtropical areas with relatively cool and humid climates. Because of the complexity of the disease, very little is known about the epidemiology and virulence of each of the three pathogens. In addition, although CIMMYT already has several sources of resistance to this disease, very little is known about the relationship and diversity of the available germplasm and its resistance mechanisms.
The candidate is expected to study the epidemiology of each or some of the three pathogens involved in the complex. This will include investigating modes of pathogen survival (oversummering), transmission, infection, temperature and humidity requirements for pathogen development, among other things. In addition, the candidate will be involved in studies investigating the diversity of the pathogen and plant-pathogen interactions at the phenotypic level and on a molecular level (provided that funds and resources for this are available at the time). Lastly, the candidate will help develop genetic populations for studying TSC and other maize diseases (e.g., northern leaf blight or turcicum leaf blight) and will learn field, laboratory and greenhouse techniques used to improve the disease resistance of maize germplasm.
Experience working with maize germplasm and pathogens; willingness to work in the field; ability to work in hot and humid environments; good English skills so the candidate will be able to write and publish scientific papers upon completion of his/her stay at CIMMYT."	<urn:uuid:c3246a2a-3e67-4538-8466-ab8a2d8b9488>	0.0
What happens when thick layers of algae form on lakes?	"I have my students locate the box next to the arrow for sublimation, and write the word in the box. I explain that when conditions are right, snow and ice will sublimate, or change state from a solid to a gas - without ever going to a liquid state. This process is called sublimation.
I have my students locate the box next to the arrow for condensation, and write the word in the box. I explain that when this water vapor rises, it cools. I ask my students, ""What did you learn about the particles in matter when heat is added or removed?"" I call on a student who correctly responds that matter changes state. I confirm that yes, it does change state. The water vapor that was in a gas state condenses, or changes from a gas to a liquid. This process is called condensation.
I have my students locate the box next to the arrow for precipitation, and write the word in the box. I explain that these particles of gas, in the form of water vapor, condense on particles of dust, smoke, and salt. When they grow heavier enough, the droplets fall as precipitation. Most precipitation is in the form of rain. However, if conditions are right, then precipitation can also fall as snow, hail (ice pellets) or sleet (rain mixed with snow).
I have my students locate the box next to the arrow for runoff, and ask them to write the term ""surface runoff"" in the box. I explain that surface runoff happens when snow and ice melt, and flow into streams, rivers, and lakes. Melting snow and ice are a major source of the movement of water world wide.
I have my students find the arrow for infiltration, and write the word in the box. I explain that some water infiltrates, or soaks into the shallow layers of soil, and some goes deeper into groundwater aquifers (underground layers of rock that are saturated or soaked with water).
I tell my students that there is one more term that is very important to ecosystems, but that it isn't on our diagram, so we will have to write it in. I have them locate the arrow for flora and fauna, and write it in (no box). Since this is a great place to review these previously introduced vocabulary terms - I ask for their meaning. I confirm them and state that I am primarily concerned today with flora."	<urn:uuid:a0b2d6bc-3d2e-4f35-b9c1-7d3f69faef7d>	0.0

I research historical artifacts and space technology preservation. I'm wondering about the relationship between underwater preservation of 16th-century Spanish artifacts and the preservation of orbital space for future use. What preservation challenges exist in both contexts?	"An orientation was presented by the Isle Royale National Park Cultural Resource Manager Seth DePasqual and project leader Randolph Beebe. The day ended with Bob Nelson cooking a great meal and an evening by the campfire discussing the next days dive plan.
August 6, 2011
There were two separate missions planned on this date and the group was split into two separate teams. The
R/V Preservation departed the dock at Amygdaloid Ranger Station early in the morning with 5 out of the 6 of the available divers to begin a systematic series of dives covering the bottom of McCargoe Cove locating and document any cultural artifacts that were found. It was decided that due to previous historic activity and water visibility the teams would work from the North end of the cove and move in a Southerly direction
While the dive teams were busy with the underwater survey the second team, using WolfsHead Research's boat the
R/V Arctic Fox and Imagenex side-scan sonar, surveyed the entirety of the cove using both the 300khz and 800khz resolutions. All of this data was recorded for future ground-truthing dives to identify any anomalies that were found.
On these two dates the dive team was split evenly between the two boats and a series of dives were made systematically surveying the Cove bottom. It was during these dives that the methodology and procedures of the survey were fine tuned using input from all of the GLSPS members and the National Park Service. Once the crews became comfortable with the survey techniques progress sped up considerably and quality data was being collected on artifacts by combining diver description, U/W photos and GPS coordinates.
August 9, 2011
On this, the last day slated for underwater work, the divers were once again divided. The divers on the
R/V Preservation continued the survey work and the R/V Arctic Fox, with 3 divers, conducted follow up dives on selected side-scan sonar anomalies. The teams were once again combined for follow-up dive briefings and evening relaxation at Amygdaliod Island
August 10, 2011
This was the planned date to cruise back to Grand Portage, but due to high winds out of the NW it was decided to postpone the crossing for a day. The day was spent organizing paperwork and data and exploring Amygdaliod Island."	<urn:uuid:3c5bdd77-4c45-41c5-9355-73e949c70ad8>	0.0

why is aging process hard to understand for scientists	"4 Basic Causes Behind Skin Aging You Should Understand
There are different causes behind skin aging and they are the following: aging caused by hormones, aging caused by environmental factors, aging caused by lifestyle factors and aging caused by genetic factors. Getting older is a normal process that all of us will eventually experience.
The skin’s texture and appearance changes as we age. To keep your skin look youthful, one of the things that you can do is to nurture it with nourishing products such as argan oil anti aging . Additionally, to know the proper steps to take in delaying aging, one needs to understand the different causes behind it. Aging caused by hormones Dry and thin skin, poor skin quality, less elasticity, pimple problems and wrinkles are all signs of a hormonal aging process.
Hormone level changes are linked to hormonal aging. Depending on the production and fluctuation of the hormones involved, this type of aging can happen early in a person’s life or much later. Hormonal aging is commonly associated with a woman’s menopausal stage or the pre-menopausal and post-menopausal stages. The environment as a contributing factor to skin aging Aging brought about by environmental factors is categorized as an extrinsic aging process. It is caused by external factors rather than by the body’s internal processes. Pollution and radiation from the sun are two of the factors involved.
The sun’s radiation can damage the DNA and destroys the skin’s natural regeneration ability. Environmental aging usually occurs prematurely so it can happen to anyone regardless of age. But, with proper skincare, this type of aging can be avoided. Wrinkles, brittle and dry skin, as well as hyper-pigmentation are among the signs of this type of skin aging. Lifestyle factors can cause aging There are also certain lifestyle factors that can contribute to premature aging. The aging of the skin can either be delayed or accelerated, depending on the person’s good or bad habits.
Cigarette smoking is one bad habit that have a negative effect on the skin. Research has shown that the skin becomes dry and wrinkled when a person constantly smokes because smoking diminishes vitamin C in the body. Exposing your skin to too much sun is also a bad habit that hastens skin aging. As previously mentioned, the sun is among the elements in the environment that can lead to premature skin aging. Sunscreen with a high SPF factor will protect your skin from the harmful rays of the sun."	<urn:uuid:babf9310-d055-48bb-9d28-a94991eb99c4>	0.0
I've noticed that many homes are shifting to low-flow fixtures to save water, but what specific problems can these fixtures face when dealing with hard water?	"The cause of these leaks differ, but things like pipe age, tree root intrusion, seismic activity, and animal activity often are contributing factors.
This issue, while similar to irrigation leakage, is much more severe usually.
When attempting to tell if leakage is in lateral line or irrigation line water supply pipes, the amount of additional water consumption noted onto your utility bills can serve as a sign.
For such leaks, the most excellent solution is to call a professional. An expert Plumber Lynnwood can recommend the finest solution for the issue—like traditional trench and replace, pipe bursting or trenchless pipe lining.
Old, Outdated Fixtures And Toilets
Many houses have a very long history connected to them, and likewise older plumbing fixtures.
In the recent years, there are many efficiency improvements that were made to the common water fixtures, like new-modelled aerators for faucets, water-saving shower head and lower-flow water-saving toilet.
This hardly shows up as sudden problem—it is generally something which comes with the home and make you pay high water bill from day one itself.
Check your house’s showerheads, faucets, toilets, and other water-utilizing equipment for the WaterSense labelling, and date of manufacture. Whenever buying a new house, ask the real estate agent or owner how old are the plumbing fixtures."	<urn:uuid:1d57a0bd-08a3-488e-8531-8d5f10cc8e2c>	0.0
legal requirements new company formation	"On Feb. 9 the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted four laws within the local self-government reform and decentralization in the second and final readings, namely:
– Law “On Amendments to Some Laws of Ukraine concerning the acquisition of authority by village, town and city mayors”.
The legal act defines the procedure for acquisition of powers and limits the newly elected heads to combine their official duties with other activities. Moreover, before the acquisition of powers a village, town or city mayor should undergo compulsory registration by the relevant territorial election commission.
– Law “On Amendments to Some Legislative Acts of Ukraine concerning the Status of a Village, Town Headman”.
The law defines the limits of headman’s duties, his/her powers, grounds and reasons for his/her resignation, guarantees of duties etc. Moreover, the document introduces a new concept of territory formation called “starostynskyi okruh” (eng. headman district). According to the concept, the boundaries of districts will coincide with the territories, controlled by the councils of amalgamated local communities (ALCs). This innovation will promote the ubiquity of the headman concept within an ALC and guarantee the rights and interests of all residents of villages and towns.
– Law “On Amendments to some Legislative Acts of Ukraine concerning voluntary amalgamation of local communities”.
This legal act enables communities to join established ALCs under the simplified procedure. The law aims at the formation of really “wealthy communities” and defines the characteristic features, under which a newly created community can be considered as wealthy.
Thus, this community should be formed around the center, determined by a perspective plan of formation of territories of local communities, and at least half of the number of residents, specified by the plan, should live there. In this case, every successive local community should join this community under the simplified procedure.
Joining an ALC provides the election of deputies to the board of the ALC, however, the election of the ALC head isn’t held. Thus, representation of all areas in the newly created community should be promoted.
– Law “On service in local self-government bodies”.
This law establishes new principles of service in local self-government bodies. The document introduces a new division of posts in local government bodies into categories, contains requirements for political objectiveness of employees, professional requirements for the post applicants, determines a competition procedure, etc."	<urn:uuid:427b36fe-43b6-4e78-bc60-1d1c3fb2a346>	0.0

how compare quiet calm behavior reinforcement methods dogs birds	"However, 18% reported using an “alpha roll” and as many as 26% used a “stare down” to “correct” their dog. 11% admitting to hitting or kicking their dogs, and 14% to roughly grabbing the dog by the scruff or jowls.
Here are the numbers that matter: The most confrontational, and I would argue, aggressive, behaviors on the part of the owners resulted in the highest levels of aggressive responses from the dogs. 43% of dogs responded with aggression to being hit or kicked, 38% to having an owner grab their mouth and take out an object forcefully, 36% to having a muzzle put on (or attempted?), 29% to a “dominance down,” 26% to a jowl or scruff shake. You get the idea. Of course, these are all dogs who were seen by veterinary behaviorists for aggression-related problems, but it makes the data even more important. Violence begets violence, aggression begets aggression.
An important distinction: Note that the authors, correctly, did NOT label the owner’s responses as “punishment” or “reinforcement.” For one thing, “punishment” is an action that results in a decrease in behavior, so if an owner stares a dog down (argh! who ever started that idea anyway!) and the dog becomes more aggressive, the stare down was not punishment. Second, there are all kinds of actions correctly termed as “positive punishment” that have nothing to do with force or confrontations. For example, I use tons of food (positive reinforcement) to teach dogs a solid stay, and respond to breaks in a stay with a Body Block (Here’s a video as an example.). A Body Block is an example of positive punishment (adding something to decrease the frequency of a behavior), but it is not confrontational or threatening if done correctly. (Note how little I move in the video, and how cheerful the entire episode is.)
Thus, the study is not so much about “reinforcement” and “punishment,” as about what happens when you threaten your dog, or forcefully and physically respond to misbehavior. Please be clear that I am not saying that if one of us occasionally raises our voice to our dog, or has a moment of humanity and loses our temper, we are going to destroy our dogs forever."	<urn:uuid:d4b3ebdf-a32f-4cc6-a7bb-6f72f0b69a22>	0.0

regular vs changing dividend payments impact on company value advantages disadvantages	"What is a debt buyback offer?
A debt takeover bid occurs when a company redeems some or all of its outstanding bonds or other debt securities. This is accomplished by making an offer to its creditors to buy back a predetermined number of bonds at a specified price and for a specified period of time.
Companies can use a debt tender offer as a mechanism for restructuring or refinancing capital. It is similar to a public tender offer, where a company solicits shareholders to buy back the shares of the company.
Key points to remember
- A debt tender offer is a public solicitation of bondholders of a company asking them to resell their bonds or debt securities at a specified price and for a certain period of time.
- Companies will consider a takeover bid when interest rates fall, making the cost of borrowing cheaper than holding onto older bonds at higher fixed coupons.
- The takeover bid may be made in cash or by exchanging old bonds for newly issued debt securities of equivalent value.
Understanding debt buyback offers
When a company issues debt securities such as bonds, it receives a capital loan from the investors who buy it. To compensate these creditors for the borrowed funds, the issuer will typically pay regular interest or coupons to the holders of the debt in addition to promising to repay the principal when the bond matures.
Interest payments, which are often fixed, represent a cost of debt for the issuer. It is possible that prevailing interest rates in the economy will change during the life of the bond. When interest rates rise, the value of existing bonds decreases since the coupon rate is lower than the prevailing interest rate. Similarly, when interest rates in the economy decline, issuers will be forced to pay the higher coupon rates attached to the bond unless they restructure their debt securities.
One method of debt restructuring to take advantage of lower borrowing costs is to make a public debt tender offer to bondholders. In other words, corporate bond issuers are turning to debt takeover bids as a way to eliminate or reduce over-leveraged, risky or high-cost capital structures.
Although tenders have many advantages, they have some disadvantages. A takeover bid can be a long and expensive process, as custodian banks verify the bonds presented and issue payments on behalf of the creditors.
Types of takeover bids
A debt tender offer is an opportunity for an issuing company to redeem its existing bonds at a price below the original face value and, therefore, reduce its related interest costs."	<urn:uuid:32514425-27a5-466a-a65e-c5d9e99ce18f>	0.0
services available schizophrenia treatment social support medication therapy residential care	"In most cases, the recovery phase will involve a variety of treatment methods, such as counseling sessions, peer support, and if needed, medical care. Treatment is also adjusted depending on the needs of the patient.
Treatment of psychological addiction to drugs is usually done in the second phase of the inpatient rehabilitation process. This second part of treatment is crucial, because when a person starts to abuse a drug, not only does the physical body become addicted, but so does the mind. Treating psychological struggles with addiction are just as important as addressing the physical symptoms.
If staying at a drug rehab center is not for you, then, there are outpatient treatment options available. With outpatient services, you can live at home while attending substance abuse treatment sessions for several days a week at the rehabilitation facility.
Outpatient rehab programs are similar to inpatient rehab services in that there are different types of treatment depending on the types and intensity of services available. Outpatient treatment programs can vary in length. Some intensive outpatient programs can require a minimum of 9 hours and up to 20 hours of participation in treatment per week. Patients can take part in this type of program for two months and up to one year if needed. Matching the patient with the right treatment program will depend on the level of severity of the addiction, the length of time they have been using the drug, and their health and life commitments.
Individuals enrolled in outpatient programs will also have the options of individual and group therapy, support groups, medication treatments, and workshops on life-coping skills.
Completing your initial rehabilitation phase is just part of the recovery process. Depending on your level of addiction and particular needs, you may also need to look at extended care and possibly long-term rehab.
Patients that seek support for lifelong sobriety will choose one of these options. When looking at ongoing care, you can also choose between inpatient residential programs and outpatient programs.
There are also options for people who may not be ready to return home once they complete rehab. Sober-living homes can provide living arrangements during an individual’s extended care process. This works as a transitional period and atmosphere until a person is ready to go back into society.
Long-term rehabilitation is the same as inpatient rehab, but for a more extended period, that can range from 6 to 12 months. This type of rehabilitation is helpful for individuals that are severely addicted or may be at risk for chronic relapse."	<urn:uuid:2c8ac7ce-5ac5-436f-b153-87d2e9847770>	0.0
what temperature needed for seeds to start growing	"Mesa Public Library adds to the environment with a seed library
Monday, Nov. 23, 2015
MESA – Hoping to dispel the notion that there is a “very outdated perception of libraries as stuffy places with shelves,” the Mesa Public Library has started a seed library, where patrons can use the free seeds to start a garden, according to librarian Cherise Mead.
The library has 30 varieties of seed that grow into edible produce. Becky Knutson, an active gardener, was thrilled when she found out about the seed library.
“Not only is it a great idea – not only could I get free seeds, which is wonderful. But I can also give back to the community.” Knutson said.
At the end of a growing season, patrons are encouraged to bring back the seeds that they harvested and donate them back to the seed library.
Library cardholders are allowed to take three seed packets a month.
Each individual seed card helps with the process of planting by providing information – like what season it can be planted in, when it will be ready to harvest and how much sun is needed. The seeds are changed out every season by Garden Pool, the non-profit that provides the seeds.
“We really hope to run out of seeds every season,” said Dennis McClung, president of Garden Pool. “That’s our goal. We want to start as many gardens as we can.”
Knutson has already planted a packet of seeds she took home from the library on opening day.
“I was like ‘only three? How can you choose and narrow it down to just three?’” she said. “I’ll definitely be going back next month and seeing what else I can grow.”

How clean are airplanes between flights, and what precautions help avoid illness?	"The Application Process is straightforward, yet detail-oriented. Below, find a step-by-step guide and tips to avoid common mistakes when using a roller to apply polyurethane for a smooth finish.
Step-by-step Guide To Roller Application
- Choose the Right Roller. Select a high-quality foam or microfiber roller for best results.
- Prepare the Surface. Sand the wood smoothly and remove all dust.
- Mix Polyurethane Gently. Stir, don’t shake, to avoid bubbles.
- Test the Application. Practice on a scrap piece of wood first.
- Apply Thin Layers. Roll on the polyurethane in thin, even coats.
- Let it Dry. Wait for the recommended drying time between coats.
- Sand Between Coats. Use fine-grit sandpaper for a smooth base.
- Repeat as Necessary. Apply additional coats for a stronger finish.
- Clean Up. Use mineral spirits to clean the roller.
Common Mistakes To Avoid
- Skipping Surface Prep. Always sand and clean the wood before application.
- Applying Too Much Pressure. Roll lightly to avoid bubbles and drips.
- Using a Worn Roller. Ensure the roller is in good condition.
- Ignoring Drying Times. Patience is key for a flawless finish.
- Forgetting Sanding. Sanding between coats is crucial for adhesion.
With these steps and precautions, applying polyurethane with a roller can be a simple task that leads to professional-looking results.
Aftercare Of Polyurethane Finishes
Aftercare of Polyurethane Finishes plays a crucial role in ensuring durability and shine. Once applied with a roller, there are vital steps to follow. Proper aftercare extends the life of the finish. It also maintains the surface’s aesthetic appeal. Let’s guide you through the essentials.
Drying Time And Ventilation
The right drying time is key for a flawless polyurethane finish. Respect these timelines:
- Touch: 6-8 hours.
- Light use: 24 hours.
- Cure: 3-4 days.
Good ventilation speeds up drying. It avoids dust setting into wet polyurethane. Keep the area well-aired. Use fans if necessary.
Maintenance And How To Fix Imperfections
Regular maintenance is essential to keep surfaces looking great. Follow these tips:
- Dust often with a microfiber cloth.
- Clean spills quickly to prevent damage.
- Avoid harsh chemicals for cleaning."	<urn:uuid:f8f58da3-2dad-4ac0-a0fd-2d84103b97dd>	0.0

I'm doing home repairs - what's the safest way to work high up?	"The best way to repair any type of surface, whether a brick or a concrete slab, is with stucco. Although stucco can be difficult to work with if not applied correctly, it can be done for any kind of surface. With some level of DIY expertise, anyone can handle most minor stucco repairs, but it’s wise to leave the more complex repairs to professional contractors as you might end up doing even more damage than good.
With so many different types of stucco products on the market, and so many companies claiming to offer “the best,” how do you know which one you should buy? The first step is to consider the area that will need repairs, including what type of repairs are needed. For example, if your home has siding, then a specific type of stucco is probably not necessary. However, there are other types of stucco that are better suited to siding repairs.
Next, you should determine the size and type of damage that needs to be repaired. If your home has extensive damage, it may not be possible for you to repair the entire surface yourself, so having a professional come out and inspect your home is probably in your best interest. In the case of damaged areas that cannot be fixed by hand, such as a cracked driveway or sidewalk, you should contact a stucco company that specializes in driveway repairs. A professional stucco company should also be able to recommend the best products for repairing damage caused by hail, tree limbs, or other objects. The company should be able to provide you with some suggestions for choosing the products to use for the repairs and should let you know if they do any repair jobs on a walk-in basis.
Once you know the extent of your stucco damage and have determined the types of repairs that are necessary, you will need to decide whether the damage is so extensive that it cannot be repaired. For instance, if your home has multiple layers of siding, you might have to replace the entire roof. While the roof is not usually the first thing to be replaced, it’s still important to consider what it will cost to repair the other layers of the siding. If your home is completely destroyed by hail, then replacing the entire sections of the home might be the only option. It is wise to also check for leaks in the home, and make sure that you are aware of any problems before you start any repairs. to avoid problems later."	<urn:uuid:d98f3e87-1899-4e87-9d96-b38cbb6dacf1>	0.0

Hey, I'm learning about farming and wondering which wastes more water - the traditional gravity-flow system used in farming or the aquaponics setup where fish help grow plants?	"Create a Wicking Bed Garden for Easy Vegetable Growing powered by Fishwater
Recently when we were filming Murray Hallam and Milne Matthews talking about their aquaponics systems, the conversation turned to their wicking beds that they both used for growing root crops. Although water is mainly used in conventional dirt gardens, Murray and Milne were also using fish water from their aquaponics system to water their wicking systems with spectacular results. We had a few questions raised on Murray’s Aquaponics forum for more information.
What is a Wicking Bed?
A wicking vegetable garden bed system is an easy to build vegetable growing system developed in Australia by Colin Austin who looked at solutions to growing food systems in desert communities. The fact that it works so well for the lazy gardener is a bonus! Wicking Beds are essentially an enclosed water reservoir that allows the vegetables to be watered from below the plant’s root zone. Its an idea way to grow root crops. Normally the system is powered by rainwater. But adding nutrient rich fish water from your aquaponics system will turbo charge your wicking bed even more. The fish water is fed once a week in summer through a slotted pipe that allows the water to flow down and slowly “wick” it’s way up through capillary action and feed the plant roots from the bottom up. Its an ideal solution if you live in a hot dry environment or like we do – with lots of sandy soil where nutrients are easily leeched away. Its also a good way to grow root crops like potatoes and carrots in a conventional dirt garden system rather than aquaponics which suit above ground growing plants like lettuce and tomatoes.
What sort of container for Wicking Beds?
Murray uses a fibreglass tub at least 400mm deep but there is really no set rule as to how deep you should make them. Some people use an old refrigerator or bathtub found at the tip. You could use an infinite variety of containers provided they do not leak. If you take a look at the video clip here your will see Murray explaining Wicking Beds with Milne Matthews at around the 9:35 mark. Just scroll the Youtube video clip forward and see them explain how the system works. Murray uses a 90mm diameter pipe with slots cut out at the base to enable water to leak out of the pipe. An elbow joiner and a short raised section completes the main assembly."	<urn:uuid:031c814e-7809-40ef-a417-27b598d42f1d>	0.0
I want to start a fish tank - what are the basics for keeping fish healthy and making it look nice?	"Overall, I would definitely recommend these fish fingers to everybody as they are filled with flavour for a bargain price of 60p, who could say no? Thanks for reading.
Whenever my son has his friend round for tea, his friend always leaves most of his food. I always make sure that he likes what I am making prior to cooking but it really makes no difference. With this in mind and with my son mentioning that he had eaten fish fingers at his friends the week before I thought I would buy a packet for this weeks feast!
Most of the fish fingers in the frozen aisle were around the £2 mark, some a little more. Fortunately in the 'specials' freezer at the end of the aisle I spotted the basics fish fingers - normally I have to seek out basics products, it is very rare to find them so readily on display!
Ten fish fingers are sold in a cardboard box. Simply packaged as with all other basics products. Plain white with the trade mark orange basics logo.
At 99p, I didn't expect too much from the fish fingers - but as they would be likely to be left on the plate anyway, I wasn't too bothered.
The fingers are covered in bread crumbs and and look pretty much the same as any branded fish finger. They are perhaps a little thinner but this is negligible.
I cooked all ten at once - in the oven on a baking tray. They take 15 minutes to cook from frozen. They can also be grilled for 10-12 minutes, or fried for 5-6 minutes.
What went in to the oven a pale-ish orangey colour, came out a nice warm autumnal brown/orange.
There isn't a horrible fishy smell as they cook, or when they are removed from the oven which is good as I find these smells tend to linger in the kitchen.
It would be rude not to try one of the fingers so I did. In the past I have found breaded fingers to be a little crispy for my liking, however long I cook them for. Not so in this case, the fingers are easily cut with a knife, they almost fall apart on cutting. The fish inside is extremely moist and I have to say very tasty. So tasty that my sampling of the product resulted in my consuming 3 of the fingers one after the other! The third with tomato sauce!"	<urn:uuid:72c48eb8-f4fd-4029-849a-43a04614d5c4>	0.0
memory security differences dram mram	"Samsung builds chips to supercharge your smartphone
Samsung Tuesday announced production of its first ultra-high-speed, 4Gbit low-power mobile DRAM chip, which uses the company’s most compact circuitry to date.
“By providing the most efficient next-generation mobile memory with a very large data capacity, we are now enabling OEMs to introduce even more innovative designs in the marketplace,” Young-Hyun Jun, executive vice president of memory sales for Samsung Electronics, said in a statement.
The new double data rate 3 (LPDDR3) mobile DRAM, which is produced using a 20-nanometer manufacturing process, can transmit data at up to 2.1Gbps per pin. The new DRAM performance is more than double that of the preceding memory standard mobile DRAM (LPDDR2), which had a data transmission rate of up to 800Mbps.
Here’s what a mobile device with the Samsung chip with 2.1Gbps performance embedded in it can do: transmit three full HD videos, collectively 17GB in length, in one second.
Improved performance; lower power consumption
Samsung said its new LPDDR3 mobile DRAM enables seamless display of full HD video on smartphones with five inch-or-larger screens. In comparison to a 30nm-class LPDDR3 DRAM, the new device generates more than a 30% improvement in performance and 20% savings in power consumption, the company said.
The new 20nm process node also offers mobile devices 2GB of memory by using four of the new chips, which have a height of 0.8mm or about 0.3 inches."	<urn:uuid:c003860a-456d-40b1-b6c0-9f184495b88c>	0.0

In what way did private businesses have the power to influence television news content through their advertising?	"Hire an experienced consultant to tackle the work you don’t have the time and resources to do.
Public Relations & Community Outreach
PR builds your sphere of influence through established media channels without the burden of paying to play. Businesses and organizations rely on expert communication to the public to:
- Promote community initiatives
- Address crises
- Mobilize support
You deserve to reach your audience without paid advertising, which often proves ineffective in furthering messages in true depth. Paid ads may seem the most direct way to your audience, but discerning audiences easily spot the difference between earned media and sponsored content. Being featured in renowned local, regional and national news outlets lends credibility to your community outreach strategy.
Your business or organization has a story to tell. You must tell it well by building and promoting a narrative around what you do.
Great PR professionals find ways to make the news. They find opportune times to weigh in on key events affecting clients and stakeholders. They turn your organization into a human-interest machine — beyond the occasional press release — using established and trusted media channels to amplify the message.
Enlisting the unbiased eyes of a third-party consultant helps to adjust failing strategies, refine messaging and produce a volume of multimedia.
Digital Marketing & Website Development
We live in a digitally dominated world. So where do you tell your brand’s story? Online, of course, where you’re sure to reach your audience as they seek answers to questions and engage with content virtually all day, every day, on multiple devices.
Users act and engage online in specific ways. It’s who they are: wonderfully different and unique in every way. They seek digital storytelling for education, enlightenment and entertainment in the following places:
- Social media
- & More
Businesses and organizations must strategize helpful digital content to meet audience needs. Whether you work in B2B or B2C markets, digital marketing should establish thought leadership in your industry. Great website development and digital presence — with a little edge from SEO — boosts relevant traffic and qualified sales leads while helping to retain brand evangelists.
But storytelling for the sake of storytelling doesn’t tell your brand’s story on its own. It must be crafted, honed, developed, revised, scrapped and revised again. Here, too, an unbiased consultant proves valuable in constructing effective messaging and distributing where appropriate online.

As a marine biologist studying gull feeding behaviors, I'm curious about how gulls manage to process both fresh and salt water, and what specialized adaptations they have for different feeding methods?	"I don't have a complete understanding of the structural variability in g.glaucoides, but the individuals I've seen in Newfoundland have all been very short-billed round headed individuals.

""Yellow-legged Gulls of Newfoundland""
Let me preface this post by saying this is not meant to be a treatise on the identification of Yellow-legged Gulls,there has already been lots written on that topic and better presented than I'm capable of doing here. I'm writing this purely to show what our Yellow-legged Gulls look like in hopes that it might assist other birders in finding Yellow-legged Gulls outside Newfoundland. I'll present evidence to demonstrate that Newfoundland YLGU's are likely of the subspecies atlantis and will also include criteria for separation from possible hybrid look-alikes such as HERG X LBBG. Even though its nice having the monopoly on this species for North America,I suspect a few YLGU's are flying under the radar of east coast birder in other provinces and states.
Most of what we know about Yellow-legged Gull in North America comes from the hard work done by the 'Godfather' of Newfoundland gulling, Bruce Mactavish. Bruce had been finding these mysterious Yellow-legged, dark mantled birds for years before they were ever considered a separate species and long before anyone else cared about them."	<urn:uuid:723efe8c-7675-435a-8a34-4036011658f5>	0.0
why study space rocks importance history	"The following is the text for an introduction I made at a public event of this year’s Space and Place theme fellows at the Humanities Center at Northeastern. More thoughts on the GeoHumanities are forthcoming.
This year’s fellows are exploring the theme of space and place in an interdisciplinary context. To me this represents an exciting opportunity to start a conversation across disciplines at an opportune moment. Across the humanities and social sciences we are experiencing a flourishing of work that takes spatiality seriously. Space and place have often been seen as either a setting for other, more important, processes in culture and society to take place or, alternatively, as the outcome of these processes – a kind of end product. A series of developments both within disciplines and across disciplines have changed this in fundamental ways.
First of all we have seen what is called the spatial turn across the humanities and social scientists. This refers to a general recognition that social and cultural life do not happen on the head of a pin but are thoroughly spatial. The spatial turn made its presence felt, for instance, in the study of literature, where space and place had been too often relegated to mere setting – the least active or interesting component in the assemblage of literary texts. Pioneering work by scholars working across disciplines but rooted in literature –scholars such as Raymond Williams and Edward Said – placed the geography of and in literature at the center of our understanding of the relationship between text and context in ways which enlivened our reading of the canon and started to introduce writing from the previously excluded margins. In History we saw the emergence of spatial history with the magisterial work of Richard White and, particularly, Paul Carter’s Road to Botany Bay – subtitled “an essay in spatial history”. Feminist scholars such as Elizabeth Grosz and Iris Marion Young wove space and place into their accounts of the construction of masculine worlds and their radical alternatives. The spatial turn was given a significant boost when Michel Foucault, whose work of prisons, the asylum and the clinic were all quite radically spatial in nature, became an evangelist for the importance of space in an essay published in 1984.
The great obsession of the nineteenth century was, as we know, history: with its themes of development and of suspension, of crisis, and cycle, themes of the ever-accumulating past, with its great preponderance of dead men and the menacing glaciation of the world."	<urn:uuid:fef420b4-f606-4644-a670-264808a9f813>	0.0
body parts affected superficial blisters disease	"Polymyositis is a connective tissue disease that triggers inflammation and muscular weakness. The cause is unknown, but polymyositis is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, possibly triggered by a viral infection of muscle tissue.
The disease is more common in women than men and tends to develop between the ages of 50 to 70 years, although anyone of any age or either sex can be affected. Usually, the muscle weakness develops gradually over the course of a few weeks or months. The inflammation may spread to other areas of the body including the heart.
Since symptoms differ between individuals, polymyositis is hard to diagnose and may be mistaken for muscular dystrophy. In many cases, polymyositis is associated with other autoimmune disorders of connective tissue such as scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren’s syndrome.
Symptoms of polymyositis
The symptoms include:
- The shoulders and hips usually affected first
- Muscular weakness
- Muscle wastage
- Muscle pain
- Swallowing difficulties
- Tremors, particularly of the hands
- Wide-footed stance and walking style
- Tendency to fall over.
Progression of weakness
Polymyositis develops gradually over weeks or months. By the time the person experiences symptoms, they have already lost around half of their muscle fibres to the disease. The head, hands and feet are usually untouched by the disease. Difficulties may include:
- Profound muscular weakness in affected body parts, such as being unable to lift the arms above shoulder height or lift the head off a pillow
- Voice changes, if the muscles of the larynx are affected
- Problems with swallowing if the oesophagus is affected, with a tendency to regurgitate food
- Peristalsis (the muscular contractions of the bowel) may falter, leading to constipation
- In its later stages, abnormal shortening of muscles (contracture).
A malfunction of the immune system
The cause of polymyositis hasn’t been found, but there is good evidence to indicate that it is likely to be an autoimmune disorder, which means the immune cells mistakenly attack the muscle fibres of the body. If a small tag (biopsy) of affected muscle is examined in a laboratory, it looks withered and studded with immune system cells."	<urn:uuid:b7bca838-6387-4010-a2eb-44917dc65254>	0.0
I'm concerned about both indoor comfort and worker safety in the construction industry. How does insulation help control indoor temperature, and what health risks do construction workers face from dust exposure?	"Construction Accident Lawyers
The construction industry is the most dangerous industry in the United States. Every year, there are roughly 150,000 construction accidents according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, approximately 1,000 of which result in death. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has reported that one in ten construction site workers are injured every year, with workers being at most risk between the ages of 25 and 34 years.
Some of the most common construction accidents causing injury include:
- Falls from scaffolds, ladders, roofs, elevator shafts, etc.
- Nail gun, saw, or other power equipment injuries
- Crane operation injuries
- Toxic exposure
- Defective Equipment
Construction accident injuries may be substantial, resulting in millions of dollars in damages in any one particular case. If you were injured on a construction site, an experienced lawyer can research your case to determine if the construction company was at fault, or third parties, or in some cases a mixture of both. “Third parties” are companies or workers other than your employer or co-workers. There are a variety of third parties who may be liable for a worker’s injuries at a construction site. These third parties may include general contractors, architects, manufacturers of equipment, other trade companies on the jobsite, etc. The property owner may also be liable in some circumstances. Claims against third parties can become complex, and it is in your best interest to work with a construction accident lawyer who fully understands these claims.
An experienced lawyer can help you figure out whether you must submit a claim through Worker’s Compensation. However, because there are limits to the amount of funds that workers may receive under the Workers’ Compensation Act, a worker may need to pursue additional funds to cover the full extent of injuries that he or she has suffered as a result of construction site injuries. A construction accident lawyer will help a worker to analyze all of the potential claims that exist for him or her.
Some injuries common to construction accidents include:
- Traumatic brain injuries
- Spinal cord injuries
- Neck and back injuries
- Joint injuries
- Broken bones and amputations
- Burns and electrical shock
While many of these injuries are caused by simple accidents, others could have been prevented if not for the carelessness or negligence of someone else. Safety regulations are ignored. Dangerous equipment is not serviced. Employees are not properly trained. Dangerous areas are not marked."	<urn:uuid:9ff8fd79-ad39-42b0-b72a-48caacf13778>	0.0

The more it is used the less likely you are of recovering the file. If it is really valuable you need to shut the server down and call in professional recovery experts.

music theory minor m7b5 chords role	"And, the vii/vi to vi cadence will sound more conclusive than a V-vi cadence, because we have the vii-i motion in the secondary key (in this case, the secondary key is built in the sixth scale degree).
Let’s look at an example of this:
Image via Open Music Theory
This is an excerpt from a piece called “Mag da draussen senhee” by Josephine Lang. In this case, we are moving from a V7 in the primary key to a viio7 in the secondary key of Bb. The chord tones for the V7 are Ab-C-Eb-Gb, which are arpeggiated in the upper voices. Next, in the viio7/vi, the chord tones would be the chord tones of the viio7 in Bb minor, which are A natural - C-Eb-Gb. Note that even though this chord is in root position, it is usually not considered good practice to write a root position viio7 chord in 18th century voice leading. The leading tones in the viio7 chord resolve upwards (the As resolve to Bb), and the chordal seventh, in this case Gb, resolves down to the F, in the arpeggiation of the vi chord in Db Major.
🦜 Polly wants a progress tracker: write a viio/V-V chord progression in any key you choose. Then, try combining this with cadential 6/4 chords. Write a viio/V-V6/4-5/3 progression, and then practice with seventh chords, writing a viio/V-V8/6/4-7/5/3 chord progression.
Modulation is the process of changing from one key to another in music. It is different from tonicization because you stay in the secondary key for a long time – usually a whole section of the piece. In tonicization, you are just borrowing a few chords from a secondary key. We should usually modulate to closely related keys.
However, if we want to modulate to a distantly related key, we will go through some harmonic sequence to get to whichever key we want to get to. Often, we do this when we are trying to modulate between parallel keys (e.g. d minor to D Major)."	<urn:uuid:59d3a1f8-fa1b-4d10-85b9-0c8b91cae233>	0.0
I'm researching global environmental threats - what's the connection between carbon dioxide absorption and chemical contamination in terms of their effects on water systems?	"A more common method directly measures TOC in the sample by again acidifying the sample it to a pH value of two or less to release the IC gas but in this case to the air not for measurement. The remaining non-purgeable CO2 gas (NPOC)contained in the liquid aliquot is then oxidized releasing the gases. These gases are then sent to the detector for measurement.
Whether the analysis of TOC is by TC-IC or NPOC methods, it may be broken into three main stages:
- Detection and Quantification
The first stage is acidification of the sample for the removal of the IC and POC gases. The release of these gases to the detector for measurement or to the air is dependent upon which type of analysis is of interest, the former for TC-IC and the latter for TOC (NPOC).
The removal and venting of IC and POC gases from the liquid sample by acidification and sparging occurs in the following manner.
The second stage is the oxidation of the carbon in the remaining sample in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gases. Modern TOC analyzers perform this oxidation step by one several processes:
- High Temperature Combustion
- High temperature catalytic (HTCO) oxidation
- Photo-oxidation alone
- Thermo-chemical oxidation
- Photo-chemical oxidation
- Electrolytic Oxidation
 High Temperature Combustion
Prepared samples are combusted at 1,350o C in an oxygen rich atmosphere. All carbon present converts to carbon dioxide, flows through scrubber tubes to remove interferences such as chlorine gas, and water vapor, and the carbon dioxide is measured either by absorption into a strong base then weighed, or using an Infrared Detector. Most modern analyzers use non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) for detection of the carbon dioxide.
 High Temperature Catalytic Oxidation
A manual or automated process injects the sample onto a platinum catalyst at 680o C in an oxygen rich atmosphere. The concentration of carbon dioxide generated is measured with a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) detector.
Oxidation of the sample is complete after injection into the furnace, turning oxidizable material in the sample into gaseous form. A carbon-free carrier gas transports the CO2, through a moisture trap and halide scrubbers to remove water vapor and halides from the gas stream before it reaches the detector."	<urn:uuid:743b95d0-2bc0-4f6e-8075-1f94e1a1dd3c>	0.0
wga strike members representation negotiations	"We’re slightly greater than three weeks into the actors’ strike, a landmark motion taken by the Display Actors Guild and American Federation of Tv and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) after contract negotiations with studio and streaming consortium the Alliance of Movement Image and Tv Producers (AMPTP) floor to a halt. That strike, which prohibits actors from sure kinds of promotional conversations about previous or upcoming tasks, was predicted to close down the Hollywood media machine.
However these smart pundits did not appear to account for one truth: Many actors can not seem to restrain themselves from talking publicly, and with out the flexibility to advertise movie or TV work, they’re opining—usually confusingly—in regards to the labor motion. The most recent of these is Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis, who took to social media Saturday to stroll again earlier feedback that appeared to point a scarcity of help for the strike.
It is a cycle that is changing into all too acquainted because the double author/actor strike continues: First out of the comment-and-recant gate was Heels actor/American Ninja Warrior aspirant Stephen Amell, who introduced at a comic book guide conference that the strike was “myopic” and ”a reductive negotiating tactic.” A backlash from supporters ensued, and in a subsequent Instagram submit, Amell mentioned that these remarks have been “clearly contradictory to my true emotions and my emphatic assertion that I stand with my union.”
Quickly to observe was outspoken fan of anti-trans pundit Jordan Peterson/Shazam! star Zachary Levi, who mentioned “I absolutely help my union, the WGA, and the strike,” after a clip of Levi saying that restrictions on mission promotion are “so dumb” at one other comedian guide conference was surfaced. That remark, he mentioned, was “made in jest” and “taken out of context.”
And now we’ve Jamie Lee Curtis, whose late mother and father, Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, have been outstanding figures throughout Hollywood’s final double strike in 1960, even opening their residence for a union assembly to assist actors perceive the aim of the labor motion.
These royal roots did not come up on Thursday, when Curtis spoke with Selection at a star-studded groundbreaking ceremony for meals safety nonprofit Undertaking Angel Meals, for which Curtis is an honorary chair."	<urn:uuid:6d15ec6d-082e-40c0-9aac-f536b36da714>	0.0
I'm curious about what futuristic writers anticipated about modern technology. Have any notable sci-fi authors been particularly prescient about tech's impact on society while being low-tech themselves?	"Matt Jefferies created a world. More specifically he created a future starship and much of its related tech. He wasn't the first to actually do this given science fiction film and television had already been around for decades. And he certainly wasn't alone during the 1960s era when there was quite a bit of sci-fi on television and film. But it could be argued that MJ stands above them because what he created resonated in a particular way. His future world, his starship, was portrayed in such a way that it all seemed so believable. And it can be argued that his creation has become the most iconic and most widely recognized piece of science fiction hardware: the starship Enterprise. Of course, MJ wasn't the only creative force in Star Trek. There were other very talented people who contributed either in ideas or in bringing ideas into physical form. But I think a lot of it took their cue from the conceptual template MJ lay down. It wasn't enough to make a new bit of sci-fi hardware look cool but also to make it seem believable. There are other popular sci-fi vehicles of that era such as the Jupiter II and the submarine Seaview, but they are largely cool unto themselves. MJ's Enterprise and other designs conveyed so much more ""beyond the hull"" so to speak. They suggested a whole world, a complete albeit yet to be revealed universe we tuned in every week to catch another glimpse of. Much of this, of course, was due to the writers and creative staff, but the Enterprise and its technology was so representative of all that. Gene Roddenberry stressed that the audience had to believe in the Enterprise to buy into the future and the stories the show presented. He charged Matt Jefferies to create such an object the audience could near immediately latch onto. And MJ delivered in spades. This isn't to say others didn't contribute significantly---they most certainly had. Much of the Enterprise's appeal, and in extent the world we saw, was enhanced by how they were presented in terms of lighting, photographing and accompanying music, and additionally by the references spoken by the characters. But I think there was still something about MJ's approach to design that telegraphed itself to others contributing to what made Star Trek work. Just my two cents."	<urn:uuid:f2c65130-028f-4e5e-9d90-17a3559cc39c>	0.0
examples real world makerspace projects schools	"- Find like-minded educators
- Design curriculum outcomes
- Select tools that all participants can access
- Manage the collaboration for success
Wednesday, July 27, 2016
Successful online global collaborations require some structure and planning. Educators need to be aware that planning that includes design and implementation is paramount to engaging students and building in success for global learning.
In a design for action mode the essential strategies for successful collaboration include the following:
Newcomers to global collaboration may find it easier to join an existing project or implementation that already has experienced educators who are leading the collaboration. This often provides a shortcut to best practices and a ready-made PLN for support. For those wanting to design, run and manage their own global collaborations the Online Global Collaboration Taxonomy may provide the key.
The Online Global Collaboration Taxonomy, explained briefly here, provides FIVE ways to move into online global collaboration. It shares the type of collaboration, purpose and communication mode as well as current examples to get started.
Level 1: Online interactions
This level applies to asynchronous communication and involves sharing online learning via digital platforms for others to interact with. Examples for this include class and individual blog posts as well as digital artifacts posted online for others to view and comment on.
Level 2: Real encounters
The goal of this level is to connect in real time using whatever tool is available to those connecting. This may be Skype or Google Hangout or other video or chat-based apps. Synchronous interaction means learning is instant and participants can ask questions, share media and build understanding of each others in a very short time. The ‘mystery Skype’ is a typical examples of this ‘real encounter’ level, As is bringing experts in to support curriculum objectives.
Level 3: Online learning
The aim of this level is to encourage learning through digital interaction and sharing of artifacts. It applies to the development of online communities to support curriculum objectives and may be localized (between classes and schools in the same geographic region), or more global. The learning focus is asynchronous interaction, although some serendipitous synchronous (real time) communication may take place, such as a chat facility for participants. Examples include student or teacher led online communities to support curriculum objectives such as MOOCs, discussion forums, and platforms that share multimedia. Projects like Global SchoolNet Cyberfair, PenPal Schools and eTwinning provide opportunity and resources to learn collaboratively online as part of this level."	<urn:uuid:2b9ed968-161c-45f3-ac6d-e4c577d0cc7f>	0.0
As a ruminant nutrition specialist, I'm researching methane emissions from cattle digestion. What is the role of protein in ruminant digestion, and how does this relate to their contribution to global warming?	"This is the average amount of nitrous oxide (N2O) that is in the atmosphere in a given month. The monthly average highlights the seasonal variation. The graph shows the last 3 years to highlight the seasonal variation.
Nitrous oxide has a large warming effect, with a Global Warming Potential (GWP) that is 273 times greater than CO2. Like CO2, but unlike methane, it stays in the atmosphere for a long time, on average 116 years. Besides its warming potential, nitrous oxide is also important because it depletes the ozone layer, which protects us from the sun’s ultraviolet rays.Wikipedia: Nitrous oxide Atmospheric occurrence
The primary unit here is parts per billion (ppb), which describes the average concentration of atmospheric methane per year. The secondary unit here is teragrams, which describes the average weight of atmospheric methane per year. We show this to be able to relate to emissions, which are commonly expressed in teragrams.Wikipedia: Parts-per notation
There is a light global seasonal cycle, with higher growth rates between October and March and less growth between April and September. Seasonal variation occurs both in the natural surface emissions and in the natural breakdown in the stratosphere.Wikipedia: Methane in Earth's Atmosphere

Full Text Available The aim of this paper is to discuss analytically the use of informational communication technologies (ICT in education so that education system could have greater benefits from its carefully planned use. In this paper we tried to show the specificity of the relations between education and ICT. Many things in that relation are accepted for granted, often without much analyzing. We selected some of typical misconceptions which contribute to erroneous ideas about education and ICT relation resulting in limited opportunities for using up new technologies in education. When analyzing ICT in education there is no room for the question whether to use new technologies in the teaching/ learning process or not, but when, why and how to use them. In order to bring these decisions and use ICT potentials for educational purposes, thorough understanding of the nature of teaching and learning is necessary."	<urn:uuid:24c2dfe8-a573-4d22-af42-fb8b9419de4b>	0.0

An understudied pathogen of potential interest is the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). There is some clinical evidence supporting an association between chronic T. gondii infection and the development of T2DM in both animals and humans. The objective of this review is to comprehensively assess the seroprevalence rates of T. gondii in subjects with T2DM in comparison to healthy controls to determine the risk of T2DM due to T. gondii infection. Six electronic databases (Google Scholar, Science Direct, Embase, PubMed, PLOS ONE, and Scopus) were searched using specific Medical Subject Headings terms without language or date restrictions. Fixed and random effects models were used to determine odds ratios with statistical significance being set at 5.0%. Among 1,963 studies, four studies reporting prevalence of T. gondii infection in 1,158 subjects with T2DM and 603 healthy controls met the eligibility criteria. The overall weighted prevalence of T. gondii infection in subjects with T2DM was 55.4% (range: 42.7 - 60.4%) in comparison to 32.1% (range: 21.8 - 50.6%) of healthy controls. Because of significant heterogeneity (Q = 25.529, p < 0.001, I2 = 88.25%), the common odds ratio was calculated using a random effects model at 2.34 (95% CI: 1.17 - 4.64, p = 0.016). Regardless of the limited number of studies and a lack of data, T. gondii infection should continue to be regarded as a contributing factor to T2DM disease development. Further high quality studies that include inflammatory biomarker analysis are warranted to determine the specific role of this parasite in the pathogenesis of T2DM."	<urn:uuid:69809f59-c5b1-4b28-aa66-6481231b0b60>	0.0

What is the examination like to determine if someone has dry eyes?
A large part of the examination is finding out what the patient is experiencing and determining the type of dry eye causing the symptoms. We examine the surface of the eye under a microscope to look at the quantity and the quality of the tear film. Additionally, we examine the eyelids and the glands inside the eyelids to insure they are healthy. More about Dry Eyes…
What are the typical treatments for dry eyes?
There are a wide range of treatments ranging from over the counter products to specialty laser procedures. Many times we start with using artificial tears and vitamin supplements that can help boost the tear film. There are prescription eye drops that can aid in tear production as well as laser procedures for patients with more advanced dry eye. More about Dry Eyes…
Are there any recommendations to help people avoid dry eye?
Of course – start by staying hydrated and making sure you consume enough water each day. Additionally, take breaks from your computer and smart phone."	<urn:uuid:72fc20a4-b2d1-46c2-a2fb-37fded67a457>	0.0
medical management sleep disorders comparison restless leg syndrome vs sleep apnea effectiveness treatments	"They may choose to stay up late to socialize, watch a TV program, or scroll through social media.
Illness – Having a cold, hay fever, or stomach bug can all have a direct impact on the quality of your sleep. Respiratory illnesses can also increase snoring and lead to broken sleep.
Work – People who work unsociable hours can have erratic sleep patterns. Frequent travelers also tend to have less quality sleep.
Sleep disorders – Sleep apnea, insomnia, restless leg syndrome, and narcolepsy all have a negative impact on sleep. You can read more about sleep disorders here on WebMD.
Medication – Some drugs used to treat health conditions, such as epilepsy or depression, can cause insomnia.
Not having a comfortable sleeping arrangement – When your bedroom is too hot or cold, your mattress is not supportive, or there’s noise pollution, these all add to sleep deprivation.
Diet – Drinking caffeinated drinks and eating heavy meals before bedtime can affect sleep negatively. Drinking alcohol also affects sleep negatively as it reduces REM (rapid eye movement) which is essential for brain activity.
Smoking – The nicotine from tobacco is a stimulant and can make it harder to fall asleep.
Having young children – Parents/carers almost always experience sleep deprivation during the early years of raising a child when they wake for a feed or comfort in the night.
What Happens When You Have a Lack of Sleep?
For me, when I’m tired after a bad night’s sleep, I always overeat the next day. Apparently I’m not alone, as according to the National Sleep Foundation, ‘a lack of sleep is linked to overeating—especially the overconsumption of junk food—which can lead to weight gain.
Two hormones that help regulate hunger—ghrelin and leptin—are affected by sleep: Ghrelin stimulates appetite, while leptin decreases it. When the body is sleep-deprived, the level of ghrelin spikes, while the level of leptin falls, leading to an increase in hunger.’
Medical News Today lists the following as symptoms of sleep deprivation:
Difficulty learning new concepts
Inability to concentrate or a ""fuzzy"" head
Lack of motivation
Increased appetite and carbohydrate cravings
Reduced sex drive’

what techniques show surface chemical structure defects	"Tooth bleaching is recommended for patients with all of their adult teeth who would like for their teeth to look whiter. Bleaching is accomplished by applying a chemical gel to the tooth surface to lighten it. This gel is held in place by a custom bleaching tray that can be worn at home. Numerous studies have shown this procedure to be safe and effective but it is not always equally effective for all teeth. Results are often individualized and some teeth show no noticeable change.
A common side effect of bleaching is sensitivity to hot and/or cold stimuli. If this occurs, we recommend discontinuing bleaching. The teeth should return to normal after a few days. If you are interested in bleaching, we will be happy to discuss this with you.
Microabrasion is a conservative treatment option for discolored tooth enamel that is not responsive to polishing or bleaching. This process involves applying a chemical agent to the tooth surface followed by polishing with a mildly abrasive paste to remove a microscopic layer of enamel. This ""in office"" procedure is often recommended for teeth with significant color defects. Many of these color defects are uneven which can make it difficult to obtain completely uniform tooth color. However, the color change is often dramatic and beneficial. When recommending microabrasion we will do our best to predict the level of success that is attainable.
Nightguards for Grinding
Of all the conversations that take place in our office, tooth grinding is near the top of the list. It is very common in children although not necessarily desirable. It is usually harmless and in many cases will be out grown. Grinding usually occurs during sleep and can be very annoying to others. Children rarely experience pain and are not aware they are grinding. The causes can range from a growing face with jaws that are changing alignment, irregular bites, to children with higher levels of intensity, creativity or anxiety. Grinding may be very transient or may occur on a regular basis. We sometimes see a wearing down of enamel on baby teeth but this is rarely detrimental. If a child has had extensive fillings this ""wearing down"" can affect the longterm success of the filings. Night guards are not usually tolerated by young children and are often unsuccessful. We are certainly monitoring for any obvious signs of wear on the permanent teeth and will be more aggressive in our treatment recommendations."	<urn:uuid:8c22c908-1322-41b4-b71d-b6bea72c91b5>	0.0

How do scientists study marine mammals in Monterey Bay?	"Conducting sonar activities more than 9.5 million times that will harm marine mammals without taking adequate steps to significantly reduce the amount of harm to these and other coastal resources cannot be consistent with California’s Coastal Management Program- whose goal is to protect, preserve, and enhance our coastal environment.
The last time the Navy came before the Commission, the Commission found that these training exercises could only be found consistent if the Navy implemented a set of measures to reduce harm to marine mammals. The Navy refused to comply with the Commission’s recommendations and conducted its training exercises without implementing the measures designed to protect California’s marine resources. Stranded whales are the most visible symptom of the deadly impacts of sonar- over the past 40 years, cumulative research across the globe has revealed a correlation between naval sonar activities and decompression sickness in beached marine mammals. Many of these beached whales show evidence of suffering from physical trauma, including bleeding around the brain, ears and other tissues, and large bubbles in their organs. Scientists believe that the Navy’s sonar blasts may drive whales and dolphins to change their dive patterns- surfacing too quickly, resulting in decompression sickness.
The Navy is poised to do the same thing again. We must bolster the resolve of the Commission and ensure that it continues to stand up to the Navy. Please help us tell the California Coastal Commission that the Navy must do more to protect our coastal resources.
Background materials on the Navy's Sonar and Munitions Program and the Coastal Commission can be found here."	<urn:uuid:efc28013-5d66-4828-aa93-122bcd250d8c>	0.0

I'm trying to learn meditation on my own but feel overwhelmed. What do experienced teachers say is needed to succeed in any spiritual practice?	"I remember my high school teachers so much more vividly than my elementary school teachers.
It is time for administrators and teachers to come together. We need to create a culture and climate where teachers don’t think they are being targeted or looking to be caught doing something wrong. They need to feel that no matter what the situation is they will get the backing of their administration. Administration and teachers need to work together so that people want to come to work every day. I can help make that happen.
There has to be trust created. I do not need a master’s degree to create trust. All that is needed for trust to bloom is time and consistency. I feel confident in my ability to work with parents, students, teachers, and other staff in a way that people are comfortable coming to me. I know that I am able to create relationships with other people in a way that is genuine.
For all the fear and trepidation that I have there is more excitement and positivity running through my body. This will be a new journey that forces me to use everything I have ever learned in life as well as test my ability to learn on the fly. I will fall but I will not fail.

what agricultural practices and quality control requirements needed for medicinal herbs laboratory testing	"Third party certification usually refers to the involvement of a third-party certification body accredited to ISO 17065. This is the most stringent (and costly) of the three processes described and includes a testing program plus site audits to check quality management systems, recall procedures, and more. The certification body decides the acceptability of where the product is tested, but it typically must be performed by an ISO 17025 accredited laboratory (the laboratory is also audited and approved by the certification body). The certification body will also audit the manufacturing site(s), headquarters, or any other location of operation they deem necessary to review. The end result is the certification-body attestation of compliance, a stamp of approval on your product, and a listing on their online registry.
Example: NFPA 2112 is a standard that requires third-party certification for compliance at both the component and the garment levels; testing alone is not adequate to label the product to the standard.
Third party testing means just that: testing performed by a third-party. Some third-party testing laboratories are accredited to ISO 17025, which means another independent, third-party body has audited them for a quality management system and technical competence. Not all third-party laboratories are accredited. If your internal specifications or the standard you are working with require testing by an accredited, third-party laboratory, ask for the laboratory’s scope of accreditation.
Example 1: ANSI/ISEA 107-15, for high visibility products, requires background material to be tested by an ISO 17025 accredited third-party laboratory.
Self-Declaration can be described as a manufacturer’s attestation that they meet a certain standard. Some manufacturers have in-house testing facilities and produce their own compliance or quality control data (generally with the exception of large-scale testing, as there few facilities with these capabilities).
Example 1: ASTM F1506 is also a self-declaration standard, and it has no third-party requirements at all. A manufacturer could, theoretically, perform all testing in-house themselves and call their product compliant.
Example 2: ANSI 107 is a self-declaration standard for the finished product; however, there are third-party requirements for the components used in the garment. At the end of the day, the self-declaration of the finished product means the onus is on the manufacturer to ensure the proper process was followed and that the product is compliant. Keep in mind that all certification bodies and some third-party labs will perform this check for you upon request."	<urn:uuid:5ada102c-f8d0-4abd-8e03-9f138b454d8a>	0.0

"We also provide regular maintenance to the alarms within your flat, which ensures that they are working at full capacity at all times, and saves you worrying about issues such as sensors running out of battery. Arlo builds great home security cameras, and this third-generation Arlo Pro is a prime example of what this company is capable of. While it doesn't have the eye-popping 4K resolution of the Arlo Ultra, it delivers fantastic video quality and many of that more-expensive camera's other signature features for less.
CCTV camera security systems were initially developed to monitor commercial properties and public places, but have been adapted to home security systems in recent years. As you begin calling home security companies, you will be offered additional devices and services that can be added to increase your security. More high-end equipment packages—like the ones Vivint Smart Home provides—come with a touch-screen control panel and the option to add outdoor home security cameras, all of which require professional installation.

Whether you're interested in a camera to deter thieves or a way to make sure packages don't walk off the porch , there are a number of cameras designed to meet your outdoor security needs. Additional work for detection and special control equipment is avoided, which again saves time and expense.
However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm—if they respond at all. Thermal cameras can also capture video of a person's movements based on body temperature.

solvent vapors vs asbestos exposure health surveillance requirement workplace	"If you do come across asbestos panels or lagging in your Penge property, do not panic. Keep in mind that asbestos is normally only dangerous to health if disturbed. There are certain situations where it could be better to leave the asbestos in situ, making sure it isn't damaged or disturbed. You ought to get assistance from an experienced asbestos removal company if you are unclear about the safety of any asbestos materials in your home or business premises in Penge.
There are different levels of risk associated with the asbestos materials that might be found in older homes. As a consequence of how different asbestos products are produced and their likelihood of releasing fibres into the environment, products such as asbestos insulation boards, pipe lagging and loose fill cavity insulations are considered higher risk to health than roofing panels and asbestos cement sheets. A certified asbestos removal company in Penge is able to provide you with a risk-free method of removal of all forms of asbestos that might be identified in your property or home.
If there's a requirement for licensed asbestos removal work to be done then the local authority or the HSE must be informed, depending on the type of premises and its usage. All asbestos work has to follow the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 to prevent and limit an exposure to asbestos fibres and dust.
If you don't hold a certified Health and Safety Executive asbestos permit you could very well be prosecuted if you carry out any asbestos removal which requires a licensed person to perform the task.
THE DISPOSAL OF ASBESTOS
As soon as the asbestos materials have been removed from your Penge property they have to be viewed as hazardous waste. There are stringent measures needed to dispose of any sort of hazardous waste, particularly that which contains asbestos. A certified asbestos removal contractor in Penge will abide by all of the regulations and guidelines provided by the local authority and the Health & Safety Executive.
Hazardous asbestos products, like loose fibre asbestos or damaged asbestos insulation, can only be removed from site observing legislation stipulated in the Carriage of Dangerous Goods Act 2009. The Carriage of Dangerous Goods Act 2009 stipulates a separate waste carrier's license is essential and the waste must be taken to a certified hazardous waste disposal centre. By using a local Penge asbestos removal specialist you do not have to stress about these details as they will observe all the regulations and guidance; including the safe-keeping of all paperwork pertaining to the disposal for at least three years."	<urn:uuid:c89a2abd-fe79-4259-921c-f060e606a3bf>	0.0

institutional investor comparing gold palladium stability profit margin	"What it is:
How it works (Example):
The formula for profit is:
Total Sales - Total Expenses = Profit
Here is some information about Company XYZ for last year:
Using the formula and the information above, we can calculate that Company XYZ's profit was:
$2,000,000 - $1,000,000 - $50,000 - $95,000 = $855,000
Why it Matters:
Profit is one of the most important measurements in determining the health and success of a business. However, the measurement of profit can vary and should be considered with other factors.
For example, profit varies greatly from company to company and from industry to industry. Because companies vary in size, it is often more appropriate to consider profit as a percentage of sales (profit margin) when comparing one company to another. As well, varying accounting methods can greatly influence profit, and these changes may have little to do with a company's actual operations.
Changes in profit are the subject of much analysis. In general, high or rising profits are indicative of a successful business while low profits could suggest a myriad of problems, including inadequacies in customer or expense management."	<urn:uuid:0579cad9-a41c-488a-bcbe-cf1bc9d53eb3>	0.0
planning to go camping range creek bears food safety precautions need to know	"It also means you take whatever common-sense precautions you can to protect yourself and other hunters. Here are a few tips to keep you and others safer the next time you go hunting:
- Advise other hunters about where you plan to set up. Doing so is beneficial because it isn’t only common sense safety-wise; it will also prevent other hunters from making noise in the area where you’re trying to track and hunt.
- Many states and private hunting clubs require hunters to wear a certain amount of hunter orange. Even if you aren’t required to do so by law, it isn’t a bad idea, especially when hunting fast-moving game (think waterfowl).
- Keep an emergency medical kit and a cell phone on you at all times because anything could happen. Hunting accidents, snakebites, broken bones and twisted ankles are all possibilities for which you need to be prepared.
Be the Predator, Not the Prey
There’s a famous scene in the original Jurassic Park movie where the park warden thinks he is hunting a raptor. Just before he takes his shot, however, he realizes that his target was acting as a distraction while another raptor snuck up on him. While this is an extreme example, it’s a reminder that each time we go hunting, we are stepping into a world where we aren’t always highest on the food chain.
Know what animals are present in the area in which you plan to hunt. Are there bears in the area? What about mountain lions? Coyotes, wolves and wild boars can be extremely dangerous to humans, especially if they feel threatened or provoked. You also need to be aware of poisonous snakes, spiders, ticks, ants, and mosquitoes. Any one of these creatures can ruin a hunt and cause extreme displeasure, or even death.
Due to the combination of weapons, nature and wild animals, there will always be an element of danger when it comes to hunting. By following the aforementioned hunting safety tips and using common sense, however, you can have a good time and gain peace of mind by knowing that you’re doing everything within your power to protect yourself and everyone around you."	<urn:uuid:a4281182-be02-4b90-af71-4a5af01e51c6>	0.0

“Where are human rights? Where is humanity?” exclaimed Naser Alden Abdulaziz, as French border police stopped him from crossing the border from Italy. Abdulaziz is fleeing the hell of a decade of ethnic violence and genocide in Darfur, Sudan, and, along with others from Libya and Eritrea, demonstrated and started a hunger strike at the border, declaring they will never return. Millions of human beings on the move all over the world are putting the global political and economic system on trial, exposing its rhetoric about human rights for what it really is: a callous disregard for the mass of humanity suffering economic destitution, ethnic violence, climate disaster, perpetual war and terror under the regime of global capitalism.
ROHINGYA FLEE IMPENDING GENOCIDE
More than a million Rohingya, who have lived for generations in Burma’s Rakhine province, have been declared a non-people in their own country since 1982. Subjected to perpetual ethnic violence and concentrated into squalid camps by Buddhist security forces, thousands have packed into tiny boats dubbed “floating coffins” provided by profiteering smugglers. They are taken out to sea, along with starving Bangladeshis and other South Asians escaping poverty—all trying to find a place to live. When navy vessels of neighboring countries—Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia—encounter them, a few provisions are handed out if they’re lucky, but then the vessels sail away.
Australia’s anti-immigrant Prime Minister Tony Abbott not only adamantly shut down any suggestion the Rohingya could go there, but, in violation of international law, has his forces stop boats and reward each member of smuggling crews $5,000 to take refugees to Indonesian waters. Bodies keep washing up on shores. Many of those who manage to land alive are discovered later in mass graves in Thailand and Malaysia.
Israeli writer Ben Samuels aptly compared the Rohingya flotilla to the SS St. Louis, which in 1939 was packed with Jews escaping the Holocaust, many of whom were killed upon returning to Europe after they were denied entry everywhere including Miami, where the State Department declared they’d have to “await their turns.” (See “Jews in 1939, Rohingya in 2015: Will the world act to prevent a 21st century SS St."	<urn:uuid:d969b176-9d7e-4073-a7b2-a3e4f0b60055>	0.0
When did spiders first appear in the fossil record?	"Evolution breaks Darwin’s own slow, gradual process maxim
This next item is included not because it is science, but because it demonstrates that not only does evolution not follow the laws of science it doesn’t even follow its own laws. Punctuated Equilibrium is an update to evolutionary theory proposed in 1972 by noted paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould. It was proposed because evolutionists realized the fossil record does not conform to Darwin’s theory of slow, gradual change of species. As Wikipedia explains it, the fossil record of an evolutionary progression:
“…typically consists of species that suddenly appear, and ultimately disappear, in many cases close to a million years later, without any change in external appearance.”
Eldredge and Gould were among the evolutionists who realized the evidence simply doesn’t fit Darwin’s theory, and instead of discarding the theory, changed it to allow what Darwin said was forbidden: saltations – or jumps in the fossil record. But as evolution evangelist Richard Dawkins acknowledges:
“Without Gradualness.. we are back to a miracle.”
Evolutionists like to pretend they believe in Darwin’s theory of slow and gradual change, but the fact that punctuated equilibrium was even proposed shows that 1.) The fossil record doesn’t support Darwin’s theory, and 2.) Evolutionists have conceded that slow gradual processes simply cannot do what they claim they can, and that in fact the only solution is something that can produce saltations – jumps. But jumps require the intervention of an agent outside of the material world; something that can intelligently manipulate natural processes to do what slow and steady processes can’t – to do what Dawkins correctly characterized as “a miracle.”
This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all the laws of science broken by evolutionary theory, but merely one sufficient to show that that Darwinian evolution does in fact break many laws of science and in fact breaks its own scientific requirements and therefore is rightfully characterized as a pseudoscience. Marine biologist Robert Carter summarizes it succinctly:
“Everything we know about the laws of chemistry, genetics, statistics and information theory argues against any life from non-life idea. But an evolutionist must believe that scientific laws are violated for life to arise from none living chemicals. That sounds like faith to me.”
So you can legitimately call evolution pseudoscience, or you could call it religion."	<urn:uuid:817c1741-736c-4b4e-b3d6-9dfb423d9740>	0.0
construction project manager need to know steel frame systems cost effectiveness and seismic performance requirements	"This makes it suitable for applications like power generation plants where large quantities of steam need to be transported over long distances.
Another notable application area for boiler steel is in the automotive industry. It is commonly employed in manufacturing parts such as exhaust systems or catalytic converters due to its ability to withstand high temperatures generated by engine combustion.
The versatility of boiler steel extends beyond heavy industries; it can also be found in everyday household appliances like water heaters or central heating systems. Its thermal conductivity ensures efficient energy transfer while its strength provides durability.
The wide range of applications highlights why boiler steel remains an indispensable material across multiple sectors – from energy production to transportation to residential use!
Remember: never end blog sections with an exclamation mark!
Benefits and Advantages of Using Boiler Steel
Boiler steel is a crucial material in the construction industry, especially for applications requiring high temperatures and pressure resistance. Its unique properties offer several benefits and advantages that make it an ideal choice for boiler manufacturing.
One of the primary advantages of using boiler steel is its exceptional strength. This type of steel is specifically designed to withstand extreme heat and pressure conditions, ensuring the durability and longevity of boilers. The high tensile strength of boiler steel allows it to handle heavy loads without experiencing deformation or failure.
Additionally, boiler steel exhibits excellent corrosion resistance properties. It remains unaffected by prolonged exposure to moisture, steam, and various corrosive substances commonly found in industrial environments. This corrosion resistance ensures that boilers made from this material can operate efficiently without undergoing premature deterioration.
Furthermore, another significant advantage of using boiler steel is its ability to maintain dimensional stability even under fluctuating temperatures. This characteristic makes it suitable for withstanding thermal expansion and contraction cycles associated with heating processes inside boilers.
Moreover, boiler steel offers outstanding weldability, allowing manufacturers to easily join different components together during fabrication. This feature not only simplifies the production process but also ensures strong bonds between parts for enhanced structural integrity.
When compared to alternative materials like cast iron or aluminum alloys, boiler steel stands out due to its cost-effectiveness over the long term. Its superior durability reduces maintenance costs while providing reliable performance throughout the operational lifespan of a boiler.
the numerous benefits offered by using
steel make it an indispensable material
and long-lasting boilers.
and cost-effectiveness sets it apart as an excellent choice for demanding
applications within various industries
Challenges and Considerations for Working with Boiler Steel

Do light rays and sound waves follow similar refraction principles?	- Seeing one: You can actually see the thermocline in some waters. You will recognize it by the kind of light refraction that suddenly occurs. This is because there are two water bodies with differing densities in the same location. This creates some kind of light refraction, which in turn creates a visual distortion. Scuba divers have been known to describe this as a shimmering in the water, frosted glass, oil on the water, or something similar to the kind of hazy heatwave you see just above the road on a hot summer day.	<urn:uuid:84dc89be-4606-4e48-a9e3-237ce572da53>	0.0
government economic growth tariff relationship impact	"The growth-profitability relationship : strategic orientations as moderator
Senderovitz, Martin, Klyver, Kim, Steffens, Paul R., & Davidsson, Per (2010) The growth-profitability relationship : strategic orientations as moderator. In Langan-Fox, Janice (Ed.) Proceedings of the 7th AGSE International Entrepreneurship Research Exchange, Swinburne University of Technology, University of the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, pp. 479-491.
Principal Topic: In this study we investigate how strategic orientation moderates the impact of growth on profitability for a sample of Danish high growth (Gazelle) firms. ----------
Firm growth has been an essential part of both management research and entrepreneurship research for decades (e.g. Penrose 1959, Birch 1987, Storey 1994). From a societal point of view, firm growth has been perceived as economic generator and job creator. In entrepreneurship research, growth has been an important part of the field (Davidsson, Delmar and Wiklund 2006), and many have used growth as a measure of success. In strategic management, growth has been seen as an approach to achieve competitive advantages and a way of becoming increasing profitable (e.g. Russo and Fouts 1997, Cho and Pucic 2005).
However, although firm growth used to be perceived as a natural pathway to profitability recently more skepticism has emerged due to both new theoretical development and new empirical insights. Empirically, studies show inconsistent and inconclusive empirical evidence regarding the impact of growth on profitability. Our review reveals that some studies find a substantial positive relationship, some find a weak positive relationship, some find no relationship and further some find a negative relationship.
Overall, two dominant yet divergent theoretical positions can be identified. The first position, mainly focusing on the environmental fit, argues that firms are likely to become more profitable if they enter a market quickly and on a larger scale due to first mover advantages and economic of scale. The second position, mainly focusing the internal fit, argues that growth may lead to a range of internal challenges and difficulties, including rapid change in structure, reward systems, decision making, communication and management style.
The inconsistent empirical results together with two divergent theoretical positions call for further investigations into the circumstances by which growth generate profitability and into the circumstances by which growth do not generate profitability."	<urn:uuid:7a8f10a8-1dd5-449a-9275-a86eed1a024f>	0.0

log burner or heat pump which more efficient	"The heated water is stored at the top of the tank and is kept warm through the unit’s refrigeration cycle.
Like traditional water heaters, heat pump water heaters come in various capacities. Certain factors, like the number of fixtures that use hot water and daily hot water usage, can help determine which size conventional or heat pump water heater is perfect for a home.
By reviewing how conventional water heaters and heat pump water heaters heat water, you’ll be able to understand better how they compare in terms of energy efficiency.
Heat pump water heaters are up to five times more energy efficient than conventional water heaters. All water heaters use the Uniform Energy Factor (UEF). Traditional gas or electric water heaters have a .60 to .93 UEF rating, significantly lower than the 4.0 rating for heat pump water heaters.
The main reason why conventional water heaters have a lower rating than heat pump water heater is because of the energy it needs to power themselves. Traditional water heaters consume energy, not just to heat water but to keep it heated for storage.
Heat pumps rely mainly on their heat pump technology, which doesn’t require a lot of power to operate. By reducing energy consumption, heat pump water heaters can obtain a higher UEF rating. This also translates into more energy savings for the homeowner.
Even though conventional water heaters have a lower UEF rating, they can still provide homeowners with energy cost savings. Whether it’s a heat pump water heater or a traditional one, all water heaters have energy guide labels that show an estimated yearly cost with the maximum gallons of hot water the unit can produce in an hour.
Conventional and heat pump water heaters can provide yearly savings, but homeowners will have first to pay the upfront costs to have one of these water heaters installed. We’ll take a deeper look at how these water heaters compare in terms of pricing.
Conventional water heaters, on average, are priced at $3,200 to $5,900 with installation. Whereas heat pump water heaters are higher in price, costing between $9,500 to $13,000. When shopping for any water heater in general, the following factors play a huge role in determining the final price.
- Additional parts
- Plumbing modifications
- Water filtration (optional)
Heat pump water heaters are new to the water heating industry, so there are fewer options for heat pump water heater models. This allows manufacturers to set their pricing for water heaters."	<urn:uuid:696774b9-3181-487c-a6dd-c94c1384e377>	0.0
smart city art citizen engagement examples	"Citizen Science in the Digital Age: Rhetoric, Science and Public Engagement
The tsunami had receded just days before. The cores of three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on Japan's central east coast were molten wrecks. The deadly radiation once bottled inside their concrete containment domes — well, nobody knew exactly where it went.
So a group of citizens decided to find out.
The years-long nationwide act of citizen science that followed armed Japan's citizenry with information never before publicly available, and forced the country's government and institutions to adapt to a political reality unthinkable just a few years earlier. Their story is one of three examples of the diffusion of scientific research explored in ""Citizen Science in the Digital Age: Rhetoric, Science and Public Engagement,"" a new book by Carnegie Mellon University's James Wynn.
Citizen science is not a new concept. The Smithsonian Institute relied on the practice to gather data for a weather project in the mid-1800s. But the digital age has vastly expanded its potential and usefulness.
Wynn's book explores how this practice is changing the arguments that steer public policy by raising awareness about risk. If risk data are no longer the sole province of scientific institutions and governments, if the information is gathered and held by the public, that ""changes the way people can argue,"" said Wynn, associate professor of English and rhetoric in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences.
Take Safecast, the effort by Japanese citizens to use homemade Geiger counters to record radiation readings around the country, and display that information in an online map.
""If you don't have data, and the government is the only source of data, they're the ones who choose how that data is displayed, they get to choose who gets that data, they get to choose how that data is characterized and framed,"" Wynn said.
Safecast volunteers gave people a far more detailed picture of the accident's aftermath, and discovered that the government had been ignoring two types of radiation that posed serious dangers to humans if ingested.
But citizen science is not always an unambiguous benefit. Two other cases Wynn explored — a climate science investigation in the United States and a sound-mapping project in London — showed how ideological or political motives can influence public debate.
Anthony Watts, a TV weatherman and skeptic of anthropogenic climate change, teamed up with a University of Colorado climatologist to photograph the locations of government temperature monitors."	<urn:uuid:dde90440-7191-4ff7-80a5-60c5decb0733>	0.0
What role do fats play in muscle building, and why should I avoid fatty foods before exercise?	"Two types of unsaturated fats are monounsaturated and polyunsaturated, both of which are thought to help lower cholesterol. Examples of these fats are olive and canola oils. Monounsaturated fats also are found in avocados, nuts and olives.
Trans fats are actually unsaturated fats that have been chemically modified. Manufacturers add hydrogen to vegetable oil in a process called hydrogenation. This increases the shelf life and the flavor stability of foods containing these fats. Trans fats can be found in vegetable shortenings, some margarines, crackers, cookies, snack foods and other foods made with or fried in partially hydrogenated oils. Like saturated fat and dietary cholesterol, they raise LDL cholesterol and increase your risk for cardiovascular disease.
Essential fatty acids are a category of fatty acids found in polyunsaturated fats your body needs but cannot manufacture itself. Good sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids include soybean, corn and cottonseed oils.
When an unsaturated fat is solidified—into margarine, for example—the process turns it into partially hydrogenated oils, which contains trans fatty acids.
The Skinny On Fad Diets
Despite the ads that claim miracle weight-loss for some products, there simply is no magic formula for losing weight. Fad diets, like those based on cabbage soup, grapefruit or protein, may help you lose some pounds in the short run, but they don't work in the long term because they're impossible and unhealthy to maintain. The truth is permanent weight loss takes time and requires a permanent change in eating and exercise habits.
Extreme diets of less than 1,000 calories per day carry health risks and could trigger excessive overeating following the period of extreme caloric restriction. Such diets usually provide insufficient vitamins and minerals as well. Severe dieting also has unpleasant side effects, including fatigue, intolerance to cold, hair loss, gallstone formation and menstrual irregularities. Most of the initial weight loss is in fluids; later, fat is lost, but so is muscle.
It is very dangerous to be on severe diets longer than 16 weeks or to fast for more than two or three days. There have been rare reports of death from heart arrhythmia when liquid formulas didn't have sufficient nutrients.
High-protein, low-carbohydrate diets are still used by some people for weight loss. Although a high-protein diet will lead to quick weight loss, its long-term health and safety benefits are uncertain."	<urn:uuid:e9e26811-70b5-4a9f-80f5-4b75caba3dc8>	0.0

How much higher is the cancer risk with Lynch syndrome?	"Cancer Gene Study Offers to Detect Disposition, Half Ignore ResultsBy Terence Monmaney
Los Angeles Times
Given a chance to learn if they carried a gene that raised their risk of developing breast, ovarian, or prostate cancer, surprisingly few of the 279 women and men in a new study -- only 43 percent -- chose to take such a look at the future.
That was a central finding of the largest study yet of how people react when offered a blood test for the so-called breast cancer gene, BRCA1, which boosts the likelihood of developing the disease to 87 percent, about eight times higher than that of women generally. The gene also confers a 40 percent to 60 percent lifetime risk of ovarian cancer and about a 10 percent risk of prostate cancer in men.
Among the study subjects, who belonged to families with pronounced histories of breast and ovarian cancer, a major reason for declining the BRCA1 test was fear that a positive result would jeopardize health or life insurance. Another prominent fear was that a faulty test would mistakenly label, and perhaps stigmatize, a noncarrier as positive, prompting much needless anxiety and perhaps even surgery.
The issues raised by the study spotlight an emerging dilemma that pits a newly acquired power of science, which literally means ""to know,"" against the foremost of medical ethics, which is to do no harm.
The study ""is a very important contribution to understanding ... what possible choices people will make when they face the actual experience,"" said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Center for Human Genome Research at the National Institutes of Health.
""Being concerned about insurability and discrimination is very unsettling to people and may dissuade them from seeking testing,"" said Dr. Henry Lynch, a cancer specialist at Creighton University in Omaha and co-author of the study. It appears Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Testing negative for the gene also has the potential to spare women unnecessary surgery, the study showed. Before the test was available, women whose family history placed them at high risk of cancer sometimes had their breasts or ovaries surgically removed, the only known way to help prevent the diseases from developing."	<urn:uuid:ff102b76-f712-4ce7-a181-d2a727c8a30f>	0.0
website mistakes that drive away customers	"With more than 1 billion active Instagram users, it becomes tough to grow your online business without having a presence on this social platform. As of 2017, 71% of American brands are already on Instagram. In 2019, this percentage likely exceeds 80-85%, bearing in mind the yearly growth rate of nearly 50%. With so many users you can imagine how any Instagram mistakes you make can be costly.
In fact, such a vast presence of brands on Instagram doesn’t mean that each of those businesses managed to utilize the service wisely. Many companies still struggle to increase the number of their followers, expand their reach, and eventually drive traffic to their website by the means of Instagram by making various social media mistakes.
Yet if you failed once in your marketing endeavors, it’s not time to give up. Online entrepreneurship is more than just a knowledge of how to create a website for a small business and put your offers in there. To establish a successful online company, you need to learn an awful lot of things on how to promote this website through all available channels. Thus, Instagram mistakes will be inevitable at the outset of your efforts.
In this post, we explain how to avoid some actions (or inactions) that can ruin your Instagram promotion even before you get it started. There are 7 essential factors which you might consider as “insta secrets” if you’re fully resolved to realize how to treat Instagram in the right way and not make the Instagram mistakes that others continue to make.
And the first step to success is to stop doing these Instagram mistakes!
1. Buy Likes and Followers – One of the Most Common Instagram Mistakes!
You could run into the services offering to purchase thousands of Instagram followers for a pittance. They say that’s the quick and easy way to become an Instagram influencer, but it’s actually a blatant lie
No matter how many followers you get, they’ll never engage with your content as real people do. Don’t expect any likes and comments from them, since they’re no more than just a bot. That string of a soulless code only decreases your engagement rates and therefore devalues your account in front of the great and powerful Instagram algorithm.
Moreover, real users will see a bit of mismatch between the numbers of your likes and followers, what can serve an off-putting factor for them. Instead of becoming an influencer, your credibility as a brand will only get worse."	<urn:uuid:25216b0a-23df-4ec8-ad8a-c69a9042e6ff>	0.0

how seasoned wood burning differs from gas fireplace safety concerns	"If you have an old or uncertified wood-burning device, you may qualify for cash rewards to recycle it or get a discount on the purchase of new heating equipment.
Through the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency’s Wood Stove Program, Snohomish County residents can receive $350 for recycling their old, polluting wood stove. Eligible devices include wood stoves and fireplace inserts (which are basically wood stoves made to be installed inside a fireplace) that are not U.S. EPA certified or were manufactured before 2000. Also eligible are free-standing manufactured fireplaces (but not built-in, zero-clearance fireplaces), wood-burning furnaces, or residential coal-burning devices.
Your old device must be in working order but can be installed or uninstalled for the recycling reward. Indoor barrel stoves and trash burners are not eligible for the reward. The homeowner is responsible for removal and taking the old stove or insert to a recycling facility.
Residents of Snohomish County wanting to upgrade to new, cleaner heat can instead opt to have their old wood stove or fireplace insert scrapped in exchange for a $1,500 discount to go toward the purchase and professional installation of new heating equipment.
Replacement options include electric heat pump; natural gas, propane or oil furnace; or natural gas, propane or pellet stove or insert. Replacement equipment must meet certain efficiency and/or emissions requirements. Work must be done by a program-approved heating contractor. No new wood stoves or inserts are allowed with the discount.
To be eligible for the $1,500 replacement discount, you must have an uncertified or pre-2000 wood stove or fireplace insert, free-standing manufactured fireplace, wood-burning furnace, or residential coal-burning device. Old device must be installed and operable in order to qualify.
After enrolling, applicants must submit several photos of their old wood stove or fireplace insert to be reviewed for eligibility. Funding is limited; one project per household. The program is currently limited to homeowners or, in the case of rental homes, property owners.
For wood stove recycling, qualified applicants will receive an agency-issued coupon and instructions for recycling their stove and receiving the $350 reward. Recycling participants have 45 days to recycle their stoves at any of the agency’s four designated recycling facilities."	<urn:uuid:3e96075c-15b8-4efe-ae68-857d3bd87811>	0.0
What kinds of hearing problems can affect the inner ear, and how much more likely are people to develop memory issues because of them?	"Understanding Hearing Impairment written by Michelle Tjelmeland
What is hearing impairment and why is early invention so important?
The term hearing impairment encompasses a continuum of hearing loss from slight to profound. “The Hearing Impaired Manual: Recommended Procedures and Practices” explains the term hearing impairment,“The child’s residual hearing is not sufficient to enable him or her to understand the spoken word and develop language, thus causing extreme deprivation in learning and communication. Or the child exhibits a hearing loss which prevents full awareness of environmental sounds and spoken language, limiting normal language acquisition and learning achievement” (5).
Once a hearing loss has been confirmed by medical experts parents will then be able to choose appropriate assistive technology to facilitate their child’s hearing loss. Furthermore, parents will then be able to help their child develop the necessary skills needed to acquire speech and language skills and communicate effectively. Early detection of a hearing loss is imperative so invention and treatment can be established immediately. Untreated hearing loss will inevitably cause a child to be severely delayed with thinking skills and speech and language production. When a child is unable to clearly hear phonetic distinctions during the first year of life, the child is at substantial risk for language learning problems. Consequently, the child will suffer delays or failure within the educational environment and amongst peers (Schwartz, 2). Parents of a child with hearing impairment must be well-informed about their child’s hearing disability. Obtaining treatment and diagnosis of a child’s hearing loss as early as possible is imperative so intervention and a individualized management plan can be established.
How does the ear work?
One must understand how the ear works in order to understand the type of loss their child has. To explain, “sound travels through the air in the form of waves of varying frequency. The frequencies of these waves determine the pitches of the sound that is heard. Sound waves are channeled into the external ear canal where they are transmitted to the middle ear which consists of the eardrum and three small bones in the ear cavity. This part of the ear serves as an amplification system. The middle ear compensates for the loss of the intensity of sound as it travels from the air medium of the middle war to a fluid medium within the inner ear known as the cochlea. Sound travels as waves of fluid to a specific area depending on the frequency of the sound in the cochlea."	<urn:uuid:38f7970a-9552-4ea2-a553-72b8f6d365b6>	0.0

What role does education play in soil conservation efforts?	"Display to header level
Initiatives in Pennsylvania and on a national level promote the study of bird populations and the protection of their habitat.
Organizations and governments involved in conservation efforts can make important contributions to protecting birds, especially threatened and endangered species. The development of farmland and open space often destroys critical habitat for bird migration, breeding, and wintering. Preserving these natural areas ensures healthy bird populations and intact ecosystems.
Land trusts, in particular, can be key partners in bird conservation. The 2013 State of the Birds report, submitted to the U.S Department of Interior by 15 bird conservation groups and government agencies, found that more than 100 bird species have at least half of their populations on private land. Many of those species are in decline and in desperate need of habitat conservation. Considering that a majority of land in the United States is privately owned, the ability of land trusts to work directly with landowners means that they can play a major role in the effort to secure, restore, and protect habitat for birds.
The National Audubon Society is a prominent bird-focused conservation organization. It coordinates a number of bird conservation programs, many of which are implemented by local chapters and state offices, including Audubon Pennsylvania.
The Important Bird Area (IBA) program is an initiative by BirdLife International designed to help organizations and governments prioritize conservation efforts in the most important places for birds. In the United States, the National Audubon Society and local partners administer the IBA program. To date, Audubon has identified nearly 3,000 IBAs covering over 400 million acres.
IBAs are areas that provide essential habitat for birds, including sites for breeding, wintering, and migration. An IBA can consist of a few acres, or thousands of acres. Land in an IBA can be public or private, protected or unprotected. To be designated an IBA, an area must meet at least one of several objective criteria.
After designating land as an IBA, the Audubon Society works with partner organizations and local chapters to develop and implement an IBA conservation plan. Plan activities vary from IBA to IBA and can include bird monitoring, habitat restoration, land protection, and proposing changes to municipal land use policies.
IBA designation does not offer legal protection to the identified area; it simply recognizes the area as having outstanding value to bird conservation."	<urn:uuid:36a08d11-6981-44f8-903c-ef7bfe428813>	0.0

What are the main advantages of using mediation to resolve disputes about horses instead of going to court?	"Pennsylvania couples like you may face disputes on the road to divorce. Some of these disputes may turn ugly. There is no shame in admitting that you cannot surmount your disputes on your own.
Today, we will look at mediation as a tool to get through a divorce. It helps resolve some disputes. It can keep conversations civil. In the meanwhile, you can try to figure your way through a difficult situation.
Tips to avoid mediation backfiring
HuffPost has an article discussing things you may not know about divorce mediation. For example, some believe mediation gives you an advantage over your partner. This is not true. Not only that, but your mediation attempts may work if you go into them with this attitude. Mediation is not a magic cure-all. You must go into it with good intentions and give it a genuine try.
Mediation is also not legally binding. The only purpose is to help you work through your disputes. At the end of successful mediation, you have a written agreement between partners. It is then up to you to carry out this agreement.
What is a mediator’s purpose?
A mediator’s only purpose is to ensure arguments end and discussion remains civil. Also, a mediator cannot tell you what to do. They offer suggestions based on their experience as a mediator and what they hear from you. Even if they suggest a certain path of action, you are under no obligation to take it.
It is important to understand the purpose of mediation and how much power a mediator has. This way, it is easier to work through the process. Just stay aware of the most important thing: cooperation is necessary."	<urn:uuid:31318853-5fe0-4105-b33e-5fe2769effff>	0.0
geothermal energy benefits environment effects mining	Hydro Electricity has been around since ancient times. Hydropower was used before power plants that generate electricity with the use of natural resources like oil were used. With the depletion of natural resources and the harmful effects of green house gasses released into our atmosphere due to the burning of oil, we can begin to look into renewable sources of energy. Solar power, Geothermal and Hydropower are some types of renewable energy sources. For my preliminary research done in The Aqueduct Futures Studio I have begun to look into the benefits of Hydro Electricity. I begin by looking into the five largest hydro plants in California. Most of the substantial plants are located in the north due to the amount of water that is needed for these plants to operate. The poster gives facts about power generated, capacity of water that a specific hydro plant can take in and the height of the dams where these hydro plants are located to give a sense of how grand these power structures are. With benefits also come impacts, I address some of these like climate change, snowpack and some ecosystem impacts. The research portrayed is minimal but crucial in the understanding of how infrastructure may change in the years to come for a more expanding future.	<urn:uuid:2b053cc9-faf4-4e2b-bf04-7c21845b574a>	0.0
I live in London and heard that air pollution used to be really bad here in the past. How does historical London smog compare to the air pollution problems in modern American cities?	"People in China cannot breathe, and they are getting tired of trying to mask it. One newlywed couple, in an act of protest, took their wedding portraits outdoors.
Donning a face mask with a now-gray stained wedding dress, the bride holds her husband, breathing through a gas mask, in a morbidly polluted embrace.
When the air is so thick that children are told to stay indoors, city dwellers can no longer see skyscrapers and face masks are out of stock. Taking wedding photos outside is a beautiful and desperate attempt to get the world's attention.
Beijing's insanely high rate of pollution is billowing at over nine times the safe breathing level. The World Health Organization has recently declared it a health crisis.
This couple's wedding album reveals just how bad China's air pollution is:
1. An act of protest
Bride Zhang Xinyu and groom Bai Beibei decided to take their wedding portraits outside, facing the hazardous smog to protest the abysmal air quality.
2. The dangers of breathing
The level of toxic particles is so bad that simply taking in a deep breath can send the particles into a person's blood stream.
3. Nuclear winter
China's toxic air pollution resembles a nuclear winter, scientists say. A nuclear winter describes the environmental impacts of detonating — yes, you thought right — a nuclear bomb.
4. Smog clinics
China's choking smog is causing asthma and other chronic conditions. One hospital in Southwest China opened a ""smog clinic"" in 2013.
5. Photosynthesis is slowing.
6. One man is suing the government.
One man recently sued the Chinese government, demanding the environmental protection agency ""perform its duty to control air pollution according to the law.""
7. City dwellers can barely see the sun.
Residents of Beijing have been posting images on social media of a muted sun behind grey skies. Some of the city's largest skyscrapers aren't fully visible.
8. Smog lab
The Chinese government may be investing $81 million(500 million yuan) to study smog pollution, its effects and enacting measures to reduce it. The plan includes the constructing a large ""smog lab."""	<urn:uuid:07d9bcbc-4fd3-4d10-b9df-b322d3da11ed>	0.0
As a pregnant woman in my final months, I want to understand both the medical risks of having multiple babies and my workplace rights - what health complications can arise with multiple pregnancies, and what protections do I have at work?	"So, I know that I’m pregnant. It’s amazing and wonderful and beyond super exciting.
Both personally and in my close circle of friends, I’ve learned and experienced way too much about early-term pregnancy loss and miscarriage. It’s far more common that people realise. Mostly because not everyone talks about it, including me.
Despite having a blog and sharing my life on the internet, I’m a pretty private person. There is NO WAY I’ll be announcing this pregnancy until it is well and truly viable and outside the danger zone of the first few months where the statistics put reported miscarriages at 1 in 5 of ALL pregnancies.
I often say to people though, it’s YOUR news, control it the way you want. For me, I keep the news of our babies very very quiet because if we were to lose this baby I would want to keep to myself to reflect and grieve and recover without having to un-announce a baby.
For other people, sharing the news of the pregnancy and a subsequent potential loss to more people would give them a bigger pool of support to draw from if they needed it. Horses for Courses.
It seems cruel in a way.
Find out you’re pregnant.
Immediately fall in love with your tiny womb-raider.
Spend the next few months terrified they might die through no-one’s fault but nature’s whim.
I’m choosing to stay positive. It’s all I can do. Eat well, move lots, take the vitamins and rest.

Which natural materials produce specific color dyes?	"textile patterns using gauguin’s color choices
in area proportions 10:11:30 (right diagonal:left diagonal:background)
These patterns reinforce what we conclude by looking at the painting: (1) the scarlet, umber and yellow gray in the lower left of the painting (diagram, top row) are used to produce a strong visual contrast between the blossoms and the rounded forms against their backgrounds, and this contrast depends primarily on the dark umber separating the dull yellow from the scarlet (left pattern); and (2) the green, purple and mauve in the upper right of the painting (diagram, bottom row) are used to reduce contrast, which pushes these colors into the background and provides a cool color contrast to the predominantly warm hues of the painting.
However, if we evaluate the colors as textile designs, other issues become more important. What is the overall color of the design when seen from a distance — is it dark or light, green or brown, warm or cool? How strongly does one color dominate the other two? What is the dominant visual pattern that results from all three colors combined — left diagonal lines, right diagonal lines, a diagonal mesh, or a field of crosses? Which pattern and average color works best in the object, fabric or environment in which the colors are used?
If we change the context in which color relationships are judged, we are likely to prefer different color combinations for different reasons. The optimal color combinations and our reasons for preferring them change together.
Toward a Natural Color Harmony. What emerges as the basic issues in color harmony and color design? An important first step is a vocabulary to distinguish the different aspects of color we are talking about:
• material color – the composition of light reflected from a surface or emitted by a light; always precisely defined by a spectrophotometric curve, but influenced by surface qualities of materials or the light absorbing qualities of light transmitting media.
• visual color – the conscious sensation of color, viewed in a specific visual context under a specific level of illumination; always approximately defined by the colormaking attributes, plus luminance: this includes appearance color — visual colors induced by viewing context.
• concept color – color treated in the abstract or as a “pure” color that cannot exist in materials, usually as a category of colors denoted by hue label (primary BLUE) or by some other generic attribute (all SHADOW COLORS, all TINTS)."	<urn:uuid:92f14527-a64f-47cc-bb68-9e57f781b7e4>	0.0
What's better for cutting energy costs: solar passive design or efficient appliances?	"Solar energy has abundant applications. Tapping solar power requires the appropriate technology to reach the grassroots of India if we aim to move towards sustainable development for all. With this goal, TERI undertook the task of providing solar energy technology to a small district in Assam.
What is a Solar Multi utility (SMU)?
Solar Multi utility (SMU) is a platform that utilizes locally available solar energy to generate electricity through solar photovoltaic technology. The generated electricity is then used for a variety of applications such as charging lanterns, powering appliances such as computer, mobile phones, water purifier etc. An SMU is located near energy utilization points in a village to provide electricity services as per the need of the community.
This project dealt with designing and implementing such a platform for the Dakshin Dimoria village under the Dimoria Development Block of Kamrup district, Assam, located 40 km from Guwahati.
The SMU was designed based on the energy need assessment carried out at the project site for high-income generating and high valued service livelihood-generation activities. The design was a result of a market survey conducted by the project team for available appliances. Based on this assessment, the SMU was designed for powering appliances that included batteries for solar applications (specially for solar lanterns), water purifier, honey skimmer for honey extraction, chilli/turmeric grinder, bamboo cross-cutting and splitting machines, bamboo slivering, and bamboo stick-making machines. These appliances are involved in livelihood generation activities, and therefore of critical importance to the people.
The entire process was broadly divided into six phases that included selection of site and appropriate solar photovoltaic (SPV) technology, designing of SMU, setting up local institutions, installation and commissioning of SMU, training and capacity building of local institutions, and monitoring the performance of SMU.
As a result of this project, a fully operational SMU was developed at the Dakshin Dimoria village and thereby helped in livelihood generation. In addition to this, an established institutional framework and effective service delivery mechanism was developed for ensuring long-term sustainability of the project. An installation, operation, and maintenance manual was also developed to facilitate smooth function of the SMUs.
The concept and purpose of SMU was well accepted among the communities. TERI also demonstrated strategies for carrying out similar projects in other regions."	<urn:uuid:87836bc3-e442-41c3-a057-30fed1e30848>	0.0
hip nerve compression symptoms vs replacement complications	"An inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) may help prevent PE in patients with DVT in the leg, but IVCF placement may risk long-term complications. Benefits outweigh risk if a second PE is predicted to be life-threatening; however, few clinical trial data are available. A filter is most clearly indicated in patients who have:
Because venous collaterals can develop, providing a pathway for emboli to circumvent the IVCF, and because filters occasionally thrombose, patients with recurrent DVT or nonmodifiable risk factors for DVT may still require anticoagulation. An IVCF is placed in the inferior vena cava just below the renal veins via catheterization of an internal jugular or femoral vein. Most IVCFs are removable. Occasionally, a filter dislodges and may migrate up the venous bed, even to the heart, and needs to be removed or replaced. A filter can also become thrombosed, causing bilateral venous congestion (including acute phlegmasia cerulea dolens) in the leg, lower body ischemia, and acute kidney injury.
Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) with SCDs provides rhythmic external compression to the legs or to the legs and thighs. It is more effective for preventing calf than proximal DVT. It is insufficient as sole prophylaxis after hip or knee replacement but is often used in low-risk patients after other types of surgery or in medical patients who have a low-risk of DVT or who are at high risk of bleeding. IPC can theoretically trigger PE in immobilized patients who have developed occult DVT while not receiving DVT prophylaxis.
Graded elastic compression stockings are likely less effective than external pneumatic leg compression, but one systematic meta-analysis suggested that they reduced the incidence of DVT in postoperative patients from 26% in the control group to 13% in the compression stockings group.
After surgical procedures with a high incidence of DVT/PE, low dose unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or adjusted-dose warfarin is recommended.
After orthopedic surgery of the hip or knee, additional options include the newer oral anticoagulants, rivaroxaban and apixaban. These drugs are safe and effective and do not require laboratory tests to monitor the level of anticoagulation as is needed for warfarin."	<urn:uuid:bc7d2103-6479-42c3-95b6-2946b557b3dd>	0.0

What should clients verify about contractors' qualifications and insurance?	"One event that can seriously harm, and even put a company out of business, is the unexpected death of a key employee, salesperson, partner, or executive.
That is why many companies formulate contingency plans for such deaths, and even design thorough succession plans for owners and key executives, managers, or board members.
A term life insurance policy purchased on one or more of these key individuals helps to solve the difficult problem about how business will go on without this important individual.
How Business Life Insurance Works
The corporation, LLC or partnership should be the applicant, own and pay for the policy premiums, and name itself as the beneficiary.
The key individual must agree to the insurance policy be taken out on his or her life. This individual would need to, at the very least, help complete the application with answers about health history, and depending on the policy, may also need to take a medical exam.
Please note if you are purchasing life insurance on a key employee or individual, this is commonly referred to as “key man life insurance” or “key person life insurance”.
How Much Life Insurance Should a Business Apply For?
It’s difficult to measure the exact value an individual brings a business, but some questions you’ll want to consider in helping you quantify the value of your employee are:
1. Potential Lost Clients: In the case of the loss of a founder or great salesperson, consider the relationships that individual has fostered with your clients. You might even write down a list of key clients that may be doing business with you due to a great relationship they have with your key employee.
2. Cost of Replacing an Individual: Key employees or owners are not easily replaced. Finding and attracting a candidate with the necessary experience and qualifications may cost the companies thousands upon thousands of dollars.
Depending on what level of candidate you’re trying to hire, these costs may include job listings, hiring agency cost, wining and dining, as well as other accommodations. If a member of your own staff does the searching, you have that employee’s time as an expense as well.
I think I can come off this point… every business understands the high cost of replacing an employee, and dreads having to replace a KEY member of the team.
3. Intangible Losses: Your key man or woman may be an idea trailblazer. Some people’s ingenuity simply cannot be replaced. Be sure to insure this person accordingly.

what are the similarities between blue concert posters database searching and analogous color schemes in art both require analyzing relationships between colors	"Having survived the first encounter against Kajima, Schterzen steals the Blue Destiny Unit 2 and Kajima pursued him using Unit 3.
The Unit 1 and Unit 3 are two variations of the same model in two different color schemes with alternative parts to distinguish each type. Unit 1 has a GM (Gundam Mass-production) type head and is outfitted for ground combat, whereas Unit 3 has the traditional Gundam type head and is refitted for space combat, with additional components added onto the existing body from Unit 1. With exception to their heads and the components for Unit 3, the only substantial differences between Unit 1 and Unit 3 are the thrusters on the outsides of the legs and the colors.
Out of the boxes, both Units are molded in their final colors and are supplemented with polycaps to provide articulation. Unit 1 comes in its true blue and dark blue plastic, with gray parts for its joints and weapons. There is one red piece for its chin, and a clear visor for its eyes. Unit 3 comes in the traditional Gundam colors of off-white gray, yellow, red, and dark blue, with the same color gray parts for its joints and weapons as Unit 1. As standard for designs with beam sabers are a set of clear pink tubes that form the beams included on their own parts tree.
Between both units, there is some minor paint work to improve the looks, such as the tube protrusions from the chest, the triangle indentations on the knees and front of the chest. Additional paint work includes the targeting eyes on the top of the forehead and back of the head. For those looking at the decals, both units come with two different color sets for eyes: one red and one green. The reason for this depends on the builder’s choice of whether to display the Blue Destiny in EXAM’s activated mode (red) or normal mode (green). Because I use paint, I opted for Unit 1’s visor in red and paint Unit 3’s eyes green.
For the sake of variety I employed a number of aesthetics: detailing in two gray tones; gunship gray to match the plastic for joint regions and engine gray for the weapons and auxiliary parts. While it is extra work, it adds to the overall finish of the model, and makes it look like a more complex construct than it really is."	<urn:uuid:8dc5c0f2-91fe-4de0-963d-0dbd7f4194ea>	0.0

poor countries climate threats funding hurdles	"While several winter storms came through the region, total rainfall accumulation was still below average during the 2011 monitoring period. Many of the plants that could not be located in 2011 were assumed dead because their vigor during previous surveys was rated as “poor” in 2009 (NNHP 2011b, p. 3). Some of these plants may have been retracted at the time. However, many plants observed between 2008 and 2011 failed to produce fruit or flower, and fruit buds were observed to be aborted. This suggests low seed production, which would cause a decline in overall abundance over time.
In summary, the climate on the Colorado Plateau and Navajo Nation is predicted to become warmer with reduced precipitation in the future. We have strong evidence to suggest that the Fickeisen plains cactus is being impacted by drought coupled with increased annual temperatures. We believe that the high number of dead and missing or retracted plants in all plots monitored is influenced by below-average winter or spring precipitation at the time when plants need soil moisture to flower. Poor reproduction in the Fickeisen plains cactus is likely to worsen in the future if climatic patterns shift toward becoming more arid with increased winter nighttime temperatures. With climatic models predicting future regional droughts, it is likely that all populations of the Fickeisen plains cactus will continue to be affected by drought and climate change. However, it is not clear if drought or climate change, of themselves, present population-level threats of extinction. It appears that drought and climate change in combination with rodent predation (see Factor C. Disease or Predation, below), as a combined effect, is the more likely scenario for population-level impacts to the plant. Additionally, the small and declining populations of the Fickeisen plains cactus make the species susceptible to natural environmental variability, including climate conditions. Therefore, based on our review of the best scientific and commercial data available, we conclude that the effects of climate change and drought are threats that have significant impacts to the Fickeisen plains cactus and its habitat.
Summary of Factor A
Based on our review of the best scientific and commercial data available, we conclude that fire associated with nonnative, invasive plant species; uranium mining; road construction and road maintenance; ORV use; and commercial development are not threats to the Fickeisen plains cactus and its habitat."	<urn:uuid:841e8afe-0979-4424-a8f3-c09234400c65>	0.0

What are better ways to study how people really behave?	"I also enjoy of looking my kids playing around – to see how they learn things, and to hear their funny thoughts and especially see how they draw so naturally.
6. What role does art play in your life? How does it change the way you view the world?
My father is a sculptor so art have always played important role in my life. It’s really hard to think the life without art.
Art gives me new ideas, perspective to the whole world, learn how to behave and how to face different kind of people and things you haven’t thought yourself before.
7. Where did you study?
I graduated from Lahti Institute of Design back in 2003. Since then I have been working in a shared studio space with other designers and illustrators – many of them are my classmates from Lahti.
To share a studio with friends must have been the best school for me. I can share my ideas and problems with my colleagues and learn new things everyday just watching how they work and solve their design problems.
8. Where do you see yourself in five years? Working in an agency?
I hope I have done a few more children’s books and some of them are translated to other languages. My agents work really hard for me so I might have a bunch of really nice clients around the world. But I guess I still work in the same studio with my friends.
9. What about in ten?
Nothing have really changed exept that the number of my picture books and translations of them have increased enourmously. And exept that my kids are teenagers and I have really hard as well as really nice time with them.
10. What do you hope to achieve with your art?
I hope my illustrations give good feelings and help people to stand their everyday life a little bit better. I dream that my picturebooks bring joy and hope to the kids and their parents who read them.
11. Now, tell us a little more about you as a person: what is your favourite food?
I really enjoy of eating my every day lunch with my friends and colleagues. Good company is for me even more important than the exact food. Though I must say that we have really good vegetarian lunch places next to our studio. At home I eat quite often Finnish rye bread with butter, tahini and slices of apple and that’s something quite unique.

ECT devices have never gone through standard clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy, though the FDA gave device manufacturers a 30-month time frame to do so in April of 1982. Thirty-four years later, this has never been done. Nevertheless, in December 2015, the FDA issued a proposed order to down-classify the device used to deliver electroshock therapy, a move followed by a wave of public outcry. Constitutional attorney Jonathan Emord recently filed a Citizen Petition with the FDA to prevent this reclassification on behalf of five individuals who were damaged by electroshock.

what makes bones move smoothly	"Alternative names broken hip
What is hip fracture? A hip fracture is a break in the top part of the femur (thigh bone) where it inserts into the pelvis to form the hip joint.
Symptoms and signs of hip fractureSymptoms and signs of hip fracture usually follow a fall or other accident, and may include:
- Severe pain in the hip or lower groin region, sometimes radiating to the knee. Attempting to move the hip usually results in a significant increase in pain. In some cases, there may be only thigh or knee pain. Lower back pain may also occur.
- Stiffness, bruising, swelling, tenderness or deformity in and around the hip area.
- A shorter leg on the side of the injured hip.
- The leg on the side of the injured hip turns outward and is shortened.
- Difficulty walking. (Walking may still be possible with partial fractures)
- Inability to put weight on your leg.
What causes hip fracture?In elderly people, the direct cause of a hip fracture is usually a fall or accident, which may sometimes be relatively minor. The underlying cause is likely to be osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become brittle and more prone to fracture as a result of mineral loss).
In younger people, however, hip fractures are usually caused by a more severe injury, such as a motor vehicle accident, sports injury or high-impact fall.
In some people with certain medical conditions, such as severe osteoporosis, cancer, paralysis or kidney disease, the bones can become so weak and brittle that a hip fracture can occur during regular daily activities, simply from bearing the body's weight.
Who gets hip fracture and who is at risk?Those who suffer from osteoporosis are at risk and the risk factors are those for osteoporosis.
- Ageing. With age, the bones gradually lose calcium and other minerals and become less dense. Loss of density weakens bones and makes them more susceptible to fracture. Ninety percent of hip fractures occur in people over age 65.
- Female gender. Women lose bone density at a greater rate than men do, and as a result are two to three times more likely to experience a hip fracture: about one out of every seven women will have a hip fracture in her lifetime. Hip fractures are a particularly important concern for menopausal and post-menopausal women."	<urn:uuid:d9c1b798-0543-4466-9c1d-d247dde0a540>	0.0
I work in cybersecurity and am interested in knowing how transparent and secure open-source solutions are compared to traditional proprietary systems in the utility sector. What are the security implications?	"He further compared Taiwan’s situation with that of Israel, another victim of constant cyber attacks that promotes its domestic cybersecurity industry through government policy, including subsidies and extensive cooperation between the private cybersecurity sector and military.
A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF CYBER AUTONOMY
Yet by the time of the Taiwan Cyber Security Summit a year later in March 2018, another interpretation of cyber autonomy may have gained traction. In his keynote at the Summit, Lee again referenced the development of the cybersecurity industry through national defense projects. However he indicated that these efforts would henceforth be led by Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), as that agency begins to take a leading role in developing Taiwan’s cybersecurity industry as a whole (Liberty Times, March 14).
The basis for MOEA’s leading role in a cyber autonomy policy stems from the National Cyber Security Program of Taiwan for 2017 to 2020, which was released in November of 2017 by the Executive Yuan’s National Information and Communication Security Taskforce, or NICST (NICST, November 14, 2017). NICST is an inter-agency task force founded in 2001 at the behest of Taiwan’s National Security Council to secure Taiwan’s government networks and critical infrastructure.
MOEA has long been responsible for executing specific policies and goals related to “cybersecurity industry autonomy” (资安产业自主). This phrase first appeared in the 2013 to 2016 National Cyber Security Program in reference to boosting Taiwan’s indigenous cybersecurity research and competitive capabilities (NICST, February 2, 2016).
MOEA TAKES OVER
As has long been the case, MOEA is focused on non-defense efforts to promote the development of Taiwan’s cybersecurity industry. One of its main related initiatives is the propagation of security standards for mobile applications developed in Taiwan. Though MOEA’s Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) had supported these efforts since at least 2015, the standards gained traction in 2017 when IDB began promoting these standards for adoption by Taiwan’s government agencies and banks (MOEA, February 22).
IDB has similarly promulgated domestic IoT security standards for internet-connected video surveillance systems. In addition, it plans to open up the testing of domestic cybersecurity industry products on critical infrastructures and other selected industries in 2018, to allow domestic companies to “gain product experience and build skills” (MOEA, February 22)."	<urn:uuid:830e69af-8bf4-4c1a-8262-80ae43546f13>	0.0

What groups support women at universities?	"FSRP has encouraged users groups to include women in every aspect of project implementation. For example, it encourages the formation of women-only groups; promotion of women as labour group leaders; assignment of accessible working sites to women in the beginning; arrangement of flexible working hours for them; priority to women in Learning Centres and income generating activities; training for on-farm and off-farm skills development, and timely payment of women’s wages. This approach resulted in the following major achievements that have empowered women:
- Creation of forums and an environment to share their experiences and feelings with their peers.
- Meaningful participation of women in all aspects of project work (more than 50 %, with women holding important posts).
- Women are able to voice their concerns when participating in construction work.
- The overall status of women has improved in society; their self-confidence and self-esteem has increased, while gender discrimination has been reduced.
5. Special targeting and selection of need based interventions
To ensure meaningful participation of the excluded and to address their needs and priorities, FSRP designed need-based special programmes with their active participation. Based on the local realities, FSRP has focused on two areas of support: economic/livelihood empowerment and social/mobilisation empowerment.
5.1 Economic and livelihood empowerment
FSRP developed livelihood support activities for the target groups, focused on entitlements to assets as well as the creation of new assets, including:
- Bee-keeping and goat raising for the poor and excluded with special targeting to landless families;
- Small businesses like weaving bamboo baskets, making agricultural tools (blacksmithing), processing and value adding to local raw materials like herbs and fiber;
- Fruit and vegetable farming;
- Establishment of nurseries (e.g. vegetables, fruit trees);
- Short-term income from construction work;
- Employment and skill transfer through the involvement of persons from the target groups as staff or local support staff.
It was observed that the lack of skills for self-employment or income generation, as well as the lack of opportunities to acquire or enhance skills as well as illiteracy were basic limiting factors for the economic empowerment of many of the excluded families. FSRP provided the target groups skills development training based on market opportunities and according to their abilities and interests. A new business creation training and support program assisted the target groups, to link their newly acquired knowledge and skills to income generation activities and business start-ups."	<urn:uuid:960646c9-1e53-4465-8f90-f3dadb94fb79>	0.0
How do geologists use satellite data in their work?	"Satellite Internet: Developing a Faster Connection Around the World
Satellite communications, currently used in some sectors, could be the next big thing in the telecommunications industry. What is the “space internet”? Why will it become important in the near future?
Technology has brought us fantastic tools like smartphones and computers, and has allowed us to accomplish incredible feats, like taking our first steps on the moon. But what do the internet and space have in common, you may ask?
In this article, our offshore esn examines the basics of the space internet, the different stakes, actors and benefits related to this innovation.
What is Satellite Internet?
The high seas, mountain peaks, and the heart of the desert are the goals of the space Internet, which must be able to serve regions without fiber optics or terrestrial infrastructure to carry signals.
To make it work, thousands of low-cost satellites are deployed in orbit around the earth. However, they differ from geostationary satellites, which are more commonly used in satellite internet.
By deploying 5G connectivity via satellites in low earth orbit, extreme geographic regions or remote areas will benefit from high-speed network coverage.
How does it work?
Space-based internet is actually not that different from satellite-based internet. Every time you surf the Internet, your satellite dish sends request data to satellites located 36,000 km above sea level.
The satellite transmits to a transmitting/receiving station belonging to the internet operator you have chosen. Once the page is retrieved, the station sends the data back to the satellite so that it can display the desired page. This is a journey of about 140,000 kilometers!
Such a distance causes latency between the request and the response, which providers are working hard to reduce. This is where the innovation of the space internet comes in.
Instead of sending satellites 36,000 km away, we are talking about sending them into low orbit. Smaller devices, and therefore more numerous, allowing to reduce the time of result, but also to cover the whole globe.
The satellites in low orbit make it possible to broadcast the Internet much more quickly. These small stellar armies are called constellations (in relation to their resemblance with the formation of real constellations seen from the Earth)."	<urn:uuid:52bf1318-e119-46b5-8abe-0dd0669c75f0>	0.0
scared hospital surgery sleep what does going unconscious feel like during operation and can patients remember anything happening	"And that was my biggest concern simply because the prospect of going through an open heart surgery is simply terrifying. But I fervently prayed that God will provide the best cardiologist to perform the surgery and that there will be no complications. And thank God, He has indeed answered my prayers!
So on the 7th of August I was admitted to Royal Brompton Hospital; they did run all types of pre-assessment tests and then Dr.Rigby came to see me. Jared and I had a wonderful time chatting with him and he answered all of our questions. He’s such a very gentle, caring, kind and sweet man. He told us that he’s one of the pioneers in this procedure (and been doing it since 1991), and that after looking at my medical records he doesn’t think there will be any complications. I asked him if he had any patient who had a stroke during the surgery and he said that he never had any. The reason I asked was simply because I remember Dr Kempny mentioned about a risk of stroke during surgery. Dr. Rigby explained that he would not proceed with the operation if he thinks the device will cause any complications.
Anyhow, I was prepared for the worst but continued to trust the Lord to grant healing mercies. And God has certainly used Dr Rigby to bring a sense of peace, trust and security before the surgical procedure. After he left the room Jared said, “What a very nice man; such a gentle soul and his countenance, the way he talks reminds me so much of Vic!” (Vic is a good friend of ours who died a couple of months ago) Surprisingly, Jared thought the very same thing I had in mind while talking with Dr. Rigby — he really did remind us of Vic.
Jared left the hospital that night when visiting hours ended, and it was quite strange being alone, confined in a hospital bed for the very first time! I’ve never had a surgery nor have been confined in a hospital until that day. I hardly get sick and never even had been to the A&E to see a DR except when I had to accompany someone who needs an immediate medical attention. Therefore it was rather unusual to find myself in a hospital bed, and I had a hard time going to sleep that night."	<urn:uuid:1c1312b1-20a2-4b37-ad91-35cedc6da95c>	0.0
How does climate change affect women's income and communities?	"With tutelage from climate change leader and former Vice President Al Gore, Loorz became a bit of a national celebrity as a youth willing to speak out about climate change.
He gave several keynote speeches and as a 14-year-old developed a sea-level awareness project in his hometown of Ventura, California. He and a group of middle schoolers installed 9-foot poles to showcase just how high the sea might be in the future.
The city council there agreed to include the possibility of rising sea levels in its long-range planning.
In 2011, after organizing a campaign to raise awareness about climate change that occurred in more than 200 cities, Loorz had the seeds of an idea that became iMatter.
While the effort attracted media attention and involvement, he saw it as largely symbolic gesture that did not force political change. He felt the next step would have to be engaging students in encouraging their communities to take concrete strategies on curbing climate change.
He and his supporters developed a website that offers standard climate report cards, tips on grassroots organizing, developing petitions, team building, dealing with media and other issues.
The movement will have authenticity because of who is leading the charge, Loorz said.
“It won’t stop the crisis, but it will change the narrative — talking about climate change in terms of generations to come,” he said. “Young people are the only constituency that can pull this off by saying, ‘This is going to affect our future and we think we should be taken seriously.’”"	<urn:uuid:0b859bd3-6401-419f-8c1a-8ac419a5768b>	0.0
How do farming and fishing practices create ocean dead zones?	"Expo and Seafood Cocktail in Strasbourg – Sustainable Fishing: From the Sea to Your Plate
On Wednesday 3 February, Blue Fish Europe organised its second yearly event in the European parliament in Strasbourg, after the “Coast to Coast” exhibition in October 2014. The event was hosted by Renata Briano (S&D, Italy), Vice-Chair of the PECH Committee, and entitled “Sustainable fishing: from the sea to your plate”.
MEP Renata Briano, host of the event, with the producers present in Strasbourg
This event featured six sustainable seafood products from France and Portugal: oysters, langoustines, seaweed tartare, lobster soup and trout mousse and sardines. The highlight of the event was the presence of the producers, who travelled from Brittany and Northern Portugal to showcase their activities, and engage with participants on sustainable fishing in Europe.
From left to right:

Their presence was highly appreciated by the Members of the European Parliament who attended, giving them the opportunity to discover first-hand some of the best practices of sustainable fishing in Europe. Indeed, all the seafood products served on Wednesday are examples of what the entire European fishing sector can offer today, and illustrate the three pillars of sustainable development (environmental, social and economic).
From selective fishing of langoustines, to sustainable oyster farming, from the valorisation of “ugly” bits of smoked trout, to a seaweed farming activity that ensures a year-long livelihood, all the products showcased are illustrations of what the men and women working in the European fishing sector do best.
Blue Fish Europe and Renata Briano are proud of the outcome of the event, which gathered more than 150 attendees, and to have brought the reality of sustainable fishing in Europe to Parliament decision-makers. Blue Fish Europe will remain committed to being a catalyst for constructive change and positive engagement between the fishing sector and governments and hopes to make this event an annual gathering in the European Parliament."	<urn:uuid:bc62d8e5-ee2b-4c93-827f-db7f9ac9b2bc>	0.0

I keep seeing QR codes being used for inventory management in businesses - what are the main benefits of using this system?	"Barcodes, a residual technology of the Cold War, have influenced several crucial sectors, from retail to logistics. Scanning a barcode can tell you all about the item, from its origins to the required conditions for storage.
While big corporations are financially content with creating a barcode inventory management system, small and medium businesses (SMBs) may face obstacles due to scale. Yet, the availability of that feature can bring several advantages to any enterprise. Here’s a short guide on how SMBs can have barcodes for their inventory system.
What Are Barcodes?
You can consider barcodes as a representation of several lines of data within a single picture. A few barcodes have attached numbers to ensure precise readings. A scanner converts that information to readable data within a fraction of a second. The numerals are for manual operation if the original code is no longer readable.
There are two kinds of barcodes currently in commercial use.
It is the most popular form of barcode you can find. 1-D barcodes contain multiple lines of varying widths. The lines’ order and width let the barcode reader obtain the relevant input.
2-D barcodes are scanned over an area instead of a line. They may take longer to scan but offer far more possible combinations and contain more information than 1-D barcodes. The most well-known examples are in the form of QR codes.
What To Consider With a Barcode Inventory System?
The barcode inventory system can create more efficient stock storage for every business. However, that efficiency can vary with scale and industry type. So, it’s best to consider a few influential criteria before deciding on the best approach for your business.
Before deciding on the system, it helps to set your inventory goals. Measure the available space and other storage factors to determine which barcode system might suit you best. You want to spend only a few resources for short-term storage or limited stock.
The efficiency of your barcode system is only as good as the software for keeping track of the inventory. It’s best to avail of something that can run on all the computers within your organisation. At Qbasis, we can deliver a customised solution that can relay the information on smartphones or through RFID chips for easier access.
Any software is only as good as the hardware supporting it. Therefore, you must collect a good barcode generator and scanner compatible with your system. The labels must remain visible until the packaging gets discarded."	<urn:uuid:367b5487-201c-48ef-8365-7e8a09c9f578>	0.0
mental activity physical exercise dementia prevention	"Washington: While dementia patients need a caregiver to look after them, a new study has found that these carers are losing their sleep while caring for their clients.
According to the study, carers lose between 2.5 to 3.5 hours of sleep weekly since they face difficulty in falling asleep and getting a sound sleep.
However, researchers also pointed out that this can be improved through simple, low-cost interventions.
Researchers in the study published in the journal ‘JAMA’ analysed 35 studies with data from 3,268 caregivers.
Informal caregiving for a person with dementia is akin to adding a part-time but unpaid job to one’s life, with family members averaging 21.9 hours of caregiving, according to The Alzheimer’s Association estimates.
“Losing 3.5 hours of sleep per week does not seem much, but caregivers often experience accumulation of sleep loss over years,” said lead author Chenlu Gao, a doctoral candidate of psychology and neuroscience in Baylor’s College of Arts & Sciences.
“It can have a strong impact on caregivers’ cognition and mental and physical health. But improving caregivers’ sleep quality through low-cost behavioural interventions can significantly improve their functions and quality of life,” said Gao.
Chronic stress is associated with short sleep and poor-quality sleep. Nighttime awakenings by a patient with dementia also can contribute to disturbed sleep in caregivers, researchers said.
“With that extra bit of sleep loss every night, maybe a caregiver now forgets some medication doses or reacts more emotionally than he or she otherwise would,” said co-author Michael Scullin, Ph.D., director of Baylor’s Sleep Neuroscience and Cognition Laboratory and assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor.
Notably better sleep was observed in caregivers after such simple behaviors as getting more morning sunlight, establishing a regular and relaxing bedtime routine and taking part in moderate physical exercise.
For the analysis, researchers searched articles in peer-reviewed journals and books addressing caregivers, sleep, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, published through June 2018. Those studies measured sleep quality and quantity by monitoring brain electrical activity, body movements and self-reporting by caregivers.
The difference in time and quality of sleep was significant when compared to non-caregivers in the same age range and with the recommended minimum of sleep: seven hours nightly for adults.
Researchers also analyzed intervention-related changes in sleep quality, such as daytime exercise, not drinking coffee or tea past late afternoon, not drinking alcohol at night and getting more sunlight in the morning."	<urn:uuid:4ac3d803-a84b-4eac-b7e2-1a440d750ca6>	0.0

What effects do tourist activities have on both mountain skiing areas and coral reef environments, and how are these impacts being managed?	"Coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to the impacts of sea-level rise and possible changes in local meteorology. Tropical coral reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef, may be able to keep pace with sea-level rise-but will be vulnerable to bleaching and death of corals induced by episodes of higher sea temperatures and other stresses. Measures to facilitate adaptation include better rangeland management; plantings along waterways; and research, monitoring, and prediction. Active manipulation of species generally will not be feasible in the region's extensive natural and lightly managed ecosystems.
Hydrology and Water Resources: Vulnerability appears to be potentially high. Any reduction of water availability, especially in Australia's extensive drought-prone areas, would sharpen competition among uses, including agriculture and wetland ecosystem needs. Freshwater supplies on low-lying islands are also vulnerable. More frequent high-rainfall events may enhance groundwater recharge and dam-filling events, but they also may increase the impacts of flooding, landslides, and erosion, with flood-prone urban areas being heavily exposed to financial loss. Reduced snowpack and a shorter snow season appear likely, and New Zealand's glaciers are likely to shrink further. Some adaptation options are available, but the cost involved would be high.
Food and Fiber Production: Vulnerability appears to be low, at least in the next few decades (potentially high sensitivity coupled with high adaptability). Agriculture in the region is adaptable, and production increases are likely in some cases. However, there may be a trend toward increased vulnerability in the longer term-especially in warmer and more water-limited parts of Australia, where initial gains for some crops are eroded later as the delayed full effects of climate change (e.g., changes in temperature and precipitation) tend to outweigh the more immediate benefits of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Impacts will vary widely from district to district and crop to crop. There will be changes in growth and quality of crops and pastures; shifts in the suitability of districts for particular crops; and possibly increased problems with weeds, pests, and diseases. Rangeland pastoralism and irrigated agriculture will be especially affected where rainfall changes occur. Changes in food production elsewhere in the world, which affect prices, would have major economic impacts on the region. With regard to forestry, the longer time to maturity results in a relatively large exposure to financial loss from extreme events, fire, or any locally rapid change in climate conditions."	<urn:uuid:75e14a9c-88ac-4740-b151-e94e2c341ec9>	0.0

What natural processes and resources are commonly used in sustainable wastewater treatment systems to make them more cost-effective than conventional methods?	"June 25, 2015
by Canadian Architect
Taking place at the University of Manitoba‘s Engineering and Information Technology Complex in Winnipeg from August 10-13, 2015, the 16th International Conference on Non-Conventional Materials and Technologies (NOCMAT) is a leading forum where scholars, governmental and non-governmental agencies, practitioners exchange innovations of low-energy cement technologies, new materials and systems, and innovative material/structural technologies such as bamboo, natural fibres, etc. towards cost-effective, durable, environmentally friendly, energy-efficient and sustainable construction. The development of innovative, non-conventional materials and technologies will also provide a significant role in eradication of poverty, creation of jobs, formation of global partnership for economic progress and social stability.
Non-conventional materials and technologies encapsulate innovation and sustainable use of novel technologies and innovative uses of more established materials. Many non-conventional materials in the 21st century have their roots in traditional vernacular construction, including earth (unfired clay), lime and natural plant based materials, such as bamboo, straw and reeds. For traditional materials and techniques to meet modern demands of construction, cost and performance requires further development, innovative solutions and systematic scientific research. Meanwhile materials of the industrial age, including steel and concrete, must also deliver more sustainable solutions. Innovations include manufacturing processes, lower-carbon materials, greater reuse of components on end use, greater recycling of materials, reduced waste, multi-span life-cycle design, and more prefabrication of components and buildings.
Keynote lectures, technical sessions, workshops, and tours of such groundbreaking projects as the Manitoba Hydro building and the Centre for Architectural Structures and Technology are on offer, along with a variety of social and networking events.

I want to start a small business. Do I need to register it?	"There are many small business ideas available for those of you who want to start a business, but do not yet have a firm idea of what business you want to start. I'm sure that many of you are looking for ideas for starting a business, because your passion at the moment is to just become an entrepreneur.
There is nothing wrong in simply wanting to have your own business and be your own boss, but you still need some business ideas.
Moreover, you do not need to have an obsession about achieving world peace or curing the common cold—but you will need to become passionate about some business idea, or you will not succeed as a startup entrepreneur.
That is why you will need to do a thorough search of small business ideas, until you find that one idea that makes your heart pump a little faster and simply ""feels right.""
Don't think you need to be in the high-tech industry with an idea for the next Facebook or Twitter in order to have a successful startup. Here is what my favorite business guru, Tom Peters, has to say about business ideas and startups:
Video from the Tom Peters ""Little Big Things Video Series""
So, don't limit your thinking. You don't need to have a high-tech product to have a successful startup business. Let your mind soar, and when you hit on the idea that you can become passionate about—proceed through the rest of this web site and build the business that will fulfill your dreams.
I know I'm repeating this several times, but if you skipped the first Section titled, Entrepreneurship on this web site, I recommend you go back and read it to make sure that entrepreneurship is really for you. Business ownership is not at all what the aspiring entrepreneur thinks it is, and often the reality comes as a shock.
O.K. then, assuming your passion to become an entrepreneur is as strong, or stronger, as ever, all you need are some ideas for starting a business. The best ideas come from within, as you identify a need not being met, and then developing your own idea on how to fulfill that need.
But remember, if you are not passionate about that business idea, you are not likely to be very successful. The need must match your passion."	<urn:uuid:e8c8f762-1643-4c9e-aa7d-89fdd1c427b2>	0.0

types information systems business management decisions	"Instrumentation is made up of a large number of small data types. These data types are shared by the different service modules 103 using a publish and subscribe model.
In a publish and subscribe model, the remote services proxies (and therefore the systems management systems) publish their data to a service provider. The service modules 103 register interest in specific types of data that are needed to fulfill the respective service module processing.
More specifically, data from a systems management instrumentation proxy 306 may include patch information, operating system package information, disk configuration information, system configuration information, system alarms information, storage alarms information and performance information. This information is published via, e.g., a wide area network (WAN) to a management tier 310. Various service modules 103 then subscribe to the information in which they are respectively interested. For example, a patch management service module 330 might be interested in, and thus subscribe to, patch information and operating system package information. A configuration management service module 332 might be interested in, and thus subscribe to, the disk configuration information, the patch information, the operating system package information and the system configuration information. A storage monitoring service module 334 might be interested in, and thus subscribe to, disk configuration information and storage alarms information.
Thus, with a publish and subscribe model, many different types of data are published by a customer using the remote services customer deployed infrastructure. Service modules then subscribe to these data types. More than one service module 103 can subscribe to the same data. By constructing the instrumentation data in a well segmented manner, the data can be shared across many services.
Sharing data across many services reduces duplication of instrumentation. By making data available to newly developed service modules, those service modules need to only identify instrumentation that does not exist and reuse and potentially improve existing instrumentation. Sharing data across multiple services also reduces load on customer systems. Removing the duplication reduces the processing load on the customer's systems. Sharing data across multiple services also reduces development time of service modules 103. As more instrumentation is created and refined, service modules 103 reuse the data collected and may focus on developing intelligent knowledge based analysis systems to make use of the data.
Accordingly, the separation and segmentation of the infrastructure from the service modules enables services to be created in a standardized manner ultimately providing greater value to the customer.
The systems management API's 410 includes systems management API's 418, integrator 212 and proxy integrators API 430."	<urn:uuid:5f3cb443-8c1a-4502-bf2f-e59cd1f26eae>	0.0

I'm worried about oil spills. Can nature recover from them?	"It's not always easy to find a unique spin on a subject, but it can be done.
Going back to Eric's question, why do I prefer larger-than-life characters? Part of the reason is escapism and wish fulfillment. I live in Midwestern suburbia, and I like taking mental breaks from it with my fiction. Having high-powered characters means you can demand more of them; they buy you a seat at the high-stakes plot table. But there are other reasons for enjoying larger-than-life characters and speculative fiction. By looking at the extremes of the human condition (or even examining non-humans), we can learn something about the ordinary parts too. And while ordinary characters in extraordinary situations can do astonishing things, extraordinary people can inspire us to transcend the commonplace and reach for something we never thought possible. Our future depends on how far we can see and our drive to try new things. If we work at it, what was once considered extreme or even impossible can become part of our mundane reality.

In my animal behavior class, we're comparing social structures - how different are honeybee colonies from early human hunter-gatherer groups when it comes to making group decisions?	"Dear Secretary Vilsack:
As the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) develops its fiscal year (FY) 2015 budget request, we urge you to request significant additional resources to address the bee health decline challenges facing American beekeepers, including those experiencing Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Thank you in advance for your consideration of our views.
Agriculture as we know it today in the United States may not exist without honeybee pollination. In order for the country to have a healthy and plentiful food supply, honeybee pollination is necessary. USDA has estimated that honeybees pollinate about one-third of the human diet. In addition, pollination is responsible for up to $20 billion in added crop value, particularly for specialty crops such as nuts, berries, fruits, and vegetables.
The nation's beekeepers are facing numerous challenges that pose a threat to our food supply. The most significant challenge that USDA has the ability to address is bee health. We are losing honeybees at an alarming rate. In 1947, the United States had 6 million honeybee colonies. Today, there are only about 2.5 million. Since 2006 alone, 10 million beehives with a value of roughly $2 billion have been lost, most of which has been attributed to CCD alone.
More recently, preliminary results for the national survey of honeybee colony losses show that the disturbing trend continues. The survey shows a decline of 31.1 percent of honeybee colonies during the 2012/2013 winter, which is an increase of 42 percent over the previous winter. On average, beekeepers lost 45.1 percent of their colonies during the winter. That is an increase of 78.2 percent from the previous winter. It is our understanding that a normal loss rate is only around 15 percent.
While we appreciate the work of USDA's CCD Steering Committee, we believe that more needs to be done before it is too late. From our perspective, we should be making significant investments in research activities in the laboratory and in the field. It is our hope that the FY 15 budget request includes increased honeybee research funding at the Agricultural Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, including funds specifically dedicated to researching the role pesticides may play in overall bee health decline."	<urn:uuid:95bef9f4-4d23-41d2-89dc-1f160ee41b18>	0.0

accompaniment legal proceedings child protection EU	"We all know by now that the Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to the constitutionality of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), which makes it difficult to separate Native American children from their families, tribes and indigenous heritage.
Despite having support from both Republican and Democratic officials, state officials feel the Indian Child Welfare Act violates the Constitution’s promise of equal protection. Furthermore, state officials feel the Indian Child Welfare Act does little to protect the real needs of the child and deprives them of proper placement outside of their community. The 1978 Act was enacted after thousands of indigenous children were forcibly removed from their homes and tribal communities. Some 35 percent of all indigenous children were removed from their families and more than 85 percent were placed with families that had zero affiliation or cultural ties to a given tribal community. The generational abuse left many without a connection to their culture, language, or families.
Family courts typically make decisions based on the best interests of the child in question. The 1978 law determined that where Native American children are concerned, one of those interests is protecting their relationships with their respective tribes.
“The tribe has an interest in the child which is distinct from but on a parity with the interest of the parents,” Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote in a 1989 decision, Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield.
The Indian Child Welfare Act sets federal requirements that protect indigenous children in adoption proceedings and requires state and caseworkers to make several considerations during hearings, such as:
- the family must be involved
- appropriate placements that fit under ICWA provisions must be identified
- tribal nations must be notified of the adoption proceedings
Any measures by the courts that divert from the above, can place the child in danger. Although the Indian Child Welfare Act is labeled as the gold standard in many proceedings, states such as Texas, Louisiana, and Indiana are currently contesting the law in recent cases. According to some lawmakers, the ICWA violates state laws by simply tipping the scales and favoring tribes. Lawyers for the states feel the Indian Child Welfare Act fosters an imbalance in adoptions proceedings by favoring legal mechanisms based on race and tribal affiliation. Several tribal nations, including the Cherokee and Navajo, two of the country’s biggest tribes, have intervened in many adoption cases that attempted to place children outside their communities."	<urn:uuid:3a6b3d8a-d83a-42f3-9419-0abc49baa702>	0.0

differences fire alarm vs trademark confusion criteria	"Jump to navigation Jump to search
Naming things is hard.
""There are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors."" – Leon Bambrick
- Avoid ambiguity
- Search for similar keywords in existing features, extensions, products, and projects, to avoid confusion and a profusion of hatnotes and seealsos. (e.g., Collection vs Collections, Labs vs labs vs labs, Page Previews vs page previews)
- Make it easy to pronounce, to type, and to remember
- Avoid l33t5p34k, avoid difficult capitalizations (e.g., SyntaxHighlight GeSHi), and don't use dashes if CamelCase is the local convention.
- Consider the translations
- If it is a user-facing feature, this is extra important. Is the word almost-untranslatable or extra-long, in any discoverable language? (e.g., help, randompage, [better examples needed...] )
- Check it isn't a reserved keyword in the usual programming languages
- This can lead to additional complexity in the code (e.g., Echo). For example: Puppet reserved words.
- For long names, specify the short form. People tend to shorten anything they can, especially if they write it regularly, as help-desk people and developers tend to do. Contractions/Initialisms/Acronyms will be invented, if you don't plan for it. (e.g., visual editor is ""VE"" to many people, see also m:Glossary and Manual:Glossary)
- Stick with a single name
- Try to pick just one name, for both the code & the user-facing product name. Otherwise you'll have to regularly explain the past/alternative names, and deal with persistent confusion. (e.g., Page-triage/Page-curation/Newpagepatrol/Newpagesfeed, or Echo/Notifications, or Popups/Hovercards/PagePreviews). Renaming things is even harder: the first name used in public is likely to stick, even if you think it's terrible.

What makes wine from Pomerol so special?	"Masters of Riesling - Jim Barry Wines
We caught up with second generation winemaker Peter Barry, whose stunning Jim Barry The Lodge Riesling 2015 from the Clare Valley is the Wine of the Month for August.
What makes the Clare Valley such a special grape growing wine region?
The Clare Valley is such a special grape growing region due to the warm days and cool nights which allow grapes to ripen fully but retain natural acidity and hence freshness. The undulating hills provide many aspects so we can grow Riesling, Shiraz and Cabernet on different slopes of the same vineyard.
What are some of the winemaking challenges it presents?
The major winemaking challenge in Riesling is sunburn, which can be mitigated by canopy management to ensure no fruit is exposed to direct sunlight. For red wine, it is about picking at the right time to achieve a balance between ripeness and acid without the grapes becoming over ripe.
What have been some of Jim Barry Wines’ greatest achievements in recent years?
We’ve had great success, but some of the standouts include:
Mathew Jukes Australian Winery of the year for 2016.
Trophy for 2016 Lodge Hill Riesling at the 2016 Royal Sydney Wine Show
Trophy for Barry Brothers Shiraz Cabernet for 2013 as the Brisbane and Melbourne Wine Shows, as well as Trophy in Brisbane for the 2014 vintage.
Trophy for best producer at the Clare Valley Wine Show for five of the past six vintages.
Also we’re very proud to have introduced the Greek variety of Assyrtiko to Australia.
Can you sum up your experience of the 2016 vintage in a few words?
Good rains in January hydrated very thirsty vines, leading to an exceptional vintage.
When Jim Barry purchased the Lodge Hill vineyard in 1977 he was confident it would “produce some of the best Riesling in Clare”. What did he see that was so special about this vineyard?
Three things. Elevation which leads to cooler night and better acid retention in Riesling, rocky/slatey soil meaning the vines have to send their roots deep into the ground in search of moisture and many aspects to suit Riesling, Shiraz and Cabernet.
The Jim Barry The Lodge Hill Riesling 2015 is the Wine Selectors Wine of the Month for August. What makes this a standout expression of the variety?"	<urn:uuid:ca990033-e652-45b2-842c-fe136bf4a206>	0.0

What happens during the process of firing bricks in a kiln, and how long does the entire firing process take from start to finish?	"Creating an animal out of a lump of clay is a long process with lots of magic, and sometimes a little surprise. I will often begin construction with a pinch pot, which will vary in shape depending on the animal I’m making. Giraffes are a teardrop shape at the very beginning of my hand building process.
The connecting edges are scored to help the clay meld together. Connecting edges are brushed with water, then pressed together. The bodies are joined together, smoothed and paddled into shape.
The bodies have to harden up enough to add the legs so there must be some drying time in the construction timeline. Sometimes I am forced to use a fan to facilitate the clay drying in order for me to work on the next stage. It is always a dance with time, heat and speed, which determines how fast I can continue my hand building process. I wrap the work to slow the drying process or leave the work uncovered or force the drying process so that I can keep working. The clay has to be just right and it has taken years for me to accurately anticipate the proper timing.
Once the animal body is fully constructed, I will take a sponge and smooth out the body and the legs, then put it back under plastic so they do not dry out whilst I work on the heads. Once the head and neck are carved and the attachment place is scored, I am ready to attach the head, body and tail together. The neck is slightly hollow and I need to cut a hole in the body to let the hot air escape during the firings.
Before the first firing in my kiln, the animal is again wrapped in plastic so the clay will even out. The drier clay will take water from the wet clay. The animal spends up to a week or more in plastic to allow for a slow dry process, which acts to minimize cracking."	<urn:uuid:7de87616-7812-4a57-9730-92449bc010cc>	0.0

nose blockage and yellow mucus not going away with cold medicine what could this mean	"Mucus-ridden stools and other symptoms such as stomachache, fever, poor appetite, and general lethargy.
Take your baby to a doctor if you see these signs or if you suddenly notice mucus in stools. There are various reasons why a baby could have more mucus in the stools.
What Could Cause Excess Mucus In The Baby’s Poop?
Some conditions cause excessive production of mucus by the mucous membranes:
- Irritable bowel syndrome: A genetic ailment that causes several symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and the presence of excessive white-colored mucus. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) consistently produce excess mucus (3) (4). At least 25% (1 out of 4) of the time, the stool will contain surplus mucus (5).
- Intussusception: A condition where a section of the intestine collapses and folds on itself to create a ring-like blockage. It is most common among babies between the ages of five to nine months (6). Intussusception can cause the baby to excrete jelly-like, mucus-ridden stools (7).
- Ulcerative colitis: It is chronic inflammation of the large intestine. Irritation of the bowel, pain, and stool with mucus are among the symptoms (8). Ulcerative colitis is one of the many inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (9).
- Cystic fibrosis: A genetic disorder that leads to excess production of mucus. It leads to the accumulation of excessive mucus in the lungs and digestive system (10). Infants with the condition may excrete more mucus than usual.
- Intestinal infection: Several intestinal pathogens can lead to the passage of more mucus in stools. Examples of some infections are E. coli bacteria infection (11), and infections due to intestinal parasites (12).
- Bowel polyps: These are small growths emerging from the inner lining of the gastrointestinal tract. They often lead to rectal bleeding and mucus in stools (13). Polyps in infants and toddlers are called juvenile polyps (14).
- Allergies: An infant with allergies and food intolerance can excrete excessive mucus in their stool. This happens because of the inflammation of the intestine due to ingestion of an allergic food (15)."	<urn:uuid:a9b603de-f2c8-458a-a7ed-c4f976dddabb>	0.0
I'm worried about both my heart health and digestion - should I stick to low-fat dairy products, and what digestive problems might dairy cause?	"What are lectins?
Lectins are a type of protein that can bind to cell membranes. They are sugar-binding and become the “glyco” portion of glycoconjugates on the membranes. Lectins offer a way for molecules to stick together without getting the immune system involved, which can influence cell-cell interaction.
Lectins are abundant in raw legumes and grains, and most commonly found in the part of the seed that becomes the leaves when the plant sprouts, aka the cotyledon, but also on the seed coat. They’re also found in dairy products and certain vegetables. While lectin content in food is fairly constant, the genetic altering of plants has created some fluctuations.
Lectins in plants are a defense against microorganisms, pests, and insects. They may also have evolved as a way for seeds to remain intact as they passed through animals’ digestive systems, for later dispersal. Lectins are resistant to human digestion and they enter the blood unchanged.
Why are lectins so important?
Lectins are thought to play a role in immune function, cell growth, cell death, and body fat regulation.
Immune response and toxicity
Because we don’t digest lectins, we often produce antibodies to them. Almost everyone has antibodies to some dietary lectins in their body. This means our responses vary. Certain foods can even become intolerable to someone after an immune system change or the gut is injured from another source. The presence of particular lectins can stimulate an immune system response.
There are some lectins that no one should consume. Ever wonder why you don’t see sprouted red kidney beans?
It’s due to phytohaemagglutinin – a lectin that can cause red kidney bean poisoning. The poisoning is usually caused by the ingestion of raw, soaked kidney beans. As few as four or five raw beans can trigger symptoms.
Raw kidney beans contain from 20,000 to 70,000 lectin units, while fully cooked beans usually contain between 200 and 400 units.
While many types of lectins cause negative reactions in the body, there are also health promoting lectins that can decrease incidence of certain diseases. Furthermore, the body uses lectins to achieve many basic functions, including cell to cell adherence, inflammatory modulation and programmed cell death.
What you should know about lectins
Ingesting lectins can cause flatulence."	<urn:uuid:979a5670-c855-47cb-b1dc-a016b8c01d2d>	0.0
I've heard that Taoism is both a religion and a philosophy - what are the basic principles and characteristics that define the Tao or the Way?	"Yet out of the midst of this din and turmoil, this strife and struggle, this hatred and jealousy of religions and sects, there have arisen, from time to time, potent voices, drowning all this noise — making themselves heard from pole to pole, as it were — proclaiming peace and harmony. Will it ever come?
Is it possible that there should ever reign unbroken harmony in this plane of mighty religious struggle. The world is exercised in the latter part of this century by the question of harmony; in society, various plans are being proposed, and attempts are made to carry them into practice; but we know how difficult it is to do so. People find that it is almost impossible to mitigate the fury of the struggle of life, to tone down the tremendous nervous tension that is in man. Now, if it is so difficult to bring harmony and peace to the physical plane of life — the external, gross, and outward side of it — then a thousand times more difficult is it to bring peace and harmony to rule over the internal nature of man. I would ask you for the time being to come out of the network of words. We have all been hearing from childhood of such things as love, peace, charity, equality, and universal brotherhood; but they have become to us mere words without meaning, words which we repeat like parrots, and it has become quite natural for us to do so. We cannot help it. Great souls, who first felt these great ideas in their hearts, manufactured these words; and at that time many understood their meaning. Later on, ignorant people have taken up those words to play with them and made religion a mere play upon words, and not a thing to be carried into practice. It becomes “my father’s religion”, “our nation’s religion”, “our country’s religion”, and so forth. It becomes only a phase of patriotism to profess any religion, and patriotism is always partial. To bring harmony into religion must always be difficult. Yet we will consider this problem of the harmony of religions.
We see that in every religion there are three parts — I mean in every great and recognised religion. First, there is the philosophy which presents the whole scope of that religion, setting forth its basic principles, the goal and the means of reaching it. The second part is mythology, which is philosophy made concrete. It consists of legends relating to the lives of men, or of supernatural beings, and so forth."	<urn:uuid:d756a659-1efc-4a81-b5e0-ce48388c9e0e>	0.0
I'm researching behavioral intervention programs and would like to understand both how cognitive activity shapes behavior and how intervention teams are structured in practice. Can you explain these aspects?	"Nine studies reported what the effect of the intervention was on their primary outcome measure [37, 39, 45, 46, 52, 58]; in Project GEMS, we reported the effect of the intervention on our primary outcome measure. Finally, 1 study determined the appropriateness of the target group for receiving the intervention , and in Project GEMS, we established that the intervention was appropriate for our written and verbal feedback.
Our discussion of the literature highlights that important areas of feasibility are not being adequately addressed in preliminary physical activity studies in persons with MS and this has major implications for the strength of the existing research regarding exercise and MS. We believe this might be addressed in future research through the provision of this scoping review of the literature. For example, process feasibility (e.g. recruitment) was discussed in less than half of the studies, and there is a need for more information on participant reactions to randomisation; it is not clear whether randomisation during clinical trials affects recruitment rates and how this might inform trial design (e.g. preference designs vs. RCTs). Metrics related to resources (e.g. time and resources) were explored in many studies, and this suggests that researchers are efficient at reporting these methodological areas. However, there is still a need for clarification of some aspects; for example, we do not know the costs involved in undertaking physical activity research programmes and these data are essential for both realistic application to funding bodies and the application of the intervention in everyday clinical practice. Data on management feasibility are not well reported in the included literature; without these data, replication of research studies and application of the intervention in clinical practice may be carried out in lieu of full knowledge regarding staffing and infrastructural requirements, and this may ultimately lead to failure of the intervention. Finally, there are many important aspects of scientific outcome feasibility, which require further explanation in preliminary studies, the reporting of intervention problems, and participant feedback will arm researchers with important knowledge to improve the science of physical activity interventions for persons with MS. There was a limitation of some studies to report hypothesis testing for baseline comparisons and the direct calculation of treatment effects, however these areas are not recommended in the new CONSORT extension guidelines .
Our case study, Projects GEMS, enabled us to systematically record feasibility study in the domains of process (e.g. recruitment), resource (e.g. communication with participants), management (e.g."	<urn:uuid:e1c60a7b-3968-4f40-8212-c4ccfe4dafc2>	0.0
marine animal food chain pollution effects	"Read through just about any pet food ingredient list—whether wet or dry—and you’ll find corn. When corn is improperly dried or stored the mold species Aspergillus can grow and develop into the toxin Aflatoxin. Elevated levels of Aflatoxin-contaminated pet food can be deadly if consumed. Although there are ways for farmers and manufacturers to test corn for toxins, too much of it has been able to slip through the cracks, be used as ingredients in pet food distributed by major brands, and find its way into households worldwide. Iams, Marksman, River Run, and Arrow are just a few of the brands recalled because of illness or death as a result of consumed contaminated pet food products in the last decade.
Pet food contamination can also occur after the food leaves the farm. Nearly three years ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the Final Rule on the Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food. It was April of 2016 when the FDA published this new rule—which was one of seven comprising the overarching Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). In response to the flurry of animal food product recalls in recent years, the FDA established this rule to curtail dangerous practices, which put the safety of animal food chain transportation at risk. These risks included improper food protection procedures, substandard vehicle cleanings between stops, and the inability to properly refrigerate food. This rule focused on overall food safety procedures instead of just emphasizing general food quality. Failure to adhere to any of these standards can also lead to illness or death of animals and costly, but preventable product recalls.
Potential contaminants at the farm and in transit are just two of the reasons animal food chain tracing measures are critical to the safety of pets and animals everywhere. For serious animal lovers and animal food chain managers, it’s not good enough to know the brand of pet foods. It’s imperative to have the ability to trace an animal’s lifecycle from the farm until it reaches your pet or animal’s mouth. This requires a concentrated effort to gather and protect data throughout the global animal food chain to alert the appropriate parties to issues before they escalate to recall situations.
Animal Food Chain Traceability
Complete animal food chain traceability is no small feat, and it’s literally a life or death matter."	<urn:uuid:3d365475-c6da-4d64-a1c3-88db11b72e33>	0.0

body temperature comparison hypothermia frostbite symptoms	"If you can prevent frostbite in the first place, you will save yourself a lot of work and save your hens from suffering.
Earlier, we mentioned some of the reasons frostbite occurs. Here we will deal with them individually to see how we can reduce the chances that your rooster or hen will get frostbite.
Low Temperature– not really much you can do about this in general. Chickens apparently don’t start to feel ‘cold’ until the temperature hits -20F who knew? They can tolerate low temperatures very well as long as they have a draft free area to shelter in.
We have discussed heating the coop in previous articles, but I still maintain that in most cases it isn’t necessary. If you hang a thermometer inside the coop, it will usually read 32-40F. How come? Well, a typical hen generates around 10watts of heat, so multiply that by the number of birds in the house to give you a ‘lightbulb’ number. Example: 10 hens each producing 10watts = 100w lightbulb!
If you have the desire to heat the coop – please use an oil-filled radiator or wall unit heater, not a heat lamp for safety sake.
Moisture– respiration and poop both contain large amounts of moisture. As long as your coop is well ventilated, most of the moisture should be expelled from the coop.
If you are concerned about frostbite, you can put Vaseline or a similar oil based cream on the wattles and combs. The Vaseline does not prevent frostbite. It forms a barrier to moisture on the exposed areas.
Wind Chill– the wind chill increases the rate of heat loss from the body. The air movement disrupts the ‘boundary’ layer of air around a body, so more heat is lost. Wind chill can be extremely dangerous.
The birds need to have a wind free area. You can cover their runs with tarps or plastic sheeting to prevent the wind from whipping through the area. If your coops have gaps/holes, they need to be plugged up to prevent the chilly breeze getting in!
Length of Exposure– how long was the bird outside? Your hens should always have somewhere relatively warm and draft free to retreat to. Also, walking on snow will chill their feet down considerably."	<urn:uuid:af2932b9-696a-45ea-a718-2a44da0be4da>	0.0

Last season in Idaho, West Nile virus was detected in nine symptomatic people, 10 horses, and a multitude of mosquitoes located across fifteen different counties. Fortunately, there were no deaths.

Southwest District Health has reported a third case of travel-related Zika virus infection in Idaho. Here’s the news release:
CANYON COUNTY REPORTS TRAVEL-RELATED ZIKA
Southwest District Health officials confirmed today that a Canyon County male in his 40’s has tested positive for the Zika virus, after traveling to an area outside the U. S. with active Zika virus transmission. He was not hospitalized. The case is yet to be interviewed, but initial information suggests this was likely travel-related. This is the 3rd case of travel-acquired Zika virus disease to be reported in Idaho this year. There have been no locally-acquired cases in Idaho. At this time, there is no vaccine or medicine for the virus.
The Zika virus is an emerging mosquito-borne disease in the Western Hemisphere. It spreads to people primarily through the bite of two species of infected mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus). These mosquitoes also carry dengue fever and chikungunya. These two species of mosquitoes are not native to Idaho.
According to Randi Pedersen, Epidemiologist for Southwest District Health, Zika typically does not cause symptoms or causes only a mild illness lasting up to a week. Some infected cases experience mild symptoms, such as fever, rash, joint pain, or red eyes for up to a week, but many people don’t even know they are infected."	<urn:uuid:4d3d914a-c5ed-40cb-b734-707e71e66ef1>	0.0

|Required Device||Android 4.1 and up|
|Available On||Play Store|
|Last Updated||September 3, 2021|
Last Shelter: Survival is a strategy game offered by Long Tech Network Limited. It has more than ten million downloads on the play store. It’s a good choice if you are looking for a post-apocalyptic world game in which strategy is everything to survive.
Overview of Last Shelter: Survival
A deadly virus has spread throughout the world and the people who come in its contact are turning into zombies. It’s not a world where you can live peacefully. In order to survive, you have to make a powerful team and fully defend the base. You play as a commander who is attacked by zombies and reaches a base. Rick, your partner, opens the base and a survivor offers you to stay in that base if you defend the base. From here on out, your journey begins.
In this game, you have to defend your base from the zombies no matter what. Build a fence around the base and set up barracks, hospitals, oil well, power plants, farms, and everything to keep everyone alive. Upgrade the base to unlock new buildings and defense. You can build a shooting range, fighter camp to train shooters and fighters. Upgrading these buildings will unlock new troops. Each troop has different stats and ways of attacking the zombies. Kill the zombies, extend your territory and build more buildings to run your shelter well and safely.
To fight against the zombies, you need all kinds of troops from melee attackers to ranged shooters. You also need vehicles like trucks with weapons, tanks, etc. Build the shooting range where you can train many types of shooters, each with different stats. You can train fighters in the fight camp. Fighters attack the zombies from close range.
Buildings are an important factor. To survive in this world full of zombies, building defense is necessary to stop the zombies from attacking your base. You also need food to live, power plants for electricity, oil well for fuel, and water filters. These are just basic needs. No one knows how many zombies can attack your base. So advanced defense, troops to fight them, heroes, headquarters are required. There are all kinds of builds that you need to build in order to survive and defend yourself.
There are 63 heroes you can use."	<urn:uuid:de4f0fe4-97ff-4f8d-95d2-152e221e062c>	0.0

behavioral manifestations neurological basis anxiety disorders	"A behavioral and neurological evaluation of dry cleaners exposed to perchloroethylene.
Tuttle-TC; Wood-GD; Grether-CB; Johnson-BL; Xintaras-C
Cincinnati, OH: U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, DHEW (NIOSH) Publication No. 77-214, 1977 Jun; :1-88
The possible adverse effects of perchloroethylene (127184) on workers' neurologic status and behavioral performance were examined in 27 volunteers who worked in various dry cleaning jobs. Of this number, 18 were exposed daily by nature of their job to various levels of the compound and had a mean 8 hour time weighted average (TWA) exposure of 18ppm over the 5 days of testing. The 9 males within the exposed group, however, had a mean TWA exposure of 32ppm. Neurological examinations showed a significant difference between neurological ratings for exposed workers versus controls. However, multiple regression analyses suggest the neurological deficits to be related to workers' prior exposure to Stoddard's-Solvent (8052413), not perchloroethylene. The effects of acute perchloroethylene exposure were examined by giving workers behavioral performance tests both prior to work and following work over a 5 day period. Although significant differences in performance of some perception and psychomotor tests were found, multiple regression analysis showed the post shift performance decrements to be significantly correlated with a measure of fatigue, not with perchloroethylene exposure that occurred during the workshift. In summary, no evidence was found of deleterious effects of perchloroethylene on workers' neurologic health or behavioral performance. However, findings strongly suggest the involvement of Stoddard's Solvent as a factor accounting for an increased incidence of abnormally large neurologic scores. (Contract No. 099-73-0035)

chemical enzyme requirements digestion process linked unlinked sugar molecules	"Plants have two main immune responses—the hypersensitive response, in which infected cells seal themselves off and undergo programmed cell death, and systemic acquired resistance, where infected cells release signals warning the rest of the plant of a pathogen's presence. Chloroplasts stimulate both responses by purposely damaging their photosynthetic system, producing reactive oxygen species. High levels of reactive oxygen species will cause the hypersensitive response. The reactive oxygen species also directly kill any pathogens within the cell. Lower levels of reactive oxygen species initiate systemic acquired resistance, triggering defense-molecule production in the rest of the plant.
In some plants, chloroplasts are known to move closer to the infection site and the nucleus during an infection.
Chloroplasts can serve as cellular sensors. After detecting stress in a cell, which might be due to a pathogen, chloroplasts begin producing molecules like salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which can serve as defense-signals. As cellular signals, reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules, so they probably don't leave the chloroplast, but instead pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule. All these molecules initiate retrograde signaling—signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus.
In addition to defense signaling, chloroplasts, with the help of the peroxisomes, help synthesize an important defense molecule, jasmonate. Chloroplasts synthesize all the fatty acids in a plant cell—linoleic acid, a fatty acid, is a precursor to jasmonate.
One of the main functions of the chloroplast is its role in photosynthesis, the process by which light is transformed into chemical energy, to subsequently produce food in the form of sugars. Water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are used in photosynthesis, and sugar and oxygen (O2) is made, using light energy. Photosynthesis is divided into two stages—the light reactions, where water is split to produce oxygen, and the dark reactions, or Calvin cycle, which builds sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. The two phases are linked by the energy carriers adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+).
ATP is the phosphorylated version of adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which stores energy in a cell and powers most cellular activities."	<urn:uuid:087d4933-d060-406b-ac12-4e497768606f>	0.0

Digitalization and Innovation
Research area: Digitalization and Innovation
The research area ‘Digitalization and Innovation’ focuses on describing, explaining, designing and evaluating fundamental changes and sustainable innovations in products, processes, services, business models and governance mechanisms based on digital technology. Researchers use methods that are focused on design and, in addition to traditional research methods from behavioral science, place particular important on construction-oriented research approaches. For this reason, in addition to publishing research findings, systematically designing artefacts is an important part of the work carried out by researchers in this area.
Energy Markets and Energy Systems Analysis
Research area: Energy Markets and Energy Systems Analysis
This research area looks at the influences of the economic, political and social environment on the development of the energy system. Its focuses are analyzing the effect of market design and regulation on incentives for investment and business models in the electricity and gas sector and conducting empirical studies on the acceptance of the transformation of the energy system and on the general public’s participation in the implementation. The Energy Markets and Energy Systems Analysis group at the School of Business and Economics combines approaches from economics, business and law, and collaborates closely with mathematicians and engineers at FAU through Energie Campus Nürnberg (EnCN).
Research area: Health
The aim of the research area ‘Health’ is to increase knowledge and find ways of applying it constructively in practice. Business research conducted on the management of cost-bearing institutions, health services, hospitals and pharmaceuticals is as much of a focus as economic research in areas such as evaluation. A key part of this is measuring the outcomes of health measures, as simple cost analysis is not enough. For this reason, qualitative effects of health services play a significant role for all aspects that are considered."	<urn:uuid:504c94f8-b2ad-4b21-ad19-0ebe581bae2b>	0.0

Grounding/Earthing The Body
A Simple Yet Profound & Totally Effective Solution For Living In Our Modern Day Electro-Pollution
The best EMR Protection ever? Let’s find out! How can EM Fields affect us adversely? The most significant method by which the body takes on increased voltage is from emitted electromagnetic radiation. Not only does this include using a Cell phone, Digital Cordless (DECT) phone, Wi-Fi, and other wireless devices close to the body, but also from more distant sources such as Cell Towers, Digital TV transmissions, Radar, etc. When exposed to this radiation the body, being a natural antenna (transmitter and receiver of ‘information/energy’), receives, and through its conductive tissues and fluids, converts electromagnetic waves into electric currents. Radiation from an electromagnetic source induces an alternating current in the body and a corresponding voltage.
When the body is insulated from the Earth (i.e. wearing rubber-soled shoes), the body becomes a ‘sink’ for electromagnetic radiation. The body then absorbs this radiation, but cannot get rid of it. This radiation gets converted to electric currents which cause vibration at the cellular level. The modulated portion (data transmission) of this EM radiation is in a frequency range that causes harmful vibration at the cellular level. This then causes damage to the cell by displacing ions and destabilizing the membrane. Ultimately, this leads to membrane leakage and can produce negative biological effects.
However, if the body is in direct contact with the Earth (i.e. Grounded), then the Earth becomes the ‘sink’ for the electromagnetic radiation. This means that the body functions as a conductor and allows the radiation to pass through it before current can be generated on a cellular level and cause damage."	<urn:uuid:f5b290ff-b2b6-4c7f-b8bd-cf4095b99e00>	0.0
As a chemist, I'm curious: how is propylene glycol used in vaping, and what are the safety concerns?	"The concentration of glycol influences the heat flows indirectly. An increase in glycol concentration causes a reduction in heat transfer by several mechanisms.
What are the Basic Features of a Brewery Chiller?
The Brewery Chiller has many basic features that make it remarkable equipment in the brewing industry. The major features that enhance its efficiency and specificity include:
- P-trap overflow
- Glycol economizers
- Hermetic compressor
- High thermal efficiency tan
- High flow glycol connections
- Electronic expansion valves
- Dual refrigeration circuits
Brewery chiller hermetic compressor
What are the Main Components of a Brewery Chiller?
Brewery Chiller has some common components as the other chillers. It comprises tanks and pumps having a range of 31 to 30,000 gallons made up of polyethylene or stainless steel. Other components include:
A dual compressor is a major component of the Brewery Chiller that ensures the movement of the refrigerant throughout the system and compresses the pressure and volume of the gas.
An evaporator absorbs the heat from the worts and fermentation process and sends it to the refrigerant to cool it down. It is placed between the compressor and the expansion valve.
A control unit is mounted that monitors the efficiency of the Brewery Chiller. Control units have certain alarms for safety reasons that can shut down the system instantly.
What is the Working Process of a Brewery Chiller?
A Brewery Chiller works by use of a multiple-section heat exchanger that uses chilled glycol and water to circulate heat away from the brew to the refrigeration system or heat exchanger.
In the first step, the evaporator absorbs heat from the process and sends it to the refrigerant which is moved throughout the system with the aid of a compressor. A condenser is located next which dissipate this heat.
The condenser forwards the refrigerant to expansion value which increases its volume. An expansion value operates by two major components such as a thermal operation valve and a pilot.
Which Refrigerant can be used in a Brewery Chiller?
A refrigerant is an organic compound that is used in Brewery Chiller as a coolant. It acts as an anti-freezing agent, having a high heat absorption rating, and a non-corrosive agent.
Commonly, a glycol-based coolant is used in a Brewery Chiller. Glycol can be ethylene glycol or propylene glycol mixed with water."	<urn:uuid:323d96ed-2d86-4b20-aa03-dcba3c7cac21>	0.0
president lincoln stance on black soldiers emancipation proclamation effects missouri kentucky status	"Confederate Speaker Portraits To Be Removed From The U.S. Capitol On Juneteenth
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says the portraits of four former House speakers who served in the Confederacy will be removed from display in the Capitol this Friday in observance of Juneteenth.
Pelosi directed the clerk of the House of Representatives to remove the portraits on June 19 to mark the day in 1865 when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news that President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation. That day came more than two years after Lincoln signed the order freeing enslaved people — a day now observed as Juneteenth.
""As I have said before, the halls of Congress are the very heart of our democracy,"" Pelosi wrote in the letter requesting the removal. ""There is no room in the hallowed halls of Congress or in any place of honor for memorializing men who embody the violent bigotry and grotesque racism of the Confederacy.""
The four House speakers whose portraits will be removed are Robert Hunter of Virginia, who was the speaker of the House from 1839 to 1841; Howell Cobb of Georgia, who served as speaker from 1849 to 1851; James Orr of South Carolina, who served as speaker from 1857 to 1859; and Charles Crisp of Georgia, who served as speaker from 1891 to 1895.
Shortly after Pelosi announced the removal of the portraits, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., attempted to pass a resolution removing Confederate statues from the Capitol. He asked for unanimous consent to approve the measure and was blocked by Senate Rules Committee Chairman Roy Blunt, R-Mo.
Booker noted that 12 Confederate statues were placed in the National Statuary Hall between 1901 and 1931. Booker noted it was a period of violence, suppression and terror for black Americans. He added that the Civil War represents four years in the country's history and that putting statues of Confederates in the Capitol was part of an effort to further intimidate and suppress black Americans.
""We cannot separate the Confederate statues from this history and legacy of white supremacy,"" Booker said. ""They are painful, insulting, difficult injury being compounded to so many American citizens."""	<urn:uuid:a9c0dca8-18fc-486a-afc4-3a1865749b6b>	0.0
I lead digital analytics at an e-commerce company and want to better understand the interplay between technical performance monitoring and user behavior analysis - what's the recommended approach to combine quantitative metrics with qualitative user feedback for optimizing website performance?	"For example, Prometheus helps to understand what’s going on in complex microservice setups, which is hard to accomplish using conventional monitoring approaches.” – Björn Rabenstein, engineer at SoundCloud and Prometheus core developer
The Prometheus software for monitoring and analysis of cloud native architectures and time series data benefits cloud developers, DevOps and end users in the following ways:
Cloud developers: Easy instrumentation of your code, which will not only help in production, but also during development to spot performance issues and other irregularities. Kubernetes scheduler performance was increased by 10x by debugging using Prometheus. Additionally, Prometheus does not lock you in as there are many integration points with other systems.
DevOps: Finally you can implement the alerting you want and ask the questions you always needed answers for.
End users: The increased reliability and better performance of Prometheus is a major benefit to end users. As the first company using Prometheus, SoundCloud was able to detect and handle outages much better than before and increase the site’s availability significantly. Additional end user case studies include Life360 and ShowMax.
The Prometheus Community
With 350+ contributors worldwide and 8,671 commits, this monitoring tool created in 2012 is quickly becoming a high velocity project. Prometheus has an active and growing user base counting SoundCloud, Digital Ocean, Ericsson, CoreOS, Weaveworks, Red Hat, and Google among its many users. Prometheus has grown to become one of the top open source monitoring tools of choice for the modern platform.
Here are some recent stats on the growing Prometheus ecosystem:
37 repositories in its GitHub organization
6867 stars for all repos
5274 stars for the main prometheus/prometheus repo
To get started with Prometheus or join its community, please visit the Getting Started page of the project’s website and the Community page of the project’s website for more information.
Prometheus and Kubernetes
Prometheus integrates with CNCF’s first hosted project, Kubernetes, which recently announced the release of its 1.3 version, to support service discovery and monitoring of dynamically scheduled services. Kubernetes also supports Prometheus natively.
“Despite their independent developments, Kubernetes and Prometheus are both inspired by the way and spirit of how Google has been running large-scale production systems. This led to a convergent evolution. Even before Prometheus entered the CNCF, Kubernetes components were instrumented with Prometheus metrics. Prometheus in turn has native support for the Kubernetes service discovery mechanism."	<urn:uuid:1e9ba100-22c6-4f6d-9b78-e8c872ab8a8c>	0.0

The Direct Line survey suggested that an en-suite bathroom could add an extra 5.1 per cent to the value of an average property.
Does not having a bathtub in master hurt resale?
Some real estate agents have advised that as long as your home has at least one tub, even if it’s not in the master bath, you should be okay. If the master bath tub is your only tub, removing it could be detrimental to the value of your home and exclude many potential buyers.
How important is a bathtub for resale Australia?
As a rule, if space for a bath is available, buyers will be looking for one. Most real estate experts agree that not having a bath makes a home harder to sell and reduces its value.
Are bathtubs going out of style?
The freestanding bathtub is a current bathroom remodeling trend that may soon be going out of style. … Freestanding bathtubs are also very heavy and may require a reinforced floor. Doorless showers. A doorless shower may increase the amount of floor space in your bathroom, but it also creates a problem with humidity.
How much does it cost to replace a tub with a walk in shower?
Cost is $200 to $2,000, depending on options. If you want a custom tile shower, the cost jumps quite a bit. Usually around $1,000 to $3,500 depending on complexity, size, and the type of tile and fixtures you choose. Add another $500 to $1,000 for tear-out, new plumbing pipes, fixtures, and any custom carpentry.
Does removing a bath devalue your home?
A bathroom is a must-have for families, whether it be for bathing the kids or when you want a moment to relax. As a result, if you are thinking about turning a bathtub into a shower, the short simple answer is no – you should avoid removing a bath at all costs to prevent devaluing your home.

In my role developing parent engagement strategies, I'm trying to identify effective ways parents can support their children's learning process. What specific actions can parents take to boost their child's academic achievement?	"Child support determinations and requests can be stressful to manage for a number of reasons:
- Real costs specific to only the child can be difficult to determine
- Unpaid support can be punishable by jail time
- If one parent feels the amount is unfair it could cause tension or arguments
Some parents choose to take all child support payments and place them into a bank account in the child's name for use as an adult. Other parents need this weekly or monthly income supplement to help with daily living costs like food and housing. Whatever your needs, keep in mind child support is meant to cover the costs of living for your child. If you use it only as such, there should be little cause for complaint from the other parent.
Although children typically live with one parent the majority of the time, healthy co-parenting still needs to take place. Co-parenting with a person you no longer live with can be challenging, especially as you redefine your relationship.
Co-parenting does not mean you have to be best friends with your child's father. It doesn't even mean you have to like him. What it does mean is you are both committed to discussing important events and issues regarding your child and trying to agree on a unified approach. While it may not be possible in all situations, there are a few key points to remember when communicating with your child's father:
- Keep each other informed of important extra-curricular activities and events.
- Stay positive and cordial when speaking in front of your child.
- Save difficult discussions for a time when you can speak alone.
- Live by the golden rule: treat your child's father as you wish to be treated.
Role of Romantic Partners
At some point, you or your child's father may decide to enter into a new romantic relationship. Preparing yourself emotionally for this occasion can take time. It can be helpful to discuss expectations about when your child should be introduced to a parent's new romantic partner and what roles that person should take on before any new relationships start.

compare senate rules constitutional requirements trump impeachment trial post presidency removal consequences	"â€œYou didn’t even bother to pull all the levers,” said Scott Jennings, a longtime political adviser to McConnell.
Many Democrats say there would have been no way to prevent Republicans from complaining that the investigation was political and lacked sufficient evidence.
â€œThey’d have said that if you’d produced volumes more evidence,â€ said John Lawrence, Pelosi’s chief of staff for eight years ending in 2013.
And while Democrats collected compelling evidence against Trump, they made the mistake of thinking they’d win by appealing broadly to voters, said Brendan Buck, a GOP consultant who’s advised congressional leaders. Republicans prevailed by aiming their arguments at the GOP’s core conservative supporters, a tactic that has driven Trump’s presidency.
â€œDemocrats seemed to play by the old rules and the president played by the new rules,â€ Buck said.
One moderate House Democrat said Democrats facing difficult reelection fights from Trump-leaning districts think Pelosi made tactical decisions that could jeopardize them.
That includes her one-month delay in formally sending the House’s impeachment articles to the Senate. That fed the GOP argument that the effort was political, said the Democrat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.
This Democrat said lawmakers also recoiled at Pelosi’s decision to sign the impeachment articles and distribute pens as mementos to colleagues. The Democrat said voters in their districts often cited that televised ceremony as evidence that impeachment was politically motivated.
â€œThey ran as, ‘I’m not just a regular Democrat, I’ll reach across party lines,'” said former Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., who once ran the House GOP’s campaign organization. â€œAnd here they are impeaching the president like this.”
One thing many from both parties agree on: By November, impeachment could well be superseded by other issues and will likely be conflated into an overall referendum on Trump.
â€œMy honest guess is that the public will very rapidly turn to kitchen table issues,â€ said former Rep. David Obey, D-Wis."	<urn:uuid:a0138e86-49c4-497b-8411-841591254fa2>	0.0

What solutions exist for controlling excessive input signals?	"The output of the XOR gate 400 feeds an input of the XOR gate 402. The other input of the XOR gate 402 is coupled to a logic high signal. The output of the XOR gate 402 will be a negative going pulse each time the sync signal is activated no matter what the normal state of the sync signal is.
The outputs of the sync polarizer 362 are coupled to a horizontal and vertical sync input of an onscreen processor 364. The onscreen processor produces red, green and blue video signals that display one or more alphanumeric characters that are programmed in its internal video ROM memory. To dictate which characters are placed on the video screen, the CPU 80 generates serial I2 C interface signals on a pair of leads 363 and 365. These signals are applied to the onscreen processor 364 which causes the processor to retrieve from an internal video RAM characters that are to be displayed on the video screen. The onscreen processor 364 provides two signals HBFK and HTONE that are supplied to an overlay control logic circuit 366. Also supplied to the overlay control logic circuit are four signals from the CPU 80 of the user pod. These four signals are H Tone Enable, OSD Enable, System Video Enable and Transparent. The overlay control logic circuit 366 reads the value of these logic signals and either enables or disables a set of tri-state buffers 368, 370 and 372 on the tri-state buffers 352, 354 and 356. These tri-state buffers 368, 370 and 372 couple the outputs of the onscreen processor 364 to the leads that connect to the monitor's color inputs.
When the tri-state buffers 352, 354 and 356 are in their high impedance state, and the tri-state buffers 368, 370 and 372 are active, then the video screen will only display those signals produced by the onscreen processor. Conversely, if the tri-state buffers 368, 370 and 372 are in their high impedance state and the tri-state buffers 352, 354 and 356 are active then the monitor displays the video signals produced by the remote computer system. If both sets of tri-state buffers 368, 370, 372 and 352, 354 and 356 are both active, then the monitor will display the video signals produced by both the onscreen processor and the remote computer system."	<urn:uuid:1d36f6a4-a1c8-4859-94ef-c172338812c9>	0.0
what does number protons neutrons add up to give in an element	"KLOE-2 at Uppsala University
The KLOE-2 experiment studies the strong interaction at low energies. The strong interaction is what binds the protons and neutrons in a nucleus, but also what binds the protons and neutrons themselves, from quarks. It is the strong interaction which gives rise to most of the proton and neutron mass, and thus the mass of the visible universe. In fact, the mass of the quarks in the proton only accounts for ca 2% of the proton's mass! We want to better understand this interaction.
Protons and neutrons are hadrons (colorless particles made up of quarks). There are two well known types of hadrons: baryons, which are made up of three quarks (like the proton and neutron); and mesons, which are made up of quarks and anti-quarks. In KLOE-2, we focus on mesons, actually light mesons (with masses up to ca 1 GeV).
The KLOE-2 experiment, an upgrade of the KLOE experiment, is currently running at the DAFNE accelerator. In DAFNE, electrons and positrons accelerated to ca 510 MeV each collide. From the energy of the collision, for example φ mesons are produced. The φ mesons can then decay to other mesons, and the decay products are measured in the KLOE-2 detector. The KLOE-2 detector is actually a collection of detectors, ordered here by their proximity to the interaction region: an inner tracker (to detect charged particle tracks close to the interaction region), a crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (to detect photons at small angles), a scintillating tile calorimeter covering the interaction region quadrupoles (to improve detection of KL decay photons), a tagger for low energy electrons and positrons (for two photons physics), a drift chamber (to detect tracks of charged particles), surrounded by a lead/scintillating fiber electromagnetic calorimeter (to detect photons but also charged particles) and a tagger for high energy electrons and positrons, located after the first bending dipole (also for two photon physics). The drift chamber and surrounding electromagnetic calorimeter were already a part of KLOE, the other detectors are the upgrade."	<urn:uuid:c1222ee9-81cf-4740-bad3-52618aa666ea>	0.0

Blu-ray Image Quality – 20th Century Fox presents this Blu-ray disc in a stunning 1080p image presentation that looks totally top notch and is totally enhanced with the 2.40:1 aspect ratio and it is Dariusz Wolski, who previously shot ‘Prometheus,’ returned as the cinematographer on ‘ALIEN: COVENANT’ to give it that extra dimension of the awesome atmospheric dramatic effects. The black levels are natural throughout and very deep at times. The scenes that transpire at night in the wheat field look totally amazing. Since it’s a dark space opera so to speak I would go as far as to say the colour palette is pretty well spot on for how you would want it to look. There’s nothing exaggerated or overblown and when those explosions go off it blinds you like any good explosion in the dark of night should. As to the skin tones, they are all very pasty white and natural throughout because of being stuck in outer space for the very long period in travelling outer space and I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary and every one had a healthy glow to them unless they were ill, you know sick from the alien bug in them. But there is one very negative aspect of viewing this film, is that it should have been shot in 3D, especially being a follow up to the previous film."	<urn:uuid:a50d9725-8dff-4762-8e64-7ad4efb3b1d9>	0.0

Artists Who Paint Themselves & Profession in Art
Throughout the history of art, artists such as Michelangelo and Velázquez have painted themselves into their paintings. Is it possible others painted using symbols of their profession? I'll explain who, what and why?
Michelangelo's fresco of the ""Last Judgement"" (1536-1541) from the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican, Rome shows Saint Bartholomew and his flayed skin with Michelangelo's self portrait.
It has been speculated that this tragic self portrayal was due to his tortured soul.
Albrecht Dürer's ""Self Portrait as Christ"" (1500) has been recognized as a symbolic representation of Christ. One can only imagine (myself included) whether geniuses such as the artists included in this article actually received some sort of ""divine intervention"" to fulfill their life's quest.
Rembrandt's ""Storm on the Sea of Galilee"" (1633) is known as this master's only seascape painting. It resided at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston until 1990 when it was stolen. To this day, it has not been located.
As there are fourteen people on the boat, it is believed that the twelve disciples, Jesus, and Rembrandt himself, are on the boat. Why shouldn't an artist be in great company?
Diego Velázquez's ""Las Meninas (The Maids of Honor)"" (1656) depicts himself as an artist, looking directly at us, the viewer, while he stands alongside a large canvas where he apparently is working.
Artemisia Gentileschi's ""Judith Slaying Holofernes"" (1611-1612) shows herself as Judith. Although it was a classic scene from the Bible, it was particularly personal for Artemisia as she was a victim of rape. It may have been a way of cleansing her mind (and soul) of this violent act.
Do artists paint themselves into their paintings because they hope they (and their works) will become immortal? Or do they consider themselves on a greater plane - or level of achievement - that supersedes all human comprehension?"	<urn:uuid:c7f2f5ef-3e7d-4108-aa16-6e8a82b33bb6>	0.0

Superior Germination Through Superior Science
Park Seed offers some of the highest-quality vegetable and flower seeds available in the industry, and there are a number of reasons for this.
First of all, we have humidity- and temperature-controlled storage, and we never treat any of our seeds with chemicals or pesticides. Nor do we ever sell GMO's (genetically modified seeds), so you always know the products you're buying from us are natural as well as safe for you and the environment.
Superior Standards - University Inspected
To make sure we are providing the best seed product possible and that our customers will get the highest number of seedlings from every packet, we conduct our own germination testing and have quality-control measures in every stage of our seed-handling operation. We hold ourselves to standards that are at or above federal and state standards, including testing specific crops more frequently than recommended by federal guidelines. And in order to maintain our organic certification, we welcome Clemson University to inspect us annually to make sure our organic seeds, which are stored and processed separately, are being handled properly.
Hand Packed By Experienced Technicians
Park Seed has been handling and packing vegetable and flower seeds for 145 years, a history that has given us a great understanding of how each variety should be cared for and maintained throughout every step of theprocess, from collection to shipping.
When packing our seeds, the majority are actually done by hand (with extreme care!), and we often over-pack them, so you're receiving more than the stated quantity.
The Park Seed Gold Standard
And many of our seeds are packed in our exclusive Fresh-Pak gold foil packets, which are lined to keep moisture out, so the seeds stay fresher for longer. We carefully pack very tiny or fragile seeds in crush-proof vials to ensure safe delivery to your home. Some of the small seeds are also offered as ""pellets"" (have a clay coating) to make sowing and growing easier.
When it comes to the kinds of seeds we offer, we are constantly seeking something new and provide many unique and hard-to-find varieties from all around the world."	<urn:uuid:678c99da-e54e-4f71-875d-3752c18f8e10>	0.0
environmental social implications waterway transport systems urban areas	"Noise pollution has become one of the main problems of modern cities, having a negative impact on the health, comfort and quality of life of citizens. However, with the development of innovative technologies, new opportunities appear to combat this problem. In this article, we will look at some innovations and technologies that help create quieter urban environments.
- Sound insulation and acoustic materials: One of the key approaches to reducing noise pollution is the use of special materials for sound insulation. Acoustic panels, soundproof wallpaper, special coatings for floors and ceilings - all this helps to absorb and reduce the sound level, preventing its propagation and reflection from surfaces.
- Smart Transport and Traffic Management: Intelligent transport management systems can significantly reduce the noise from cars and public transport. Automatic speed control, traffic flow optimization and the use of electric and hybrid vehicles help to reduce noise and emissions of harmful substances.
- Green areas and sound-absorbing vegetation: Creating green areas and parks with an abundance of vegetation is an effective way to reduce noise in an urban environment. Plants, especially those with dense foliage, can absorb and break up sound, creating a calmer atmosphere.
- Active noise reduction: Modern active noise reduction technologies allow you to reduce the noise load by using systems that emit an anti-wave of sound, neutralizing noise waves. Such systems are used, for example, in acoustic panels, headphones with active noise reduction and even in some public spaces where noise can be significant, for example, around construction sites or transport hubs.
- Quiet materials and technologies: Special quiet materials used in construction, such as noise-absorbing concrete and asphalt, help reduce sound reflection and noise levels in urban areas. In addition, engineers and architects are developing new designs and technologies, taking into account aspects of noise protection and creating quieter buildings and infrastructure.
- Information systems and warnings: The development of information systems that warn about noise events and notify citizens of temporary changes in the noise environment, allows people to take measures to minimize the negative impact of noise on their health and comfort. This may include warnings about noisy events, construction work, or temporary changes in traffic.
- Public education and awareness: Raising awareness of citizens about the problem of noise pollution and its impact on health and quality of life can contribute to changing attitudes towards noise. Conducting campaigns that teach noise reduction measures and involving citizens in the decision-making process to improve the noise environment are important aspects of combating noise pollution."	<urn:uuid:d012bb98-f4c7-4240-a46e-6dad44dc65b7>	0.0
international export procedures hazardous goods regulations workplace safety precautions	"Health care workers who prepare or administer hazardous drugs or who work in
areas where these drugs are used may be exposed to these agents in the air or
on work surfaces, contaminated clothing, medical equipment, patient excreta,
and other surfaces.
Studies have associated workplace exposures to hazardous drugs with health
effects such as skin rashes and adverse reproductive outcomes (including
infertility, spontaneous abortions, and congenital malformations) and possibly
leukemia and other cancers. The health risk is influenced by the extent of the
exposure and the potency and toxicity of the hazardous drug.
To provide workers with the greatest protection, employers should implement
necessary administrative and engineering controls and assure that workers use
sound procedures for handling hazardous drugs and proper protective equipment.
The US-American NIOSH guidance (Preventing Occupational Exposure to
Antineoplastic and Other Hazardous Drugs in Health Care Settings) contains a
list of drugs that should be handled as hazardous drugs. The area of new drug
development is rapidly evolving as unique approaches are being taken to treat
cancer and other serious diseases.
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated Appendix A in the

which body parts does osteoarthritis affect most	"In the first year or so of latent syphilis you can still pass the infection on. After this time, you are no longer infectious to others but you still have syphilis infection. If left untreated, the germs can slowly damage various parts of your body and symptoms of the final (tertiary) stage may eventually appear.
Tertiary syphilis can develop many years after the initial syphilis infection. Some manifestations of the disease can occur up to 50 years later. Many of these complications are potentially very serious and can make you extremely unwell. Some problems are life-threatening and can lead to death if untreated.
Syphilis is not considered to be infectious in its tertiary stage. Tertiary complications are slowly progressive and can affect any organ of your body.
Tertiary syphilis may cause several types of complications:
- Brain (neurological) complications. This is also called neurosyphilis (see next section).
- Cardiovascular complications. These are problems affecting your heart and blood vessels (the cardiovascular system). Most commonly, syphilis affects the main blood vessel leading out of your heart (the aorta). Inflammation here can cause weakening of your aorta, which can stretch, forming an aneurysm. Aneurysms have thin weak walls and can burst (rupture), potentially leading to death. Even if an aneurysm does not rupture, it can seriously affect one of your heart valves (the aortic valve), leading to a heart murmur. In turn, the heart does not pump very well and becomes swollen (distended) with blood. This condition is known as heart failure. See separate leaflets called Heart Failure and The Heart and Blood Vessels for more details.
- Gummatous disease. Gummas are soft growths (tumours) caused by inflammation. They are not cancerous (malignant) tumours but are long-term (chronic) and can affect any part of the body. They can grow on your skeleton and affect your joints; they can also cause large lumps in or under the skin. Gummas can grow on your internal organs (such as your liver) and affect organ function. Quite commonly they appear on your leg, below your knee. Gummas may be single or multiple and can vary in size between one and several centimetres."	<urn:uuid:afe5fd42-5ef5-40f8-97b8-3d9235236dfd>	0.0
I'm starting a new business and I'm confused about LLC vs C corp taxes. How do they differ in terms of taxation, and what are the legal protections they offer to owners?	"To register a limited liability company in Ghana, the basic requirements include; Get a name for the company. The name must be unique, it should not be misleading or undesirable. Next, the applicant has to obtain a tax identification number (TIN). Also, the applicant should indicate the address of the building where he intends to carry out the business. The company should be registered with the Ghana Investment Promotion Center (GIPC). After successful registration, the company will receive relevant documents that will confirm the formation of a new LLC as well as the rules and regulations that will guide the company.
Dissolution of an LLC
There are lots of factors that may lead to the dissolution of an LLC such as;
- Differences of opinion among its members
- Poor management
- Lack of working capital
The plan to dissolve an LLC first has to be a result of the mutual consent of all the members. They have to obtain a certificate of dissolution from the legal authorities. They need to cancel all licenses/permits which they obtained in the formation of the company.
Also, they need to inform all tax authorities about the dissolution through proper documentation. If there are pending salaries of employees, they have to clear them in order to avoid future claims.
The contents of the dissolution notice have to include a formal email address. This is to enable the creditors to send their claims. The company must include the deadline for creditors to file their claims. They need to explain that if the deadline elapses, they will not allow any claim. If the creditors raise a valid claim, then members will have to settle by making full repayments.
The company should distribute assets according to the share of capital each member contributed. The final step is to file the articles of dissolution with the state authorities in charge. This shows the formal date of the dissolution and the reasons behind dissolving the company.
LLC Vs LTD
When we talk about the LLC vs LTD, there are minor differences though they are largely the same. The state laws govern both of them.
The primary difference between the two is that LTDs pay tax LLCs do not.
The acronym “LTD” means limited and we commonly see it mostly within the European Union and affords owners the same protections as an LLC. Generally, they use it to describe an entity, and you will always find that corporations S and C usually end with LTD.
LLCs provide certain benefits such that it allows members partnership and corporate benefits."	<urn:uuid:bc1c710e-e5a5-4b34-8ce9-83e3ace11641>	0.0

reasons why corporations change name logo design	"Because these brands appeal to very different customers, they just might be able to get away with it.
3. Diesel and Velux
Can it get more simple than these logos? I think not. In both cases, a red rectangle gives a feeling of straightforwardness combined with the aggressiveness of bright, primary red. Upper case white letters add a feeling of modernity and draw in the eye without any of the seriousness of black. These two logos are certainly very similar, but they are just as dissimilar.
Diesel, a jeans and sportswear brand, uses ultra-plain letters for a contemporary feeling, with a tagline below hinting that successful living can be had by using this brand. Velux, a window covering company, uses a heavily serifed font that suggests leadership roles in their industry and a strong sense of tradition. These logos are definitely similar, but the fact that they are similar and belong to companies in such disparate industries will keep them from feeling like copycats.
4. Sun Microsystems and Columbia Sportswear
A square on its side made up of four interwoven parts: it sounds so simple and yet so unique that it is hard to imagine two different companies successfully using this element as a logo design and the cornerstone of their brand. However, there are a few differences. Sun Microsystems uses a business-like blue and waves the square out of their name. Columbia, on the other hand, has an earthy brown that is representative of their earthy brand and gives a more ‘basket-like’ feeling to their logo design. It should also be noted that the companies use very different fonts, which make it easy to tell them apart, and text in the logo that clearly denote their industry.
These logo designs can co-exist for several reasons. First, as with several of our previous examples, they are not in the same industry. In fact, it is unlikely that two brands as disparate as this will ever be in the same store or even on the same city block. Second, there are several key differences that make up for any similarities. These include differences in color, differences in the makeup of the logo design, and differences in the fonts chosen for the logos. Sometimes a similar logo design can be pulled off with finesse, but the situation has to be handled with care.

As a production engineer monitoring oil pressure in a manufacturing facility, I'm interested in understanding how KPIs can help track the optimum pressure value of 80 in a production line. What are the main benefits of using KPIs for this kind of monitoring?	"When the saturation pressure of the reservoir is unknown, as is mostly the case, the monitoring of fluid composition and fluorescence will indicate if the sampling pressure has fallen below the saturation pressure of the fluid. The sample will then be collected or not according to criteria based on the stability of the composition, and the minimization of filtrate contamination.
To identify a retrograde condensate, one can steadily drop the sampling pressure below the saturation pressure of the fluid to observe the change in the fluorescence signal that will occurs with dew formation at the dew point pressure. This is a useful test for reservoir development since it identifies the existence of retrograde condensate, provides a real-time estimate of the fluid dew pressure, and gives information about the effects of two-phase flow on production performance. We can also monitor the estimated dew point against oil based mud (OBM) contamination."	<urn:uuid:24469821-de60-419a-8247-cc920214280d>	0.0
who pays arbitrator fees dispute settlement	"Otherwise, the parties have latitude in choose an arbitrator. Most jurisdictions do not require that arbitrators have any special training.
- Example: Each party may select one arbitrator and those arbitrators select the third arbitrator. The parties will seek to select experts with experience in the particular industry and with knowledge of the customs and practices.
How to Submit a Dispute to Arbitration?
Arbitration begins with the parties submitting their dispute to the arbitrators. Submission is simply the act of contacting the arbitrators and providing them with the dispute information and setting up a time to have an arbitration proceeding. Submitting a dispute to arbitration authorizes arbitrators to make a decision that binds the parties and resolves their dispute. In mandatory arbitrations, many jurisdictions require that the parties submit the matter to arbitration within 6 months of the dispute arising.
Submitting a Dispute to Arbitration Requires an Agreement with the Arbitrator(s)
In voluntary arbitration, the parties must enter into an agreement with the arbitrators to resolve the dispute. The terms of the arbitration agreement and the dispute are passed on to the arbitrator. The parties may propose the rules governing the arbitration. In most cases, however, the arbitrator will agree to arbitrate the matter based upon model arbitration procedural rules. Mandatory arbitration may have formalized documents or procedures for this purpose.
- Note: Many arbitrations employee the rules provided in the Federal Arbitration Act.
What are the Procedures for an Arbitration Proceeding?
The arbitration procedure follows a semi-formal format with the arbitrators controlling the process. Often the arbitrators will orchestrate the arbitration similarly to a trial. The judicial rules of evidence and procedure do not apply, so the arbitrators have a great deal of latitude. They look beyond strictly legal criteria to other factors that bear on the proper resolution of a dispute. They can look at such factors as the state of the law, fairness, productivity, consequences on morale, and whether tensions will be heightened or diminished. Of note, they can generally request any evidence from the parties that is necessary to arrive at a decision.
- Note: The arbitrator will often follow a form of model arbitration rules in holding the proceeding. Mandatory arbitrations will always follow the procedure proscribed by the law or court mandating arbitration.
What is an Arbitration Award?
Arbitrators do not issue a judgment, as in civil trials."	<urn:uuid:fb23e8eb-6b73-4800-b4d7-16b685a90255>	0.0
elderly care options assistance types	"Common Signs of Elder Abuse in Care Homes
If you have trusted a care home to look after an elderly relative, the expectation is that all personal needs will be met. Unfortunately, some care home employees do not treat residents the way they deserve. Elder abuse comes in many forms, so it is important to recognize the common signs.
There are six types of elder abuse that may occur in a care home setting. To protect your loved one, always remain vigilant to the possibility that he or she is a victim of harmful actions.
Physical abuse is the use of force or violence which may result in injury. Bruises, burns, cuts and other visible signs of physical abuse should be investigated.
Elders who are vulnerable may become the target of a sexual abuser. Your relative may not have the ability to tell you about sexual abuse, making this one of the more difficult types of elder abuse to uncover.
An emotionally abused elder may become withdrawn or complain of ill treatment from one or more care home employees. These concerns should be investigated to ensure that the treatment does not constitute abuse.
If you notice that your relative’s money is disappearing without explanation, it may point toward financial exploitation. This type of abuse may also involve the theft of assets such as jewelry and other personal property.
The care home has an obligation to provide food and other provisions to elderly residents. If there is a failure to honor these commitments, you have a right to have the matter investigated.
Abandonment covers situations where a person or persons responsible for the care of an elderly resident have deserted their duties. This scenario is more common than many relatives realize.
If you have concerns about the safety of an elderly relative in a care home, speak to Turner Law for advice today.

looking for info about attorney fees personal injury case and extra insurance protection details	"If the demand letter doesn’t yield the outcome your lawyer wants, they can proceed with filing a personal injury lawsuit.
Filing a Lawsuit
To file a lawsuit on your behalf, your lawyer will draft a petition and file it with the court, along with any filing fees. Your attorney must fulfill the service of process requirement and provide the opposing party with copies of the summons and complaint.
After the insurance company receives these documents, they have a set number of days, typically between 20 and 30, to file its response to your lawsuit with the court. Upon filing the response, your case can officially commence.
Engaging in Discovery
The discovery phase is the most important part of a personal injury lawsuit and also the most time-consuming. During this phase of a lawsuit, both parties have the opportunity to request and obtain evidence and documentation to help build their cases.
Several tools are at an attorney’s disposal to get the information they need, including:
- Requests for production
- Requests for admissions
Among these tools, depositions are widely used and favored by lawyers.
What Is a Deposition?
A deposition lets an attorney get a recorded statement from a party, referred to as the deponent, under oath.
A lawyer may decide to depose a party to get vital information from them to help strengthen their case. Potential deponents can include a party to the case or any witness with knowledge about the case that can provide helpful details.
When an attorney wants to depose a party, they send that party what is called a subpoena. A subpoena informs that person they’re being deposed and gives information regarding time and location.
During a deposition, the party requesting the deposition can ask questions, and the opposing party’s attorney may also have the opportunity to ask questions. A court reporter is present to properly transcribe everything people say during the deposition.
Typically, an attorney can schedule as many depositions as they feel necessary to get everything they need before concluding the discovery phase.
What Happens After Depositions Conclude?
After a deposition, the attorney will usually request the court reporter’s transcript of the proceedings. Having a transcript allows the lawyer to read and reread what was said during the deposition to extract the information they need most. This is usually the case for every deposition.
Once both attorneys have finished taking all of the depositions they want, they can either continue with discovery or conclude discovery altogether."	<urn:uuid:bb956b66-ac6e-416c-81f0-06526a6aa7ea>	0.0
I'm trying to start my first garden and want to be eco-friendly. What are the most important things to know about making a natural garden, and what problems should I watch out for to keep my plants healthy?	"I’m not sure exactly when I first fell in love with fairy gardens, but I’ve always loved miniatures.
I have been collecting little things that catch my eye for years. I love the fact that I can blend two of my favorite hobbies and come up with something so fun even the grandchildren can’t resist playing along.
One of the first things for starting a fairy garden is the foundation–the container. You can use just about anything. Small containers are great to get started because they don’t really need much decoration. If you have a lot of fairy garden accessories already it may be wise to choose a larger container. I have seen everything from an old cooking pot to a bathtub! Use your imagination and look around at what you already have. Do you have an old colander that isn’t being useful in the kitchen? Do you have some elegant flower pots that would add some charm to your garden? Even a simple clay flower pot is a good beginning. Be sure that the character of the pot will match the look and theme of your accessories and plants.
Next you will need some plants that will fit into a miniature scheme. Look for plants with smaller leaves. Small evergreens are often found in garden centers, produce sections of grocery stores, and in flower shops. Herbs make great fairy garden “trees”. Rosemary and Thyme have woody stalks that can be trimmed to look like trees, plus you get to enjoy the herbs in your cooking and the wonderful scents of the plants. Small scale succulents also make nice plants. Keep your eyes open. You will be surprised at how you look at plants differently when you gear your thinking to a miniature scale. I have a tiny bougainvillaea that is only about eight inches tall. It is in a medium sized flower pot and is trimmed to look like a “tree”.
Another important addition to your garden are foundational things like rocks, stepping stones, or marbles. Glass marbles make adorable little “water” features and rivers. Tiny stone walkways help to make your garden into an artistic composition by drawing the viewers eye into the scene. I have used aquarium gravel for this purpose and the scale of the stones look great.
I shoot for more natural colors, but that is just my preference. Bright colors may be more fun and magical if you are creating gardens with children.
Now you can add the details."	<urn:uuid:80c4842e-8000-4b88-b005-a11905be470e>	0.0
How does crop insurance protect farmers financially and what research exists on its market effects?	"GM papaya wins approval in U.S., Japan
HFP Editor's Note: Safety and health approvals have now been granted by the Japan Health Regulatory Organization, eliminating any scientific or health-related objection to the GM Papaya. The next step is the Agricultural marketing process which needs to have procedures in place to bring the fruit into Japan. After that, importation can begin.
By Harry Cline, Farm Press Editorial Staff, Apr 21, 2010 >>> Link to original
Genetically modified papaya will soon be on the supermarket shelves in Japan just like it now is in the U.S.
This first-ever fresh market GMO food product is not from an American corporate giant. It is the result of tenacious research from a host of scientists and the cooperation of Hawaiian farmers. This rare feat in today’s contentious debate over GMO crops was not accomplished to make a statement. It was to save an important crop for farmers in the impoverished state of Hawaii.
Dennis Gonsalves, director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center in Hilo, Hawaii, and professor emeritus of plant pathology at Cornell, detailed to the 63rd annual meeting of the Western Society of Weed Science in Hawaii how Hawaiian agriculture has done what no other ag sector has; win approval to market a genetically modified food crop in the U.S. and Japan.
Gonsalves was the project leader on the successful effort to save Hawaii’s $47 million papaya industry. He is a native Hawaiian raised on a sugar plantation on Hawaii’s Big Island. He received bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the University of Hawaii and a doctorate at the University of California at Davis. He went to Cornell University as an associate professor in 1977. He spent 25 years at Cornell, yet his biggest professional achievement there saved an industry 4,700 miles away in his native island homeland.
Gonsalves left Cornell eight years ago to become director of the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center in Hilo, Hawaii.
Papaya is the second largest fruit crop in Hawaii. It is grown commercially for export to the U.S. mainland and Japan. Hawaii exports 25 percent to 30 percent of its papaya to Japan.
Papaya trees can be severely damaged by the papaya ringspot virus (PRSV), which is rapidly transmitted by aphids."	<urn:uuid:366e8633-be34-45d0-9b89-1635a5489c22>	0.0

Drinking water system and Sadog Tasi WWTP to receive funding
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has awarded $2,930,700 to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). This new infusion of money provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 will help the state and local governments finance many of the overdue improvements to water projects that are essential to protecting public health and the environment across the state.
""This remarkable opportunity to provide much-needed support for sustainable water and energy-efficient drinking water and wastewater systems throughout the U.S. is unprecedented,"" said Laura Yoshii, acting regional administrator for the EPA in the Pacific Southwest. ""This funding will allow CNMI to address its highest water infrastructure priorities, protect human health and surface water quality, address climate change and create critical green jobs as a foundation for a sustainable future.""
CNMI will receive $1,101,700 for its wastewater construction program for the Sadog Tasi Wastewater Treatment Plant to enhance the management of wastewater, significantly reducing energy usage and operation and maintenance costs. CNMI also will receive $1,829,000 to improve its drinking water system.

ways export modified 3d object surface design to new file format	"By default, Inkscape uses its own variation of the SVG format, Inkscape SVG. Inkscape SVG files contains data specific to Inkscape and it’s features. Inkscape does export to standard SVG (Plain SVG) format and compressed variations of SVG.
Art created in Inkscape can be saved in numerous other file formats, including pdf, eps, and ps (PostScript). If you plan to go back and forth between Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator, I recommend using Inkscape’s default SVG format. Even though I get a bunch of errors dialogs while opening Inkscape SVG files in Illustrator 10, I get the least trouble this way. Plus Inkscape’s layers are preserved. I’ll go into this deeper in a future Inkscape tutorial. But that’s what’s currently working for me.
Now if you have plans to export your work into Adobe PhotoShop or GIMP for further work, that’s not so straight forward. Inkscape can export to GIMP’s native file format XCF, but you must have a copy of GIMP installed first. Inkscape needs to access certain libraries that GIMP possesses to translate what you have into a XCF file. To learn how to enable this ability, read How to Enable Saving to XCF in Inkscape. There’s also a version for enabling XCF for Windows 8.1 users.
There is a SVG plugin for PhotoShop, but it takes a while for it to decrypt your SVG file. The other downside is that it won’t recognize your Inkscape layers. Also it’ll create a layer for every single object and path that’s in your SVG file. So if you’re working on a piece that uses a ton of paths, then it’s not even worth it.
If you’re not so worried about your layers, you can easily export to a PNG file. The downside to that is that you’ll be working with a flatten, rasterized version of your image with some transparency. (If you haven’t created any background in your image yet.) When I was working on the header for the State of the Site post, I came to the decision to treat it like line art in Photoshop, and set the blend mode to Multiply.

prototype vs agile testing changes feedback	"After making its global media debut in Shanghai last October, this is the first opportunity for the Chinese public to see the Electric Performance Hybrid.
Its appearance in Beijing is boosted by overwhelmingly positive feedback from test drivers and engineers, who recently spent two weeks north of the Article Circle for a rigorous shakedown with the first running Polestar 1 prototype – in temperatures as low as -28 degrees Celsius (-18 °F).
The intense winter test drive is designed to examine and fine-tune traditional automotive aspects like suspension and driving dynamics, but in the case of the Polestar 1, the drivetrain and batteries were also under scrutiny – in one of the coldest places on the planet.
Test drivers specifically focused on the Polestar 1 torque vectoring system, which is enabled by two rear electric motors with individual planetary gear sets. Chassis balance was further optimized thanks to the advantages of testing on ice, allowing the test drivers to better analyse and react to the car’s behavior while driving.
“Our test drivers have given us some enthusiastic feedback on the handling and dynamics especially,” says Thomas Ingenlath, Chief Executive Officer at Polestar.
“Besides being very happy with the balance of the chassis, they are particularly excited about the torque vectoring. We are now very confident about how this enhances the Polestar 1’s cornering responsiveness and accuracy. This is a driver’s car. We have now passed a major milestone in the development of the Polestar 1, and prototype testing continues throughout 2018.
“Now we look forward to introducing the car to the Chinese public for the first time, a key market for Polestar,” concludes Thomas Ingenlath."	<urn:uuid:f8b2d303-c418-4380-97bf-fe34b8093f91>	0.0
What are the main purposes of conducting regular cybersecurity audits, and what are the typical financial costs companies face when these audits fail to prevent ransomware attacks?

Emotet was originally a malware that targeted banks – it would sneak onto your computer and steal sensitive and private information. First, on the scene in 2014, Emotet has gone through a variety of versions, evolving into a ransomware that can evade detection even by some anti-malware products. Since its inception, Emotet has stolen banking logins, financial data, and Bitcoin wallets from individuals, companies and government entities across Europe and the USA.
Using worm-like capabilities to spread to other computers, hackers usually introduce Emotet by spam emails – made to look legitimate and with the use of tempting language to trick the victim into clicking on the link.
Emotet is one of the most costly and destructive malware – according to the Department of Homeland Security, the cost of the average Emotet attack is upwards of $1 million to clean up.
Ryuk specifically targets large organizations for a high-financial return. According to CrowdStrike, between August 2018 and January 2019, Ryuk netted over 705.80 bitcoins across 52 transactions totalling a value of $3,701,893.98. It first turned heads with its attack on Tribune Publishing’s operations over the Christmas period of 2018. At first, the company thought the attack was just a server outage, but it was soon clear it was the Ryuk ransomware.
Another term for ransomware such as Ryuk that targets large enterprises for high ROI is ‘big game hunting.’ These large-scale attacks involve detailed customization of campaigns to best suit the individual targets, increasing the effectiveness of the attacks. ‘Big game hunting’ therefore requires much more work from the hacker; it is also a normally launched in phases. For example, phase one might be a phishing attack with an aim to infect an enterprises network with malware to map the system and identify crucial assets to target. Phases two and three will then be a series of extortion and ransom attacks/demands.
How to prevent ransomware
There are many things to consider when fighting ransomware. With so many different types of malware around these days, you should keep in mind the following three main tips and execute accordingly."	<urn:uuid:7e8f9803-b8c4-4731-a437-8fc8c2a0c537>	0.0
nft digital art market impact benefits artists blockchain transparency what risks theft piracy	"Now, instead of having to rely on an NFT sell-off to access funds, you can take out a loan and use your NFT as collateral with companies like Drops. You could also earn interest with your NFT portfolio by lending to others.
NFT Environmental Impact
As with other cryptocurrencies, each NFT minted does have some impact on the environment. For instance, Bitcoin mining uses enough energy to power 10 million homes a year.
26. How do NFTs Impact the Environment?
Most NFTs work on the Ethereum blockchain, which requires a proof of work system to confirm each new block. The process of confirming each block is called mining and consists of computers on the network racing to solve a complex problem.
The first computer to solve it verifies the block and collects the gas fees. Thus, miners invest in more computer power, and if that power comes from sources that emit greenhouse gases, the environment is negatively impacted.
27. Ethereum’s Carbon Footprint is Similar to That of Sudan
Although not as carbon-intensive as Bitcoin, Ethereum is currently estimated to consume 44.94 terawatt-hours of electrical energy and release 21.35 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year28.
28. The Average NFT Has a Carbon Footprint Similar to an Average Person in the European Union
Digital artist Memo Akten analyzed 18,000 NFTs and found the average carbon footprint similar to that of the average person living in the European Union28.
This large footprint is partly due to the many transactions involved with NFT minting, bidding, sales, and transfer of ownership. Overall, NFT emissions are estimated to be ten times higher than the average Ethereum transaction.
29. Ethereum is Planning a Shift to Lessen Environmental Impact
Luckily, blockchain networks realize their platforms’ impact on the environment and are attempting to mitigate it. The developers of Ethereum are planning to move to a less carbon-intensive proof of stake system called Ethereum 2.0 in 2022.
30. The Shift to Ethereum 2.0 Could Reduce NFT Energy Usage by 99%
Proof of stake systems results in fewer emissions because they don’t require mining. Thus, while some platforms have already moved to proof of stake systems for trading NFTs, the majority remain on the Ethereum blockchain.
Hence, the shift to Ethereum 2.0 should significantly reduce energy consumption28."	<urn:uuid:f9a04047-a05d-42d1-b5c6-4260f97ad407>	0.0

The 2,016 x 1,512-pixel maximum resolution is high enough for making sharp 8x10-inch photographic prints, while lower resolution settings are perfect for conserving memory card space if you don't need large prints, or sending email attachments over the Internet. The uncomplicated user interface means you won't spend much time learning the camera. Plus, the included camera dock makes downloading images and recharging batteries a snap. With its point-and-shoot simplicity, the SQ is an excellent option for novices. However, its fashionable design may tempt more experienced pros looking for a fun snapshot camera. The high-end all-metal body with swivel lens and included ""Cool Dock"" make it relatively expensive for a 3 megapixel model, but if your budget will accommodate it, it's a very appealing little camera.
Breaking away from most standard digicam designs, the Coolpix SQ's square body resembles an MP3 player more than a camera. Despite the square, compact size, Nikon managed to retain the popular swiveling lens design, making the camera more flexible for shooting at odd angles. The lens rotates approximate 225 degrees, facing down in the front and rotating all the way to face behind the camera (a unique self-portrait tool cleverly remaps the image in the LCD so it isn't blocked by the lens housing as it swings in front of half the screen)."	<urn:uuid:8d15e8c2-c4fb-40a3-b21a-2ee2938ffbf2>	0.0

middle east religious institutions compare modern christian advocacy muslim healthcare legacy	"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - View original article
|Part of a series on|
Christendom has several meanings. In a cultural sense, it refers to the religion itself, or to the worldwide community of Christians, adherents of Christianity. In its historical sense, the term usually refers to the medieval and early modern period, during which the Christian world represented a geopolitical power juxtaposed with both paganism and especially the military threat of the Muslim world. In the more limited and traditional sense of the word, it refers to the sum total of nations in which the Catholic Church is the established religion of the state, or which have ecclesiastical concordats with the Holy See.
|This section needs additional citations for verification. (February 2013)|
The term cristendom existed in Old English, but it had the sense now taken by Christianity (as is still the case with the cognate Dutch christendom , where it denotes mostly the religion itself, just like the German Christentum). The current sense of the word of ""lands where Christianity is the dominant religion"" emerges in Late Middle English (by c. 1400). This semantic development happened independently in the languages of late medieval Europe, which leads to the confusing semantics of English Christendom equalling German Christenheit, French chrétienté vs. English Christianity equalling German Christentum, French christianisme. The reason is the increasing fragmentation of Western Christianity at that time both in theological and in political respect. ""Christendom"" as a geopolitical term is thus meaningful in the context of the Middle Ages, and arguably during the European wars of religion and the Ottoman wars in Europe.
The Christian world is also known collectively as the Corpus Christianum, a translated as the Christian body, meaning the community of all Christians. The Christian polity, embodying a less secular meaning, can be compatible with the idea of both a religious and a temporal body: Corpus Christianum. The Corpus Christianum can be seen as a Christian equivalent of the Muslim Ummah.
The word ""Christendom"" is also used with its other meaning to frame-true Christianity.[clarification needed] A more secular meaning can denote that the term Christendom refers to Christians considered as a group, the ""Political Christian World"", as an informal[clarification needed] cultural hegemony that Christianity has traditionally enjoyed in the West."	<urn:uuid:e800113a-7941-48a9-811d-2999ffc9b777>	0.0
How do processed foods impact sodium consumption and hearing health?	Unprocessed carbs, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds are all beneficial for health, especially for digestion, as they are rich in fiber. Whole, non-processed carbs like these can also help improve metabolic health and lower your risk of chronic diseases. On the other hand, refined carbohydrate is highly linked to increased weight gain and diabetes, as they are high in sugar and lack in nutrients. Examples of this are sugary drinks, cakes, cookies, pastries, fries, and white breads. A lot of studies have shown that frequent consumption of processed foods or refined carbohydrates may also mess with blood sugar levels, as the spikes and dips may cause you to crave more high-carb foods.	<urn:uuid:b5be4198-82f3-4a34-a8cb-beb735503f96>	0.0
groundwater surface runoff pond differences management	"As many as 96 districts in 12 States have been affected by high arsenic contamination in ground water. Around 70.4 million people in 35 districts alone have been exposed to groundwater arsenic.
n India, around 80 per cent of the rural population and 50 per cent of the urban population use groundwater for domestic purposes.
Water quality issues like arsenic, salinity, nitrate, iron, flouride and heavy metals in water due to geogenic and anthropogenic reasons have been reported from various parts of the country.
What is Arsenic?
Arsenic (As) is an odourless and tasteless metalloid widely distributed in the earth’s crust. Elemental arsenic is a member of Group VA of the periodic table, with nitrogen, phosphorus, antimony and bismuth. It has an atomic number of 33 and an atomic mass of 74.91. Arsenic is highly toxic in its inorganic form
How does arsenic get into drinking water?
Because it occurs naturally in the environment and as a by-product of some agricultural and industrial activities, it can enter drinking water through the ground or as runoff into surface water sources.
What happens to the arsenic that gets inside the human body?
Arsenic in drinking water is absorbed through the intestine into the bloodstream through which it reaches the various organs.
The human body normally gets rid of smaller amounts of arsenic through urine.
However, if there are large amounts of arsenic, the remaining arsenic accumulates inside the body and can lead to adverse health effects.
However, the mechanisms underlying the adverse health effects by arsenic are not completely known. The level of accumulated arsenic can be known by investigating nail and hair samples.
High arsenic levels in rural India: Numbers and facts
1. High arsenic content in groundwater affects the human, animal, soil and plant systems.
2. As many as 96 districts in 12 states have been affected by high arsenic contamination in groundwater. Around 70.4 million people in 35 districts alone have been exposed to groundwater arsenic.
3. Over one lakh deaths and 2 to 3 lakhs of confirmed cases of illness have reportedly been caused by groundwater arsenic.
4. According to a report revealed by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, 1.47 crore people in India face serious health hazards due to presence of arsenic in groundwater.

diabetic looking for healthy food suggestions what meals good for blood sugar control	"One in ten people in the US currently has diabetes and the incidence is growing such that the CDC projects that as many as one in three people in the US may have diabetes in 2050! As such, the prevalence of Diabetic eye disease is likely to increase. Diabetes can impact the eye by increasing the risk of cataract, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. However, good blood sugar control and annual dilated eye exams by an eye physician can detect and treat these findings early to prevent loss of vision.
What is Diabetic Retinopathy?
Diabetic retinopathy results from sustained uncontrolled blood sugars over several years which damage blood vessels nourishing the retina. The retina is the light sensitive film lining the back of the eye that translates light into images. Diabetic vascular damage in the retina may result in swelling, bleeding, and scar tissue formation within the retina.
Development of Diabetic Retinopathy
Persistent suboptimal blood sugar control can weaken the blood vessels nourishing the retina resulting in bleeding and leakage of fluid into the retina. If the leakage impacts the central part of the retina known as the macula, diabetic macula swelling (edema) ensues and central vision may become blurred and distorted. As the retinopathy progresses, the damage to the retinal blood vessels may ultimately result in closure and poor perfusion to the peripheral retina. This may result in the development of abnormal new frail blood vessels that may tear and bleed into the eye clouding the vision and leading to scar tissue formation. This scar tissue can pull on the retina and lead to retinal detachment with loss of vision.
Who’s at risk of Diabetic Retinopathy?
All patients with diabetes (type 1, type 2, and gestational) are at risk of diabetic retinopathy. Risk of retinopathy onset and progression increases with poorly controlled blood sugars, duration of diabetes (most patients will develop some form of retinopathy by 15 years), associated uncontrolled high blood pressure & cholesterol, active smokers, and diabetic patients going through puberty/pregnancy.
How to prevent Diabetic Retinopathy?
While diabetic retinopathy isn’t always preventable, following up for regularly scheduled exams is one of the most important ways to prevent vision loss. Most diabetic patients should expect to develop some form of diabetic retinopathy in their lifetime if they live long enough."	<urn:uuid:71fd4220-1cb1-41da-8967-20633749920f>	0.0
How can websites boost search rankings and help disabled users?	"Google has released yet another update to its algorithm used to rank websites. Known as Panda 4.1, it follows in the same footsteps as previous Panda updates – with a focus on identifying and penalizing websites with thin, irrelevant, low-quality, and/or mostly duplicate content. If a website is deemed to offer little-to-no value to the end user, Google may penalize it by reducing its rankings or even removing it from its search index. To learn more about Panda 4.1 and how to protect your website from becoming its next victim, keep reading.
Pierre Far broke the news of Panda 4.1 on his Google+ Page, saying “Based on user (and webmaster!) feedback, we’ve been able to discover a few more signals to help Panda identify low-quality content more precisely. This results in a greater diversity of high-quality small- and medium-sized sites ranking higher, which is nice.”
The good news is that Panda 4.1 is a relatively small update when compared to previous algorithm updates. According to Far, it’s expected to affect just 3-5% of all Google search queries. With that said, webmasters should still keep a close eye on their rankings to determine whether or not they are being hit by Panda 4.1. If you notice a decrease in one or more of your sites’ rankings, you should perform a thorough audit of its on-site and off-site optimization elements.
A Look Back at Panda 1.0
Google publicly announced the original Panda 1.0 update in a 2011 post on its Webmaster Central blog, noting that it was just one of hundreds of different search improvements expected to roll out that year.
“Some publishers have fixated on our prior Panda algorithm change, but Panda was just one of roughly 500 search improvements we expect to roll out to search this year. In fact, since we launched Panda, we’ve rolled out over a dozen additional tweaks to our ranking algorithms, and some sites have incorrectly assumed that changes in their rankings were related to Panda. Search is a complicated and evolving art and science, so rather than focusing on specific algorithmic tweaks, we encourage you to focus on delivering the best possible experience for users.”
Panda was launched for the sole purpose of improving Google’s search results."	<urn:uuid:63b9b03f-5f9c-4b95-a8e2-501c659adb4f>	0.0
I'm comparing water conservation methods: bucket car washing versus greywater system costs?	"The increasing pressure on water resources in the UK is having a detrimental impact on the water environment. It is important that we encourage more sustainable water use to maintain and improve the water environment and at the same time reduce operating costs.
Reduction in operating costs can be achieved on holiday parks using a number of water conservation tools.
Water efficiency equipment – data logging, pressure management
Undertaking leakage detection and repair
It is in this article that we will be concentrating on water efficiency equipment, specifically data logging. We will be talking about other efficiency measures in future articles, so keep an eye out for those.
Data-logging has become one of the vital tools for effective water conservation and we will be discussing this further below.
Data logging is an important part of the water management strategy to ensure long-term economic benefits by improved management of water use. You need to measure water to be able to manage it and an accurate data collection is key to managing water effectively. It also encourages more efficient and effective water use, whether you are a site manager monitoring the effects of water abstraction from a borehole or a holiday park owner trying to keep track of leakage occurring on their water distribution system.
The management of the water system across holiday parks is important to ensure protection of the environment and long term sustainability of the business. Holiday parks need to be proactive in managing their water usage through annual consumption targets and the introduction of a plethora of water saving measures including pressure reducing valves, rainwater harvesting systems and data loggers.
Today, one of the more popular methods of recording water readings is with a data logger. Data loggers are stand-alone box instruments that measure signals, convert them to digital data and, in this case, send the data in a SMS text message to a web server.
With the evolution of technology, new PC based software has been developed allowing the user to monitor their water consumption on a more detailed and accurate basis without the need to visit site.
Do I really need a data logger?
We know a large majority of the holiday park owners already have water management solutions and understand the need to monitor their water supplies more closely. This could be the maintenance staff taking weekly readings to identify any increases over the norm or the security staff taking meter readings during the early hours of the morning to try and catch any potential leakage at initial stages.
Alan Castledine, Commercial Director of Park Resorts commented that, “Water is liquid gold” where overheads are concerned and it is crucial to manage water consumption to contain costs and help the environment."	<urn:uuid:96b62660-b900-4547-a9ba-9bfd1864429e>	0.0

birth problems early pregnancy brain spinal cord chiari malformation spina bifida risk factors differ	"Cerebrovascular neurosurgery: priority of development
Over the past year the MC Erebouni performs an intensive work on the development of a specialized center for the treatment of strokes. This work is conducted with the direct participation and support of specialists in this area, mainly from Canada and the United States. Currently, both worldwide and in the MC Erebouni is running a program of intensive development of endovascular neurosurgery and increase of its role in the prevention and treatment of strokes.
More than a year the endovascular neurosurgery intervention is successfully performed at the MC Erebouni. It should be noted that this area of medicine is a relatively young and started to develop during last 10-15 years. In early June 2015 the Service of Cerebrovascular Neurosurgery was established at the MC Erebouni. The head of the Service was appointed neurosurgeon David Sahakyan.
In early July 2015 Head of the Service of cerebrovascular neurosurgery D. Sahakian and a leading specialist of Atlanta Medical Center and Grady Memorial Hospital (Atlanta, USA), Dr. Mikael Grigorian had jointly perform 6 cases of intervention two of which were unique and had been performed the first time in Armenia at MC Erebouni. The one intervention was case of spinal angiography that is an invasive high-precision diagnostic procedure and another is carotid artery stenting which is the endovascular surgery case.
One of the intervention was carried out in the patient G.A. 1958 y/b, with a suspected spinal arteriovenous malformation or fistula of lumbar spinal cord. In this study, MRI of the spine had show abnormal blood vessels and in conjunction with clinical data was suspected vascular malformation. Diagnostic spinal angiography allowed to examine in detail the vessels feeding the spinal cord with the accuracy and eliminate the presence of any of vascular lesions. This couldn't be achieved by other diagnostic methods.
The second case is stenting of carotid artery in patient G. 1957 y/b. He admitted to the hospital with acute ischemic stroke in the right hemisphere of the brain. According to MR and CT angiography patient has a critical stenosis (99%) at the bifurcation of the internal carotid artery."	<urn:uuid:00e1166b-dc2c-497e-88cc-90830530f60e>	0.0

sensory processing disorder misophonia differences triggers	"The finding that FM patients (10 compared with 26 healthy controls) had a normal ‘blink response’ (analogous to the acoustic startle response) suggests that their nervous systems were not ‘jumpy’ and surprisingly they had a slightly higher sensory threshold than controls.
In contrast FM patients reported a greater perception of ‘discomfort’ in response to the stimulus suggesting an “apparent dissociation between peripheral nociceptive (unpleasant stimulus) input and subjective pain sensation”. A recent study, in fact, suggests that brain regions associated with increasing discomfort in association with pain, i.e., in making pain really ‘painful,’ are over-activated in fibromyalgia.
On repeated measures the FM patients blink reflex returned to a ‘hyperexcitable’ state rather than becoming habituated to the stimulus (a finding curiously also seen in the movement disorder Parkinson’s disease). Similarly, when the blink response was ‘conditioned’ by a weak pre-pulse, pre-pulse inhibition (sensorymotor gating) was significantly reduced in the FMS patients, and unlike controls the perception of ‘discomfort’ did not reduce significantly over time.
These findings suggest that instead of calming down in response to repeated sensory signals as it should, the brainstem remained in an excited state. Taken together, these findings support the concept of altered sensory gating (i.e., pain processing) in FM in common with other chronic pain states.
They’re intriguing findings, particularly given recent research suggesting that when Lyrica works it does so in part by reducing brainstem activity
Digging Deeper: The Pedunculopontine Nucleus
Now there’s a mouthful! PPI appears to be mediated by a brainstem area called the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) which connects to various other brain regions including the thalamus and somatosensory cortices, both of which have recently been associated with pain processing in FM.
In addition to the vital function of ‘gating’ sensory information, the PPN is implicated in a host of other functions that can have a serious impact on quality of life relevant to FM symptomology. These include ‘arousal’, attention, learning and maintenance of REM sleep:
“The PPN is involved in many functions, including arousal, attention, learning, reward, and voluntary limb movements and locomotion. While once thought important to the initiation of movement, recent research suggests a role in providing sensory feedback to the cerebral cortex."	<urn:uuid:6ccaaa62-72e1-4223-8152-8cca4ef431f5>	0.0
tooth decay causes prevention benefits establishing dental home	"Tooth extraction is a procedure done to remove a damaged or potentially problematic tooth. Like every dental procedure, the wound created by the extraction process heals over time with proper care. The dentist will provide the necessary aftercare instructions to follow.Aside from using the recommended medications and resting adequately, there are certain things to avoid…
When Is a Tooth Extraction Necesssary?
While dentists will often do everything possible to save a tooth no matter the age of the patient, there are some situations where tooth extraction is necessary. When it comes to removing teeth, there are two different types of extractions a dentist or oral surgeon can use depending on the reason for removal: Simple extraction and surgical extraction.
A simple extraction can be used when the tooth is already fully emerged past the gum line and can be easily removed using forceps. A surgical extraction involves cutting into the gums to retrieve a tooth, usually because it is impacted. Here are some common reasons a patient might need to have either a simple or surgical extraction performed.
Reasons for a simple tooth extraction
A dentist might suggest pulling a patient’s tooth because of infection or overcrowding in the mouth. Continue reading to learn more about each of these reasons for a tooth extraction.
Tooth decay or gum disease
Fillings or root canal treatment can often treat minor cases of tooth decay, but severe deterioration can warrant the need for extraction. This situation often occurs if the patient has not had a dental exam in a while and the decay has gone untreated for a long period of time. Eventually, the decay can extend to the pulp of the tooth leading to an infection.
If the infection is too severe to be treated by root canal therapy, the extraction of the tooth is necessary to keep the infection from spreading. Gum disease is another type of infection that causes the degeneration of the bones and tissues surrounding a tooth. If not addressed early on, these structures can deteriorate to the point that the tooth either falls out or needs to be pulled.
If teeth are severely misaligned or overcrowded, it might be necessary to pull teeth to open up space in the mouth or to make an opening for an impacted tooth. Most often, the removal of the tooth or teeth is combined with orthodontic treatment. Braces are used after the tooth is removed to further expand the jawbone and balance the bite."	<urn:uuid:9b2d4a48-ad37-41d7-8d95-c816a2efb729>	0.0
How did the Emancipation Proclamation impact slavery and Southern economy?	"Say, shall for us so many victims die?
Say not that smalls the sphere in which we move,
And our attempts would vain and fruitless prove;
Not so -- we hold a most important share,
In all the evils -- all the wrong they bear;
And tho their woes entire we cant remove,
We may thincreasing misries which they prove,
push far away the plant for which they die,
And in this one small thing our taste deny. (""A Poem on the African Slave Trade"" (2:196-217, 212-213)
The ""Abolition"" (volume 2) has a powerful early essay by Coleridge on the slave trade which, like Mary Birketts poem, appeals for a consumer boycott as part of a wider anti-slavery campaign and as a way of rooting the cause in everyday life. Though endorsed by hundreds of thousands the boycott did not materially diminish the sugar trade, but it did stimulate domestic debate and allow women and young people to take a lead. It is a pity that volume 3 of Slavery, Abolition and Emancipation does not give any space to the partisans of immediate emancipation. A suitable text would have been Elizabeth Heyricks Immediate, not gradual abolition, in which she observed: ""men may propose only gradually to abolish the worst of crimes, and only mitigate the most evil bondage I trust no Ladies Association will be found with such words attached to it."" Her argument was heeded, and by 1830 the national Society changed both its name and its objectives.
The contribution of the cruelty of slavery to British wealth remains deeply controversial, though it is now more widely recognized that Britains historic prosperity owed much to slavery and the slave trade. We should, of course, beware the dubious notion of inherited guilt -- itself redolent of racist legends. But privilege can be, and has been, inherited and lessons can be learnt.
The culture of anti-slavery was instructive because it heralded the awakening of a popular understanding of the long-distance havoc that could be wreaked by the market, making it entirely appropriate that its themes should be echoed by Jubilee 2000 or the critics of the Bank of Englands decision to dump gold regardless of its impact on South Africa and Russia. Anti-slavery was about making connections and piercing the veil which hides from consumers the human costs of production."	<urn:uuid:3cd33159-4e60-41c8-aba9-03289b252753>	0.0

What problems does high carbon footprint cause?	"“Aside from being better for the environment, fridges work more effectively that way as well.”
3. Make sustainability part of your business culture
Being conscious of a company’s energy consumption levels can’t just be the passion of the business owner.
Rauland explained that if a small business owner truly wants to make a difference, they need understand that reducing their business’s carbon footprint has to be a group effort whereby everyone within the organisation has a role to play.
“Spread the roles across the entire company and encourage everybody takes part in reducing the organisation’s impact on the environment.
“Talk about it in meetings, send out emails about it, write climate change policies collaboratively and make everyone in the organisation part of the climate change conversation.
“The key is to bring everyone on board.”
4. Use your energy savings wisely
Aside from the direct benefits that being environment-conscious at work can bring to the global climate change issue, when businesses put effort into finding more efficient ways to consume energy, they can end up saving the business (a lot of) money.
As part of her advice to small businesses, Rauland recommended that business owners consider to donating part or all of their savings to a cause that their employees collectively decide on.
“It puts a deeper level of meaning and impact into the businesses climate change narrative.”
According to Rauland, allocating part of those savings to incentives that encourage staff to be conscious of climate change outside of the office as well is also a great way to add another dimension to a business’ efforts to reduce its impact.
“Taking the money saved from your overuse of electricity and giving it back to the employees in ways like paying for their train or bus tickets to work, can be a great way to offer a financial incentive to employees, while encouraging them to think more about their own personal carbon footprint outside of the office as well.”
Rauland’s advice indicates that just about any business can find ways to reduce their carbon footprint while also increasing efficiencies and save money.

mosquito virus symptoms effects	"If you are taking this medicine to treat malaria, the usual dose is 5 tablets at one time as a single dose.
Take this medication for the entire length of time prescribed by your doctor. Your symptoms may get better before the infection is completely treated.
In addition to taking mefloquine, use protective clothing, insect repellents, and mosquito netting around your bed to further prevent mosquito bites that could cause malaria.
Contact your doctor as soon as possible if you have been exposed to malaria, or if you have a fever or other symptoms of illness during or after a stay in an area where malaria is common.
No medication is 100% effective in treating or preventing malaria. For best results, keep using the medication as directed. Talk with your doctor if you have fever, vomiting, or diarrhea during your treatment.

pros of nuclear energy clean electricity generation and problems nuclear waste disposal	"Since 2000, as nuclear power’s cost projections have more than tripled, its share of global electricity generation has fallen from 17 percent to 13 percent. That of cogeneration (making electricity together with useful heat in factories or buildings) and renewables (excluding big hydropower projects) rose from 13 percent to 18 percent.
These bite-sized, modular, quickly built projects—with financial risks, costs, and subsidies generally below nuclear’s and declining—now dominate global power investments. Last year, renewables (wind, water, solar, geothermal), excluding large hydroelectric dams, attracted $131 billion of private capital and added 52 billion watts. Global nuclear output fell for the past three years, capacity for two.
This market shift helps protect the climate. Renewables, cogeneration, and efficiency can displace 2 to 20 times more carbon per dollar, 20 to 40 times faster, than new nuclear power—saving trillions of dollars over decades and avoiding vast financial risks.
Still uncompetitive despite 60 years of handouts, nuclear developers clamor for ever greater subsidies. The White House, Senate, and House all propose expanded federal loan guarantees ($36 billion was the White House figure); developers demand at least $100 billion. The Clean Energy Deployment Administration endorsed by both houses of Congress could issue unlimited loan guarantees without congressional oversight. It would probably fund nuclear and renewable energy like the recipe for elephant-and-rabbit stew—one elephant, one rabbit.
Bureaucrats, not credit markets, would evaluate risks and pick winners. Taxpayers would become America’s main energy financiers and almost exclusive nuclear risk-takers. America’s once market-based electricity investments would work like China’s, Russia’s, and France’s nuclear command economies. This is bipartisan folly.
As nuclear subsidies spiral toward fiscal ruin, brave voices protest from a handful of think tanks: the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the George C. Marshall Institute, the American Enterprise Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the National Taxpayers Union, Taxpayers for Common Sense. Yet most congressional budget hawks—supposedly sages of circum-spection and defenders of free markets—urge more nuclear socialism.

Between prescription medications and natural remedies like omega 3's and healthy foods, which tends to work better for treating pain and inflammation in the long term?	"Sport Video games
Surprisingly playing interactive video games has been observed to improve motivation and social functioning. Engaging in video games will make sure that there is no reduction in the blood flow to cortex part of the brain.
Reduction in blood flow to the brain is called hypofrontality which observed in schizophrenia patients. Playing video games will significantly subside its effect.
It sounds too good to be real to be listed under natural remedies for schizophrenia.
Including foods which are high in antioxidants will reduce the severity of schizophrenia. Vitamin C is considered to anti-stressing agents. Vitamin A and E are also observed to a great effect in reducing mental illness and works as antipsychotic medication.
Antioxidants will reduce the free radical activity which ultimately reduces oxidation stress.
Green tea is a great source of anti-oxidants. It also provides additional benefits like improving the metabolism and makes sure that brain gets enough energy in time. IT will also help blood circulation throughout the body.
Omega 3 Fatty Acids
Having foods which are rich in omega 3 fatty acids like salmon fish are the best natural remedies for schizophrenia. Because research proves that omega 3 with high EPA (Eicosapentaenoic acid) will reduce schizophrenia symptoms effectively.
You can also use daily supplements of omega 3 but the proper checking should be done before consuming. Some fish oils are not properly filtered or laboratory tested. So have a look at the label and make sure that they are high in EPA.
Research also confirms that the need for antipsychotic drugs may be reduced with EPA intake from fish. In fact, a study performed over 300 people in the United States for 3 months have provided results with great improvements in reducing the severity of schizophrenia.
In 2010, a study was published in General Psychiatry providing the positive effect of omega 3 in reducing the development of psychotic illness.
Include salmon, pumpkin seeds, flax seeds in the diet. Make sure to consult a doctor for proper dosage of omega 3 supplements. Usually, 1 to 2 pills are the normal recommendations for the average adult.
Cast away your shyness for a healthy brain and peaceful mind. Personal therapy is proven have a great impact on improving person’s social functioning. The important aspect is to treat schizophrenia as a biological illness but not as some damage to brain and personality.
In some cases, personal therapy was found most effective than family therapy in reducing psychotic illness."	<urn:uuid:a0f21a80-88b9-4f26-b15a-9dfc5f954bcb>	0.0
heart attack treatment ems hospital options	"What is the average life expectancy after a heart attack?
Indeed, data from the United States National Vital Statistics Reports shows the median life expectancy of non-MI individuals aged 65-69 is 18.7 years, while it’s just 8.3 years for those who have suffered a heart attack.
Does having a heart attack shorten your life?
Once you have a cardiac event like a heart attack or a stroke, your life expectancy decreases. Each time it takes a little more out of you and makes it harder to come back to normal. That being said, if you make all the necessary changes and wholeheartedly adopt a healthy lifestyle, you can live a full and long life.
Can you live a good life after a heart attack?
Many people go on to live full, healthy lives after having a heart attack. Knowing common heart attack symptoms, as well as taking steps to prevent another heart attack, are great ways to increase your life expectancy after such an event.
Can a person survive 3 heart attacks?
The average person who survives a first heart attack may survive a second, sometimes a third, but very few survive more, said Dr. Edward I. Morris, a cardiologist at Washington Hospital Center, across town from Cheney’s hospital.
Are you more likely to have a second heart attack?
About 1 in 5 people who have had a heart attack will be readmitted to the hospital for a second one within five years, according to the American Heart Association.
How do you strengthen your heart after a heart attack?
Regular cardio exercise can make your heart stronger. Examples include walking, jogging, running, bicycling, and swimming. Exercise helps your heart pump blood and deliver oxygen to your body. It can lower your cholesterol level and blood pressure.
What triggers heartattack?
A heart attack occurs when one or more of your coronary arteries becomes blocked. Over time, a buildup of fatty deposits, including cholesterol, form substances called plaques, which can narrow the arteries (atherosclerosis). This condition, called coronary artery disease, causes most heart attacks.
How does your life change after a heart attack?
Here are nine steps you can take to beat the odds.
- Don’t smoke. …
- Control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. …
- Check for and manage diabetes. …
- Get regular physical exercise. …
- Maintain a healthy weight. …

MRI of the knee
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive medical test that helps physicians diagnose and treat medical conditions.
MRI uses a powerful magnetic field, radio frequency pulses and a computer to produce detailed pictures of organs, soft tissues, bone and virtually all other internal body structures. The images can then be examined on a computer monitor, transmitted electronically, printed or copied to a CD. MRI does not use ionizing radiation (x-rays).
Detailed MR images allow physicians to better evaluate various parts of the body and determine the presence of certain diseases that may not be assessed adequately with other imaging methods such as x-ray, ultrasound or computed tomography(also called CT, MDCT or CAT scanning).
What are some common uses of the procedure?
MR imaging of the body is performed to evaluate:
- organs of the chest and abdomen—including the heart, liver,biliary tract, kidneys, spleen, bowel, pancreas and adrenal glands.
- pelvic organs including the reproductive organs in the male (prostate and testicles) and the female (uterus, cervix and ovaries).
- blood vessels (MR Angiography).
Physicians use the MR examination to help diagnose or monitor treatment for conditions such as:
- tumors of the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
- certain types of heart problems.
- blockages, enlargements or anatomical variants of blood vessels, including the aorta, renal arteries, and arteries in the legs.
- diseases of the liver, such as cirrhosis and tumors, and that of other abdominal organs, including the bile ducts, gallbladder, and pancreatic ducts.
- diseases of the small intestine, colon, rectum and anus.
- cysts and solid tumors in the kidneys and other parts of the urinary tract.
- tumors and other abnormalities of the reproductive organs (e.g., uterus, ovaries, testicles, prostate)."	<urn:uuid:30cf00c4-f3d9-47d6-b25b-deca7d8a5eb1>	0.0

stop motion animation how is it made	"Let's look at a simple scene which demonstrates the effects of motion blur settings.
The following images show the positions of two balls at frames 1, 2, and 3. In this example key-frames are made with linear tangents, so that as we observe shutter timing, the balls will maintain a fixed speed.
Motion blur can be enabled in the Render Settings window under the Features tab. By default it is not enabled.
By default the Motion Blur Type is set to Frame, which is often sufficient for basic motion blur. The alternative, Subframe, is more accurate, but involves more sampling of geometry and transforms at different times. Shutter Timing settings other than Frame Open require Subframe blur. So let's go ahead and change the Motion Blur Type to Subframe. And then observe the effects of different Shutter Timing settings.
The following images show Frame Open blur for frames 1, 2, and 3. The shutter opens at the start of the frame. The default shutter angle of 180 means the shutter is open for half of a frame. Notice how the last frame has no blur. This is because there is no animation after the time that the shutter opens for that frame.
The following images show Frame Center blur, which means the shutter opens before the frame, and closes after, centered on the frame. The blur for the first and last frames looks shortened, because the animation does not extend beyond those frames.
The following images show Frame Close blur, which means the shutter closes on the frame. Again, the first frame has no blur because there is no animation before that frame.
Our red ball looks kind of odd in the second frame with centered blur. The blur is horizontal, when the ball really should reach an apex in the middle of that streak. By default, there are only two motion samples, because they are expensive, and two is often sufficient. You can change the global number of motion samples in Motion Blur section of the Render Settings. Or if you know that only a particular piece of geometry requires extra samples, you can add them to just that geometry. Select the geometry, and in the Attribute Editor, under the transform tab for the selection, do Attributes->RenderMan->Add Motion Samples.
At the bottom of the Attribute Editor, with tab for the sphere's transform selected, you'll see a setting for motion samples."	<urn:uuid:cecbd2bb-22b7-47b9-8881-4e74f9a2e779>	0.0

communication methods security impact business productivity	"Technology is an element that affects our lives in a variety of ways. Whether you are using technology for work or your personal life, it can be an important tool that helps you to streamline and improve your productivity.
Business Technology: The use of technology is an integral part of running any type of business. The main aim of this type of technology is to improve various business operations by automating them and making them easy to manage.
Construction: Technology is used in the planning and building process of both buildings and heavy engineering structures. Generally, technology is used to make the best possible design of these structures by using computer programs and software.
Despite the many advantages that technology provides, educators encounter challenges when using it in their classrooms. Perhaps a specific platform is too hard to introduce, or maybe it won’t run on their devices.
Teaching Students With Technology:
There are a number of different teaching methods and resources that use technology to engage students and help them learn. They may help them master new skills, enliven difficult topics or subjects, and even make learning fun!
Research backs these benefits up. In one school district, a math game that adjusts content to accommodate student trouble spots and learning speeds mastered 68% more math skills on average.
Although technology has the potential to improve your life, it can also have a negative impact on our planet, our economy and our society. There are many philosophical debates about its role and impact, and there are some ideologies that see the continued development of technology as beneficial to society."	<urn:uuid:42b5d293-2d0a-4164-bdb0-c1ee268a620e>	0.0
I'm planning a garden that needs minimal watering since we often have droughts in my area. What are some ideas for plants and techniques that can help save water while still having a beautiful garden?	"It can be disheartening to have your hard work in the garden go caput due to unforeseen challenges. That’s why it is the goal of Gardening Know How to help avoid these issues, or at the very least amend them, by providing the best information possible so your garden will flourish – and that includes answering the gardening questions that plaque us all. In the garden, pepper growing is a common practice, and not without its own set of problems. Here are the top questions about peppers.
1) How to treat insects on pepper plants?
Insect control depends on the type of bug that’s attacking your pepper plants. Sap-sucking insects such as aphids, scale, mites or mealybugs are easy to control with insecticidal soap or neem oil spray. (Never spray when temperatures are above 85 F./29 C.). Harmful pests like caterpillars, leafrollers, hornworms and potato beetles can be removed by hand, or you can apply a naturally occurring bacteria known as Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis). Pepper plants are more pest resistant when they aren’t stressed; plant peppers in well-drained soil, then ensure they are watered and fertilized properly.
2) How to fertilize pepper plants?
Pepper plants need to be fed because nutrients in the soil run out quickly. However, easy goes it, because too much fertilizer can result in big, beautiful, bushy plants with very little fruit. Here’s an easy way to ensure your pepper plants have the nutrients they need: Mix a slow-release fertilizer into the soil at planting time (organic, slow-release fertilizer is great for peppers and other edibles), and then follow up with a light application of a water-soluble plant food or fish emulsion every couple of weeks. Be sure to water after applying fertilizer.
3) What causes blossom drop on pepper plants?
Blossom drop on pepper plants is usually the result of some type of stress. Some problems are easily rectified, but often, there isn’t a lot you can do. For example, drastic temperature changes can cause blossom drop, but the plant often rebounds when the temperature stabilizes. Other possible reasons for blossom drop include poor pollination, over- or under-watering, too much (or too little) fertilizer, excessively low or high humidity, fungal diseases or insect pests.

Flea & Tick Treatments For Dogs Online
Vetshop is dedicated to keeping your furry best friend free from the dangers and misery caused by fleas and ticks. That’s why we offer an extensive range of effective, affordable tick and flea treatment for dogs, including:
- Topical treatments
We want to offer your dog the very best of care without breaking the bank, as fleas and ticks are common and can be highly dangerous.
The importance of tick treatment for dogs
Ticks are rife in the Australian natural environment, particularly in bush, scrub and long grass. They are parasites which attach onto your dog’s skin and feed on their blood. There are three different types of ticks found in Australia:
- Brown ticks
- Bush ticks
- Paralysis ticks
Paralysis ticks are by far the most dangerous of these. Their saliva is highly toxic and does serious damage to your dog’s nervous system. Without being treated in time, virtually no dogs survive a paralysis tick infection.
This is why regular tick treatment for dogs is an essential part of giving them the proper care they deserve.
Why you need flea control for dogs
Most dogs will be affected by fleas at some point during their lives. This is an extremely uncomfortable experience for your dog, as they will become extremely itchy. However, flea bites can also cause more complicated skin conditions such as allergies and dermatitis. These are highly distressing conditions for your dog and can lead to other infections, which are very costly to treat.
In addition, fleas can be hosts for parasites including tapeworms, which are then transferred to your dog via flea bites.
Fleas can lay between 40 and 50 eggs every day, and once they’ve infested your home it can take months to get rid of them. In some cases, they can even transfer to humans, so it’s not just your poor dog that will be itchy and uncomfortable!
A preventative flea treatment for dogs is the easiest and most convenient way to break the flea life cycle and remove the risk of infestation.
Protecting all dogs from ticks and fleas
At VetShopAustralia, we offer a wide variety of flea and tick control for dogs of all sizes and breeds, as you must select a treatment appropriate for your dog’s weight. We even offer treatments suitable for puppies, as you should begin treating your dog for tick and fleas as young as possible."	<urn:uuid:4ab73bd0-cce1-4645-b3ab-c213a29a36e5>	0.0

I've been feeling down lately and heard that gut health might be connected to mood. What chemicals do healthy gut bacteria produce, and how do these chemicals affect both our digestive system and mental well-being?	"However, vegetarians and vegans do not need to panic since our body can convert ALA to EPA and DHA with a variable conversion rate (8-20% and 0.5-9%, respectively).11
For example, 1 tbsp of flaxseeds contain 2350 mg ALA. If we take 2 tbsp and assume a conversion rate of 8%, we will get already 376 mg of EPA and DHA. Other sources are walnuts (2574 mg ALA per tbsp) and chia (1900 mg per tbsp).12
Consider taking vitamin B12 and D as a supplement
Vitamin B12 is only found in animal products. The reason is that vitamin B12 is only produced by bacteria and Archaea. This bacteria can also be found in the human colon. However, all the B12 produced is excreted through faeces rather than absorbed because the receptors are found in the small intestine. Interestingly, our gut microbes also need B12 and there is some kind of competition for it in the small intestine.13
Vitamin D also influences the composition of the microbiome.14, 15 It is produced when we are exposed to sunlight. So, if you are unlucky enough to not see the sun for days, your body and mental health will benefit from vitamin D3 supplementation.
If you suffer from intestinal distress, try taking digestive enzymes
Have you noticed bloating, gas, constipation or pain after consuming certain types of foods? It might be that your stomach acid is low or that you don’t produce enough digestive enzymes to break down food. When food is not digested properly, particles arrive at the colon where bacteria ferment them. Here we are not only talking about resistant starch and fiber, but also about undigested proteins and fats, whose byproducts can lead to bloating, smelly gas and constipation. In this case, taking digestive enzymes or betaine HCl can help easer these complaints.
Eat slowly and in a peaceful manner
Evolutionarily, when humans were stressed due to food scarcity or having to run from an animal, the body prepared for it in various ways. During these times, digesting food was not a priority and, as a consequence, less digestive juices were produced. Nowadays, this survival function is standing in your way to achieving a healthy gut microbiome."	<urn:uuid:97bec183-a080-4d7d-b0b4-dd0b9df6fbfa>	0.0

I personally believe that not every child will get autism from the MMR vaccine (which is the vaccine most blamed for the onset), but that a certain percentage of children have the genes that make them susceptible probably when combined with other factors such as a poor diet. This is NOT from the genes…it is from the way we are treating the genes. It takes hundreds of thousands of years for true genetic variation to occur, and this is occurring in decades.
California researchers say that the state is seeing a sharp rise in the number of autistic children–but said they were mystified about what caused the unprecedented spread of the developmental disorder.The report by researchers at the University of California-Davis’ M.I.N.D. Institute released on Thursday showed a 273% increase in the number of autistic children entering various state treatment centers between 1987 and 1998.The findings also indicate that the increase could not be accounted for by other factors such as the misclassification of cases or changing diagnostic criteria.”Speculation about the increase in autism in California has led some to try to explain it away as a statistical issue or with other factors that artificially inflated the numbers,” lead investigator Dr. Robert Byrd said.”Instead, we found that autism is on the rise in the state and we still do not know why. The results of this study are, without a doubt, sobering,” he added.Medical experts say it is difficult to compare California’s autism numbers with other states’ because tracking systems are different. But they say anecdotal evidence indicates rates may also be rising elsewhere in the country.The California study, which was launched this year in an effort to determine why observed cases were increasing, looked at a statewide sample of 684 children from both English- and Spanish-speaking families.But the research did little to solve the mystery.Dr."	<urn:uuid:1dd57434-5bf8-4b8a-a7e7-0d4fc4f9445b>	0.0
What defines proper evidence-based clinical medicine?	"Welcome to the Department of Chemical Pathology at the University of Pretoria
Chemical Pathology (also known as clinical biochemistry/clinical chemistry) is a discipline that interfaces with almost every clinical specialty, as up to 70% of clinical diagnosis requires the input of laboratory investigations.
In this Department, we are passionate about, and dedicated to the discipline in particular and pathology in general and this is borne out in our enthusiasm to achieve excellence in teaching, clinical training, research and laboratory service.
Chemical Pathology overlaps with the discipline of metabolic medicine and in some countries, the UK, for example, it is integrated with metabolic medicine to cover the domains of lipidology, metabolic bone disease, nutrition, inherited metabolic disorders and diabetes/endocrinology. This illustrates the vast overlap of chemical pathology with clinical medicine. Thus, chemical pathologists are often called upon to manage these disorders either in the outpatient or inpatient setting. A substantial component of the discipline also overlaps with molecular genetics owing to the importance of molecular diagnosis in many inherited metabolic diseases. In summary, Chemical Pathology occupies a central facilitative and enabling role in clinical medicine, without which proper patient management will not be possible. It is not just in secondary and tertiary health care where it is important, chemical pathology is also important for primary health care where screening tests are often used to determine disease patterns and occurrences and risk management in otherwise healthy individuals.

inattentive adhd anxiety disorder physical symptoms	"Study: Methylphenidate is Effective Long-Term ADHD Treatment
Methylphenidate, a central nervous system stimulant medication commonly used to treat ADHD symptoms, remained beneficial for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder after two years of use, according to a new study.
June 26, 2019
Methylphenidate — the popular central nervous system stimulant medication that comes in brand names including Ritalin, Concerta, and Daytrana, among others — remains effective in treating symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD or ADD) in children and adolescents after two or more years of continued use, according to a study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry1.
A team of researchers from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands conducted a placebo-controlled discontinuation study using 94 children and adolescents ages 8-18 who had taken the ADHD medication methylphenidate for more than two years. A seven-week, double-blind continuation of ADHD treatment was administered to participants, or they were administered gradual withdrawal over three to four weeks with use of a placebo.
At the study’s culmination, researchers used common ADHD rating scales to compare symptoms before and after the seven-week period. They found that patients who discontinued treatment saw worsening symptoms while those who continued taking methylphenidate experienced uninterrupted symptom control, even after two years or more of treatment with methylphenidate. The ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) was the primary outcome measure, the Clinical Global Impressions improvement scale (CGI-I) and the Conners’ Teacher Rating Scale–Revised: Short Form (CTRS-R:S) were the secondary outcome measures.
Continuation and discontinuation groups had average (SD) ADHD-RS scores at baseline of 21.4 (SD=9.7) and 19.6 (SD=8.9), respectively. The average scores were 21.9 (SD=10.8) and 24.7 (SD=11.4) after 7 weeks. Between groups, the difference in change over time was −4.6 (95% CI=−8.7, −0.56), favoring the methylphenidate group. Also, The ADHD-RS inattention subscale and the CTRS-R:S ADHD index and hyperactivity subscale deteriorated substantially more in the discontinuation group."	<urn:uuid:ef1b5868-0d7a-4387-b864-7246ca1e945a>	0.0

preferred structures habitat fish locations	"Monarch butterfly habitat focus of new environmental program
Starting in 2018, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) will target financial assistance through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) Monarch Habitat Initiative for implementing designated practices that create or improve monarch habitat. Payment is provided after the practices have been installed and determined to meet NRCS standards.
Some of these practices include conservation cover, field borders, prescribed burning and brush management. Eligible landowners may be able to receive financial assistance to offset the cost of establishing or improving pollinator and monarch habitat, according to Michigan Farm Bureau Ag Ecology Manager, Laura Campbell.
“One way landowners and farmers can help is by participating in one of the pollinator protection programs offered by FSA under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), and a new offering in Michigan from NRCS under the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP),” Campbell explained. “MFB along with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Michigan State University, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Farm Service Agency (FSA), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other partners are promoting the development of a habitat management plan for the Monarch butterfly.”
This habitat management plan, in coordination with other state plans, will be submitted to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to demonstrate that landowners, state and federal agencies, scientists and universities are committed to taking the actions needed to help the Monarch recover without the need for listing under the Endangered Species Act and all the regulation that comes with it.
Local NRCS offices will accept applications for conservation financial assistance on a continuous basis. Applications may be submitted at local field offices or online using the Conservation Client Gateway. On designated dates, applications are ranked and selected for funding."	<urn:uuid:12b54b80-b4d3-4140-aa70-bc02ebc45e7b>	0.0

Nowadays, the world is ready and waiting for products offering environmental solutions. People are demanding sustainable choices and are getting ready to pay for them. Some years ago, the western world was not yet aware of the impact of marine litter, nor was it prepared to get involved. Today, it has become clear that instead of extracting more natural resources to produce even more plastic products, everybody is getting eager to use more and more sustainable solutions."	<urn:uuid:acd7eb18-cdd8-4a88-bdcb-b465151f9322>	0.0

Questions and Answers
I was not dissapointed. My monitor is level, the polished arm extending from my desk is not an eye sore, and best of all, my boss asked me to order one for him too after seeing mine!
PROS: Solid Good looks Very sturdy Great adjustability
PROS: This is a nice design improvement over the previous model. It's sturdy, inexpensive, and high quality. I like the chrome pole, and no I'm not a stripper.
CONS: No way to prevent it from tilting. Only thing I don't like about it is that it still tilts when you touch it and there is no way to lock it in place."	<urn:uuid:89f65520-1518-4da7-99e5-9a2272cd6a16>	0.0
