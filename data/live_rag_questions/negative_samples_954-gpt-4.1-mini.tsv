exocrine pancreatic insufficiency symptoms causes patient numbers usa	"About 94% of pancreatic cancers are classified as exocrine tumors. These tumors start in the exocrine cells of the pancreas. The following table describes the most common pancreatic exocrine tumors.
|Adenocarcinoma||Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of pancreatic cancer. It accounts for about 90% of all pancreatic cancers. It begins in the cells lining the pancreatic duct.|
|Acinar Cell Carcinoma||Acinar cell carcinoma is a very rare form of pancreatic cancer. Some tumors may cause excessive production of pancreatic lipase, the enzyme secreted to digest fats. Pancreatic lipase levels can be measured in the blood.|
|Intraductal Papillary-Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN)||An IPMN is a cystic tumor that grows from the main pancreatic duct or from side branches of the duct. The tumor may appear as a finger-like (papillary) projection into the duct. An IPMN may be benign at the time of diagnosis. However, it has a risk of progressing to malignancy. This risk is high when the IPMN originates in the main pancreatic duct. An IPMN may therefore be a precursor for adenocarcinoma.|
|Mucinous Cystadenocarcinoma||Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma is a rare, malignant, cystic tumor. The cyst is filled with a thick fluid called mucin. It is similar to an IPMN but occurs in just one area of the pancreas, more commonly in the tail of the pancreas. These tumors are mostly seen in women.|
There are other rare types of exocrine pancreatic tumors not discussed in this table. For information about other types of exocrine pancreatic tumors, contact a Patient Central Associate.

traditional kofte ingredients food poisoning risks	"THURSDAY, Jan. 8, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- The potential health hazards of e-cigarettes remain unclear, and more regulation on their use is needed, say two groups representing cancer researchers and specialists.
The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) together issued a list of recommendations on Thursday aimed at bringing e-cigarette regulations more in line with those of traditional cigarettes.
In a news release, the two groups pointed out that e-cigarettes, which are not smoked but deliver nicotine in a aerosolized form, are not yet regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. They called on the FDA to regulate all types of e-cigarette products that also meet the standard definition of tobacco products.
Those that do not meet that standard should be regulated by whichever means the FDA feels appropriate, the cancer groups added.
Among other recommendations is a call for e-cigarette manufacturers to provide the FDA with a full and detailed list of their products' ingredients; a call for warning labels on all e-cigarette packaging and ads to advise consumers about the perils of nicotine addiction; and a ban on all marketing and selling of e-cigarettes to minors.
Containers for the liquid nicotine used for e-cigarettes should also have childproof caps, to reduce the chances of accidental poisoning of children, the groups said.
ASCO and AACR further urged that some of the tax monies levied on both traditional and e-cigarette products be used for research into whether or not e-cigarettes have any real value as a smoking-cessation tool, or contain any health hazards.
""We are concerned that e-cigarettes may encourage nonsmokers, particularly children, to start smoking and develop nicotine addiction,"" ASCO President Dr. Peter Paul Yu explained in a news release. ""While e-cigarettes may reduce smoking rates and attendant adverse health risks, we will not know for sure until these products are researched and regulated.""
ASCO and AACR aren't the first organizations of health professionals to come out for more regulation of e-cigarettes. In 2014, three leading medical groups -- the American Medical Association, the American Heart Association and the World Health Organization -- all advocated for more restrictions on ""vaping"" devices.
The recommendations are being simultaneously published Jan. 8 in ASCO's Journal of Clinical Oncology and the AACR journal Clinical Cancer Research.
For more on e-cigarettes, head to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.

I'm interested in environmental organizations in North America - can you tell me what the Commission for Environmental Cooperation does and when it was created?	"There are lots of organizations out there that do focus more on changing people’s minds and getting more people on board. We do other types of work, even though that work is very important. We focus on trying to solve the problems that will, hopefully, maybe even reverse climate change someday, even though that’s a huge thing to say, we like to be hopeful.
IVAN: I love it. I want to be hopeful as well. I think it’s within our reach, the more we do as organizations, as small businesses, as large businesses, in the everyday life we have, I think the more of a positive effect we can have. Now, you mentioned your role at BEF. Your title is Environmental Products Representative. What does your day to day look like at BEF?
HEATHER: It’s funny you mention my title, because I believe I may have a title change soon. But, essentially, my work at Bonneville Environmental Foundation is under the business development umbrella. So, I interact with businesses and entities, such as governments, cities, counties, universities, and other nonprofits, who are interested in looking at their own impact, especially from a water carbon and energy perspective, and doing something about it. The reason I represent the environmental products is because those are one solution, and one approach that a business can take to address their environmental impacts, and of course there are lots of other approaches as well that I like to discuss with businesses. From an energy perspective obviously there’s efficiencies and conserving energy. But at the end of the day, most businesses, I don’t know any business that doesn’t have any footprint at all, there is some effect. And when there’s something left there, what we call an unavoidable footprint, we consider the solution of using something like a renewable energy certificate, like you guys have, carbon offsets, and the water restoration certificates as a way to balance the remaining, unavoidable environmental footprint.
IVAN: Let’s talk about those three things you just mentioned. The Water Restoration Certificates, the Renewable Energy Certificates and the Carbon Offsets. Can you give me a high-level description to each of these three things that we just talked about?
HEATHER: So, a Renewable Energy Certificate… Actually, let me start with offsets, since those were first on the market."	<urn:uuid:9ffe53ea-c8c6-42e1-973e-7a09fdf84629>	0.0

What are the various forms of contraception?
There are many types of contraception. Please refer to these links for details:
- Choosing the right Birth Control Method – Health Promotion Board
- Types of Contraception – Young Women’s Health
- Preventing Pregnancy with Contraception – Health Promotion Board
- Sex Etc – Sex Education for Teens
How effective are various forms of contraception?
- The effectiveness of contraception depends on whether or not it is used properly.
- There are two different measures of contraception effectiveness:
- “Perfect use” measures the effectiveness when a contraceptive is used exactly according to clinical guidelines.
- “Typical use” measures how effective a method is for the average person who does not always use the method correctly or consistently.
For example, a woman who never forgets to take her pill will experience almost complete protection against pregnancy. But often a person may miss a day for one reason or another, in which case the risk of pregnancy increases.
Typically, effectiveness is closer to 92%, meaning on average 8 in 100 women taking oral contraceptives will become pregnant in the first year of use.

How do modern x-ray tubes manage heat generation during operation, and what are the recommended safety protocols for operating these devices?	"Likewise, some jobs require specialized equipment and in-depth knowledge. Stay out of trouble by knowing when to call a pro.
As the seasons change, so to do the needs of the vehicle. Knowing how to prepare the car for the harsh cold and wet conditions of winter is as important as getting ready for the heat of summer. Likewise, driver adjustments maximize the benefit gained from changes in hardware.
By design, preventative maintenance tasks are designed to reduce wear, increase efficiency, and prevent costly breakdowns. These are some tips for prolonging the life of the vehicle. Learn how to change fluids, preserve the paint and plastics, operate the vehicle in a systems-friendly fashion and make evaluations during use in order to proactively manage vehicle longevity.
A compelling reason to update an older vehicle is the remarkable increase in safety technologies in modern cars. Put modern technology to work by understanding and selecting the features that increase vehicle safety. Further, understand those systems so that their use increases driver awareness and reduces the risk of collisions or accidents. Also, understand the limitations of modern safety systems.
Vehicle ownership presents some common issues that are worth understanding. Changing a tire, for example, is a skill required at some point for nearly all drivers. Considering the common issues and how to prevent or handle them is the aim of this chapter. Change a tire, evaluate the brakes, add fluids, replace the wipers or jump start a car with ease.
Some sounds, smells, warning lights or vibrations are basically harmless warnings that do not require immediate attention. Others are signs that severe damage is being done or is about to be done to the vehicle. Understanding the warning signs that indicate a need for immediate service will reduce the likelihood of operating with a severely damaged vehicle."	<urn:uuid:b5b34a06-158f-411f-b2a5-c979f7cdf5e2>	0.0

What are the main symptoms someone should look out for to know if they are getting dehydrated from gastroenteritis?	"What is influenza?
Influenza is a respiratory infection caused by the influenza virus. It is spread through respiratory droplets. After you are exposed to someone who has the flu it takes 1-4 days before you start showing symptoms. Usually it causes sudden onset of severe headache, body-ache, fever, runny nose, and cough. While you are sick with the flu, and even a day before you get sick, you are contagious, meaning you can pass the virus along to others if you have close enough contact.
Influenza is commonly called ‘the flu’ which is differentiated from common cold symptoms by the severity of body aches and fever. It is also different from the stomach flu or gastroenteritis, which is the vomiting and diarrhea viral illness that is often referred to as the flu.
What should I expect if I get sick?
The symptoms will resolve after a week or so and most people will recover fully without any specific treatment for the flu. There are antiviral medications available to treat the flu (Tami flu & Relenza are two) but these only shorten the course of being sick by a day or two; their use should be minimized to prevent the flu virus from developing resistance to the medication. These medications are more effective if you start them as soon as possible after you develop flu symptoms and do almost no good if you have been sick for more than 72 hours. Like a cold, the cause of the infection is a virus and antibiotics will not get you better any faster unless you develop a secondary bacterial infection like pneumonia.
While you are sick, it is best to stay home and treat your symptoms with tylenol or ibuprofen, drink plenty of fluids and rest. This will allow your body to recuperate and heal itself while preventing others from getting ill.
Occasionally, people get quite ill and every year people die from influenza. Usually these deaths occur in the very young and very old, or people with chronic medical conditions. Last year, there was a higher than expected percentage of deaths in normally healthy individuals due to the H1N1 strain of influenza.
If your breathing becomes difficult at any point while you have influenza, you must see your doctor or go to an urgent care or ER for an evaluation to check your oxygen saturation, maybe get a flu test, or a chest x-ray to make sure you don’t have a bacterial pneumonia which can be a complication of influenza.

When did the Knights of Malta own islands in the Caribbean?	"Hompesch had minimal leadership qualities. He dithered, and Napoleon landed 15,000 troops, who occupied the island in short order.
The Knights were scattered. Many of them went to Russia, for the Tsar Paul I had developed an interest in the Order. In gratitude for the refuge, the Tsar was named Grand Master, but he died in 1801, and his successor, Alexander I, had no interest. The Order effectively ceased to exist, but was reconstituted in 1879 by pope Leo XIII, and it is this restored Order that we know today as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.
Over the centuries of their rule the Knights had treated their native subjects not badly according to the mores of the time. They did a lot of public building, and the populace supported them, by-and-large, in their holy military endeavors. But the Order had become exceedingly rich, and the Knights grew thoroughly accustomed to their lives of luxury. By the time of Napoleon's appearance the ideas of the Enlightment had penetrated the culture of both the Knights and the Natives. The result was demoralization among the former and disaffection among the latter.
The French made themselves unpopular, however, by exercising the various traditional vices of occupying armies, and the people rose against them in 1800. The British came in to help, and stayed. Malta became a British colony in 1814.
The British saw in Malta what everyone else saw: a critical location for projection of naval power in the Mediterranean. With Malta added to Gibraltar the British controlled the western half of that sea, bottling up the French. They modernized the fortifications and built up their presence.
Coinage of the period was British. They struck those little 1/3 farthings to substitute for the old, small, 1 grano coppers, and they were used nowhere else. It's not too hard to collect a nice example of the British ""grain."" Pick your monarch.
That Britain held Malta through World War II is one of the miracles of that war, and the island played a key role in the Allied invasion of North Africa.
People had begun talking about independence back in the 1920s, and a movement began to form. Independence activities were put on hold during the War, but accelerated after, culminating in formal independence in 1964."	<urn:uuid:249229d7-e494-485d-9c2b-2b701b689d6a>	0.0

I'm curious about John Clarke's photography journey. How did he get started?	"JASON FABOK Brings Cinematic Style to JOKER in DETECTIVE
Written by John Layman with art by up-and-coming artist Jason Fabok, Detective Comics has been surprising readers since its new creative team took over in October. With a story that has been concentrating on villains, Layman and Fabok have given Batman fans a unique mix of gritty detective stories and fun moments reminiscent of the character's animated series.
In fact, it's animation that helps to inform the work by Fabok, who burst onto the scene at DC by helping out with David Finch's work on Batman: The Dark Knight.
Newsarama talked to the artist about his unique style on Detective Comics, drawing The Joker, and his hopes for the future.
Newsarama: Jay, what drew you to the chance to work on Detective Comics?
Jason Fabok: I've always wanted to work on Batman. That was my main goal when I started this crazy ride a few years back. Batman has been my favorite character since the first time I saw Tim Burton's Batman movie as a child. I’m still in a state of shock that I'm even working on a Batman title. I never thought that I'd get this chance so early in my career.
As for how I got this opportunity, it was right after the Batman Annual that Mike Marts approached me and asked if I was ready for a ""Big Project."" I was curious as to what he had up his sleeve and it turned out to be Detective Comics. I couldn't turn something like that down.
Nrama: Were you aware of John Layman's work before? What did you think of the chance to work with him as he started on a DC Batman comic?
Fabok: I knew he was a hugely popular writer with Chew but hadn't found the time to check out his work. But right from the get-go, I felt we've really clicked. We had some great conversations as to what he wanted to do with the series and what my thoughts were as well. I honestly couldn't believe how close our vision was for the series. He pitched a fun, action-packed, detective comic that reminded me of the old Batman animated series. I loved the idea of each issue being it's own story while having a connecting tie through the arc."	<urn:uuid:1c46868f-196a-4d28-8cda-78f215f98a70>	0.0

How does Polish grammar compare to deep phonological dyslexia symptoms?	"In Study 2, three participants completed one-on-one phonological awareness intervention through Zoom. They were assigned to learn one skill with simulated classroom noise and another with the simulated benefit of a classroom FM system. Both studies utilized adapted alternating treatment single-case designs and assessed performance using daily assessments on the phonological awareness skills targeted during intervention and one additional phonological awareness skill.
In Study 1, two participants demonstrated quicker and more pronounced improvement on the skill learned while wearing the FM system, suggesting FM systems show promise as a tool to use during phonological awareness training. In Study 2, two participants made gains on the phonological awareness skills assessed. However, a difference was not evident between skills learned in the simulated classroom FM and simulated classroom noise condition.
The results of Study 1 indicate that FM systems show promise during phonological awareness instruction. However, the finding from Study 2 that simulation of the signal-to-ratio of FM systems was not associated with improved performance compared to simulated classroom noise suggests that aspects of FM systems beyond the increased signal-to-noise ratio alone may be responsible for the benefit they provided. Additionally, findings from Study 2 indicate that virtual phonological awareness instruction holds promise as a method of delivery.

what hardware components needed build automatic loading firing catapult ev3	"During the French and Indian War, tactics by necessity evolved quickly in the North American wilderness. After some initial bloody tactical disasters, British leadership rapidly recognized the need to adopt a new way of warfare, shifting from a regular European style of fighting to more irregular tactics led by light infantry units. The recruits in these groups wore cut down hats, coats and leather leggings and carried equipment focused on swift movement and close, skirmish-style combat. To build out my FIW Britsh light infantry units, I’ve drawn upon a variety of manufacturers.
To begin, I purchased the single offering of British light infantry models available from AW Miniatures. This small package comes with two copies each of just three different poses with two firing variations and one model loading on the move. The figures are dressed in the popular jockey caps of light infantry soldiers along with spare equipment on chunky molds which scale well with a variety of manufacturers.
Seeking to layer in some significant variety to my forces, I went next to Redoubt Enterprises and their large offering of FIW figures. Redoubt offers two six-packs of British light infnatry, one with jockey caps and the other wearing basic round hats. The packages each come with no duplication of poses, offering a lot of variety in firing, loading and advancing sculpts. One figure in each set comes with a separate hands and rifle piece meant to be glued with the musket raised high in melee mode. I chose to invert the piece in a loading posture on each of the two models.
Finally, I went to Front Rank Figurines with their vast listing of FIW models available individually for purchase. Again, there was a lot of variety here with shooting, advancing, loading and at-the-ready troops, many hauling small campaign-ready backpacks. To these, I added two NCOs — one at ease and one commanding trops forward — along with a more formal officer sold as Major General James Wolfe (middle above).
Across three UK-based manufacturers, these figures all fit well together as heftier 28mm casts. With them, I’ve been able to create 3-4 small units of British light infantry which serve as key components to so many FIW engagements on the table."	<urn:uuid:9cf95944-2368-4a09-b779-aee81ffe0545>	0.0
I'm an architectural historian researching luxury hotels in former financial buildings - what interesting features did they preserve in The Ned hotel from its past as a clearinghouse bank?	"The historic Majestic Hotel is set to reopen its doors in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in December this year.
The 300-room hotel, owned by YTL Hotels and located along Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin on a 1.29 hectare site opposite the Kuala Lumpur railway station, will open to guests following a RM250 million ($82.5 million) restoration program.
The hotel, built in 1932, was considered one of the top landmarks of Kuala Lumpur and had also previously housed the country’s National Art Gallery.
According to the Guide to Kuala Lumpur Notable Buildings published by the Malaysian Institute of Architects in 1976, the Hotel Majestic building was erected on the site of the former residence of the German consul. With its original 51 rooms, Hotel Majestic was among the first ‘big’ hotels to be constructed at the time.
The restored Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur will also become a member of the US-based The Leading Hotels of The World (LHW) group, making it the only hotel in Kuala Lumpur to be included in its portfolio of luxury hotels.

Why do birds fly high up in the evening?	"Protofeathers are in no way similar to feathers and are probably just frayed collagen fibers that originated from within the skin, not feathers from follicles outside the skin. Scientists have never observed scales turning into follicles that could produce feathers.
8. Preening Gland
Birds have a uropygial gland, or preen gland, at the base of their spine that secretes an oil. Birds turn their heads 180 degrees and use their beak to rub the preen oil on their feathers. Without this lubrication the feathers on birds wings can not operate properly. Dinosaurs do not have a uropygial gland. Scientists have never observed an animal evolve a preen gland and the ability to turn their heads 180 degrees to access the bottom of their spine at the same time.
9. Modern Fossil Birds
For dinosaurs to have evolved into birds it would require dinosaurs to be around first but we find fossils of modern birds in layers before their supposed dinosaur ancestors. Confuciusornis feducciai and Confuciusornis sanctus are some examples of modern birds found in the Early Cretaceous period. Feathered bird fossils like Jinfengopteryx and Archaeopteryx are also found in Jurassic rock layers.
The fossil Archaeopteryx is considered by some to be a transitional fossil between reptiles and birds because of it has teeth and claws; however, now Archaeopteryx is considered to be a flightless perching bird. Other birds are known to have claws such as the ostrich and the hoatzin when it is young. Also the Hesperornis birds have been found that contain teeth.
So did dinosaurs evolve into birds?
NO. Birds came first, then dinosaurs were created.
And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven... And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so... And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."	<urn:uuid:fa76471a-4ef0-4431-ac23-dfdd3e2a9ed8>	0.0

number indigenous sites artefacts damaged destroyed warragamba dam wall raising	"As evident in the Chixoy project, where the selection of the site for the dam was considered a massive state failure due to geological miscalculations, it became obvious that the development promised by the government (the official website for the Xalalá project states that one of its goals is to better the quality of life for Guatemalans) will not benefit the indigenous communities in the region. In Chixoy, the dam project already has displaced 3,500 Mayan community members and affected 6,000 other families who lost their land and means of livelihood. The argument that few will benefit at the expense of many apparently matters little to Guatemala City: The proposed dam is scheduled to bring in millions of dollars in taxes and salary revenue and is expected to produce 886 GWh per year.
The Indigenous Movement
Such disregard for the welfare of a population sector that accounts for a majority of Guatemala’s nationals (although officially the number is said to be 40 percent, other sources put the percentage of the indigenous at close to 60 percent) has motivated a determined call to action by the indigenous. In Guatemala, hostility and racism towards indigenous groups is manifested by political exclusion. The unvoiced consensus among the powerful Europeanized minority remains that although the indigenous population is substantial, its political representation should remain marginalized. President Àlvaro Colom’s blatant disregard for the 2007 community referendums, valid under international law, highlights the Central American state’s need for a more powerful indigenous presence in government.
In 1993, with the help of a failed self-coup by former President Jorge Serrano Elias, the Permanent Maya Assembly, representing an early indigenous political movement, asserted its presence and its push for permanence in the Guatemalan political arena by submitting a list with three names for the vice-presidency. Although this move gained national attention at the time, the assembly failed to generate any major breakthroughs. The indigenous movement lay semi-dormant for a number of years, until the recent election of Bolivia’s Evo Morales, the first indigenous leader in Latin America, raised expectations among Guatemala’s underrepresented community. This prompted a 2006 statement by Rigoberta Menchú Mum, 1992 Nobel Peace Prize winner and an indigenous leader, to announce that she would pursue the presidency in the 2007 election.
Menchú’s presidential bid that year proved to be a fiasco, as she gained only about 3 percent of the vote."	<urn:uuid:6568dbf0-fbca-44b7-a722-c279cb9b49a5>	0.0

safety rules near sparks welder	"How to Pick the Right Welder Technical School near Somerton Arizona
Finding the right welding trade school near Somerton AZ is an important first step to starting your new career as a professional welder. But since there are numerous schools to pick from, how do you determine which ones to consider? And more significantly, once you have narrowed down your options, how do you pick the right one? Most people start by looking at the schools that are closest to their residences. Once they have found those that are within commuting distance, they are drawn toward the cheapest one. Yes, location and the cost of tuition are important concerns when reviewing welding technical schools, but they are not the only ones. Other factors include such things as accreditation, reputation and job placement rates. So before beginning your search for a trade school to become a welder, it’s sensible to establish a list of qualifications that your chosen school must have. But before we examine our due diligence checklist, let’s cover a little bit about how to become a welder.
Welding Certificate and Degree Training
There are multiple options to receive training as a welder in a technical or trade school. You can receive a diploma, a certificate or an Associate Degree. Bachelor Degrees are offered in Welding Technology or Welding Engineering, but are more advanced degrees than most journeyman welders will need. Some programs are also made available in conjunction with an apprenticeship program. Below are short summaries of the most typical welding programs offered in the Somerton AZ.
- Certificate and Diploma Programs are generally made available by technical and trade schools and take about 1 year to finish. They are more hands-on training in nature, fashioned mainly to develop welding skills. They can provide a good foundation for a new journeyman or apprentice welder, or supplemental skills for working welders.
- Associate Degree Programs will take 2 years to complete and are usually offered by community colleges. An Associate Degree in Welding Technology offers a more extensive education than the diploma or certificate while still providing the foundation that prepares students to enter the workforce.
Some municipalities and states do have licensing requirements for welders, therefore don’t forget to find out for your location of future employment. As needed, the welder school you select should prep you for any licensing exams that you will need to pass in addition to providing the proper training to become a qualified welder."	<urn:uuid:c57ef8aa-64f2-49ca-9540-37e39e82d57c>	0.0

Phase transitions in the domain structure of ferromagnetic superconductorsKhaymovich, I.M., Mel'nikov, A.S. and Buzdin, A.I.
Starting from the London-type model, we study the domain structures in ferromagnetic superconductors taking account of the nucleation of vortices and antivortices coupled to the magnetic texture. We predict that the coupling between domains and vortices results in the formation of two energetically favorable domain configurations: (i) a Meissner-type vortex-free configuration with strong domain shrinking and (ii) a more rare domain configuration with a dense vortex-antivortex lattice. The switching between these configurations is shown to result in the first-order phase transitions which could be observable in superconducting uranium-based compounds.

Hey, I'm fascinated by archaeological digs happening in Israel. What are they searching for at the Tel Shiloh site and have they found anything interesting so far?	"BAR 35:06, Nov/Dec 2009
First Person: Barred from the City of David
I have been writing about the City of David for more than 35 years. The major excavations of Yigal Shiloh between 1978 and 1985 were undertaken as a result of a book I wrote. In that sense, I created the site. So it is no small thing to me that General Shuka Dorfman, the current director of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), has instructed Ronny Reich, who codirects the current excavations near the Pool of Siloam with Eli Shukron, to bar me from the site.a Shuka, as everyone calls him, is mad at me. It has something to do with the famous James Ossuary (inscribed “James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus”), which was first published in BAR by Sorbonne scholar André Lemaire in 2002.b I cannot be more specific about why Shuka is so angry because he won’t tell me. He won’t speak to me. What is clear is that it has nothing to do with the City of David or its excavation. At a meeting of Israel’s Archaeological Council, council members suggested he talk to me, but Shuka rejected their advice; he remains obdurate. After all, he’s a general; he is accustomed to commanding, not taking suggestions."	<urn:uuid:7071c241-1c6a-477a-b5a0-1b306091ddff>	0.0
how much percentage entertainment agents charge from performer earnings	"Disappointing, But Not Devastating
As we anticipated in last week’s post, US GDP did come in at a very disappointing 0.2% growth.[i] This was anemic and also much slower growth than the expected growth of 1.0%.[ii]
When you examine the component parts of US GDP, (Consumption + Investment + Government Spending - Net Exports), there are signs of hope and despair.
- US Consumers held up their end of the bargain by willingly spending in spite of tough winter conditions. They added 1.31 percentage points to GDP.[iii]
- US Businesses grew more optimistic about the consumer by increasing inventories and adding 0.74 percentage points to GDP.[iv]
- The big drag (no surprise) was the massive headwinds created by a huge, strong-dollar-induced trade deficit. Net exports subtracted a whopping 1.25 percentage points from GDP.[v,vi]
US GDP was in a similar position last year at this time contracting by 2.1%. In some regards, we are a little better off.[vii]
One big difference between today and this same time last year is in corporate earnings.
When you look back at Q1 2014 earnings, you see US companies in much stronger shape than today.[viii,ix]
While both periods had analysts predicting earnings shrinking, actual results vary substantially. We had decent growth in Q1 2014, but now we are facing an earnings drought.
Certainly more volatility will be in our future and that's observable for most watching their portfolio values.
What's less obvious is how much more earnings, trade, and GDP headwinds we have to face from a continued strong dollar. The dollar is up over 18% since it began its rally in mid-2014.[x] However, when looking at the trade-weighted dollar over longer periods of time, you can see we may have more to go.
A strong dollar has not been devastating at this point and the consumer is anything but disappointing. With lots of fire power in the consumer’s wallet (income growth, credit and savings accounts), we can see the US economy stumble forward for the foreseeable future while we continue to fight a strong dollar.

As a veterinary student focusing on feline development, I'm curious about the exact timeline of when kittens get their first teeth and how the teething process progresses - could you explain the key stages?	"When your baby is around 6 months old, you'll probably start to see his first two teeth pushing through his gums. This process, known as teething, is an exciting milestone for parents, but it can also be frustrating if your little one is experiencing teething pain.
A baby's discomfort from teething is caused by the fact that his new teeth are erupting through his tender gum tissue. While you may be somewhat familiar with teething issues, you might still have a tough time determining whether your child is suffering from pain related to teething or from discomfort caused by a different problem. Keep reading to learn how to recognize which of your child's symptoms point to teething pain and which symptoms may be signs of other issues that could require medical attention.
Recognizing the Common Signs of Teething Pain
General irritability and crankiness are two of the telltale signs of pain from the teething process. If you're lucky, your baby's crankiness may only last for a brief period, although some babies remain irritable for several weeks as their teeth grow in.
Because of the discomfort that comes along with teething, your little one might also refuse certain foods or have trouble sleeping. Of course, some babies are picky eaters and fussy sleepers before they ever begin teething; that's why it's important to take note of your child's normal habits, so it will be easier to determine whether any behavior changes are related to his teething process.
If you're still unsure if your baby's symptoms are caused by pain in his gums, you can examine his gums to check for visible swelling and redness. You can also gently place a finger on or near the area where his teeth are growing in to see if he has a negative reaction to your touch.
Knowing Which Symptoms Are Unrelated to Teething
Many parents mistakenly believe that a baby's fever and diarrhea are connected with teething. However, experts haven't found any links between these symptoms and teething pain. If your child exhibits fevers or diarrhea, it's a good idea to call your physician to see what else might be causing these issues.
Every baby is unique, and while some little ones will have very strong reactions to teething, other babies will show no signs of distress at all. Keeping tabs on your baby's regular behavior and learning what signs do and don't point to teething pain will help you ensure that your little one remains healthy during this important process."	<urn:uuid:c7accec6-19c3-4e95-ae0c-63728b578e6e>	0.0
photo print longevity storage methods comparison	"There are some nice little extras, like a secondary input tray for postcard sized photo paper, and a neat CD tray for printing directly onto compatible CD/DVD discs, as also featured in the Canon MP640.
As a dedicated photo printer running six dye-based inks, the PX710W makes a surprisingly good job of mono text printing but print quality is less than perfect where you need it most – in photo output.
We often found that fine detail got lost in lowlight areas and that contrast was a little high, while skin tones were sometimes cool and less than flattering.
Another problem was that the Epson seemed more prone than other printers to print head blockages in the ink nozzles, requiring greater frequency in cleaning cycles, which is not only an inconvenience but also wastes ink.
The PX710W is one of Epson's best photo printers to date but speed and quality could still be better, even in comparison to more general purpose printers like the Canon MP640."	<urn:uuid:c7878e4d-8508-4094-8182-8e8ff10ae085>	0.0

How did ancient leaders die while defending their lands?	"Although this technically constitutes a non-apology apology and was deemed “unsatisfactory” by Muslims, many anti-Jihadists would have preferred the Pope to use the opportunity to make a clearer stand against Islamic aggression.
Still, his comments raised public debate about the issue, and certainly marked progress compared to his predecessor Pope John Paul II, who kissed the Koran in public in an effort to reach our to Muslims.
I have described examples of incredible stupidity and appeasement from Christians in the West, but also of courage and clarity of mind in standing up to Islamic aggression and defending Western civilization and the world from sharia. The ideological civil war within the West is not just between secularists and religious people; it runs straight through the Church itself.
Christians need to understand that there can be no peace or understanding with the Islamic world. They want to subdue us, pure and simple. Church leaders of all denominations, Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, must stop stabbing Israel in the back and campaigning for a de facto open borders policy while Muslims are threatening to swamp our lands. Yes, Christianity teaches compassion, but it also teaches identifying evil and standing up to it. At the end of the day, the Church must decide whether, in the defense of civilization, it wants to be a part of the problem or a part of the solution."	<urn:uuid:754ed7dd-60bc-4e03-8ede-9a33baf49e34>	0.0

As an aviation engineer, what causes ice formation on aircraft and how is it monitored for safety?	"FAA Calls on the Aviation Industry for Help
The FAA wants to collaborate in order to equip for NextGen and help increase safety and efficiency.
The Federal Aviation Administration will host a ""Call to Action"" summit on Oct. 28 to engage the aviation industry in meeting the Jan. 1, 2020, deadline to equip aircraft with new avionics technology.
FAA and the aviation industry stakeholders plan to discuss how they can work together to resolve barriers and address potential challenges to meeting the mandate to equip aircraft with Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B). ADS-B will move aviation technology from a ground radar system to satellite-based GPS technology, increasing safety and efficiency by providing a more accurate view of aircraft location.
""The FAA has met its commitment and built the foundation for ADS-B,"" said FAA Deputy Administrator Mike Whitaker. ""It is time for all users of the national airspace – avionics suppliers, aircraft integrators, operators, and installers – to work together to ensure that all aircraft flying in controlled airspace are equipped with these NextGen avionics. The full benefits of increase safety and efficiency of the national airspace depend on 100 percent equipage.""
In May 2010, the FAA published a rule that requires all aircraft flying in specific, controlled airspace to equip with ADS-B Out avionics by 2020."	<urn:uuid:cbede9b9-37d2-4ff8-a0dc-97bbbe2afb90>	0.0
what ancient building inspired construction design taj mahal india	"In the 1800s, when the British defeated the Mughals and took over India, the Taj Mahal was looted by British soldiers who cut gemstones from the walls as well as stole candlesticks, doors, and even tried to sell some of the marble.
Years after the Taj was desecrated by soldiers, Lord Curzon the British Viceroy of India in 1900 recognized that this was a structure of immense cultural value and tried to restore it to its former glory. During the restoration, the traditional Mughal-style gardens that surrounded the Taj were updated to the more European-style green lawns.
When India gained independence, the government did not recreate the original gardens but instead chose to maintain and preserve the immaculate lawns that we see in most famous Taj Mahal photos today.
Because of its immaculate beauty and important cultural significance, the Taj Mahal was named not only one of the Seven New Wonders of the World , but also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Today, the Taj sees around 2.5 million visitors per year who head to Agra to catch a glimpse of the 'World's Greatest Testament of Love'.
Today, the biggest threats to the Taj Mahal are air pollution and wear and tear from the sheer number of visitors it receives. Agra, while once the gem of the Mughal Empire, today is an industrial and dusty city. The pollution released from nearby factories and road traffic over the past century has tarnished the mausoleum’s walls turning them yellow.
To prevent further damage, the Indian government has enacted laws concerning the restriction of traffic and factory pollution. The Taj has also undergone a facelift in the last five years where its marble walls were cleaned using a special mud pack.

How does Tim Kloss contribute to the development of poetry at the weekly gatherings at Linneman's?	"Poems are Not a Luxury: Audre Lorde and Adrienne Rich
208 West 13th Street, #210
New York, NY 10011
“Poetry is liberative language,” wrote Adrienne Rich. “Poems are not a luxury,” argued Audre Lorde. How can we understand these claims about the intersection of poetry and politics? This course delves into the lives and works of Rich and Lorde, as we explore their respective poetic oeuvres. To Rich and Lorde, liberation was a through-line of experience between eros, politics, and language. And both express in their works understandings of gender, sexuality, and the body. In a famous interview between the two writers, they discuss poetry as the language of the dark, the feminine, the unconscious; we will explore this tendency in their work and the ways in which their respective renderings of the feminine influenced the trajectory of feminist theory and politics in the mid and late-20th century. Their conversations with one another, and treatments of their legacies by Claudia Rankine, Lisa L. Moore, Marilyn Hacker and others, will inform our investigation of poetry as part of feminist theory. How do Rich and Lorde navigate antiracism and intersectionality among allies with different race and class affiliations? How does poetic form contribute to their political practice? Readings will include Diving Into The Wreck, The Fact of a Doorframe, Uses of the Erotic, Sister Outsider, and the Art of the Possible, among others.

I'm researching historical cryptography pioneers and want to know who actually invented the coding system known as the Playfair cipher - I heard there might be a mix-up with the naming?	"Is there anything that you do now at work that you don’t think would come as easily if you hadn’t attended 42?
Learning how to learn. It is important to know how to figure things out without someone holding your hand. At The DEN we are teaching the essentials about blockchain and smart contract development and they generally move so fast. One year regular time is 20 years in blockchain time because so much happens in a year. A month ago the newest version of Solidity came out and I essentially had to learn the new version of that language. It is always changing, every month or so there is a new language, library or token standard. You want to stay up with it to provide the most up-to-date information.
How did you get your foot in the door where you work?
So The DEN actually came to 42 and did some presentations. They let me know they were teaching people how to develop in this framework. I told them I wanted to learn, and that is how I got my foot in the door. That is something great that 42 provides. Although they don’t do direct job placement they bring in employers who want to hire and they introduce you to people who may know about available jobs.
Describe what you do at The DEN:
I am responsible for maintaining all curriculum, keeping it up-to-date and making new courses that involve blockchain. I am essentially the person who needs to go in and find all of the technical knowledge, package it in a way that is interesting and engaging and make it so it helps you learn new skills.
What does your typical workday look like?
A typical day starts around 11 am at the office. I will go and research something at night and integrate something new in the curriculum. The other day I was researching opcodes and seeing how they work and figuring out how I want to integrate that into the curriculum. Most of the day involves looking at different chunks of code, writing code, and at the end of the day, we will have a meetup. The meetup will start at 7 pm and end at 9 pm. At the meetup, I will present about bitcoin, etherium, smart contracts, and cryptography. I get a lot more done at night, little fixes will come up during the day. When you are coding or writing any code you need to get into a mindset where you are focusing on that and that alone."	<urn:uuid:a51faf2e-55cb-49b9-a7b7-36b4bbf5e798>	0.0

I'm curious about how hurricanes get their names - what's the story behind this tradition of naming big storms?	"People tend to move their homes and businesses into the paths of hurricanes.
Also, the time that it takes to evacuate some crowded coastal communities is longer than the time for which accurate hurricane forecasts can be made.
The following are tools forecasters and researchers are using to try to figure out these great storms.
While the hurricanes are still far out at sea, forecasters rely on direct observations from ships and instruments on ocean buoys. Satellites are their main toll and can orbit 22,000 miles above the equator at the same rate as the earth’s daily rotation, so always they hover over the same patch of the planet. Their big picture images allow forecasters to track storms night and day all over the Atlantic Ocean. These images are the first important clues to the formation of these storms as well as their location, size and intensity.
As the storms move closer to land, direct measurements are made by “Hurricane Hunter” airplanes.
Routinely, the US Air Force Reserve uses a specially equipped flight of C-130 aircraft to monitor approaching hurricanes. Their pilots fly into the core of the storm. Specialists aboard these planes drip instrument packages through the storms that radio back accurate information about the location of its eye, the strength of its winds, the direction and pace of its progress, and other important features such as air pressure, temperature, and humidity.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also have two special hurricane-probing planes, including a high altitude jet, that are designed for research.
As the storms get within about 200 miles off of the coastline, land-based weather radar begins to give forecasters importantindirect measurements. The new Doppler Radars give forecasters valuable images that give details about the internal structure of the storm – its wind fields, and how they change as a hurricane approaches land.
Forecasters are increasingly relying on computer models to help them forecast the intensity of the hurricane and its movement. Detailed information from all of the satellite sensors, and aircraft instruments, radars, ships and buoys continuously pours into thecomputer models. The results of a whole group of forecasting models are compared with one another as hurricanes approach the coast."	<urn:uuid:210929a1-c8fe-4f4f-9057-8d21e05bb0b8>	0.0

My favorite place to look for patterns is Ravelry.com :)
I've ordered my yarn and found several possible hooks--have to check gauge. I substituted the yarn for Stroll Tonal Sock Yarn. It's almost exactly the same yardage and was 1/2 the price.
I've never made socks before, but much prefer crochet to knit, so I hope these will be great. I'm excited to try.
I'm hoping we will be able to get help: I've read ahead into the pattern and am already confused! Maybe it'll be easier with the work in hand.

Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council will
meet 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
“Sanctuary advisory council members help us balance protection of our coral reef ecosystem with the concerns of the local community,” said George P. Schmahl, the sanctuary’s manager.
The 11-member Flower Garden Banks Sanctuary Advisory Council consists of eight voting non-governmental members and three non-voting federal government agency members. The advisory council includes representatives from the recreational diving, diving operation, oil and gas industry, recreational fishing, commercial fishing, research, education and conservation communities.
Located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, designated in 1992, includes three separate areas: East Flower Garden, West Flower Garden and Stetson Banks, which was added in 1996. The sanctuary harbors the northernmost coral reefs in the continental United States and serve as regional reservoirs of shallow-water reef fishes and invertebrates.
NOAA National Marine Sanctuary Program seeks to increase the public
awareness of America’s marine resources and maritime heritage
by conducting scientific research, monitoring, exploration and educational
programs. Today, the sanctuary program manages 13 national marine
sanctuaries and one coral reef ecosystem reserve that together encompass
more than 150,000 square miles of America’s ocean and Great
Lakes natural and cultural resources.

innovative hospital care system singapore how different	"The primary mission of the United Hospital Fund, a 501(c)(3) organization, is to shape positive change in health care for the people of New York. Founded in 1879 to support voluntary hospitals and assist them in solving common problems, today the Fund works to advance policies and support programs that promote high-quality, patient-centered health care services that are accessible to all persons across the full spectrum of care.
The Fund undertakes research and policy analysis to improve financing and delivery of care in hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, and other care settings. It raises funds and gives grants to examine emerging issues and stimulate innovative health care programs, and it works collaboratively with civic, professional, and volunteer leaders to identify and realize opportunities for change. The Next Step in Care campaign is one of the Fund’s many initiatives to improve patient care, especially for those most vulnerable. It is taking shape in New York, but is envisioned as national in scope.
The Fund created Next Step in Care in cooperation with health care providers, including hospitals, nursing homes, and home care agencies, as well as family caregivers. How to better manage and improve transitions in care has been a focus of the Fund's Families and Health Care Project (see chronology) since it published ""Rough Crossings: Family Caregivers' Odysseys through the Health Care System"" in 1998. That report dealt with the challenges family caregivers face in patient care transitions and the poor communication and training that oten accompany hospital-to-home discharge.

when emil kurbedinov awarded front line defenders	"Organizations can designate a person/s to be responsible for monitoring new technologies and new security protocols and for updating passwords, and codes, as well as stressing vigilance. Secondly, international human rights orgs can develop relationships with trusted local advisers and meet regularly with them for their assessment of security risks.
Security tools and systems need to be more accessible and usable for human rights orgs. and defenders. Funders should provide additional resources for tech support. It is a challenge finding trustworthy IT support in foreign countries. Sometimes older, and simpler technologies such as a pad of paper and a pen as opposed to a laptop in the field are more secure.
Provide political accompaniment to increase safety. International or national NGOs can accompany local HRDs by acting as a witness and by providing public recognition of a HRDs work. This can involve having a physical presence or writing letters to American politicians or politicians in the host country. The political cost of harming local HRDs then increases if other people are watching and their profile is raised.
Participants noted a number of protection measures to pre-empt the imminent threats to HRDs or respond to threats after the fact. The list included such measures as: temporary relocation, trial observation, emergency grants and relief programs, emergency hotlines, safe houses, protective presence at HRDs offices or homes by internationals or influential nationals, and utilizing organizations that focus specifically on the protection of human rights defenders.
Training staff how to think critically about security rather than only specific tasks using a technology is important. If a HRD considers themselves not well versed in technology this methods helps them realize they know more than they think when it comes to common sense security approaches. They also realize security is an on-going process.

Between Roman and Chinese medicine, which had earlier documented treatments?	"Erica is a UK vitiligo patient, 46 years old, who has suffered vitiligo for 27 years. And she is not the only vitiligo patient, her mother also has vitiligo for decades years. As we all know that vitiligo is also a genetic skin disorder. And she has tried many treatments but there is no obvious effect.
When she searched the website and consulted the online doctor. The doctor talked with her condition and used treatments. The white patches boundary is not clear, which shows that the vitiligo is still in active stage. If she doesn’t control the expansion of vitiligo, there will show new patches on skin. From email and calls, after 4 months communication, she wants to come China to have a try for UM-D vitiligo treatments.
The experts and nurses met her, and the other day make a treatment plan for her in 15 days treatments. There are 3 steps for her. The first step is to control the active stage. The second step repigmentation. The third step is to prevent the recurrence of vitiligo.
The doctor used UM-D system treatments for vitiligo. It is a system of western treatments as well as the traditional Chinese medicine. The Chinese medicine is a type of herb medicine of specialist vitiligo therapy. The herbs can be used to bath therapy, the skin can absorb the medicine to open the follicle of skin, then the medicine is rapidly absorbed. The heat can also promote the herb soup into gas form.
Combined with the modern treatments like laser, cream and tablets, the doctor will give a system treatment. The skin turns red, then after 6 days continue treatments and medication. There are some black dots on skin that is called as melanin island. After two weeks treatments, there are some areas showed the original color.
After 15 days treatments, there already show some good effects. Then she got another 15 days treatments, she was really happy with 3 months medication came back home.
If you also want a further consultation about the treatments, and you are also suffering from vitiligo, you can consult our online doctor and send your problem to firstname.lastname@example.org and hope we can do a favor for you."	<urn:uuid:17568c24-2284-4ac8-b411-ced3bddb885a>	0.0
What makes the underground root system of the silver-leaf nightshade plant particularly challenging for agricultural control and management?	"- Belladonna atropa L.
- Atropa belladonna L.
- A. belladonna acuminata
- Nightshade family
Parts Usually Used
Leaves and flowers
Description of Plant(s) and
Atropa belladonna is a poisonous plant with reddish flowers and shining black berries. Source of various alkaloids, including atropine and scopolamine. Belladonna (beautiful lady) is an anticholinergic. This attractive plant with its thick stems or branches and leaves is somewhat similar to the tobacco plant. However, its axillary flowers, dull brown to dark purple in color, indicate that it is neither tobacco plant or ground-cherry (Chinese lantern). The ripe, shiny black berries often entice children to pick and eat them, with fatal results. Plants can have good and bad characteristics, and this is the case with belladonna. It can kill people, but it is also a life saver.
The Garden Nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.), often thought of as the Deadly Nightshade, but should not be confused with Belladonna. The Solanum nigrum is the rarer of the many nightshade species.
Antispasmodic, diuretic, narcotic, sedative
Various alkaloids, especially hyoscyamine and scopalamine
Sedative, anticholinergic (an agent that blocks parasympathetic nerve impulses) and spasmolytic effects on the gastrointestinal tract. Treats nervous congestion, suppresses the action of smooth muscles, and is helpful for kidney pains, and colitis. It is used in ophthalmology to dilate the pupils of the eyes (Atropine).
The leaves applied externally are used as a treatment and possible cure for cancer by both Western herbalists and in Chinese folk medicine.
Belladonna in powder form from leaf and flowering top of Atropa belladonna Linne or A. belladonna acuminata. It is used generally in tincture form, though the dry extract in tablet form may be used.
If eaten, vomiting should be induced immediately.
This herb is potentially fatal. Could cause death or other serious consequences. Its use is not recommended without professional medical guidance."	<urn:uuid:e9f9b162-158e-4492-b3c2-bc941005a4e3>	0.0

What are BMD test applications and who should get screened?	"Applications for New York City public schools were originally due today, Monday, December 3. However, last week, the Department of Education announced that they were extending their deadline to turn in your rankings to Friday, December 14. They went out of their way to stress it absolutely was not due to what an unmitigated disaster their much vaunted new parent portal is. It’s simply because of… reasons. (In their defense, even before the error-plagued parent portal, the DOE had a long history of extending their own deadlines. But that was usually because either not enough students had applied to the schools the DOE thought they should or, in the case of Universal Pre-K, not enough had applied, period, despite the Mayor insisting there was overwhelming demand.)
Except for the specialized high schools, and LaGuardia, all other NYC public high school choices – Screened, Arts/Audition, Ed-Opt, etc… – go on a single form. Teens can rank up to 12 choices, and an algorithm attempts to give each their top available choice. (Click here for tips on how to maximize your odds of getting in.)
When I work with families to help them navigate NYC’s insanely and needlessly complicated school system, I inevitably get the question, “What’s the best school?”
And I always answer, “The best school is the school that’s best for your child.”
I don’t fundamentally believe that a specialized high school like Stuyvesant is necessarily better than a screened school like Leon Goldstein or Townsend Harris. It depends on what you’re looking for.
Earlier this year, Mayor Bill de Blasio and School Chancellor Richard Carranza introduced a bill that would change admission to the specialized high schools from a single test, the SHSAT, to admitting the top 7 percent of students from every public middle school. (Private and Catholic school kids, you’re not welcome anymore.)
Advocates claim that grades and test scores are a much better predictor of student success than a single test.
Here is where I get confused:
NYC has over 400 public high schools and about 700 programs within those schools. Currently, easily one-third use grades and test scores (along with, sometimes, essays, interviews and portfolio review) to accept students.
How many schools use the SHSAT?
Two in Manhattan, two in the Bronx, two in Brooklyn, one in Queens, and one on Staten Island."	<urn:uuid:68d9f650-77a5-4137-86f7-22ad11624ab7>	0.0
As a prayer leader, how does making intention for regular prayers compare to Janazah prayer regarding Qibla and timing requirements?	"Do you believe in magic?
The end of the year is ripe with holiday celebrations and an overwhelming field of possibility as people are willing to believe in miracles. It is the perfect time to watch as your visions, dreams, and prayers show up in your life.
In this episode ofThe Deep Dive with Adam Roa, I discuss the power of prayer and how you can use it to create the reality you want.
Here’s what you’ll hear:
- My own personal prayer I use to set intention and ask for strength
- Why Burning Man is so transformational
- How to use prayer to manifest the life you desire
- Why Christmas is the most powerful time to set intentions
Prayer, to me, is setting a powerful intention for what you want to experience in life. It is the understanding that we are somehow connected to God or a higher power. By acknowledging this, we can use our prayers to recognize our own power and create a life of our own design.
If you have a negative reaction to hearing the word “prayer,” I understand. In this episode, I explain my own personal history growing up in church as well as how I’ve shifted my ideas around it.
If you want to use the collective magic to create a life you love, then this episode is for you.
Thank you so much for listening to this podcast. I hope it inspires you to pray more and set your intention for the new year. Please subscribe and leave a review on iTunes so that we can share this message out to more people and help them to believe in magic.
Feel free to tag me on social media and let me know what prayers or intentions you’ll be sending out to the universe this holiday season.

"Boldly patterned and brightly colored, the Wood Duck is a beautiful and distinctive bird, similar in appearance to its Chinese cousin, the Mandarin Duck. Wood Ducks are members of a group within the duck family (Anatidae) known as the “perching ducks”; while not closely related to one another, members of this family, unlike most ducks, perch and nest high in trees. This preference for elevated nest sites has the advantage of protecting young ducks from predators. However, it provides a challenge for ducklings, who leave the nest the day after hatching and are unable to fly. They use their sharp claws–another trait unusual among ducks–to climb out of the nest cavity, then jump, sometimes up to 65 feet, to the earth below! The day-old ducks are so light, however, that the fall doesn’t injure them. Hunted nearly to extinction by the end of the 19th century, legal protection and conservation efforts made the recovery of the species an early and dramatic success story in the history of American wildlife management.

island museums stockholm vs gainesville attractions	"At 1.2 nautical miles, neighbouring Delos is among the top attractions in Mykonos: In fact, the very reason that the island of the winds was discovered by the intellectuals and the artists in the 1930s. Take the ferry or your private boat to the sacred island of antiquity that is nowadays a remarkably well preserved Unesco Heritage site, to see history coming alive. Once back in Mykonos Town, venture to the archaeological and folklore museums to discover their treasures, but also set about exploring the trademark, quaint churches and chapels of Mykonos. There are 700 of them, one per local family, all with a fascinating backstory.
Praised by mastermind architects, such as Le Corbusier, the picturesque old town, is another of the must-see attractions in Mykonos. Strike a pose against the iconic, whitewashed, sugar cube, bougainvillaea clad, houses. Get lost in the maze-like streets and alleyways: They are lively, crammed with beautiful people and full of designer boutiques, jewellery stores, boho shops, cafes and bars.
Then there is Petros the Pelican, the island’s famous mascot and one of the most photogenic attractions in Mykonos: He’ll be invariably strolling on the seafront, eager to pose next to this Hollywood star or the other, or anyone who’ll ask him nicely for that matter."	<urn:uuid:0d69ba0a-3344-43be-b133-cb70a0dc4c44>	0.0

In computer science, specifically in algorithms related to pathfinding, a heuristic function is said to be admissible if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal, i.e. the cost it estimates to reach the goal is not higher than the lowest possible cost from the current point in the path.
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems.
In computer science, amortized analysis is a method for analyzing a given algorithm's complexity, or how much of a resource, especially time or memory, it takes to execute.
Any-angle path planning algorithms are a subset of pathfinding algorithms that search for a path between two points in space and allow the turns in the path to have any angle.
In computer science, anytime A*, also known as anytime repairing A* (ARA*), is a variation of the A* search algorithm.
Artificial intelligence (AI, also machine intelligence, MI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence (NI) displayed by humans and other animals.

How do tax benefits differ between hybrid arbitrage funds and municipal bonds?	"- Convertible Arbitrage: Convertible bonds combine elements of both stock and bonds in one trade. Convertible arbitrage funds build long positions of convertible bonds and then hedge the long exposure. Arbitrageurs attempt to make profits by identifying pricing discrepancies between the convertible bond and its component parts, and then continually monitoring these component parts for any change in their relationship.
- Market Neutral: MManagers construct long/short portfolios of equal weightings that eliminate market risks so to drive return purely from stock selection.
- Statistical Arbitrage: Managers use quantitative analysis to construct a market neutral portfolio. Managers, typically, build multifactor models to identify those factors that have a consistent impact on security prices.
Corporate Structure Strategies
Corporate structure strategies take advantage of significant corporate transactions like a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy. These funds attempt to generate returns by concentrating their portfolios in companies where it is more important to understand the event. The trade involves taking less market risk in favor of more company specific risk. Sub-Strategies include:
- Distressed: Distressed debt hedge funds invest in the securities of a corporation that is in bankruptcy or likely to fall into bankruptcy. The fund may short sell the company to profit on declining values or may purchase the security prior to the company announcing its reorganization plan to the bankruptcy court with the expectation that there will be a positive resolution with the company’s creditors. A manager may also employ capital structure arbitrage through buying and selling certain securities of the same company depending on the estimated outcome.
- Merger Arbitrage: This strategy generally entails buying the stock of the firm that is to be acquired and selling the stock of the firm that is to be the acquirer to capitalize on pricing spreads based on a successful completion of the announced merger.
- Event Driven: Event driven managers attempt to profit from significant market events that are nonrecurring, including merger arbitrage, but also can be in the form of spin-offs, share buy-backs, and re-organizations. Because the events are nonrecurring, financial markets typically do not digest the information associated with these transactions in a timely manner.
These funds are designed to take advantage of a wide-range of opportunities presented by various markets. Opportunistic strategies typically take directional bets in specific markets or securities. Sub-strategies include:
- Global Macro: Global macro funds take a macroeconomic investment approach on a global basis. These are top-down managers who invest opportunistically across financial markets, national borders, and commodities."	<urn:uuid:e218ffe7-9d55-45ba-b622-8ebb7a748c95>	0.0

head lice life cycle how many days until mature adults capable crawling between hosts	"Thermal treatment with warm water has become a common method for the control of sea lice. It is not completely effective to eliminate all stages of the louse, but it is estimated that it can eliminate between 75% and 100% of mobile lice.
A disadvantage is that warm water treatment can cause different consequences that affect the welfare of the fish after treatment. Although treatment with warm water is frequently used, the opposite approach - treatment with cold water – has until now not been investigated.
Rapid temperature decrease
The optimal thermal range for sea lice is unknown, however, it is known that they require temperatures of 4°C upwards to successfully complete their life cycle, and that under this temperature, mature females, eggs and larvae fail to reach the infective stage.
Despite that, little is known about how lice cope with a rapid decrease in temperature and whether this could cause mortality or reduce their ability to remain anchored to salmon.
With this background, researchers from the University of Melbourne, Australia, and the Institute of Marine Research, Norway, analysed whether temperature-specific treatment with cold water is a viable strategy as an antiparasitic method.
Fewer lice but more damage
To do this, they exposed fish infected with Lepeophtheirus salmonis to a rapid transfer from 15°C to several low temperatures of treatment for different durations and also analysed if there was any damage in the fish that was detrimental to animal welfare.
The researchers tested the effects of cold water treatment in the short term (0.5 and 10 min) and in the long term (30 and 240 min) at temperatures of -1, 1 or 5°C divided into 8 groups.
“The treatments with water at -1°C for 10 minutes and 1°C for 240 minutes reduced the loads of mobile lice but created more damage to the skin and eyes than the control treatments,” the authors said.
Industrial-scale research required
They also stated that despite having a potential as a control method, the long-term effects on the welfare of the fish and the possible evolutionary impacts on the thermal tolerances of lice should be considered together with their use.
“Our results on the antiparasitic and welfare effects require detailed research on an industrial scale, since agglomeration, pumping and passage of fish through treatment units add additional and possibly synergistic effects in the elimination of lice and pose more risks of animal welfare,” they concluded."	<urn:uuid:9855e07d-6753-4f87-880a-1585877d81b8>	0.0

How do wave power plants impact marine ecosystems and what are their effects on global pollution compared to other energy sources?	"Marine Pollution and Toxicology
Mission and Research Lines
Our oceans and aquatic resources are endangered due to pollution, mainly from human action, and sources of pollution are very diverse as well as its effects.
At the School of Marine Studies we are working mainly on establishing baseline data for the presence of chemical pollutants such as metals, oil and nutrients and associated biological effects in aquatic organisms (so called biomarkers). Marine plastics are also an area of research mainly the presence of microplastics. The data will be useful for future monitoring programs and environmental risk evaluation.
The effects of these pollutants (biomarkers) are being studied in aquatic organisms (bioindicators) to understand the mode of action of these pollutants and their negative impact to the wellbeing of these organisms and how these organisms deal with the exposure to these pollutants.
In more detail, our research focus in three main lines: 1) establishment and validation of biomarkers and bioindicator species as early warning tools for the presence of classical and emerging contaminants, in estuarine and coastal environments, 2) study the regulation and functioning of detoxification processes in fish species and to evaluate the potential of emergent contaminants to modulate them, and 3) assessment for the presence of microplastics in marine ecosystems and potential effects to the biota.
● Assessment of damage caused to the aquatic ecosystem from the sewage spillage in the Cunningham River
Sewage spillages are among the major contributors to aquatic pollution in estuaries and coastal areas. Raw human wastewater contain a mixture of contaminants, that include high concentrations of organic compounds such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous. Biodegradation of the sewage organics result in the production of inorganic nutrients (such as nitrate and ortho-phosphorous) which lead to eutrophication of the aquatic environment. Eutrophication is a known consequence of sewages discharges that seriously impacts the health and development of most organisms inhabiting any aquatic environment. Sewage also contains heavy metals and these can bio-accumulate in fish and shellfish making them unhealthy and unsafe for consumption. On December 6 2014, strong winds and floodwaters severely impacted the Central Division of Fiji causing flash floods in low lying areas of Suva."	<urn:uuid:2db0acb3-b278-4b0d-9598-d81ee36cbfcd>	0.0
Could you explain the annual food preparation scale and timing for this traditional German festival that's been running since 1974?	"WAUSAU, Fla. (AP) — Democrat Alex Sink can make a claim her eventual Republican opponent for governor won't be able to make: She ate possum on the campaign trail Saturday.
Yes, possum — the marsupial that looks sort of like a giant rat and likes to hang from its tail.
Sink was one of several statewide candidates to attend the annual Possum Festival, though only she and U.S. Rep. Adam Putnam, a Republican agriculture commissioner candidate, actually ate the tough, chewy beady-eyed mammal.
""I had possum when I was a child. I didn't eat it every week,"" said Sink, who was raised on a North Carolina farm and thus wasn't squeamish about poking her fork into the well seasoned chunks of meat. ""It was tender and tasty.""
The top Republicans running for governor, Attorney General Bill McCollum and millionaire Rick Scott, didn't attend the festival.
The possum festival is a tradition that's gone on for decades. Former state Rep. Loranne Ausley, a Democrat running for Sink's current job of chief financial officer, had a 1974 picture of her father at the festival when he ran for state Senate.
""That's the first time I came, when I was 10 years old,"" said Ausley, who like the other candidates bid on possums for the opportunity to stand on stage and hold the mammal by the tail.
The candidates shake the creatures to keep from being bitten. So it may have been the only appropriate time to yell at a woman candidate, ""Shake it baby, shake it"" — as one woman shouted while Ausley was on stage.
Sink handled her possum like a pro. When her husband, Bill McBride, ran for governor in 2002, she attended the festival.
""I had more trouble eight years ago. I had a much bigger possum. It tried to crawl up and bite me,"" Sink said.
Putnam was lucky enough to get the last serving of possum. He said he's eaten rattlesnake and Rocky Mountain oysters but this was his first taste of marsupial.
""It wasn't as greasy as I had heard. It tasted like pork pilau,"" said Putnam. ""I assumed it was fried, like all good things. I was a little bit apprehensive that it was Crock-Pot possum because everything's good fried."""	<urn:uuid:ba4387f5-390f-49c1-b919-c13b1b305b0b>	0.0
What's bigger - Boston's Museum of Fine Arts or The Tech Museum's BioDesign exhibit?	"Residential school exhibit honoured with Ontario Historical Society award 0
On behalf of city council and the community, Mayor Dave Canfield congratulated Lake of the Woods Museum on being honoured by the Ontario Historical Society with the Museum Award of Excellence in Community Programming. The award was presented in recognition of the museum's landmark exhibit 'Bakaan Nake'ii ngii-izhi-gakinoo' Amaagoomin: We Were Taught Differently'.
Museum director Lori Nelson accepted the award on behalf of museum staff, directors and exhibit committee volunteers at a presentation ceremony June 4 at the North York Civic Centre in Toronto.
At council Monday, Canfield read the Ontario Historical Society citation that accompanied the award presented for excellence in community involvement and programming.
The citation reads:
""Seeking to promote understanding of and respect for the cultures and heritage of the Lake of the Woods area, and to engage a diverse community in discovery and learning, the museum developed a groundbreaking exhibit in 2008.
With nine First Nation communities within an hour drive of the museum, the need to develop positive cross cultural awareness was identified in community strategic planning exercises. As the story of the Indian Residential School continues to affect the residents today, the museum undertook to tell the story.
Developed in partnership with NeChee Friendship Centre and the Lake of the Woods Ojibway Cultural Centre, the exhibit was an important community milestone to recognize the contribution of First Nations people, and facilitate understanding.
The museum's exhibit, 'Bakaan Nake'ii ngii-izhi-gakinoo' Amaagoomin: We Were Taught Differently' was a landmark display chronicling the residential school experience, a challenging topic.
Described as exceptional in terms of content and as stunning visually, the exhibit respectfully interpreted the difficult topic. The exhibit included outreach with a former student available to speak to classes and a series of educational programs, including the gathering of former students and a presentation to build awareness and develop a positive impact on relationships in the community.
The exhibit has been recognized by the Aboriginal Healing Foundation and the Lake of the Woods Museum was invited to bring the exhibit to the National Forgiven Summit in Ottawa in 2010. Because of the importance of the theme, the exhibit was developed to travel to other communities and venues."	<urn:uuid:3f016d77-a3f7-4f18-a799-50ff1cbc80a0>	0.0

How do doctors detect serious medical conditions like epilepsy and brain tumors in patients using brain monitoring?	"Published on December 25th, 2014 | by News Feed
Colorado Approves Over $8 Million For Medical Marijuana Research
For the first time ever, government money will be used to support medical marijuana research. It was a historic moment this week when Colorado granted more than $8 million to further study how marijuana could impact devastating health conditions like brain tumors, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, and Parkinson’s disease.
While it’s still in the early stages, the grants are evidence that we are officially moving into a new frontier for medical marijuana in the United States. The initial studies will likely throw open the floodgates and more researchers will take interest and further studies will follow closely behind.
Dr. Suzanne Sisley, a psychiatrist in Arizona, is thrilled to see government funds going to learn about the positive impacts of weed for patients. “This is the first time we’ve had government money to look at the efficacy of marijuana, not the harms of marijuana,” she explained. Sisley plans to pioneer a new study to investigate how marijuana could help veterans suffering from PTSD.
Dr. Larry Wolk, Colorado’s Chief Medical Officer, said the research is desperately needed because doctors need more specific information to better guide their patients. “There’s nowhere else in medicine where we give a patient some seeds and say, ‘Go grow this and process it and figure out how much you need,’” Wolk said. “We need research dollars we can answer more questions.”
Money for the grants will come from Colorado’s medical marijuana patient fees. The program received 57 applications from interested researchers, but the advisory board chose eight proposals to sponsor for this first round of grants. The studies will cost an estimated $7.6 million, but the board approved grants totaling $8.4 million in case researchers exceeded their budget proposals as is oftentimes the case.
There are currently 117,000 people registered in Colorado’s medical marijuana registry. Each individual must pay $15 per year to stay on the state list. By using the money collected from the registry for research, Colorado will move towards better treatment for these patients. Hopefully, this will open the door for other states to begin funding medical marijuana research as well."	<urn:uuid:aa77c9cb-5e52-43f1-bca3-3a1480c92b2d>	0.0
How do the setting methods differ between homemade cranberry curd bars and traditional apple butter when preparing them for storage?	"Once I had my lovely lemons I had to decide what to make with them! There are so many things one can do with a Meyer lemon! I decided on lemon curd first as I wanted the lemons to be the star of the recipe so I could fully appreciate their flavour.
This recipe uses 3 lemons and makes just one jar of lemon curd, So the verdict of my first Meyer lemon curd? It is very fruity and sweeter than curd made with regular lemons, its delicious! Made on a sunny day following a bitterly cold couple of weeks the taste of this lovely curd made from lemons ripened in the California sunshine sang Spring to me.
Meyer Lemon Curd (adapted from this recipe by Rachel Allen)
- Zest and juice from 3 Meyer Lemons
- 75 grams ( 3 oz) butter
- 100 grams (3.5 oz) caster sugar (I used unrefined sugar)
- 2 eggs
- 1 egg yolk
- Put the lemon zest,juice, butter and sugar into a saucepan, heat gently until the butter has melted.
- Whisk together the eggs and egg yolk.
- Pour the egg mix into the lemon and butter, whisking quickly. Keep whisking until the mixture has thickened, this took 3 minutes for me. Keep the heat low or the eggs will scramble. No matter how careful you are, in my experience little flecks of cooked egg white will still appear which is why I follow with the next step.
- Remove from the heat and push through a fine sieve with the back of a spoon into a bowl to remove any cooked egg.
- Pour into a sterilised jar.
- Once cool keep in the fridge.

Can you tell me about Nolan Ryan's pitching speed and strikeout achievements?	"Nolan Reimold has started this season like I thought he’d start the 2009 season. And the 2010 season. And the 2011 season. See a pattern? If not, I suggest answering C on all standardized tests and lowering your safety school expectations. It feels like Reimold’s been sleeping on his post-hyper’dom since Branch Rickey was just a twig. He has 25-ish homer power and 10-ish steal speed. If he gets on one, he hits 30 homers and steals 15 and is a top 25 outfielder. If he hits his head on his post-hyper-ness, you drop him. In my Nolan Reimold fantasy from January, I gave him the line of 65/24/80/.250/10. Don’t wanna trust January Grey because he’s been known to hit the bottle? ZiPS updated their projections for Reimold to 65/22/68/.260/10. So don’t trust me. But you gotta trust someone in this life. You can’t go it alone. Cause when you let people in, the world opens up to you. I think the preceding was a speech given by Patrick Dempsey in an 80’s movie that was followed by a slow clap. Anyway, here’s some more players to buy or sell this week in fantasy baseball:
Henry Rodriguez – I wish I was in one of the 90% of ESPN leagues where HanK-Rod isn’t owned, but it might be impossible because at least 75% of the ESPN ten-team leagues are one guy who owns all 10 teams with ten alias then goes into the ESPN forums and says, “I’m going to grace you with my presence and answer a few questions. If you wish to know my credentials, look at my virtual trophies on my virtual mantle on my virtual profile.”
Jake Peavy – Which Peavy are we getting? The one that’s good when he’s pitching or the one that’s not good at pitching because he’s injured? Isn’t it clear? I didn’t say, “Isn’t it the clear?” Now, now.
Lance Lynn – You know why there’s so many repeat customers in these Buys? Because people picking up players in ESPN leagues are like De Niro in Awakenings."	<urn:uuid:5f656b84-c687-419d-9c71-8dece1d32a9d>	0.0

Krishnamurti: It is a theory. The fact is one thing and the idea about the fact is another. We are not concerned with the man who supplies a conclusion derived by a specialist. We are only discussing about a man who is in conflict and is discontented with that conflict. How does he get out of it?
C: The traditional way is to explore through books. Man attains by negating and resolves by knowledge.
Krishnamurti: Proceed step by step. I am in conflict. Now, how do I resolve it? You say by knowledge. What is knowledge?
C: The realization of conflict is knowledge.
Krishnamurti: I do not have to realize it, I am in conflict. I know I am in conflict, in pain, in sorrow. What do you mean by knowledge and what do you mean by conflict? To know that I am in conflict, is that knowledge? Or do you call knowledge what I should do about that conflict? When you use the word ""knowledge"", what do you mean by that? What is the sanskrit equivalent of that word?
Krishnamurti: What does that mean? Knowledge about what? Is it the know- ledge about the cause of conflict?
C: Jnana will also apply to the nature of conflict and how it arises.
Krishnamurti: How does it come into being and how does it work? What is the nature and structure of it? To know the cause is to know the structure and the nature of pain. Do you call that knowledge?
C: Sir, jnana has been divided as that which pertains to the phenomenal world and that which refers to the non-phenomenal world.
Krishnamurti: What do you mean by conflict?
C: Conflict is duality.
Krishnamurti: We know what the word ""knowledge"" is. What do you mean by the word ""conflict""?
C: Dwandva - conflict between the two - hot and cold, pleasure and pain, happiness and sorrow.
Krishnamurti: So let us proceed: I am in conflict."	<urn:uuid:a6018536-70eb-4078-bff6-3a234d5cad90>	0.0

When was the first beer probably discovered?	"What: Tornado Alley Hash #1193
When: Saturday, May 4, 12:00
Location: Parking lot off of Topeka, just north of Murdock, behind the Grand Chapel (Which sits on Broadway across from the Artichoke).
Hash Cash: $7 (Good Tequila and Mexican Beer)
Shiggy Level: 2-3 (probably won't need a dry bag)
Hares: Anything Goes, Tina, PBR, PQuad, PPL, Dip, NBA, ASS, nnKatie, nnSarah, nnMike, nnJeremy
May the Fourth Be With Chuy.........Han Solo de Mayo.......Return of the Pacos.......whatever you want to call this hybrid which we inflicted upon Doodah on the most miserably cold May 4th in recent memory. BOYA started this torture from the backside of The Grand Chapel, and led the pack off to the east through interesting (editor's note: By ""interesting"" she means ""low socioeconomic/high African American demographic) neighborhoods and industrial warehouses. First beer near was found in a relatively warm storm sewer by 13th Street and the Ditch, which we discovered was also evidently the man cave of PBR. Here, we were amazed to find out that Mexico exports crappy beers similar to Genny Lite. We then followed trail to the north, passing McAdams Park, and through even more industrial areas. Second beer near was found by old railroad tracks by the rendering plants near 21st Street. We were delighted to find even more crappy beer, but this time it was accompanied by the wafting aroma of rotting cow carcasses. (Thank you, Cargill.) Now, here's where the trail turns exceptionally shitty. The hare led us northwest across 21st Street, over fences and along a litter-strewn creek. If the entire pack avoids contracting some horrible disease, it will be a miracle. NBA, for one, needs a tetanus booster after an encounter with a barbed wire fence. We continued to the north along the creek, past an abandoned factory from which gunshots were periodically emitted (editor's note: I want to stress that NBA is serious. Someone was shooting guns inside of an abandoned building that the hare actually intended to circle behind).
We found the on-in a little to the north of the factory with a serape-clad Darth Vader waiting for us."	<urn:uuid:9b6477c4-1a6e-4b60-8bf1-f71a032cf5e1>	0.0

As a development economist, what role did the state play in Eastern Europe's economic modernization?	"Taking noteof these points and the others made in the Uppsala declaration, we, the delegates to this Conference on Basic Sciences for Development in Eastern and Southern Africa;
Recognising the indispensable role that science and technology play in national development;
Further recognising that national development depends to a great extent on the application of endogenous science and technology knowledge;
Realising that science is a powerful intellectual resource that enables mankind to understand natural phenomena and convert them into usable resources for socio-economic development and a sustainable environment;
Convinced that science and its application are major factors of socio-economic development in the subregion and that the future of the development of any one nation in the subregion is more dependent on the generation, dissemination and effective use of scientific knowledge than any other development factor;
Acknowledging that basic sciences (biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics) are fundamental to the understanding of natural phenomena, natural and man-made disasters, discovery of new products and techniques and to the application of science and technology for socio-economic development;
Considering that the status of basic sciences, education and research capacity in the subregion is inadequate to enable science to play its full role in the national development;
Appreciating that responsibility for improving the status of the basic sciences in the subregion lies individually and collectively with the countries in the subregion;

As a theater historian studying early Black playhouses, I'm curious about how the African Grove Theatre influenced both 19th century performances and modern Black theater institutions. What were its historical achievements, and how does its legacy continue in contemporary theater organizations?	"19th International Festival of Contemporary Art 4+4 Days in Motion

Palác u Stýblů, Archa Theatre, Ponec, Studio Alta, ÚLUV, Studio Alta
4+4 Days in Motion Festival, October 10 – 18, Palace U Stýblů and other Prague locations: contemporary, modern, thought-provoking theater, dance, visual arts, and debates
Prague, August 19 – 4+4 Days in Motion: International Festival of Contemporary Art, is coming to Prague again. From the 10th to the 18th of October, Prague will be flooded by “cultural adrenalin”: a number of modern, thought-provoking, interesting and stimulating events in various artistic genres, from dance and theater, exhibitions and audiovisual projects, to debates and guided tours. The many events include a large exhibition of contemporary art, located in the currently unused Palace U Stýblů on Wenceslas Square; performances by dance and theater troupes from Austria, Belgium, Israel, Norway, and the US in the Archa Theater; art projects from Belgium and the Netherlands, taking place outside traditional theaters; premieres of new performances by local troupes; or the Czech Crash international symposium, introducing a number of performing arts organizers. Apart from the abovementioned locations, the festival will take place in the Alta Studio, Ponec Theater, the former Center for Folk Handicraft at Národní třída, and several other unconventional locations.
“The Archa Theater will present five dramatic and dance productions from abroad, offering serious reflection of contemporary topics, as well as fun and entertainment. The productions are seemingly unconnected by any common theme, story or motto. However, anyone looking for a connection will surely find it,” says program coordinator Pavel Štorek. Austrian choreographer Doris Uhlich and Belgian choreographer Jan Martens present dance performances reflecting issues in contemporary society. Israeli choreographer Hillel Kogan and Norwegian dancer/choreographer Yaniv Cohen offer a sarcastic confrontation of current Middle East reality and severe religious criticism. American director and performer Zachary Oberzan cleverly intertwines fiction and documentary theater. The Belgian company CREW and Dutch director Lotte van den Berg will present projects taking place outside traditional theaters."	<urn:uuid:f417ed60-a9b8-4335-8e2b-ef63158b2403>	0.0

What's the maximum allowed shot shell load for handicap competitions?	"Unfortunately, ice hockey will largely come to a halt in the Netherlands in the coming month. Only youth under the age of eighteen are allowed to train with restrictions and play matches within the club. The competitions will in any case come to a standstill for the next four weeks, the cabinet announced yesterday.
Today, consultations are being held between NOC * NSF and the various sports federations about the exact effect of the measures. This concerns the measure that national competitions in all sports, except football in the Eredivisie and Eerste Divisie, will be stopped. It remains to be investigated how these national measures relate to international competitive sport.
All amateur team sports for adults, where it is impossible to keep 1.5 meters distance, are prohibited from Wednesday 22.00 PM. Individual sports, such as in the gym, or team sports with a maximum of four people, are still allowed. Children up to 18 years old can train and play mutual matches with teams from their own club.
In addition to the sports canteens, the showers and changing rooms will also remain closed. Public is not welcome at competitions. By stopping amateur competitions, the cabinet hopes that the number of travel movements will be limited. Individual sports and team sports with up to four people may still continue. It seems as if only football in the Eredivisie and Eerste Divisie are exempt from the ban.

medical procedure fix hole eardrum patch repair surgical options	"Having an ACL reconstruction treatment can give you a competitive edge when it comes to sports or other physical activities. As the recovery process speeds up after the procedure, you will be able to return to training more quickly and take part in competitions if you desire. This can give you an advantage over athletes who still need to rest from their injuries.
Improved Self Esteem
The ACL injury can take its toll on your self-esteem and mental health. But with an ACL reconstruction treatment, you can begin to rebuild your confidence quickly. As your mobility and strength improve, so will your self-image and outlook.
Decrease Stress Levels
Finally, ACL reconstruction treatment can also help you to relax and reduce stress. By relieving the source of the injury, i.e. the damaged ACL ligament, you can go through life without stress, worry and fear of another ACL injury. Moreover, improving your mobility and reducing pain in the leg area can allow you to be more active and find ways to reduce stress.
An ACL reconstruction treatment can offer all of these benefits, giving you your mobility and quality of life back. So if you have suffered an ACL injury, don’t hesitate to consider an ACL reconstruction treatment today.
Things To Remember When Considering ACL Reconstruction Treatment
Some people who have undergone knee injuries or taken part in sports activities may require a surgical procedure called ACL reconstruction treatment. This treatment is often recommended by medical professionals to address issues related to knee injuries. It’s essential to consider your options before opting for this treatment, as there are certain factors you must bear in mind. Here, we’ll discuss the top few things you should remember when considering ACL reconstruction treatment.
Understanding What ACL Reconstruction Treatment Is
ACL reconstruction treatment is a surgical procedure done to fix the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which connects the thighbone to the shinbone and helps with knee stability and movement. It becomes damaged due to certain activities or a sports-related injury and may require ACL reconstruction treatment to repair or reconstruct the ligament. This surgical procedure involves removing the damaged tissue and replacing it with a substitute.
Expected Risks and Benefits of the Treatment
ACL reconstruction treatment is generally considered safe and effective. However, as with any surgery, there are risks associated with the procedure. Possible risks include infection, blood clots, and nerve or joint damage. Speaking to your doctor or surgeon before the procedure will help you understand the potential risks and any possible side effects."	<urn:uuid:9c089e43-38ef-4601-a923-c1603450b234>	0.0
How did Western powers react differently to Soviet control of Poland in 1945 compared to the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968?	"Tomorrow it will be the turn of Poland and Romania. When Germany has obtained the oil and wheat it needs, she will turn on the West. Certainly we must multiply our efforts to avoid war. But that will not be obtained unless Great Britain and France stick together, intervening in Prague for new concessions but declaring at the same time that they will safeguard the independence of Czechoslovakia. If, on the contrary, the Western Powers capitulate again they will only precipitate the war they wish to avoid."" . Perhaps discouraged by the arguments of the military and civilian members of the French government regarding their unprepared military and weak financial situation, as well as traumatised by France's bloodbath in the First World War that he was personally a witness to, Daladier ultimately let Chamberlain have his way. On his return to Paris, Daladier, who was expecting a hostile crowd, was acclaimed. He then told his aide, Alexis Léger: ""Ah, les cons!"" (Ah, the fools!).
Joseph Stalin was also upset by the results of the Munich conference. The Soviets, who had a mutual military assistance treaty with Czechoslovakia, felt betrayed by France, which also had a mutual military assistance treaty with Czechoslovakia. The British and French, however, mostly used the Soviets as a threat to dangle over the Germans. Stalin concluded that the West had actively colluded with Hitler to hand over a Central European country to the Nazis, causing concern that they might do the same to the Soviet Union in the future, allowing the partition of the USSR between the western powers and the fascist Axis. This belief led the Soviet Union to reorient its foreign policy towards a rapprochement with Germany, which eventually led to the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939.
The Czechoslovaks were greatly dismayed with the Munich settlement. With Sudetenland gone to Germany, Czecho-Slovakia (as the state was now renamed) lost its defensible border with Germany and its fortifications. Without them its independence became more nominal than real. In fact, Edvard Beneš, the President of Czechoslovakia, had the military print the march orders for his army and put the press on standby for a declaration of war."	<urn:uuid:7f6ac84d-a72c-483f-b33e-3cf63de6d788>	0.0
What happens when two different viruses infect the same cell?	"Examples include:
Macro viruses infect documents that are created using specific programs or applications that contain macros — mini-programs making it feasible to automate a set of operations so that they are performed as one act, saving the user from having to carry them out separately. Examples include:
These viruses alter the paths indicating the location of a document. When you execute a program (a file with the extension .EXE or .COM) that has been infected by this virus, then you are unknowingly running the app; the original document or program was relocated. Once your system is infected, it becomes incredibly difficult — if not impossible — to find your original files.
These viruses intercept or detach themselves otherwise — using different algorithms and encryption keys — each time they infect a system, which makes it impossible for antivirus programs to locate them using string or trademark searches. Additionally, it allows them to create a significant number of copies of these. Examples include:
- Satan Bug
These viruses infect applications or executable files (files with an .EXE or .COM expansion). When one of these programs is run, either directly or indirectly, the virus is activated and generates the damaging effects it is programmed to perform. The vast majority of current viruses belong to the category and can be categorized depending on what they do.
These viruses contain encrypted malicious code and typically replicate by decrypting spreading and themselves. When encrypted, it is difficult for antivirus software to detect them. However, as soon as they decrypt themselves in an effort to disperse, your antivirus can capture them fairly easily.
These could be considered file infector viruses, like a resident and direct action viruses. Once they get into your system, they follow other documents that already exist; Quite simply, so as to perform their own disease routines, they could either wait until a program is run (resident viruses) or act instantly by making copies of themselves (direct action viruses). Examples include:
These viruses quickly spread through a native Network Area (LAN), and sometimes throughout the internet. They generally multiply through shared resources like folders and drives; when they infect a computer, they hunt through the system to find new prey. Once they have completed infecting that computer, they proceed to another, repeating the cycle. The most dangerous network viruses are:
These viruses are like resident viruses (though they do not host themselves on your computer’s RAM), and include a finder module and a replication module."	<urn:uuid:0caa6c36-47be-4d27-a089-619ed3ebb7a5>	0.0
how many agents participated protocol division aiwolf 2021	"Before McLAUGHLIN, KALODNER and GANEY, Circuit Judges.
Appellant was convicted of being engaged in the business of accepting wagers and failing to pay the occupational tax in connection therewith, in violation of 26 U.S.C. §§ 7262, 7203.
The application for the issuance of the warrant was supported by the affidavits of Irving B. Dubow and A. Joseph Toscano, Special Agents, Intelligence Division, Internal Revenue Service. Both affidavits were executed June 28, 1961. The central problem is whether these affidavits contained sufficient evidence to establish probable cause to search appellant's residence, 18A Hamilton Place, Jersey City, New Jersey. Agent Dubow stated that on September 29, 1960, he had participated in the execution of a search warrant on the same premises, appellant's home. At that time, he stated, ""There were seized within, on the upper and lower floors, cartons containing packets of coded current lottery number slips, an adding machine, records, wagering paraphernalia and secreted currency in excess of $50,000.00.""
Agent Toscano in his affidavit said that, ""Joseph Moriarity has a criminal record dating from at least December 26, 1930 and continuing until July 1960. He was arrested six times for possession of number slips and in July 1960, was arrested by Special Agents of the Intelligence Division for conducting a gambling operation in violation of Sections 4401, 4411, 4412, and 7203, Title 26, United States Code.""

Shortly thereafter appellant, mostly driving a car affiant knew to be his, would appear and drive to the woman's car. The first time affiant observed such action, the woman handed appellant ""a white stuffed envelope"".

Treating Sleep Apnea Might Be a Win-Win for Golfers
FRIDAY, Dec. 13, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Treating their sleep apnea improved middle-aged men's golf games, according to a small new study.
Latest Sleep News
""The degree of improvement was most substantial in the better golfers who have done a superior job of managing the technical and mechanical aspects of golf,"" said study lead author Dr. Marc Benton, medical director of SleepWell Centers of New Jersey, in Madison.
Researchers looked at 12 men with an average age of 55 who had moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. The sleep disorder is characterized by frequent episodes of disrupted breathing during sleep.
Their golf performance was assessed before and after up to six months of a sleep apnea treatment called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which helps keep a person's airway open by providing a steady stream of air during sleep.
The therapy led to less daytime sleepiness and improved sleep-related quality of life. The men also had a significant 11 percent drop in their average golf handicap index, a formula used to estimate a player's skill level.
Among better golfers who had a handicap of 12 or less at the start of the study, the average handicap fell by almost 32 percent after CPAP treatment, according to the study, which was published in the Dec. 15 issue of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.
The men attributed their improved golf performance to factors such as improved concentration, endurance and decision making.
""With the cognitive enhancement afforded by successful treatment of their sleep apnea, they saw measurable improvement early and more significantly than those who were less skilled,"" Benton said in a journal news release.
The researchers said most avid golfers in the United States are men aged 40 to 70, which is a group with a high rate of sleep apnea.

What was the increase in students walking to school in Hanoi?	"Why you should have a couple massage in Hanoi
Posted by Admin
Wouldn’t it be great to spend some time relaxing and reconnecting with your significant other while enjoying a holiday in Hanoi together? A Couple Massage is a great way to do just that. There are lots of great benefits to couple massage, and a couple massage will be a perfect gift during your sweet holiday in Hanoi.
What Are the Benefits of Couples Massage?
Couples massage is a popular service at Hanoi spa, any time of year. Basically, two people are massaged in the same room, at the same time, by two different therapists. It can be a husband and wife, girlfriend and boyfriend, same-sex partners, or moms and daughters, or best friends.
What happen during the couple massage?
Couples massage is a massage that takes place in a room large enough for two massage tables. What you get in a couple massage varies greatly based on the location and focus of the therapists you select. In a Hanoi spa, couple massage typically includes access to showers, hot tubs and more. In a therapeutic setting, the focus is on the bodywork, so while the amenities might be less extravagant, the therapists are typically better trained. In a therapeutic couple massage, each therapist has an individual conversation with the massage guest to determine his or her goals for the session. At spas in Hanoi, it’s common for one massage guest to want a focus on relaxation, and the other on tending to aches and pains from athletic activities.
Benefits of a couple massage?
- It’s not a secret that massage is great for relaxation, but for a couple this is a great way to force each other to stop and take a minute together. A couple massage is a great way to free yourselves from technology and spend a relaxing, intimate moment together and make a perfect summer holiday in Hanoi.
- Marriage and family counselors will tell you that massage is a great way to release. In that moment, you are driven to let go of the past and the future and focus on the present. Couple massage allows you both to focus on each other and on the moment thus helping you reconnect.
- A Couples Massage can also help increase your feelings of affection for each other. Massage has been touted to release “feel-good” hormones that increase your feelings of intimacy.
- Couple massage is bonding experiences because you’re experiencing relaxation and bliss together."	<urn:uuid:c20e88bb-d0ad-4804-b26d-bcc16e638f3d>	0.0
why earth domes good for growing plants	"- If you are using cups it’s a good idea to plant three to four seeds per cup, and at least two per cell in the seed trays. This will insure that something comes up in each cup or cell. Don’t forget to write on each cup what you planted in it, or mark your row of cells in the seed starting tray with popsicle sticks. Do this for each type of plant you will be growing.
- Place your cups into the sheet pan, or any kind of container with a short lip on it that will hold water. Make sure your seed starting trays come with a bottom that holds water, most do. Some come with domes too but I don’t think these are necessary.
- Ok it is critically important to keep the soil moist. When you get up in the morning spray the top of the soil. Do this again in the evening or whenever you notice the surface of the soil is dry. But minimally twice a day. You must be consistent about this. After the seeds sprout and become established you can start watering from the bottom. Just pour some water into the tray and you will be watering all the cups at the same time. not to much though you don’t want to over do it. As they get bigger more water will be required.
- After the seedlings reach about three inches tall you will need to decide what plant in that cup or cell is the strongest. Using a pair of scissors cut the other seedlings off about 1/4″ above the soil or pinch them off with your finger nails. Be careful not to injure the one you want to keep. You do not want to pull the ones you are culling out, this could damage the strong plants roots.
- Now I suggest using cups right from the start because at some point if you are growing in a seed tray with small cells “lets say a Tomato plant” it’s roots are going to fill out the cell. If you don’t transplant it into a larger container like a plastic cup it will become root bound this will stunt the further growth of the plant. So I just start right out in the larger cups. By the time they are in danger of becoming root bound, it’s time to plant them outside anyway.
- How to harden off your plants. About a week before it’s time to transplant out in the garden you have to harden your plants off."	<urn:uuid:515cad2d-6a68-4900-bb71-a4dc2a60968d>	0.0

How does the Index of Urban Green Zones Allergenicity work?	"by Corine Laan (Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences) and Nanda Piersma (Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and CWI)
Parks are necessary for sustainable urban vitality. We studied the optimal availability of parks by combining open data sets with polygons and classification frameworks from urban planning literature. Both distance and population density should be considered as measures of availability when planning urban parks.
Urban green spaces may have a historic origin or be planned in cities for purposes such as maintaining biodiversity, recreation, health, climate control, amelioration of air pollution and fire protection. Parks and their facilities may be owned and maintained either by municipalities or private parties. Studies show a positive relationship between the availability of parks and the health and the wellbeing of residents.
The evaluation of urban green space has been studied from different perspectives, including city planning, user appreciation, availability and accessibility, and its function in the urban context. Many case studies from these perspectives have given city planners and municipalities tools to manage urban green spaces in their cities.
The classification and evaluation of urban green spaces has commonly accepted indicators such as availability and accessibility [R1]. Availability is defined here as a quantification of green spaces (in size and distance) without consideration of public availability or proximity to residential locations (WHO2016). Accessibility is defined as a quantification of green space availability to general or specified public groups in relation to distance, expressed in service radius, or neighbourhood green index.
With the availability of more and new data sources on green urban areas, the classification framework for urban green spaces can be further developed and detailed. Global data also enables the framework to be generalised and standardised to overcome case-specific city characteristics.
In our research, we include the park size and population density within the catchment area of the parks as an indicator of availability of urban parks. The case study of Amsterdam shows that including park size and population density provides a radically different availability score of parks.
The indicators are modelled in an interactive dashboard for the Amsterdam case.
The Amsterdam case
We use open data, provided by the Municipality of Amsterdam, and consider urban parks that are open to the public and maintained by the municipality. The parks are denoted by polygons in line with another data set from the Copernicus urban atlas data for Europe [L1]. The polygons are plotted on a 100 x 100 m grid of the city of Amsterdam."	<urn:uuid:5f2bbc28-f2ea-4996-9f02-1314d72fa1e6>	0.0

What are the key similarities and differences between ancient Roman elections and modern democratic elections in terms of citizen participation and voting rights?	"New State Voting Laws II: Protecting the Right to Vote in the Sunshine State
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law thanks Chairman Leahy and the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Human Rights for providing this opportunity to submit written testimony in advance of the important field hearing, “New State Voting Laws II: Protecting the Right to Vote in the Sunshine State.”
The Brennan Center is a nonpartisan think tank and legal advocacy organization that focuses on issues of democracy and justice. Among other things, we seek to ensure fair and accurate voting procedures and systems and to promote policies that maximize citizen enfranchisement and participation in elections. We have done extensive work on a range of issues relating to voting rights, including work to remove unnecessary barriers to voter registration; to make voting machines more secure, reliable, usable, and accessible; and to expand access to the franchise. Our work on these topics has included the publication of studies and reports; assistance to federal and state administrative and legislative bodies with responsibility over elections; and, when necessary, participation in litigation to compel states to comply with their obligations under federal law and the Constitution. We submit this testimony today in our capacity as national advocates of voting rights committed to (1) preventing efforts, such as Florida’s H.B. 1355 (alternatively “the Law”), to constrict voter registration and participation and (2) promoting improvements that will make our election system secure and accessible to all eligible Americans.
The harm caused by HB 1355 to Florida voters and community-based voter registration groups is so severe that several organizations and individuals have been forced to turn to the courts for relief. In Florida v. United States, the Brennan Center is co-counsel to the League of Women Voters of Florida (“LWVF”) and the National Council of La Raza (“NCLR”), who oppose HB 1355 because of the harm it will cause to minority voters. The Brennan Center also represents LWVF, Rock the Vote (“RTV”), and Florida Public Interest Research Group’s Education Fund (“FL PIRG”) in LWVF v. Browning, a broad challenge to the Law on the basis that its provisions violate the U.S. Constitution, the National Voter Registration Act, and the Voting Rights Act.
In this statement, the Brennan Center will detail why the discriminatory provisions of HB 1355 should be struck down."	<urn:uuid:feeeffdc-d891-4a84-b7c2-ee21741106b9>	0.0
hitler otto great leadership differences similarities	"How do I Improve Employee Performance Through Leadership?
Raising and maintaining high performance among your work force is an essential element to your business reaching its goals and objectives. Your leadership team--supervisors, managers and executives--plays a vital role in ensuring employee performance levels remain high. This is a challenge for many leaders; however, it's one that can be resolved. With effective leadership, your work force can prove to be your organization's most valuable resource.
Jot down the differences and similarities among the employees who report to you, and draft an action plan for acknowledging those differences as well as the similarities. Use this planning technique to identify goals for your employees, according to their skills, aptitude and capabilities. One of the traits of an outstanding leader is the ability to develop effective interpersonal communication skills that adapt to the varied work styles, culture and needs of employees. Management and leadership are two separate functions; however, to become a good manager, your leadership style needs to be one that acknowledges the strengths in the different personalities and skills within your work force. An effective manager works to adapt her style so it works for the entire work force, not just a select few employees. Attention to the needs of a diverse work force will encourage your employees to perform well.
Exhibit behavior that your employees will emulate; modeling behavior is likely the best way to train employees in the nuances of professionalism in the workplace. When workplace professionalism becomes standard procedure, employee performance improves because your work force is proud of the manner in which they perform duties and interact with internal and external customers. Employees are most likely to exceed job expectations when they have a sense of pride in their work. In addition, praise employees for their efforts and for a job well done. Providing regular feedback to employees is another trait that true leaders and effective managers possess.
Reward employees whose performance exceeds expectations and develop performance improvement plans for employees whose performance falls below expectations. Work together with your employees to construct plans that will enhance skill sets and prepare them for future roles within your organization. Investing the time and energy in developing your work force has significant returns. In addition to improving performance, this leadership activity demonstrates you have a vested interest in your employees. This can increase job satisfaction, which can, in turn, raise the level of job satisfaction among your work force.
Communicate with your work force on a continual basis."	<urn:uuid:25230e45-5042-45e1-8b8c-8cd92810e25c>	0.0
How fast can an E. coli bacteria swim?	"And they actually rewound the tape, and they went back to that particular line of bacteria end evolved citric eaters all over again. The kind of research that Lenski is doing is important not just to answer some of the basic questions about life but to answer some important questions about our own health. E. coli and other bacteria can make us sick, and in World War II scientists developed antibiotics to kill them and it seemed like magic bullets. The problem was that the scientists discovered very quickly that E. coli and other bacteria were becoming resistant. They were evolving resistance because the mutants that could resist a little bit were doing better than the susceptible ones and over time, it became more and more resistant. So now today scientists are trying to develop new kinds of antibiotics to overcome this resistance. You know, they are trying to find these drugs that maybe bacteria have not evolved resistance to, and they found some really promising ones. For example, they found the [that] frogs in their skin made this new totally different kind of antibiotic and first it seemed like it was indeed the magic bullet that there was no way that bacteria could evolve resistance to it, but scientists decided to run [an] experiment where they exposed E. coli to a little bit of this frog drug and then a little bit more and little bit more, and sure enough the E. coli evolved resistance to it in the lab. So even before this drug makes it to the market, we already know that we have to be very careful in dealing with the evolution of resistance.
Another thing about life is that, as Darwin argued, life forms a tree. So he envisioned species branching of from each other through natural selection, and here is actually where those E. coli that make you sick come into the story. So, most of the strains of E. coli that you will encounter are perfectly harmless and you have got probably about 30 of them inside of you right now; but there are some that are very nasty. So these are the kinds that contaminate spinach and hamburger. Their name is E. coli 0157:H7 and when they get into you, what they do is they build a needle and inject toxins into your cells in your intestines and [your] cells form these bizarre pedestals almost kind of like this throne you are making for this bacteria that is making you sick."	<urn:uuid:4f8a1953-fb11-4de2-90a5-7b342b40d17b>	0.0
how many residents michigan wind farm opt out	"“If you take their study and boil it down, you only get jobs — maybe in the thousands,” Transeth added. “And most of those gains would be offset by other jobs lost in the energy industry.”
A study by the Mackinac Center for Public Policy showed that by 2025 the mandate would cost the state 10,540 jobs, increase the average annual household electric bills by $180, and impose net costs of $2.55 billion on the state economy.
Most of the increased generation is expected to come from wind power, according to McDiarmid.
“The lion’s share of the generation will be from wind,” he said, adding that even with the production of the federal Wind Production Tax Credit, wind would still be a major source of generation. “Wind works in Michigan, with or without the production tax credit.”
According to Detroit News, wind farms faced fervent opposition in many communities in Michigan, and residents along Lake Michigan worked hard to keep companies from putting wind turbines offshore.
Wind power only made up 0.3 percent of the state’s total net electricity generation in 2010, according to the Energy Information Administration. Likewise, renewables only made up 3.7 percent of the state’s net electricity generation in 2010.
Fossil fuels still play a significant role in statewide energy production. Coal represented 54 percent of Michigan’s net electricity generation in 2011, though much of the coal is imported from Wyoming, according to the EIA. Another 30 percent of Michigan’s 2011 net electricity generation were provided by three nuclear plants.
“The Proposal 3 energy mandate will put a $12 billion burden on Michigan’s electric customers, but the real bottom line is the financial harm that Proposal 3 will inflict on each family and business,” said Megan Brown, spokesperson for the CARE for Michigan Coalition, in a statement.
Research by Public Sector Consultants, a Michigan-based research firm, shows that renewable energy generation is 67 percent more expensive than conventional energy generation.
“There is an investment cost up front, it’s not very much, and we think the voters should have a chance to decide whether or not they want to do this,” said McDiarmid.
One poll done in Michigan done by MRG for the Michigan Energy and Jobs Initiative found that 58 percent public supported it and 31 percent opposed it."	<urn:uuid:e77e893f-3bf1-4cc0-beb1-e93e691b131d>	0.0
How large is the server space in the Quicken Loans building?	"According to a post on WarrenBuffet.com, Warren Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathaway and Quicken Loans have teamed up to offer $1 billion to someone who is able to pick a ""perfect"" NCAA March Madness bracket. Registration for the Quicken Loans Billion Dollar Bracket Challenge opens up on March 3rd.
What is a perfect bracket? That means picking the correct winner of every single game in the NCAA men's college basketball tournament that begins on March 18, 2014. Berkshire Hathaway is ensuring the grand prize. I think they're good for the money, given the company has over $200 billion in net assets (assets less liabilities) as of September 2013.
The chances of winning are 1 in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808, which in words is nine quintillion, two hundred twenty three quadrillion, three hundred seventy-two trillion, thirty-six billion, eight hundred fifty four million, seven hundred seventy-five thousand, eight hundred and eight. This actually gives me some incentive to play POWERBALL, with its much better chances of winning the prize at 1 in 176 billion!
Is this really $1 billion!? Well, kind of. If you take the winnings over 40 years, you'll receive $25 million each year. Or you can take a lump sum of $500 million up front. I think I'd go with that option. Of course, if there are multiple winners, you'll split the proceeds.
Quicken Loans is also giving away $100,000 to the top 20 scoring brackets! They are capping contest entires to the first 10 million registrants, thought they may expand that at their discretion. The contest is open to legal, 21 and older residents of the U.S. and District of Columbia.

jennie wade death circumstances gettysburg civilian casualties statistics	"Discourse Does Not Match Falling Sept. 11 Death Toll
By Shankar Vedantam
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, November 22, 2001; Page A18
Nearly 2,000 names have been removed from the lists of those dead and missing in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- but it would be hard to tell that from the public discourse in America over the past two months.
Initial estimates of 6,030 casualties in New York, Washington and western Pennsylvania had dropped to 4,132 by yesterday and will probably fall further as officials sort through the confusion and remove double-counted names and other errors. Politicians, pundits and the general public, however, have often used numbers larger than the steadily declining count.
The discrepancy reflects both the resilience of statistics and a curious psychological irony: Although people are glad that there were fewer victims, powerful political, social and emotional forces conspire to make reducing the number of casualties difficult.
For once a number becomes a symbol for tragedy, reducing it runs the risk of seeming callous and implying the tragedy was not as bad as previously thought, say statisticians and sociologists who study how numbers are used.
""Once a number gets into circulation, it takes on a life of its own,"" said Joel Best, author of ""Damned Lies and Statistics."" ""People become invested in it, they feel they need to defend it, criticism of the number becomes a criticism of larger principles.""
The toll of missing and dead has fluctuated because of confusion over casualties in New York. The plane crashes in Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon were known early on to have caused 44 and 189 casualties, and those figures have not changed. But an accurate count has been far more difficult at the World Trade Center.
Officials in Manhattan were inundated with missing-person reports -- often of the same person and sometimes with different spellings. Dewi Williams, a spokesman for the British consulate, said yesterday that about 26,000 phone calls to British officials triggered initial estimates of 200 to 300 dead and missing Britons. The current number is 63.
On Monday, when official reports were putting the number of victims at 4,184, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said, ""It is now 69 days since September 11th, when coldblooded terrorists turned civilian airliners into flying bombs and used them to kill 5,000 innocent people.""

What characteristics defined Sergeant Baker as a soldier?	"|Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force (CMSAF)|
Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force (CMSAF) is the highest enlisted rank in the UNSC Air Force, and is equal in pay-grade to Chief Master Sergeant and Command Chief Master Sergeant, and is above Senior Master Sergeant. The pay grade for Chief Master Sergeant is E-9, and is the highest enlisted rank in the UNSCAF.
The Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force is selected by the Air Force Chief of Staff. The CMSAF is the senior enlisted member in the Air Force, with a 3-star protocol equivalency. The CMSAF represents entire Air Force enlisted force, and speaks on behalf of the enlisted members of the service to Air Force and UNSCDF senior leadership.
The CMSAF is one of four Service Senior Enlisted Leaders. Each Service has a rank for the senior enlisted member of that Military Service. Only one Soldier, Marine, Sailor, or Airman can hold this rank at any one time. The other three are: Sergeant Major of the Army (SMA), Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps (SgtMajMajCor), and Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy (MCPON).

As someone studying military medical history, I'm curious about how U.S. Army nurses served during WWII and how this led to changes in the Air Force Medical Service structure. What were their combat roles, and how did this influence the later organization of the Air Force Nurse Corps?	"11, 2017) - Met with skepticism before World War II about whether African Americans could master the skills of flying in combat, the Tuskegee Airmen went on to become an acclaimed fighting force. And the Hoosier parents of two of our guests were among the most distinguished members of the all-black Army air squadron during an era when the military was segregated.
As Hoosier History Live salutes Black History Month, we explore Indiana connections with the squadron, which drew its name from the Tuskegee Army Air Field in Alabama. Many of the men who were part of what is known as the ""Tuskegee Airmen Experience"" were not pilots and did not aspire to be. Many fought in the war as ground crewmen or in other non-flying support roles. To share insights about the Tuskegee Airmen, who were collectively recognized (both flight and non-flight personnel) in 2007 with a Congressional Gold Medal, Nelson is joined in studio by:
Some of the Tuskegee Airmen received training at Freeman Field (now Freeman Municipal Airport) in Seymour. In the spring of 1945, it became the setting for the ""Freeman Field Mutiny,"" a non-violent civil rights protest. More than 100 officers were arrested for refusing to sign an order that they would not attend the whites-only officers club.
In another piece of Hoosier African-American history, Tuskegee Airmen of the 618th and 619th Bomb Squadrons of the 477th Bomb Group trained at Atterbury Army Air Field, near Columbus Indiana.
Some other Indiana connections, courtesy of our guest Reginald DuValle:
At the outset of the war, the U.S. Army Air Corps set up College Training Detachments (CTDs) because there weren't enough aspiring pilots with college degrees to meet the need. Theodore Randall, an Indianapolis native, served as commander of the CTD at Tuskegee.
Tuskegee pilots ended up fighting in aerial combat over Europe and North Africa. Many were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.
In Indiana, the Tuskegee Airmen were honored at a ceremony last October during which a stretch of I-65 from Seymour (not far from the site of the Freeman Field Mutiny) to the Bartholomew/Johnson County line was named the Tuskegee Airmen Highway."	<urn:uuid:5db1f5ca-5a83-4f70-aec1-c8cfc1aae16d>	0.0
As someone studying Pacific naval operations, I'm particularly interested in the battle stars awarded to Nassau and Princeton - how did their combat decorations compare during their respective service periods?	"Before he was wounded, his squad's machine gunners Mike Massaconi and Clancy Lyall were low on ammo. As Webster was their ammo bearer, Clancy and Mike yelled at him to bring more ammo, but Webster did not move out of his foxhole. After numerous shouts from both men, Clancy took out a grenade and threw it right in Webster's foxhole. The pin on the grenade was still in place, unbeknownst to Webster. Webster quickly fled up the dike to get ammo.
While recuperating back in England, Webster missed the Battle of the Bulge fighting and rejoined his unit in February, 1945 after being formally released by the hospital. What he found was a decimated regiment, exhausted, weary and bitter over his absence and the loss of friends. Soon thereafter, Easy Company discovered their first concentration camp, witnessing firsthand the walking and also the unburied dead of the Landsberg Concentration Camp.
Author Stephen Ambrose had this to say about Webster: ""He had long ago made it a rule of his Army life never to do anything voluntarily. He was an intellectual, as much an observer and chronicler of the phenomenon of soldiering as a practitioner. He was almost the only original Toccoa man who never became an NCO. Various officers wanted to make him a squad leader, but he refused. He was there to do his duty, and he did it - he never let a buddy down in combat, in France, Holland, or Germany - but he never volunteered for anything and he spurned promotion"".
Awards and decorations
His list of authorized medals and decorations are:
- Bronze Star
- Purple Heart with one oak leaf cluster
- Good Conduct Medal
- European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with Arrowhead and 4 service stars
- World War II Victory Medal
- Army of Occupation Medal
- Presidential Unit Citation with one Oak Leaf Cluster
- Combat Infantryman Badge
- Parachutist Badge with 2 jump stars
He was the last of the surviving Toccoa veterans who had fought in Normandy to be sent home. He returned to work as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Daily News and found great enjoyment sailing, studying oceanography and sea life. During those years he worked on his wartime memoirs and occasionally approached magazines with an article but deferred any wholesale treatment of the war."	<urn:uuid:963aaab7-9acc-4780-ba05-eaa680432b7e>	0.0
What are some of the key things that theaters should consider when making their shows more welcoming for people with special needs?	"Events are the times that people come together and they are meant to be happy times because one should ensure that they can benefit from all of them. There are so many ways that the people apply so that the event can be an event and that is why we have to ensure that we pull off some great tips. One of them that the people hold in such high esteem is the barbeque. When doing the ribs on the grill, the event is able to have a great aroma and the attendees are able to indulge into some great tasting food. The appearance of the food on the grill as well as the appearance is boosted using the basting sauce and that is what people should get. There are so many of them in the market and they are brought by the many manufacturers interested in making sure that the people benefit so much. The choice of the basting sauce for the client should be a choice that they can be proud of and that is why they have to consider some things when choosing.
One has to look at the flavor as the first thing. Flavor is everything when the people can be able to get the tastes that they have and that is what they should ensure. The choice of the basting sauce most of the time is the one that can offer them with the needs that they have. They have to check first with the preferences that they have as well to ensure that they go for an amazing choice. The variety of the flavors have been availed so that the different people can get accommodated.
The client has to make sure that they check the quality of the paste. Most of the products that come in the market have to meet some standards and that is what the people should ensure the choice of the client most of the time has to be a basting sauce that has been brought in the market. The client has to ensure that there is a diamond mark of quality since it shows the standards that they have. The client has to ensure that the basting sauce will benefit them the most and that is why the quality is necessary.
The client has to ensure that they look at the pricing too. There are so many varieties and they pricing vary according to the manufacturer. They also can change the dealer so that they can be able to benefit. They have to ensure that they compare several so that the price they go for will be the lowest and that way they will benefit the most."	<urn:uuid:f00c9703-3942-4dc3-9984-7d7a4c6ec1fd>	0.0

plutonium waste treatment decontamination effectiveness	"In many cases, this may provide a desirable factor of safety. In other cases, it may lead to the expensive over-engineering of a system or unwarranted increases in operational costs. Laboratory research has also determined that air temperature, relative humidity, flow rate, lamp design, and ballast engineering have significant impacts on the effectiveness of these systems. Furthermore, the location of the decontamination UV array is of crucial importance because of the potential for air eddies and corners of ducting to allow some of the flow to pass through untreated. HVAC systems designers and control contractors will have to factor these components into their plans, and base decontamination systems designs on tested parameters in order to ensure maximum effectiveness. Because of the constant airflow in modern ventilation systems, making this work in an HVAC system requires coordination between dampers (in order to slow the passage of the air enough to allow all particles to receive a sanitizing ray of UV light) and the UV light itself. While this kind of attention to detail might not be necessary in installations primarily concerned with improving the day-to-day healthiness of air, in order to control the spread of a deadly bio-terrorist pathogen (such as anthrax or smallpox) the design of a UVGI system is of critical importance.
The effectiveness of UV light as a germicidal agent has resulted in two other techniques for decontamination. Pulsed UV (PUV) involves pulsing UV lamps at high power at regular intervals. This technology is being increasingly applied for air and surface sterilization and decontamination due to the powerful use of advanced UV light lamps and efficient energy consumption. This is a procedure, which appears to have certain advantages of very high inactivation rates for most known microorganisms. PUV is also effective on very hazardous and ""hard-to-break"" toxic organic compounds and odors from water, air, or surfaces without producing ozone at a very high speed. These systems use mercury-free flash lamps that emit pulses at such high energy that the cells are actually physically destroyed. To have this mechanism work, the rate of the energy deposition into a microorganism (the fluency rate) must be higher than its rate of cooling to a surrounding media. In this case, a microorganism undergoes momentous overheating and disintegration."	<urn:uuid:163803b2-d1ea-490c-bec7-0456a1eb729d>	0.0

How long could the powered hip exoskeleton run between charges?	"At some point in your nerdy childhood, you surely imagined what it would be like to build an entire exoskeleton out of Lego. How much fun would that be to have a Lego creation you could actually climb inside and drive around?! Well, award-winning Lego enthusiast Diavo Voltaggio is well on his way to that bright future.
As far as we know, Voltaggio isn't building a badass Lego mech suit, but we can't stop think thinking about how rad it would be if he did. The Lego enthusiast won well deserved accolades for his Mark VI Mindstorms robotic arm and hand at BrickFair Virginia last week.
The cyborg attachment includes four independently motorized fingers powered by touch sensors as well as a blue light bar and five blue LEDs for looks. The lights also came in handy when the convention switched into ""World of Lights"" mode, shutting down all of the convention center lights so that the brick creations could light up. The arm also includes a smartphone mount for fun and convenience.
Now, Lego isn't necessarily the most durable material for a battle-ready mech suit. But if you did want to build one, this cyborg arm is a great starting point. If you've got a whole bunch of bricks lying around, you might as well start building an exoskeleton for the big BrickFair in November. After all, a full Lego mech suit might be the only thing that can save your from the imminent doom of a Lego Firewalk. [Pocket Lint]

cryptocurrency key seed generation security audits implementation requirements	"The RC14001 Technical Specification is more comprehensive than ISO 14001, but the certification process grants both an ISO 14001 registration certificate and an RC14001 certificate, if the management system meets all requirements. As a result, certification to the RC 14001 Technical Specification fully meets customer requirements for ISO 14001 registration.
Every ACC member company must complete either RCMS or RC 14001 certification audits for a specific number of sites. Headquarters plus a fraction of the plant sites must be certified.
How RC14001 and ISO 14001 Audits Differ
RC14001 audits are similar to ISO 14001 audits, but with a few key distinctions. In RC14001, additional personnel are involved from logistics, distribution, product stewardship, process safety, and security. Safety, Health and Environmental (SH&E) professionals will be involved in the plant and headquarters sites.
Interaction and communication with community partners, local governments and agencies represents a larger part of RC14001. Companies are focused on stakeholder concerns.
Because of the additional requirements, auditors need additional time to assess the RC14001 management system relative to the typical time requirements for an ISO 14001 audit.
Who Should Seek RCMS® and RC14001
RCMS is limited to ACC members only. Businesses in the chemical, petroleum, and allied industries can use RC14001 to implement a single environmental, health and safety management system that meets best practices, encourages stronger performance and provides a route to business success. Responsible Care® is a valuable tool to demonstrate to customers and stakeholders that a company is committed to corporate and social responsibility.
By participating in Responsible Care®, ACC members agree to:
- Measure and publicly report performance
- Implement the Responsible Care Security Code
- Obtain independent certification for a professional management system
- Apply the modern Responsible Care Management System to achieve and verify results
Benefits of an Effective Responsible Care Management System
Achieving Responsible Care certification helps companies improve their performance and better succeed in business.
Through the Responsible Care Management System, companies can provide alignment and compatibility with other management systems. RCMS provides a method to integrate safety, environmental, security and health performance thereby improving efficiencies of the processes and systems that may be currently operating independently.
The certification process encourages teamwork, by revealing how many management groups interact, including environmental, health, and safety, community relations, shipping, security, regulatory compliance and purchasing."	<urn:uuid:7b6b1dee-c212-43fb-a605-6e2fee7099ec>	0.0
My family has German roots and I'd like to know how language use has changed in Lutheran churches - what's the difference between St. James Lutheran's historical language practices and modern Lutheran churches like the Missouri Synod?	"Three graduates of Seminex, the St. Louis theological seminary run by moderates who split from the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, will become pastors in United Methodist churches. Such a move would have been unthinkable in the parent group, which has few ecumenical ties and only limited dealings with fellow Lutheran bodies.
""This is the first official opportunity for our Lutheran confessional witness to be welcomed beyond the borders of Lutheranism,"" declared Seminex placement director, the Rev. Karl Reko, in announcing the appointment of the three graduates to United Methodist churches in New York state.
Stephen Rosendahl, one of the three graduates, acknowledged that at first he had some questions about serving a Methodist congregation but ultimately, he said, ""I decided I'm a Christian first and a Lutheran second.""
In a separate development, the LC-MS formally expelled the Rev. Dr. Alfred P. Klaysler, widely known religious journalist and former editor of LC-MS publications. He refused to give up membership in the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, the body formed by moderates who disagreed with the conservative LC-MS interpretation of the Bible.
The Unification Church and an evangelical Protestant television syndicate are partners in a challenge to a new North Carolina law requiring licensing and financial reporting by groups that solicit money from nonmembers.
The challenge originally was filed by the PTL (Praise The Lord) television network, based in Charlotte. The Unification Church subsequently secured court permission to join the suit.
Vice President of PTL Robert Manzano complained that PTL was not confortable in the alliance and charged that court action permitting the Unification Church to join the suit ""only muddies the waters"" and could affect the credibility of PTL's suit.

What breakthrough features does the HX90N tooling prepreg material offer in terms of surface quality and thermal properties?	"US Aluminum Castings has an engineering department with over 60+ years of combined tooling design experience. By pairing highly experienced foundry designers with recent graduate level engineers, our design team is able to provide tried and true design methodology backed by cutting edge solidification modeling, CAD analysis, and an A9100D certified tooling design and development process.
We work hard to develop high quality, cost efficient casting tooling and machining fixtures consistent with the needs of our customers.
Our Niche: Heavy Truck, Aerospace, and Defense Castings.
During our initial quoting of a new project, we look for the follow design criteria:
- A dimensioned 2D print and 3D model showing casting/machining tolerance requirements.
- Aluminum casting alloy or required material properties.
- Anticipated annual production rates.
- Anticipated order schedules/quantity.
- Any critical dimensions or special characteristics related to the casting or machined part.
- Casting Class and Grade
- Surface finish requirements
- Allowable draft angles
With this information, our design team will work along with the customer to help determine a suitable casting process and tooling plan. It is our goal to provide our clients with quality castings delivered reliably, within budget.
When designing a part as a casting, some standard design considerations are:
- Is there sufficient draft? Is it placed suitably in relation to the parting line?
- If required, where are the tooling points located? Are they on or near the parting line?
- Is there ample machining stock in appropriate locations?
- Are there any unnecessarily thick or thin wall sections?
- Are fillets and radii adequate/inline with tolerance expectations?
- Can the number of cores be reduced/eliminated while maintaining functionality?
With an in-house pattern shop and full service machine shop, US Aluminum Castings is able to provide our clients with high quality tooling at an affordable price. We are able to design tooling to fit all of our production lines, from cast iron permanent molds to urethane sand patterns and multi-material machining fixtures. We take great pride in our ability to not only design our tooling, but to also build it to the highest standards. These in-house capabilities also enable us to maintenance and repair all of our customer owned tooling whenever the need may arise.

what natural winemaking methods used modern winery burgenland austria	"– Winemaking in Austria was long a male area but the trade is seeing a sluggish but regular change of face with extra women taking lead roles within the industry.
Thus personal contact allowed Jewish women artists to be admitted to the airtight artwork associations. The most important at the Secession have been Hermine Ostersetzer (1874–1909), the spouse of the publisher and art dealer Hugo Heller (1870–1923), and Ilse Twardowski-Conrat, the sister of Erika Tietze-Conrat (1883–1958), a widely known artwork historian.
Thus for Austria as a whole, the proportion of the aged population will grow from 18.6% in 2017 to 28.1% by 2060. By then, Carinthia (34%) as well as Burgenland (33%) are expected to stay the “oldest” areas whereas the western a part of Austria in addition to Vienna will still rank as the “youngest” areas. The average age of Austria’s inhabitants will significantly improve over the subsequent decades from forty two.5 to 47.0 years . According to the assumptions for fertility, mortality and migration by Statistics Austria, the entire population of Austria will increase to 9.43 million folks (+9%) until 2030. In 2015, the reference year for the brand new inhabitants projection, Austria had a population of 8.sixty three million.

Can ACFM and Hall probe field measurements both work through surfaces without direct contact?	"What's a Bar Code?
Hand held laser scanners are the most expensive of the scanning devices, but offer the largest depth of field making them an appropriate choice for a wide variety of non-contact applications.
How Lasers Work Hand held laser scanners use a laser diode to create a scan line by projecting a beam of energy off a rotating prism or oscillating mirror. The beam is reflected out the scanner window onto the bar code, where light energy from the bars and spaces is reflected back to the scanner, collected on a mirror, focused, and read by a photodetector. The resulting signal may then be read using decoding software within the scanner or at the terminal or host.
Lasers have their advantages over CCDs. They're not bar code width-dependent. Depth of field is significantly greater and lasers can work in direct sunlight because the amount of reflected light is much greater and much more defined; the signal return is in a defined pathway. Also, lasers don't have to touch the bar code. There's a visible scan line which allows for larger bar code reading.
Laser technology is an excellent choice for non-contact applications, and the only choice for applications that require reading distances of a foot (.3048m) or more. Available in both hand held and fixed mount form, lasers are easy to use, read a wide variety of code densities, and allow for easy reading of bar codes from irregular surfaces or throughglass. Because they are non-contact devices, lasers will not wear out repeatedly scanned labels.
Hand-held lasers can scan media in hard to reach places, on curved surfaces, or through plastic. They also add longer label life to your application.
The light generating medium in first-generation moving beam laser installation was a Helium-Neon laser tube. In the past few years semiconductors capable of producing laser light have been incorporated in most laser products..
Laser diodes, both visible and infrared, are in a package about the size of an LED. Compared to the gas tube used to create Helium Neon lasers, the laser diode is much smaller, requires significantly less power, and is more durable. This makes these hand-held devices suitable for portable data collection terminals or for fixed-station decoders that are powered from the terminal.
Fixed-mount lasers allow both hands to be free for use in handling product or paper. In addition, self-triggering mechanisms allow these lasers to operate without human intervention."	<urn:uuid:ba33d69a-29f9-4e77-a4da-12934782fe61>	0.0
I'm curious about how Islamic scholars dealt with religious texts - what are the two main approaches they used to interpret difficult passages, and how did they decide who could use which method?	"In other words, coming out of Khorasan, an area that now encompasses Afghanistan, will come an army that includes the Mahdi, the Islamic savior of the world. The parent organization of ISIS was al Qaeda, which, of course, was headquartered in Afghanistan at the time of the 9/11 attacks.
Last year, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi named himself caliph, which means that in his own mind and in the eyes of his followers he is not only the leader of ISIS but the overall leader of Muslims everywhere.
These beliefs may seem like a crazy delusion to most of us, but it’s important to understand that they are theological in nature, and this theology is rooted in ultra-fundamentalist Islam.
ISIS sees itself as the vanguard army that is bringing back true Islam to the world. This project is of such cosmic importance that they will break any number of eggs to make this omelet, which accounts for the’ir murderous campaign against every ethnic group, religious group and nationality that they perceive as standing in their way. ISIS recruits also believe that we are in the end times, and they are best understood as members of an Islamist apocalyptic death cult.
IS THERE ANY ROOM FOR DEBATE OR DIALOGUE?
Getting back to the literary festival of 2014. While there, I moderated two sessions, ‘Reading the Soul’ and ‘Writing the Self.’ The former was about how religious texts have their own literary tradition on the notebook of humankind; the latter was about the relative truth of memoir – in this case as told by two very different Bangladeshi-origin female authors, both of them Muslims.
It was difficult to avoid religion in both sessions, especially as one of the authors had chosen to read a passage from her book recounting an incident passed down from her grandmother in which she was humiliated by her Hindu teacher at school because he had forgotten to return her school notebook. The story culminated in the teacher ‘purifying’ his house by spreading cow dung on every surface. I was skeptical of her grandmother’s recollections – after all, as a student, how could she know he did this at his home without her having seen it? And, I wondered aloud why she had chosen to read that passage at the venue when her book had many more interesting passages."	<urn:uuid:4c3ea52f-8ef7-4bd6-8782-664c2c69e15b>	0.0

The significance of having the physical presence of St. Nicholas within the historical and geographic context of the 9/11 Memorial of this nation’s history is tremendous. When finished, St. Nicholas will be a visible and inspiring tribute to not only the victims of the atrocity that was perpetrated on 9/11, but also a shining spotlight on the Greek Orthodox Faith and Hellenism, and our core values of love, respect, peace, healing, and forgiveness.
We are pleased to announce that to date, we have raised almost half of the amount needed in pledges and now, we would like to invite your – and by this I mean everyone’s – participation to support the Rebuild St. Nicholas Campaign. As children of immigrants such as the ones who built the original St. Nicholas and now the Founders of Faith, we believe that we have been truly blessed with success in this great country and it is time that we use our considerable resources to help our Church and community offer our enduring values at a time of such upheaval and insecurity in our nation and our world. The new St. Nicholas Church will be a National Shrine from which will emanate the ideals of Hellenism and Greek Orthodox Christian values that were passed down to us for our Nation and all of the world to see. This is a unique opportunity of tremendous historical significance to show the world who we are as Greek Orthodox Christians and leave something that will make future generations of our community very proud. Therefore it is of the utmost importance for every Greek Orthodox Christian to support this endeavor in whatever way they can

What are the most common symptoms someone gets when infected with Legionnaires disease, and which groups of people are at higher risk of getting it?	"- Salmonellosis in children - what to do?
Salmonellosis - a fairly common infection that is usually transmitted through food.Her pathogens can live in water, soil, animal feces, raw meats, eggs.Salmonellosis in children is not uncommon.
In the last two decades have seen an increased incidence of typhoid salmonellosis in Europe and North America.Perhaps this is partly due to the fact that people are increasingly traveling to and including, visit third world countries where the risk of Salmonella contamination is particularly high.In countries such as typhoid fever is common - a very dangerous disease, caused by a salmonella.For example, in India and Pakistan typhoid fever ill people from 40-50 million - is much greater than in developed countries.Worldwide recorded annually from 16 to 33 million cases of typhoid fever, and 500-600 thousand people a year die from the disease.
Not everyone in the body which gets salmonella, ill with salmonellosis.However, children, particularly
most common in children as in adults, there are gastrointestinal form of salmonellosis.Carriers of the bacteria causing the disease, can be chicken, beef, and some reptiles.Typhoid Salmonella - causative agent of typhoid fever, is carried exclusively by people and is usually transmitted through the feces of an infected person.
Symptoms of salmonellosis in children
have, in general, healthy children gastrointestinal form of salmonellosis usually occurs in mild and moderate forms.The incubation period for salmonellosis in children lasts 12 to 72 hours, that is, as time passes since entering the bacteria into the body before the first symptoms of the disease.Symptoms of the disease include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, headache.Typically, the temperature is reduced by no more than three days, while the other symptoms may persist for up to seven days.Salmonellosis in children under one year sometimes be severe, and causes severe symptoms that persist for a longer time.
When the disease typhoid fever, the first symptoms are usually the same as in the gastro-intestinal salmonellosis.But in the second week in children increased liver and spleen, and the pinkish appears characteristic skin rash.Fever and other symptoms of the disease when the disease persists for ten days or more."	<urn:uuid:9e9af1ce-c3e8-4735-8be4-6585240196d9>	0.0
Can my family join me if I get a Greek Golden Visa?	"by Expatguru - 01/29/2010
""This article describes some important information for those planning to bring their families to the kingdom""
Okay, so you have been offered a lucrative job in Saudi Arabia and have signed the contract. You have been promised that you would be able to bring your family after the mandatory probation period. You have submitted all required documents for stamping of your visa and are all set to go. Now, all you need is a visa and a ticket and once you land in the kingdom, after the probationary period you can start processing the papers for your family to join you, right? Well, not always.
Expats planning to relocate to Saudi Arabia on family status must be aware that there is something called a ""visa profession"". Do not get this confused with the profession which you have been hired for. Let me explain this in detail. Every organization in the kingdom will be allotted a certain number of visas at the beginning of each Hijri year. Prior to this, the organization must have submitted their requests to the Ministry of Labor in the kingdom. The Government carefully evaluates each request and releases a certain number of visas in each category. It doesn’t always happen that the organization would get the same quantity and category of visas applied for. So, they end up with taking whatever is given to them and bring people in whichever visa is available.
So, you might, in reality, be an engineer working in a reputed firm, but the visa you have arrived may not actually mention your profession as an engineer. The problem is that if the profession mentioned in your visa is that of a non-supervisory category, for instance, labor, mason, carpenter, etc., you would not be eligible to bring your family because of restrictions by the Government. As a policy, the Saudi Government wants to make sure that only those who can support their families would be issued a family visa. Changing one's visa profession after arriving in Saudi Arabia is not an easy task.
So, how do you ensure that your visa is actually the profession for which you have been hired? Well, to be safe, make this as one of the conditions before signing the contract that you need a supervisory category visa in case the appropriate visa is not available with your employer. When your visa comes stamped from the Saudi Embassy / Consulate, check the passport and get someone who can read Arabic translate the profession mentioned in the visa."	<urn:uuid:6aca8efa-bc18-4066-93b6-1f9fb8d2941a>	0.0
I'm curious about different ways that humans used animals for transportation in the past - what are some examples of how animals were used for moving people and goods?	"Some companies have already banned animal testing with their beauty products, and are trying to put an end to all of it.
The beauty company LUSH. For more than 30 years, they have been fighting against animal testing. It’s Cruel and ineffective, and despite some changes in the last four decades, there’s still so much more to be done, says the LUSH company. This company advertises for animal testing awareness on all of their products like bags, packaging, and even on the receipts. In Europe, India, Israel, and Norway animal testing for cosmetics are banned. One good thing that has come out of animal testing, is animal testing for medical purposes. Due to animals and people being able to get the same illnesses some research is very beneficial to humankind. All medical research is planned out, and experts only use animal experimentation for urgent purposes. Scientists do try to keep the welfare of the animal in mind as they are experimenting, which means a small number of an applicable species can be used.
Veterinarians are an essential part of the medical research team. The veterinarians make sure that the animal is being treated humanely and they also provide the medical/surgical support. The animals are protected through laws, regulations, and policies to provide humane treatment to all of the animals in the research. The Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Animal Welfare Act give details about day-to-day animal care. Some good examples of animal testing for medical research would be on dogs to discover insulin for people with diabetes, monkeys for the polio vaccine, pigs for skin grafts for burn victims, and mice for a rabies vaccine.
Many people are against animal testing for beauty-products but, of course, we have people that would love to say that it is okay. Animals are a great way to further research on humans. This makes sense but, not all animals have the genetic makeup of a human. That means that these innocent animals that are not similar to humans were just inhumanely slaughtered all in the name of research. If scientists would like to discover more about humans, they could find some humans that have no problem being tested on. Some people believe that animal testing is cheaper than others.
This is also false. The USA spends $16 million dollars annually for animal testing at the taxpayer’s dollar."	<urn:uuid:6728df3f-8de9-487d-84c8-04b8d536e7c1>	0.0

Nickname: The King of the Missions
Location: 4050 Mission Avenue, San Luis Rey, CA 92068
Named in honor of France’s King Louis IX, a Spanish ally, the mission benefited from a local Indian population that was already familiar with the Spanish settlers from the long-established mission communities at San Diego and San Juan Capistrano. It quickly became one of the largest and most prosperous in the mission system, and operated two asistencias, or sub-missions.
The beautiful church façade is a perfect example of late mission architecture. It is unusual in that it was designed with a single bell tower.
The mission complex also featured sunken gardens, a laundry, and a charcoal-filtered spring.
In 1893, a Franciscan novitiate was established on the site; it later became San Luis Rey College. Today it is a retreat and conference center.
1798 – Mission founded.
1816 – asistencia (sub-mission) at San Antonio de Pala established.
1823 – asistencia (sub-mission) at Las Flores established.
1834 – Mission secularized.
1865 – Returned to Catholic Church.
1893 – Franciscan novitiate established; it later became San Luis Rey College.

After wanting a dog for over 20years and loving Basenji's for almost as long I finally became a very proud Basenji mummy a few months ago. I'm form the UK and currently spending some time in the Netherlands, I looked into finally getting my first dog before christmas, then a few weeks into the new year i decided i'd definately get one this year, I looked online that night and found my girl! (I think we were meant to be!) she was last of a litter and the people who were going to take her just never showed up, so I went to meet her, fell in love instantly and she came home with me within the week.
Now i knew that Basenji ownership wasn't going to be easy (the other breed i like is bull terrier so i clearly have problems here…) and we've had some moments...but words cannot express my love for this little one. I can't remember my life without her!
She's turning 5 months soon and is more than I could ever hope for. I'm at the barn all day with the horses and she's settled so well to the barn life, I was so worried she'd run off but she's such a good girl, life is often hectic and always changing, but i'm her constant so she's always keeping an eye on me and knows to come back to me if she's unsure of anything. She now has off lead walks and is such a good gal, when new people or dogs appear she stops, comes to me and waits for the new people/dogs to come to her. then plays like a maniac!

Extending over thousands of hectares of waterfront land,Peterhof parks are characterized by their magical beauty. The lower park is one of the largest parks in the baroque style in the world. Tourists are enchanted by the magical ambience of these places. Large flower beds are arranged symmetrically at the base of the Great Cascade. They are decorated with two basins with in the center, a large marble cup from which flows a stream of water. In the driveway of Marly, the longest avenue of the park, there is a bronze statue of Peter 1st the Great, as well as Adam and Eve fountains decorated with marble sculptures.
The fountains of Peterhof
Renowned for its unique fountains in the world, Peterhof or the ” Capital of Fountains ” attracts thousands of tourists who come to look at the fabulous fountains. These fountains operate daily from May until October. They are officially open to the public on the last day of May, during a lively festival animated by several artistic performances.
Being among the most powerful water jets inPeterhof, Samson reaches more than 20m in height. At the time, the caretaker Paul Sualem built a special pipe fed by a pond on the heights of Babigon to ensure the power of the jet. In 1799, Tsar Paul I ordered to replace the lead sculptures distorted with time by other bronze statues quite identical.
The Fountain of the Pyramid
Considered the most picturesque fountain of Peterhof, the Pyramid attracts a large number of visitors. Designed by Michetti, it was inspired by the famous Obelisk Fountain at Versailles. Pyramid has more than 500 water jets of different heights while the Obelisk Fountain has half of these water jets.

What makes the Horezu Monastery significant in terms of its architectural and artistic value?	"King Milutin filled up all these buildings with frescoes, icons, ecclesiastical vessels,
books and embroideries. A lot of them were lost with the time, but many of them have
also been preserved in churches and in monasteries' treasuries. The exceptional

""Christ loving and God fearing King"".
STEFAN UROSH III OF DECHANI
King (1321 - 1331)
St Stefan of Dechani
Stefan Urosh III was the son of King Milutin. Out of his love for Christ, as well as
gratitude to the Chilandar community which had mediated in his reconciliation with his
father Milutin, Stefan built in the courtyard of the Hrussia Tower, in Chilandar, the
Church of St Basil.
He built many more endowments, the most famous being the monastery of Christ the
Pantocrator near Dechani, in Metochia, after which the King was named by the people
""Stefan of Dechani"". Because of its architectural symmetry, lavish sculptural
ornamentation, theological themes of paintings and richness of the monastery treasury,
Dechani represents one of the most significant monuments of the Serbian medieval
Relics of the donor, Stefan of Dechani, are resting in peace in the Dechani monastery.
STEFAN DUSHAN THE MIGHTY
King (1331 - 1346), Tzar (1346 - 1355)
Dushan was the son of Stefan of Dechani. Borders of Dushan's state included the
most important centre of Orthodoxy of the Byzantine Empire - Mount Athos -The Holy
Mountain. The State Assembly in Skopje accepted the proclamation of the Empire and
Patriarchate. On Easter day 1346, Dushan was crowned the Tzar by the Serbian
Patriarch Ioannikos and the Patriarch of Trnovo Symeon.
At Dushan's time not many enlargements were done at the Chilandar monastery, but
he bestowed it with many gifts and untold wealth. He was generous also to other
monasteries of Mount Athos. The legend credits him with donation of the Holy
Archangels Church."	<urn:uuid:8fb38eb0-f8ce-40f8-8fc2-522f45721351>	0.0
who commissioned lee friedlander photographs computing 1980s	"“Crane’s goal,” Rohrbach believes, “has been to critique our subservience to photographic realism and to suggest that we have fallen into a bad habit of giving undue preference to that part of photography’s magical language.” Writing specifically of Crane’s nude studies, Rohrbach writes that “[e]ach body almost dissolves, becoming a sinuous river flowing across a snowy landscape.” The gentle lyricism and natural sense of flow of Crane’s nudes departs drastically from Weston’s almost sculptural, static nudes. Such works beautifully capture the philosophical difference between Crane’s “challenging vision” and the vision of her contemporaries. Crane achieves what Rohrbach calls an “unnerving disconnect” that breaks old associations and forces us to reconnect with what we see before us.
Crane jumps from subject to subject throughout her career, always seeking something new to cast askew and make new. In a series of collaged photographs involving neon lights, Crane “juxtapos[es] neon lights over faces like ceremonial urban masks,” writes Foerstner in her essay, “On the Path to the Perfect Photograph.” In Neon Cowboy (above, from 1969), Crane superimposes a grid of neon cowboy signs over a series of male nudes. Rohrbach connects Crane’s use of series to the influence of John Cage’s music celebrating the artistic potential of chance. Although the neon sign does not move, the male model beneath does, sometimes wearing the neon like a mask and sometimes pulling away, revealing the hollow “mask-ness” of the sign. Rohrbach also makes a fascinating connection between Crane and the philosopher- semiotician Roland Barthes. Contrasting Crane with Lee Friedlander, who sees photography as seeing rather than making, Rohrbach calls Crane “a linguist at heart, in love with photographs as signs rather than signifiers.” Such philosophical depth adds a whole new dimension to what seem to be Crane’s simple pictures of people, buildings, neon signs, etc. “Crane taps the everyday world for the tumultuous undercurrents of unifying themes: chance, accident, chaos, contradiction and mystery playing out before our eyes,” Foerstner concurs.
After years of photographing the urban landscape and its inhabitants, Crane went “back to nature” in the 1990s with her Coloma to Covert series."	<urn:uuid:9ff4d8d0-733c-48ba-a1d0-1ff4a5248e72>	0.0

Based on rainfall gauge data over 36 years (1981–2016), a frequency analysis was performed for this basin to understand and evaluate its overall flood risk; daily rainfall measurements of 119 rain gauge stations within the basin were considered. Four common probability distributions, i.e., Log-Normal (LOG), Gumbel type-I (GUM), Pearson type-III (PE3), and Log-Pearson type-III (LP3) distributions, were used to calculate the return period of rainfall at each station and at the basin-scale level. Results of each distribution were compared with the graphical Gringorten method to analyze their performance; GUM was found to be the best-fitted distribution among the four. Thereafter, design hyetographs were developed by integrating the return period of rainfall based on three adopted methods at basin and subbasin scales; each method had its pros and cons for hydrological applications. Finally, utilizing a Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model, we estimated the possible flood inundation extent and depth, which was outlined over the Chao Phraya River Basin using the design hyetographs with different return periods. This study can help enhance disaster resilience at industrial complexes in Thailand for sustainable growth."	<urn:uuid:476f0d04-8d6c-4a28-97b0-38c115373dab>	0.0

The identification of metabolites detected in untargeted UHPLC-MS metabolomics studies can be a significant hurdle and is essential to derive biological knowledge from data. Chromatographic retention time, full-scan accurate m/z and MSn data can all be used, in combination with chemical standards and in-silico workflows where available, to identify metabolites.

small animal vs large animal anesthesiology courses monitoring equipment	"Make sure it will support the weight of the tiny animal in a safe manner. Use safe paints. Painting or sealing the surface your equipment is important so that you can keep it clean (think urine) and safe for your small pets.
If you are teaching your mouse to run an agility course do not let them have the same type items in their cage to play on or sleep in. For example, you will have a hard time teaching a mouse to run through a tunnel on a course if they sleep in one in their cage.
Fence Jumps are made to look like a fence that a horse would be behind in the country. Why? Because all animal agility, all, meaning dog, cat, rat, gerbil, mouse all or any species came from the idea of Steeple Chase. An event horses compete in by jumping over all kinds of pretty and functional fences...well, cut outs if you will. The event can also be called ""Show Jumping"".
So you will see, even in mice agility, fence jumps on about every agility course that is set up.
This is also the reason some folks call all the jumps and or all agility equipment ""fences"". Many people also refer to the small animals agility or jumping courses as ""Show Jumping"" or Showjumping"".
Bar Jumps are made with ""bars"" that are the same height in either side of the matching sides. Most bar jumps are adjustable.
Bar Jumps are usually where you will see the most artsy type jumps at an event. It is fun to make the course a pleasure to look at and have a little fun while making your equipment.
Some, but not all, Bars or polls are made to fall if hit while the animal is coming over it and hits the top bar.
Be sure to start the animal with low bars when first training these pieces of equipment.
STATIONARY BAR JUMPS
This is a fun little Coke Bar Jump. The jumps do not have to be fancy, but functional and stable.
I have directions on how I made this on our craft page.
The edges look a bit unsightly not because I was sloppy, but that I added glue to the area where the caps were put together to give the jump more strength.
I also have this type of Stationary Bar Jump. This one could also qualify for a Fence Jump. It works well and is stable enough for a gerbil or hamster or even a small or young rattie."	<urn:uuid:1280fa25-31fc-416c-a9e0-78267e2aeafd>	0.0
How do you identify the positive lead on an LED?	"Positive Deviance (PD) was designed as a practice for social change that enables communities and organizations to discover and act on the wisdom and skills existing in the system. The underlying premise of PD is that every community has individuals or groups whose uncommon practices or strategies enable them to find better solutions to problems than neighbors and peers who have access to the same resources. PD is led by people in the community who help identify and spread successful practices. Ideas, experiments and projects for change are more likely to be accepted and adopted when they are based on existing local wisdom versus external initiatives imposed on the system.

when did european eels get anguillicoloides crassus parasite	"The North Queensland Cowboys have romped home to a 42-14 win over a lacklustre Parramatta Eels side in front of a crowd of 13,285 at 1300SMILES Stadium in Townsville.
In what was an extremely one-sided affair, it was ultimately poor starts in each half that cost the Eels in a tough night for them in Northern Queensland. The Eels just couldn't get any decent amount of ball at any point throughout the match, with possession flow sitting at over 60% to the Cowboys for the majority of the game.
The Cowboys impressive victory was built on the back of a dominant performance from their giant forward pack with Australia and New South Wales hopeful James Tamou finishing the match with over 170 run metres, closely followed by a strong performance from second rower Jason Taumalolo who ended the match with over 140 run metres.
It took only 5 minutes for the Cowboys to open up their account for the night with Johnathan Thurston chasing through on a Michael Morgan grubber to get the night's first try. Two more Cowboys tries followed in quick succession with Matthew Scott and Curtis Rona both adding their own tries within the 20 minute mark.
Amazingly, despite hardly having any ball, the Eels were able to get within four points of the Cowboys at halftime. Paul Green wouldn't have been happy with the soft defence shown from his side as Ken Sio went over in the 25th minute, followed by a 33rd minute Pauli Pauli try with what were basically their only two chances of the half. Chris Sandow took the score to 18-14 and within a converted try with a penalty goal right on half time.
The second half began as the first did, with Kane Linnett scoring only 5 minutes into the half. When Sandow went himself and got over the line 10 minutes later, it looked as though the Eels might be back in it, however the video referee correctly ruled that Sandow had knocked on in attempting to ground the ball.
A second Kane Linnett try in the 57th minute, followed by a second Curtis Rona try in the 65th ended any hope of an Eels fight back, not that it was ever likely."	<urn:uuid:23fc354a-3bb3-4ed1-aa35-d8af7f385513>	0.0
Which condition has a higher survival rate: untreated neuroblastoma or untreated CML?	"Progression Free Survival with Nivolumab in Recurrent NSCLC
HealthDay News — For patients with previously untreated stage IV or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), nivolumab is not associated with longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy, according to a study published in the June 22 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
David P. Carbone, MD, PhD, from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center in Columbus, and colleagues randomized patients with untreated stage IV or recurrent NSCLC and a programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor expression level of 1% or more to receive nivolumab or platinum-based chemotherapy.
The researchers found that the median progression-free survival was 4.2 months with nivolumab versus 5.9 months with chemotherapy among the 423 patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.45; P=0.25); median overall survival was 14.4 versus 13.2 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.80 to 1.30). Overall, 60% of 212 patients in the chemotherapy group received nivolumab as subsequent therapy. Treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurred in 71 and 92% of patients who received nivolumab and chemotherapy, respectively; treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 18 and 51%, respectively.
""Nivolumab was not associated with significantly longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy among patients with previously untreated stage IV or recurrent NSCLC with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more,"" the authors write.
The study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb, the manufacturer of nivolumab, and ONO Pharmaceutical."	<urn:uuid:bf179abd-8371-445e-bf1e-f0cffb523697>	0.0
I live in Mali. How much has rainfall decreased here in the past 50 years?	"“This € 170.000 grant will be used to invest in mobile-based cashless payment facilities for a project that is going to provide 560.000 rural people with drinking water in the Sikasso region (Mali) for the 15 coming years”, explains Thierry BARBOTTE, Chairman of the ODIAL SOLUTIONS group and Director of UDUMA MALI. “In 2018, UDUMA MALI has entered into public service delegation contracts with the first 11 out of the 30 targeted municipalities.”
3 Malians out of 4 live in rural areas and provide themselves with drinking water by means of manual pumps. However, 1 pump out of 2 is regularly out of service. “This existing situation implies more time-consuming and exhausting water chores, has a high cost for the pump upkeep, affects the health conditions and contributes to the rural exodus”, states Nicolaas VAN DER WILK, Operations Manager of UDUMA MALI. Furthermore, boreholes made unusable by defective pumps represent nearly 66 billion CFA francs (100 million euros) in lost public investments.
Mobile technologies at the heart of the UDUMA model
The project, under the tutelage of the Malian Ministry for Energy and Water, is offering an alternative to this situation for the Sikasso region. The Malian local authorities are going to entrust the management and the operation of 1.400 water points equipped with manual pumps to the private operator UDUMA MALI. The operator guarantees a continuous water service (72-hour max downtime) for at least 15 years and renews a large part of the equipment.
UDUMA MALI will be charging a fixed user fee per consumed volume (500 CFA francs/m3, 0.76 euro). The water pumps will be equipped with digital water meters. The water service is provided by a caretaker (1 on each pump) and a mechanic (1 per 50 pumps), whose remunerations evolve with water consumptions. The new water service delivery model is expected to create small-scale income-generating activities for nearly 1.500 women in the Sikasso Region.
The GSMA M4D Utilities Innovation Fund grant will enable UDUMA MALI to deploy mobile-enabled devices for cashless revenue collection, combining Mobile Money and Near Field Communication (NFC) technologies."	<urn:uuid:e1f6d3a2-2585-437a-bf8a-1819db481032>	0.0
Between Foster's Beijing airport and Creative Group's Goa terminal, which has the bolder roof design?	"Everything about Goa!Goa to Kerala
Kerala and Goa share the same Arabian Sea coastline along the western coast of India.
Goa to Kerala by Train : By far train is the most popular means to travel between Goa and Kerala. It's a 15 hours or so journey from Madgaon (MAO) to Ernakulam Jn (ERS), the main railway station for Cochin.
There are two daily express trains connecting Goa with Kerala. The first one is the Mangala Lakshadweep Express (Train No: 12618 ) from H Nizamuddin (NZM) near New Delhi to Ernakulam Jn (ERS) .
If you are heading further south of Kerala like Alleppey (ALLP), Kollam (QLN), Varkala (VAK), Trivandrum(TVC) etc, opt for Netravati Express (Train No 16345) Netravati Express connects Mumbai with Trivandrum via Goa.
Both has stop at Madgaon (MAO) of Goa. Additionally, you can board Netravati Express from Karmali (north Goa) or Canacona (south Goa).
Mangala Lakshadweep Express stops at Thivim (North Goa) also.
Other than these two daily trains you will see 3 or 4 more trains between Kerala and Goa that are weekly, bi-weekly or tri-weekly.
Select the train that suits you based on the day of travel, time and destination in Kerala. Check with irctc.co.in website for updated schedules and reservation availability.
Goa to Kerala by Flight There are no direct flights to Kerala from Goa.
By the way Kerala has three airports, to which domestic and international flights operate: Calicut International Airport (CJJ), Cochin International Airport (COK) and Trivandrum International Airport (TRV).
There are frequent flights from Goa to Mumbai, some decent number of flights between Goa and Bangalore. Both Bangalore and Mumbai are well connected by direct flights to Calicut, Cochin and Trivandrum.
It's a hop on hop off type journey, but that's the best available option to fly to Kerala from Goa.
Goa to Kerala by Road : National Highway 17 (NH17) running along the west coast of India connects Mumbai with Cochin via Goa."	<urn:uuid:d49ed392-b85d-4c6d-9ab2-70dc997b85e1>	0.0
I'm new to guns. What exactly does ballistics mean?	"These three kinds of scenes are very similar in that they have to tell a part of the story by using details. Horror and action are not my strongest points as a director. I'm better at making pretty paintings than the deliberate pacing of shots which build up tension in a horror or action scene. I'm getting better at the pacing of shots in a love scene as I've had more experience with them. Horror is very very specialized and difficult to do.
Storyboards are important in commercials. And for films with budgets so large that you know exactly what your sets will be like. But in our world they are mostly a waste of time.
Instead, use the following rules.
What's actually important
There are only two things that are important when shooting a movie
And you read the scheduling section of the Wiki first, right?
Shooting the movie isn't important. That's the fun part of what we do. But in order to sell the movie we absolutely must have good stills. Frequently the producers rep will tell us what they want for stills. Otherwise, we need all the actors in front of a blue screen with their guns or whatever. And then we need pictures of them in character doing the things their character does. Distributors will actually reject a picture that does not have several hundred high-resolution stills.
One of the most important and potentially expensive deliverables on a motion picture is the DM&E tracks. We absolutely must have well recorded dialog in order to deliver those. The dialog quality is more important than the picture. Viewers will presume the picture looks terrible if the sound is terrible.
To recap: the two most important things are stills and sound. Everything else you do to make a movie? Tertiary or... worse...
What to shoot
- Shoot all of the action
- all the entrances
- all the exits
- shoot all the dialog
- shoot everything in the scene that anyone refers to: dead body on the floor, glass of whiskey, baccarat table.
And remember that it's all about the decisions made on-stage. I don't mean the decisions the director makes, I mean the decisions that the characters make. If you have a character come to the end of a hallway and she has the option of going left or right — we want to see her make that decision. Left or right?"	<urn:uuid:a3cbe4cd-2ded-474b-b221-71f601c657f4>	0.0
I'm working on a school project about food science pioneers. Could you tell me if Nicolai Vavilov and the botanist Petr Zhukovsky had similar goals in their travels to Turkey?	"RED: And where did you learn the most about winemaking?
SCOTT: Growing up I had a lot of varied interests, not just in oenology but also in food science, so I pursued studies in Fermentation Science at the University of California at Davis. In addition to winemaking, I also explored the principles and science behind distillation, food engineering and even a little cheese-making. Since my brother and I were experimenting with home brewing during the summers, I took the opportunity to study at Davis’ Institute of Brewing Studies, eventually earning a Master Brewers Certificate. After Davis, I joined the Carmel Brewing Company, and eventually assembled a brewpub in Monterey from the ground up, formulating the recipes and brewing all the beer that we would serve on tap. I had always enjoyed the engineering side of things such as fluid dynamics and heat transfer, and working in a small brewpub allowed me to be hands-on throughout the brewing process and use some of the mechanical skills I learned growing up.
Ultimately though, I found that brewing didn’t really fulfill my creative side, and I found myself gravitating back toward winemaking. In 2000, I joined the Robert Mondavi family of wines working on a variety of brands that took me from Australia to Italy. These experiences abroad really shaped my philosophy about wine and winemaking, my travels to Italy clarified the synergy between wine and food, while making wine in Australia introduced me to a new approach with a focus on the details and the idea that you only get one chance to make a wine great.
RED: What is your winemaking style or philosophy?
SCOTT: Winemaking fulfills my artistic side without giving up the innovative hands-on experience that keeps me in touch with my family’s roots in agriculture. I enjoy all of the challenges that each vintage presents in order to shape the style of wines we make at Estancia.. Our winemaking style is one that fully embraces the coastal terroir.
RED: Tell me, what makes the Monterey and the Central Coast region so special?
SCOTT: Born and raised in Monterey County, I have tremendous respect for the climate – the wind and fog and the impact it has on the fruit and wine."	<urn:uuid:4ac305b0-9dad-4baf-a489-c38801be01a0>	0.0
Which blocks noise better, suspended or acoustic ceilings?	"We have already discussed how to address flanking noise through floors and ceiling
The problem with cavity walls is it is not only the cavity allowing the free passage of noise around the party wall but the internal masonry skin is often of low density blocks. In the early days these would be known as “breeze” blocks but in more recent years they have been replaced with even lower density blocks called “Thermalite” blocks. The Thermalite blocks are more efficient at allowing noise to be transmitted through them into adjoining rooms and are a particular problem with flats when flanking noise travels up and down through these blocks into flats above and below but the soundproofing of flats is an issue I will discuss in a later article. The best way to soundproof these walls to reduce flanking noise transmission is to install a 50mm M20AD solution but can be expensive so should only be installed in extreme cases where the flanking noise is more of a nuisance. If you still want to look at the M20AD solution to reduce flanking noise through a wall go to our web page via the following link M20AD To soundproof a wall.
And back to the cavities within the walls and the best way to treat these is to have blown mineral wool installed that will have the advantage of giving additional thermal insulation. Other types of thermal insulation such as injected foam or polystyrene will not be as efficient at absorbing the noise and could actually compound the problem making the noise being heard even clearer.
More information on how to soundproof a party wall can be found on our web page via this link soundproof a party wall.
This article explains how flanking noise uses the cavities and lightweight masonry of walls to gain access. More about how to soundproof a party wall will be published in the near future. If you want to see how we can help soundproof a room or garage, go to our web site via this link. Soundproof a garage.

There is a common misconception concerning acoustic underlays and what is required of them. Most people want an acoustic underlay to reduce airborne noise such as speech and music being heard through a floor. So when they go to buy a new carpet, they also ask for a sound absorbing underlay from the carpet supplier."	<urn:uuid:009d05d0-bfc5-459c-b932-9541d3baea99>	0.0
When comparing chicken biryani and chickpea pilaf preparation methods, which one takes longer to make using a pressure cooker?	"You can also mix in heated peas, toasted almonds, or raisins to the pilaf to make it more interesting.

I'm fascinated by local food traditions and heard about a big bean festival somewhere in Piedmont - could you explain what this event is all about?	"Yay! It's Blogger's Quilt Festival time!! What could be better than seeing lots of beautiful quilts from all around the world and hearing the stories behind them, with the bonus of finding new bloggy friends.
Today I'm sharing my version of a pattern by Chris Jurd called Mariner's Garden.
The paper pieced center is a scrap attack of blues and greens. I didn't have an overall plan when choosing my colours. I had a lot of blues and greens so figured that was a good start. When it came to choosing a background I thought I'd use orange or yellow, something sunny and bright, but when trying those options they just fell flat, but the purple really made the center pop.
The flowers in the setting triangles were my first attempt at applique and far from perfect, but I'm okay with that. You have to start somewhere, and I learnt a lot doing them...
This peacock fabric was in my stash and the colours were right so they became the corner blocks. They inspired the name for the quilt - Peacock Garden
The quilt top has sat in my cupboard for about 2 years. I was putting off quilting it , partly because it's big! and because I was worried about not doing a good enough job. I took it to Tanya Croft, my lovely long arm quilter who chose a simple loopy squiggly all-over design. I'm so happy with it, it's not too fussy and just dances around the quilt.
I love this pattern and enjoyed making it, I'd really like to make it again in other colours.
Fun backing fabric!! Domestic Diva by Emily Taylor.
A super big Thank You to Amy from Amy's Creative Side for organising the Blogger's Quilt Festival!! And to all the wonderful sponsers for supporting such a fun event.
I always try to reply to comments but it's going to be a busy week of trying to visit as many festival blogs as I can so please excuse me if I don't reply, but if you leave me a comment I'll make sure I visit your blog and leave a comment in return. :)"	<urn:uuid:6d55d591-a4b8-4637-b364-ea3511d5bcf2>	0.0
What kind of editing do alpha and rush readers focus on?	"Now agents also require the writer rather than the publisher to pay them.
3. The technical part of publishing -- getting ink onto paper, editing in the larger sense of organization and content, proofing for accuracy and clarity, formatting, illustrating, printing and binding, and finally distributing -- have never been easier. If you have the money, the machinery is all there. In fact, it takes less money than ever before because printing can be done one copy at a time instead of in mass lots that must be stored until sale (and taxed as property) and distributing can be handled online.
4. There are more customers out there than ever before. But they read less. And no one is quite sure what they DO read, in spite of all the demographic studies. But there are technical ways to find readers for any genre or discipline -- just takes time, effort and maybe money. Rather like locating voters. Or consumers of any kind. Amazon uses the technique of the publishers: sell them what they bought last time. (If you liked X, buy X2.) But writing the same thing over and over is not good for authors.
5. The major problem is sorting and evaluating. Everyone wants to be an author, even if they have to pay to do it. Critics are less eager. “Branding” is how some publishers do -- one publishes thrillers, another publishes chick lit, etc. (Agents also “brand.”) See http://www.dennismcmillan.com/ for a fascinating analysis of the market. McMillan sells to high-end readers of thrillers. His books are fine objects but he gives no attention to editing and proofing, depending on the writers for that. He’s got a “chimney” relationship going: readers who are like the writers in tastes and assumptions. The result is that a few years after publication, the individual copies, the actual books, can be worth a lot of money, introducing the element of speculation that is characteristic of the arts these days.
6. This means that the reader who chooses his or her books carefully AS OBJECTS can actually MAKE money rather than only being a consumer. Originally, the readers were the ultimate source of money for everyone. This practice also moves the profit to the second-hand (“antique” or “collector” market if you think “second-hand” implies downscale) rather than the original publisher.

What countries did the gemstones in Anglo-Saxon jewelry originate from?	"Anglo-Saxon Rune Lore
Beginning with an introduction to Anglo-Saxons and the Futhorc, the Anglo-Saxon expanded version of the ancient Norse runes, Anglo-Saxon Rune Lore provides an excellent brief guide to Anglo-Saxon rune lore and interpretation.
An individual guide is given for each rune including its Elder Futhark equivalent, Younger Futhork equivalent, phonetic value and symbolic interpretation for divination. Ancient stories are looked into with guidance for interpretation in contemporary life.
Throughout this book the author quotes the Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem as translated by Bruce Dickens in his 1915 work Runic; a complete version of the poem being included at the end of the book in Anglo-Saxon followed by its translation into modern English. There is also a very useful glossary of terms and bibliography for further study.
If you are interested in discovering these runes for yourself Anglo-Saxon Rune Lore provides an excellent basis, presenting the background to these ancient English runes together with wonderfully clear guidance on their interpretation and use.

awards european film festival cannes 2014 2023 comparison	"The Locarno International Film Festival last week released their line-up for the 2014 festival, including a plethora of new films, retrospectives and festival honours.
The festival will run this year from the 6th -16th of August. Locarno falls in the European festival circuit between Cannes and Venice, tending to allow for smaller films to come to the fore in the midst of the heavyweights of Cannes and Venice. The festival is mostly known for its Piazza Grande open-air screenings, which seats over 8 000 people and features one of the world’s largest open-air screens.
The festival includes an International Competition, Concorso Cineasti (highlighting the first and second films from emerging directors), an Out-of-Competition selection, a Short Film Competition and the Open Doors section, which focuses each year on a specific region. This year’s Open Doors features films on Sub-Saharan Africa.
Locarno typically functions as a discovery festival, launching new trends, films and careers – for example, Roberto Rossellini’s Rome, Open City screened at the first ever festival in 1946. This generally means that many of the titles in the line-up will be unknown to even the most avid of festival-circuit followers.
There are a few familiar faces however – Jean-Luc Godard’s Goodbye to Language will be screening out of competition, as will Thom Andersen’s latest offering, The Tony Longo Trilogy and some competition heavyweights such as Lav Diaz and Pedro Costa will be recognisable names to ardent cinephiles. Sydney audiences will have the chance to catch Aaron Katz and Martha Stephens Land Ho! at the Possible World’s Film Festival before it screens outdoors at the Piazza Grande at Locarno, alongside Luc Besson’s Lucy, starring Scarlett Johansson.

What percentage of performance horses have gastric ulcers?	"M1 signifies the presence of metastatic disease. Sampling of at least 15 lymph nodes is recommended during surgical staging (see Curative Surgical Resection below). A staging laparoscopy prior to definitive surgery to exclude peritoneal carcinomatosis should be considered in patients with stage T1b or greater disease without radiographic evidence of distant metastases. Pathologic review should include (1) grade of tumor; (2) histologic subtype; (3) depth of invasion; (4) whether lymphatic or vascular invasion is present; and (5) if there is known metastatic disease, the status of HER2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry or fluorescent in situ hybridization or both.
Ulcerating gastric adenocarcinomas are distinguished from benign gastric ulcers by biopsies. Approximately 3% of gastric ulcers initially believed to be benign later prove to be malignant. To exclude malignancy, all gastric ulcers identified at endoscopy should be biopsied. Ulcers that are suspicious for malignancy to the endoscopist or that have atypia or dysplasia on histologic examination warrant repeat endoscopy in 2–3 months to verify healing and exclude malignancy. Nonhealing ulcers should be considered for resection. Infiltrative carcinoma with thickened gastric folds must be distinguished from lymphoma and other hypertrophic gastropathies.
- Curative Surgical Resection
Surgical resection is the only therapy with curative potential. Laparoscopic techniques achieve similar outcomes and lower overall complication rates as open gastrectomy. After preoperative staging, about two-thirds of patients will be found to have localized disease (ie, stages I–III). In Japan and in specialized centers in the United States, endoscopic mucosal resection is performed in selected patients with small (< 1–2 cm), early (intramucosal or T1aN0) gastric cancers after careful staging with endoscopic ultrasonography. Approximately 25% of patients undergoing surgery will be found to have locally unresectable tumors or peritoneal, hepatic, or distant lymph node metastases that are incurable. The remaining patients with confirmed localized disease should undergo radical surgical resection with curative intent. For adenocarcinoma localized to the distal two-thirds of the stomach, a subtotal distal gastrectomy should be performed."	<urn:uuid:b3a39804-cfe0-4059-b2c7-35571b7715d2>	0.0
virginia oyster industry aquaculture development permit requirements disease monitoring	"“I lead a small team which conducts internal audits, training and procedure development to ensure that everyone is doing the work that they need to do to not only meet our regulatory requirements, but meet additional requirements that we are certified.”
Jennifer’s involvement in aquaculture doesn’t stop with her day job at Cooke Aquaculture though. She is involved with many national aquaculture organizations. She sits as a board member of the Aquaculture Association of Canada, a technical committee member for the Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance, a member of the Salmon Farm Standard Technical Committee for Best Aquaculture Practices, and much more.
“One of the biggest issues with marine farming is that people can’t see the cows grazing, horses galloping and that scenic red barn in the background,” Jennifer explains. “Marine farming happens underwater and for people not in the industry, it can be difficult for them to understand everything that happens. I am especially passionate about helping people to understand what happens on a fish farm.”
Reflecting on her time at the AC and her switch to studies in aquaculture, Jennifer has no doubt that her decision was the right choice.
“Aquaculture isn’t just about being on the farms and feeding the fish, there are so many varied careers within the industry or those associated with supporting the industry,” she explains. “With so many different species under the Cooke banner and various operational locations, I get to interact with a multitude of people, farming and fishing practices, learning new things daily. It’s never redundant and never slow!”
“I knew from the day that I learned about aquaculture that I wanted to be involved,” Jennifer smiles. “I have been involved and absolutely loving it since I graduated in 2002.”"	<urn:uuid:dc94edd6-7447-47ae-b21e-d30a324130c9>	0.0
wanted expert opinion ancient egyptian musicians temple performances status levels	"ANCIENT MOONSHOTS: Megalithic Mysteries from before Technology
From “El Gigante” on Easter Island to the “Unfinished Obelisk” at Aswan, Egypt, step-by-step solutions of how the ancient architects might have constructed these magnificent feats of engineering
Ancient Moonshots: Megalithic Mysteries from before Technology
A new book proposing step-by-step solutions to the completion of four of the ancient world’s most mind-boggling but only semi-finished feats of megalithic construction: the boulder-hewn Inca “fortress” of “Sacsawaman” above Cuzco, Peru; “El Gigante,” the 65-foot long “moai” statue still in the quarry on Easter Island; the 1200-ton “Unfinished Obelisk” abandoned in the quarries at Aswan, Egypt, and the enigmatic assemblage of 100,000 tons of the world’s largest dressed stone blocks at the Roman temple-site at Baalbek, Lebanon.
In their times, and for their builders, these were the technological equivalents of our Apollo Space Program. The reader is first offered a 54 page primer on hand methods for manipulating gigantic blocks of stone and a short, but fascinating history of megalithic architecture in the western world, from the huge standing monoliths at Göblekli Tepe, Turkey’s enigmatic 12,000 year old temple site, and the earliest known free-standing megalithic structures on the tiny Mediterranean island of Malta, on through Stonehenge and numerous examples of Egyptian, Minoan, Mycenean and Classical Greek work, culminating with the seldom-visited, but incredible Roman temple of Jupiter-Baal at Baalbek, in its day the largest in the world.
Note: this publication includes the author’s previously published works “SACSAWAMAN, AN INCA MASTERWORK”,“EL GIGANTE, AWAKENING THE GIANT”, “THE UNFINISHED OBELISK” and “BAALBEK’S TRILITHON: AN ENIGMA”, all available as separate publications through this website.

who were first people interviewed monthly newsletter eso 2019	"There are way too many people thinking, “as long as we send out our newsletter regularly it will engage our audience”; if only it were that easy….
If your nonprofit is serious about engaging your audience and getting them to donate or volunteer then you need to have a sound email marketing strategy to ensure your newsletter becomes a signal instead of noise.
Today I am going to explain a strategy for your nonprofit organization that you need to follow. It almost guarantees that you will increase your open and click through rates and engage your supporters.
First here are some statistics you need to be aware of:
• Targeted emails drive 18 times more revenue than broadcast emails. Thanks Emma
• Email list segmentation is considered the most important tactic used for email marketing
• Segmented email campaigns have a 14.32% higher open rate than non-segmented campaigns. (Mailchimp, 2016)
• And just so you know how you compare to the benchmark; in the nonprofit sector the average open rate is 24.98% and the average click through rate is 2.76%.
The good news?
You can implement this strategy for your newsletter…. even if you have a small database of subscribers and use a free platform such as MailChimp’s free plan.
So what is this email segmentation strategy all about?
In an ideal world we would only receive emails that were of interest to us. The sad truth about monthly newsletters is that they take a lot of time to create and are not engaging supporters like they used to.
Most people suffer from an overflowing email inbox and simply do not have the time to read through a newsletter. In the nonprofit industry newsletters are mostly read by the employees of the nonprofit organization and not the target audience.
The solution? It is easy for a potential donor to just ignore a newsletter which has say five articles of which he has little interest. In this instance, a potential donation is lost. However, by sending targeted emails, the potential donor’s time is saved, and interest is gained.
By targeted email I mean segmenting your mail list into various groups. For example you could divide your email base into:
• Regular donors
• Once-off donors
• Potential supporters
• People who have attended an event
Now instead of sending 1 monthly newsletter with five articles to all of these readers, you send one relevant article to each group. By doing this it makes the newsletter more targeted and the readers only get information on what they are interested in."	<urn:uuid:181282ad-d907-45da-aa3c-8a2c00411c86>	0.0
I'm interested in winter houses - what's special about Sirdalen House location?	"Ibiza, you took my heart, and now I've taken it back
It was love at first sight, such an immediate feeling of ""ah.. I'm home""
I know I'm far from the only one to have felt that way about this island. It IS SPECIAL, very very special. It is stunningly beautiful, parts of it in biblical ways, other parts in paradisiacal ways. Parts of Ibiza look like the garden of Eden, and others like the picture perfect beach. Her landscapes are beautiful, pure, crystalline and raw. Natural, with fruits and vegetables growing freely in nature.
The first winter I spent in my house in Ibiza was like Christmas every day, picking huge, juicy oranges off the trees, chili from the bushes below, and pomegranates to sprinkle in my salads. In September the figs were so abundant and almost erotic, and the grapes had this golden color that mesmerized me, thinking of the significance it had for centuries of wine making, not to mention wine drinking.
I kind of ignored the bad sides of the island, which I'll also now ignore, not really wanting to go into any details. I have plenty to say, but am afraid I might get stoned or shot to death by Ibiza fanatics who'll hate me much for criticizing their beautiful paradise.
The thing is with these people, that it seems they are convincing themselves and others about how wonderful this place is. Everyone goes on and on about how stunning it is, how lucky we are to live here. And this happens especially in the winter, when the island goes to sleep, the tourists have gone back home, and it's just what it is: a tiny island with about 120,000 inhabitants. It's a village- a graveyard village. It's dead and dull and flat out boring. There's no culture, no art, no events, no libraries or book cafes to hide out in when it rains, the houses are cold and humid and dark and... There, I said it. A few bad things.
But the expat population here go crazy in the off season, convincing themselves and especially others, especially in Facebook, what a perfect paradise it is that they live in. Numerous pictures of empty beaches- yes, they're sunny and it's probably 18 degrees Celsius, but they're empty."	<urn:uuid:b6a8a567-0eda-4cf7-9ec4-5ed1caa8bd58>	0.0
I'm fascinated by coffee processing methods - what's unique about the honey processing technique used in places like Costa Rica?	"In the selection process the percentage of floating cherries is reduced and plants with better and more uniformed height, yield, ripeness and quality are separated.
From the evaluation performed in the Perez Zeledon region ( Southern Costa Rica) it is noticed that this varietal present a slower coffee cherry ripeness process, and since this characteristic is of great importance for the coffee cultivation in this region, a special emphasis is given to the development and evaluation of this varietal. Thus, in the year 2010, the varietal was released for the benefit of Costa Rica coffee farmers looking for late harvest varietals to avoid early rains during the harvest season and maintain the Caturra arabica high quality in the cup.
Evaluations performed measuring growth, yield, and quality in the cup, coffee cherries ripening process and resistance to fungus and pests, The Venecia varietal present the following characteristics:
a. High quality in the cup.
b. Big coffee bean size ( bigger that its Caturra Parent ) and yield similar to Caturra varietal.
c. Late harvest: Coffee cherries ripe late in the coffee harvest season.
d. Compact size of the coffee plant that favors harvesting
The harvest of the Venecia Varietal in the regions where it was evaluated was similar to the Caturra Varietal. It can be clasified as a varietal of medium yield.
Regarding coffee cherry size variables and coffee bean after processing. The Venecia varietal presents bigger coffee cherry size and same or higher yield after mill processing. Coffee beans have a higher size in the 17/64 filter, compared to the Caturra Varietal.
Same results were obtained withe the peaberry coffee bean.
This Venecia varietal presents a high quality coffee cup. In several cupping events during the selection process, the quality in the cup was same or higher than the comparable Caturra and Catuai Varietals. It is more Aromatic, has more body, higher acidity, less bitterness, and overall, it was selected the best among the three varietals by selected institute cuppers.
Because of this varietal is of late harvest, it is recommended in micro climates where rain may interfere with optimal harvest. Besides the higher quality in the bean, the Venecia coffee Varietal allows to decrease the lost in coffee cherries due to rainfall, thus farm labor use and farm infrastructure is optimized."	<urn:uuid:5d2d9de1-1927-4938-a9bd-3f334007f4d7>	0.0

Which approach emphasizes support resources more - ABA or online education?	"To achieve the goals of this Plan, the College will build on its strengths, including a vibrant and committed faculty who offer students an individualized education; competitive and internationally recognized programs in Dance and Theatre Arts that attract students because of their quality programs and the liberal arts-based education provided at MMC; and our central Manhattan location, which makes the College particularly attractive to students in general, but especially in fields such as the performing arts, visual and media arts, media, business, and international studies, and provides unparalleled internship possibilities.
Marymount Manhattan remains committed to the liberal arts as an essential foundation of an undergraduate education. Our liberal arts sensibility relies on our traditions, encourages exploration, and emphasizes connected learning. The programs we offer provide students with pathways for discovery about themselves and the world around them. The integrative nature of our approach is evident in the recently redesigned General Education curriculum and in our support of students’ pursuit of double-majors and minors. The College encourages faculty and students to cross disciplines in building their course of teaching and study. Opportunities that allow unexpected yet transformational connections across disciplines distinguish Marymount Manhattan from other institutions. Our integrated and experiential approach to a liberal arts education leads us to new frontiers of knowledge.
This plan indicates how, over the next five years, the College will firmly articulate its identity, strengthen its academic offerings, make its administration more efficient, utilize its technology resources more effectively, and promote itself more vigorously. It will guide the allocation and re-allocation of resources that occurs in the annual budgeting process over these years.
Articulating our Identity
The Plan was guided by discussions within the Strategic Planning Committee and among the faculty and the larger community, and reinforced by the report of our consultants, AKA / Strategies. It proposes that the College recognize that it is an institution with a tri-partite identity, i.e., as a college of the performing, visual and media, and liberal arts. Marymount Manhattan’s strength draws from the interrelationships between and among these areas.
Many faculty members cross the boundaries of these three branches, as do our students: e.g., the double major in Communication Arts and Business who interns at the White House; the Psychology major who is now a highly successful fashion designer; the International Studies alumna who has performed with her band on Saturday Night Live; the Dance alumna who is now a corporate lawyer and another who is in medical school."	<urn:uuid:77cffcdc-90cc-41d2-9f24-f26394e65730>	0.0
I notice most circuit boards I see are green in color - I've always wondered why they chose this particular color for circuit boards?	"From the emails I've been receiving, it's very clear that I need to create new up-to-date web pages ASAP. I'm sorry it's so confusing. I'm going to start redesigning the MP3 player portion of the site tommorrow.
Aug 31, 2000: We received the first few circuit boards yesterday evening, and I've built the first board and I'll be testing it this afternoon. Here's a photo of the board:
The next step is to add the board, kits, and parts to our on-line store so that we can begin taking orders for them. We currently have about 20 boards and the rest are expected today or tommorrow. Robin and I are planning on working to build boards all weekend so that we can ship them on Tuesday.
I should also mention that the firmware currently does not make use of the DRAM, so there is very little buffering, and the drive can not spin down (high capacity NiMH batteries last only about 1 hour with the drive spinning continuously). It will take me some time to merge the DRAM controller with the other FGPA player hardware, but the good news is that when this is ready, anyone who has the board will be able to flash upgrade to get DRAM support. The other issue with not having DRAM is that the hard drive must be defragmented before it is put into the player.
There is also a larger copy of the board photo, where some of the chips are more readable.
Aug 28, 2000: Robin and I have been spending quite a bit of time preping components and getting ready to make a bunch of boards. I've made dozens of orders for parts from various distributors, and our living room is filled with boxes and parts. We spent part of Sunday moving the phones and printer around, which required getting under the house to pull more wires (not fun). The new arrangement makes it much easier for Robin to process an order. Most of this doesn't involve the computer, so I've not updated this page in a while, and I'm horribly behind in answering emails. If you have an email message sent to me, please be patient. I'll try to get to them soon.
The guy from the circuit board place called a couple days ago. The boards will be delayed a bit, because his wife who was pregnant and expecting in a couple weeks had a blood pressure problem."	<urn:uuid:f6d47292-ddb3-4e21-9a70-b567b5394e50>	0.0
what is used to study meaning of words that describe truth levels	"As an ancient language, Hebrew went through a long period of disuse. Towards the end of the 19th century, it underwent a transformation and emerged as a modern language due to the efforts of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, a noted Jewish linguist.
Today, people participating in Hebrew language learning online often find words that can’t be directly translated into English.
Some of these words are discussed below:
1. Firgun (פרגון)
The word ‘firgun’ is used to describe feeling genuinely happy for another’s person joy, or taking pride in their accomplishments.
It’s also a concept, implying that a person who engages in ‘firgun’ has a generosity of spirit, and feels no resentment or jealousy towards someone else’s happiness.
2. Davka (דווקא)
‘Davka’ is an incredibly versatile word, as its meaning can vary depending on the usage. One says ‘davka’ when they want to describe something that’s the opposite of what they were expecting.
The word can also be used to describe irony, or a deliberately harmful act.
3. L’ecole Sratim (לאכול סרטים)
The term ‘L’ecole Sratim’ literally means ‘to eat movies.’
One uses the term when talking about someone with a dramatic, over-the-top personality. It also describes someone who tends to blow small things out of proportion.
4. Chutzpah (חוצפה)
‘Chutzpah’ is perhaps one of the most popular Hebrew words used by non-Hebrew speakers. The word is commonly used in conversation and in writing by English speakers, but it does not translate directly to English.
Someone with ‘chutzpah’ has a lot of nerve or audacity, bordering on rudeness. In Hebrew, the word generally has negative connotations. But in English, it takes on a more positive meaning since it’s used to praise a person’s brashness.

5. Stalbet (סטאלבט)
‘Stalbet’ is one of many Hebrew slang words with no English translation.
It’s used in the contexts of relaxing, unwinding, or simply doing nothing."	<urn:uuid:07a78134-4554-4afa-9d7f-51971edfbbe1>	0.0

I've been analyzing workplace risks and disabilities - how do the physical mobility challenges differ between the recycling collector's work environment and Stephen Hawking's professional career?	"I will deal with this question over a couple of separate journals, as there are many issues...
Firstly, it’s crucial you have one or more health and safety representatives (HSRs) as it’s becoming increasingly clear that there are going to be a range of issues which need to be considered and dealt with before workers can safely return to work. Under the obligations of the OHS Act, the employer has a legal duty to consult with any HSRs when identifying and assessing hazards and risks, and when implementing controls to eliminate (or minimise) these hazards and risks. If there are no elected HSRs, then the employer must consult with affected workers – but this is difficult to do effectively, and is often just not done at all. The duty to consult, which is in s35 of the Act, also requires the employer to consult when proposing changes to (almost) anything, like the workplace, the systems of work, the plant and so on.
This is super important – how things will need to be done, what the workplace might look like, and more will need to change. Specifically, this might mean changes to or consideration of:
- The physical layout of the workplace – to ensure physical distancing
- The hours of work
- How and how often the workplace needs to be cleaned
- Evacuation procedures
- How many visitors/clients can enter the workplace
- Interaction between staff and visitors/clients
- Leave policies
- and more…
These issues will affect the level of risk to workers of contracting COVID-19.
There will be other issues, depending on the workplace and the type of work. For example: workers in the transport sector – potential overcrowding in buses, trams, trains and platforms; or construction workers – there have already been employer complaints about the difficulties of maintaining physical distancing. For these reasons it is crucial that workers, through their HSRs have a say. It is unacceptable for employers to not consult – using the excuse that there has not been time. It is absolutely ‘practicable’ to ensure that HSRs are involved in the return to work process.
Please remember: if you have any OHS related queries, then send them in via our Ask Renata facility on the website.

blank canvas opera premiere location date	"Although Verdi did not attend the premiere in Cairo, he was most dissatisfied with the fact that the audience consisted of invited dignitaries, politicians and critics, but no members of the general public. He therefore considered the Italian (and European) premiere, held at La Scala, Milan on 8 February 1872, and in which he was heavily involved at every stage, to be its real premiere.
Verdi had also written the role of Aida for the voice of Teresa Stolz, who sang it for the first time at the Milan premiere. Verdi had asked her fiancé, Angelo Mariani, to conduct the Cairo premiere, but he declined, so Giovanni Bottesini filled the gap. The Milan Amneris, Maria Waldmann, was his favourite in the role and she repeated it a number of times at his request.
Aida was received with great enthusiasm at its Milan premiere. The opera was soon mounted at major opera houses throughout Italy, including the Teatro Regio di Parma (20 April 1872), the Teatro di San Carlo (30 March 1873), La Fenice (11 June 1873), the Teatro Regio di Torino (26 December 1874), the Teatro Comunale di Bologna (30 September 1877, with Giuseppina Pasqua as Amneris and Franco Novara as the King), and the Teatro Costanzi (8 October 1881, with Theresia Singer as Aida and Giulia Novelli as Amneris) among others.
Most performances of Aida have used a subdued, relatively brief, prelude. Verdi also composed a longer concert overture, which includes more melodies from the opera; this was given a rare broadcast performance by Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra on 30 March 1940, which was never commercially issued.
Details of important national and other premieres of Aida follow:
20th and 21st centuries

Which protected water area is bigger, Nha Trang Bay or Great Barrier Reef?	"First published January 2017 | Words and photos by Vietnam Coracle
INTRODUCTION | GUIDE | MAP | RELATED POSTS
Filled by the calm, glistening waters of the East Sea, Cam Ranh Bay, just south of Nha Trang, is a splendid natural harbour surrounded by hills. From its southern shores, a finger of land points northwards into the bay: This is Cam Lap Promontory, one of those rare places that’s easily accessible yet undeveloped and utterly beautiful. It’s the kind of place you fall in love with, and one that, for the time being, really does deserve the overused epithet of ‘hidden gem’. Beaches don’t get much better than this in Vietnam, and yet, if you visit on a weekday (avoiding weekends and national holidays), you will probably have the chalky, white-sand, boulder-studded beaches and mirror-flat, jade-blue sea all to yourself. This is my guide to one of my favourite corners of coastal Vietnam.
GUIDE: CAM LAP PROMONTORY
Often dubbed ‘Vietnam’s Maldives’, Cam Lap Promontory is in the perfect stage of development: fairly easily accessible but far enough from the beaten track to ensure that few travellers make it here; a handful of good accommodation options but large-scale construction has yet to arrive; locals are welcoming and friendly to foreign travellers, not cynical and predatory as they can be in the more popular beach towns. Cam Lap Promontory makes a rewarding day trip from Nha Trang or Phan Rang, or as a destination in itself for those who like their sandy beaches less trodden. Weather in Cam Ranh Bay is pretty good year-round and it receives less rain than Nha Trang, just 70km to the north. My favourite time to visit is the height of the dry season, from January to April.
I’ve divided this guide into 4 sections: click an item below to read more about it:

professor asking twitter book suggestions law students what was main conclusion	"No, I am not a scientist, and really this experiment started out very innocently. I wanted to find out what great books there were available (as a gift) about Social Media. What is it? Why do it? What results can you expect? Is it fun? SOOOO, I thought that certainly the best place to find out about Social Media might be through, well, Social Media – and in this case Twitter (and a quick try on LinkedIn). I know I could have used a search engine, but I wanted to hear from all of those people that I trust and respect. I was not prepared for the onslaught of silence that I received. AND I didn’t just send one tweet, I sent FIVE – yes 5 – I will repeat 5. See below:
- Can anyone suggest a great Social Media book that I can buy for someone for Christmas? Gotta be encouraging and easy to read!
- Still looking for info on good books on #SocialMedia. How it works, why do it and what to expect. Any help?
- Want to buy a good book on #SocialMedia. How it works, why do it and what to expect. Any suggestions?
- You know I find it interesting that I essentially tweeted the SAME Social Media info request 3 times and got 1 response. Why? worth a blog
- I am going to try this one more time. Looking for a book on #SocialMedia - how it works, why to use it, gauge its success. any suggestions?
Hard to understand? I even hashtagged it! I got a grand total of 2 responses. The first one came from HRmarketer.com, which also happens to be the company I work for. Congratulations team – you were watching the Twitter conversations just like we tell our clients to do.
Then on my last Tweet, @Herzwords contacted me with a great suggestion. I would have thought that if the companies who have solutions surrounding the confusing world of Social Media, would have been contacting me with suggestions of the books, ebooks, articles, white papers that they have. Not good.
Now like with any experiement, we review the process, and create a Hypothesis/conclusion.
- Well the very sad part is that all of my followers, really are not interested in helping me, or don’t have the information to help me."	<urn:uuid:7c11ef7e-d994-490b-a820-841b3ace6f8b>	0.0
Do cats with leptospirosis and liver disease both show increased thirst and urination?	"In one study, dogs were dosed daily for one year (52 weeks) without a report of a serious adverse event. Additionally, an investigation into Bravecto® by Snopes also put facts to the falsehoods, finding them UNPROVEN.
Effects of Bravecto® in Dogs and Cats
The flea and tick medication Bravecto® is a systemic antiparasitic drug given by mouth or topically. The medicine spreads through the bloodstream to all areas of the skin. It kills the flea or tick when it tries to bite and is then exposed to the active ingredient.
Bravecto® works by inhibiting the nervous system of insects. It does not have any effect on the nervous system of animals. In fact, it is excreted unchanged through the pet’s liver and kidneys. Since its introduction in 2014, Bravecto® has provided longer-lasting flea and tick protection and as of 2020 more than 125 million doses distributed in 85 countries.
The best most frequently reported adverse reaction in dogs in both the active control groups was vomiting. Other side effects occasionally seen in dogs include decreased appetite, diarrhea, lethargy, excessive thirst and flatulence. Bravecto® formulations are safe for pregnant, breeding and lactating dogs. Use with caution in dogs with a history of seizures or neurologic disorders.
For cats Bravecto® is available as a topical or an oral medication given every 2 months. Side effects in cats may include vomiting, itching, diarrhea, hair loss, decreased appetite, lethargy, and scabs/ulcerated lesions, increased liver enzymes, or hyper-salivation. It should be used with caution in cats with a history of neurologic disorders.
Bravecto® is a valuable antiparasite treatment that contributes to the health of millions of dogs and cats. By killing fleas, ticks and mites, it promotes dog health worldwide by protecting them against dangerous parasite infestations that are known to lead to disease transmission, blood loss, local irritation, and skin allergies. Flea, tick, and mite exposure poses a much more significant risk of transmitting a devastating disease to your pet or yourself."	<urn:uuid:2d131609-e2c6-4d73-a876-89c4f821a375>	0.0
How long did Yacov Sharir and Keith Saunders work in dance?	"Was Yosef absolving his brothers of all responsibility since it was all part of the Divine plan, or were the brothers responsible for their brutal behavior despite the fact that all worked out?
The Midrash (Tanchuma Vayigash Siman 5) sheds light on this dynamic. Immediately prior to Yosef’s revelation, the heated exchange between Yosef and his brothers becomes dangerously close to turning violent. Yosef understood that he must reveal his identity. “Yosef said to his brothers, ‘Did you not tell me that your brother died? In fact, I purchased him, and I will bring him out to you.’ At this point Yosef called out, ‘Yosef son of Yacov come to me, Yosef son of Yacov come to me and speak with your brothers who sold you.’ The brothers began scanning all corners of the room to catch a glimpse of their long-lost brother. Yosef turned and said to them, ‘Why do you look here and there? I am Yosef your brother.’ In that moment their souls left their bodies, and they were unable to answer him.”
Yosef was conflicted; on one hand he was overjoyed to see his brothers and feel a sense of belonging and familial security. On the other hand, Yosef realized that these were the very men who turned an indifferent ear to his cries; these were the men who were supposed to be his beloved protectors but instead became rage-filled antagonists. These were the men who were ready to murder their own flesh and blood. Perhaps, I cannot have a relationship with them. Perhaps, it is better to remain distant and repay them in kind so they can suffer as I did. And so, Yosef calls out, “Yosef the son of Yaakov come to me, Yosef the son of Yaakov come to me”. He is looking for his self, for his identity. Who should I be? What should I do? Should I seek revenge or reconciliation?
Yosef finds resolution with one simple phrase – I am Yosef your brother. I choose to be your brother and not an indifferent, vengeful tyrant. I make this choice not because you have earned it; I make this choice because it is best for me."	<urn:uuid:2bf34ce2-15f7-4ff2-88f7-aaa124446123>	0.0
what was average speed record breaking million franc delahaye compared to circuit du sud ouest speed record	"Last month the 2018 Honda Civic Type R set a new record in Belgium and now the hot hatch has done it again by setting a new record at the Silverstone GP circuit in the UK. The 2018 Civic Type R set a new front-wheel drive production car record, which was previously held by the 2016 Civic Type R.
For its latest record setting sprint, the Honda Civic Type R was piloted by British Touring Car Championship winner Matt Neal. According to Neal, “Where I found the real advantage of the Type R was really in the high-speed corners – the stability which is a combination of the aero and the new advanced suspension system. Into corners like Copse and Stowe at the end of the Hangar straight, you can carry big entry speed with supreme confidence.”
The latest record time at the Silverstone circuit is the fourth lap record for the new Honda Civic Type R. It all started in last April at the Nürburgring Nordschleife, where the Civic Type R set with a lap time of 7mins 43.8 seconds. Shortly after that WTCR driver, Esteban Guerrieri set a new record at the ‘Type R Challenge 2018’ with a 2 mins 1.51 seconds lap record for a front-wheel drive production car at the Magny-Cours GP circuit in France. Most recently Bertrand Baguette recorded a time of 2 minutes 53.72 seconds in the same car at Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium."	<urn:uuid:8435b90a-9418-46e5-b80c-b0a09cfb8209>	0.0

I've been reading about ancient religious clothing and was wondering what kind of precious stones were used in the first row of the breastplate that they made?	"Paula's monument was Jerome's life-work--his letters, his doctrinal treatises, his commentaries, but above all, his Latin version of the Hebrew Scriptures--the Vulgate. And what a unique monument it is!
All the Anglo-Saxon translations, not to speak of others, were made from it, as was also the English version of Wyklif, while its influence in Tyndale's and subsequent English versions was most profound. It was the first book to come from the press of Gutenberg, a copy of which Bible is the most prized volume in the world today. But a still more signal honor awaited it, for it was decreed by the Council of Trent, that ""the old and Vulgate edition,"" approved ""by the usage of so many ages,"" should be the only Latin version used in ""public lectures, disputations, sermons and expositions."" And so far-reaching has been its influence through the centuries that the religious terminology of the languages of Western Europe has in great part been derived from or colored by the Vulgate.
Nor is this all. As is well known, most of the modern languages of Europe have been formed under the influence of, and as the result of the fecundity of, the ancient Latin. But the Latin from which these languages have been fashioned was not the language of Cicero, or of Virgil, popular as he was during the Middle Ages, but the language of the Church and of the Bible--the language of the Vulgate--which was created by Jerome acting under the inspiration of Paula. It is the Vulgate, which was the first book of which the nascent languages of medieval times essayed a translation, the first book of which an attempt at translation was made in the French of the twelfth century, and in the German of the eighth century. It is the Vulgate, with its admirable narratives, with the fascinating simplicity of Genesis, with its charming pictures of the infancy of the human race that supplied the needed language in which to address the barbarians from the North, when they first came under the beneficent influence of Christian civilization.
Our fathers were wont to cover the Vulgate with gold and precious stones. And they did more."	<urn:uuid:dfabd2bb-7340-4b51-ba7f-6b713c2a2bc8>	0.0
I'm curious about the unique steam engines at Crofton - what makes them special compared to other historic machines?	"The Wisconsin Automotive Museum displays more than ninety collectible autos including such rarities as a Hudson Essex Terraplane, a Reo Flying Cloud, and a Pierce-Arrow. The collection also includes vintage American standards such as Pontiacs, Studebakers, Chevrolets and Fords, all arranged in the striking Art Deco interior of Wisconsin's largest auto museum. But the real stars of the museum are two Wisconsin-made automobiles: the Kissel, which was manufactured in Hartford from 1906 to 1931, and the Nash, which was built in Kenosha from 1916 to 1957. The museum also displays a collection of automobile signs and advertising art, as well as license plates, spark plugs and oil cans. A series of industrial and outboard engines built in Hartford from 1936-1992 is also exhibited, along with a huge operating layout of Lionel trains.
105 years in the making, the Harley-Davidson Museum opened its doors to the public in 2008.

What specific measures has Beneteau implemented to reduce their environmental impact in their industrial operations?	"Return/Recall Service Support
A product recall or return is normally a high stress and time sensitive events but that does not mean that sustainability and environmental considerations should not apply. Our specific suite of services enhance the sustainability of each step in the recall process with a focus on conserving energy and achieving measureable, net-positive sustainable results at reasonable costs. From transportation to disassembly, segregation, storage, recycling/destruction, and disposal, customers receive guidance on how to most efficiently and effectively minimize their environmental impact and meet sustainability goals.
Stericycle will manage through the urgent, critical nature or recall event to ensure no environmental penalties for any number of regulatory violations will result. These penalties can have more than just an immediate financial impact—they can also dramatically interrupt business operations or impact brand image. Our experience and unmatched knowledge of environmental regulations and regulatory agencies ensures our clients avoid costly fines.
Minimizing Our Footprint
Beyond the services we provide our customers, we recognize the importance of minimizing the direct impact our own operations have on the environment and communities. While, by law, a small portion of the medical wastes we handle must be incinerated, we are constantly looking for ways to reduce the impact of this disposal method or seek opportunities for electric cogeneration when incineration is used.
To reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions, Stericycle leverages sophisticated transportation logistics and telemetry technology. The impact of such technology in Canada and the U.S. has resulted in a significant reduction in the total number of miles driven. In 2014, our fleet traveled 2.5 million fewer miles in Canada and the United States.

How do blazar plasma jets accelerate particles, and what technology detects them at the South Pole?	"Dawn of Plasma Age
In recent years, there has been a virtual eruption of plasma applications. It seems safe to say that here at the beginning of the 21st century, we are also at the dawn of plasma age.
Plasma has a number of characteristics which make it useful. Because of its exceedingly high temperatures - 10,000 to 20,000°C - we may use plasma technology to separate out various gases and liquids which are harmful to humans and the environment.
This ability has proved beneficial in the production of optical fibre, an essential new material in modern communications. Optical fibre is produced from refined quartz. Japan, for example, imports this quartz from Brazil. In the refining process there, charcoal is used and carbon monoxide, a deadly poison gas, is a by-product. Hot plasmas, however, can dissipate the carbon monoxide and thus reduce the hazards to those working in or living close to the quartz refineries.
The ability of plasma to form new coatings is another very useful property. While the plasma temperature must be high, it is not necessary that the matter to be modified need to be the same temperature - this in contrast to the ordinary chemical processes. In this way, a thin metal coating can be applied to the surface of a plastic lens, say, without melting the plastic. When plasma particles and other gaseous particles come together on the surface of solid materials, many useful reactions occur.
Since the plasma particles (atoms, molecules, charged ions) are pure energy, they stick on a number of surfaces - metal, ceramics, plastic, glass, fabric, wood. The plasma particles actually penetrate the atoms of the solid target, forming a very strong and hard surface. Some of the typical uses here are for drills and other cutting tools, anticorrosion piping (oil, artificial blood tubes), anti-friction coating, anti-rusting, or even the application of gilt to decorative jewellery items.
Lessen Air Conditioning
Plasma technology makes a major contribution to energy conservation through its ability to coat window glass and thereby reduce infra-red rays. Air conditioning is a major consumer of electricity in hot climates and during summertimes. Infrared rays normally pass through glass windows and help to warm a room. By using plasma technology to coat windows, infra-red warming can be cut, thus reducing air conditioning needs.
It has been found that the cost of such plasma coating is more than justified by the reduction in electricity costs."	<urn:uuid:1d21ac6b-5951-48f5-9f95-92323edb00cd>	0.0
How much more expensive are investment fees in other countries compared to the United States for regular mutual funds?	"Investors may think twice before hopping from fund to fund or chasing the latest hot performance because they have a real incentive to stick around and ensure long-term treatment of their gains. As it is, investors often have no built-up gain and thus no frictional costs for hopping from fund to fund.
2. Create parity between mutual funds and other investment vehicles.
Mutual funds offer investors diversification and professional management, and many come with a reasonable price tag. Yet, stocks, exchange-traded funds, and separately managed accounts have a leg up in attracting investors because they are inherently friendlier from a tax standpoint. With stocks, investors pay gains based on when they transact and thus can control their own destiny with their buy and sell decisions. The ETF structure allows management to scrub the portfolio of capital gains using inflows or redemptions, thus avoiding capital gains in all but the rarest cases. All of these vehicles are means to an investing end, and there's no good reason why mutual funds--one of the more shareholder-friendly and widely owned investment types--should sit at such a disadvantage in this regard.
In fact, the United States would not be alone if it made this change. Most countries tax their mutual fund equivalents just as they do other investments, or they don't tax them at all, thus encouraging investing."	<urn:uuid:26869e60-5b32-48d4-8137-c472fc16dcd6>	0.0

I've heard about the Progressive Automotive X Prize competition - what was the winning innovation and has it made it to the market?	"WHAT: Racing against the clock and each other at Irwindale Speedway, 10 teams of the Southland's top high school auto technology students will repair disabled Ford cars during the 2006 Ford/AAA Student Auto Skills Competition state finals.
The competition requires repairs to be made with the highest quality work in the lowest total time. The winning pair from the So. Calif., or the No. Calif. contest held concurrently in Danville, Calif., will represent the state at the national finals on June 25 in Dearborn, MI.
WHY: Trained automotive technicians are among the most sought-after and highly paid professionals in today's job market, but many high schools are scaling back or eliminating their automotive programs due to lack of funding and/or trained teachers. The annual demand for qualified auto technicians exceeds the supply by about 35,000 and the auto repair industry is predicted to increase in size. This skills competition has been in place since 1949 as part of an effort to attract and train more young people for automotive professions.

How many protons are needed to make one ATP?	"Protons Are What Make Elements Distinct
All matter, including mineral crystals, is made up of atoms. All atoms are made up of three main particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons have a positive charge, neutrons have no charge, and electrons have a negative charge. Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, but electrons have a mass that is 10,000 times smaller.
The element hydrogen (H) has the simplest atoms. Most hydrogen atoms have just one proton and one electron. The proton forms the nucleus (the centre of the atom), while the electron orbits around it (Figure 5.5, left). All other elements have more than one proton in their nucleus. Protons repel each other because they are positively charged, but it is possible to have more than one proton in a nucleus because neutrons hold them together. The next most complex atom, helium (He) has two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus, in its most common form. Some atoms of the same element can have different numbers of neutrons. For example, forms of hydrogen exist with one and two neutrons, and a tiny fraction of He atoms have only one neutron. Forms of an element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.
The number of protons in an atom determines what element it will be, so the number of protons is called the atomic number of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is the mass number. The mass number distinguishes between isotopes of an element. Isotopes of an element are denoted by putting the mass number as a subscript in front of the symbol for that element. For example, the isotopes of hydrogen are 1H (1 proton), 2H (1 proton + 1 neutron), and 3H (1 proton + 2 neutrons).
For most of the 16 lightest elements (up to oxygen) the number of neutrons is equal to the number of protons. For most of the remaining elements, there are more neutrons than protons. This is because the more protons that are concentrated in a small space, the more neutrons are needed to keep the nucleus together. The most common isotope of uranium (U), for example, is 238U."	<urn:uuid:89ea6050-9047-4a6b-a97c-59b612addd4c>	0.0
eagle scout project approval steps needed	"On Sunday, Aug. 12, Troop 50 bestowed the Boy Scouts of America’s highest rank during a ceremony honoring new Eagle Scout Nicholas Emil “Nick” van Zuk. He is the son of Rose-Marie Zuk and the late Dr. Gary Zuk of Auburn. At the time of his Eagle Scout Board of Review, Nick was the troop’s youngest Eagle Scout and its 15th since its founding in 2012.
Nick’s ceremony, held at Monarch Estates senior living and retirement community — the site of his Eagle Scout Leadership Service Project — included many of his fellow Scouts and adult leaders who have been in Scouting with him since his days as a Cub Scout, and who have served with him in a variety of troop leadership positions. It also included his pastor, Rev. Msgr. William Skoneki of St. Michael’s Catholic Church, who offered the invocation.
After accepting the “Eagle Scout Charge” from Scoutmaster Andrew Baird, Nick’s mother, Rose, the Eagle Scout medal on Nick and presented him with an Eagle Scout neckerchief slide. He in turn presented his mother with an Eagle Scout mother’s pin. Mr. Baird presented Nick with a framed Eagle Scout medal, noting that Nick was the first Eagle Scout in the troop to have enough merit badges at the time of his Eagle Scout Board of Review to receive all three Eagle Scout palms. Concluding the troop’s recognition was Chartered Organization Representative Michael Tullier, who acknowledged the troop’s gift of membership in the National Eagle Scout Association.
Also on hand for the ceremony was Ron Anders, Ward 2 councilman and mayor pro tem for the City of Auburn. On behalf of the city and Mayor Bill Ham, Mr. Anders congratulated Nick on his achievement and his example of leadership. In recognition of those achievements, Mr. Anders presented Nick with a proclamation declaring Aug. 12, 2018, as “Nicholas Emil van Zuk Eagle Scout Day.”
|Nick honors the contributions of Mark Hankess, one of five individuals he presented with Eagle Scout mentor pins.|
During Nick’s closing remarks, he acknowledged his fellow Scouts and the adult leaders who had supported his efforts to earn the Eagle Scout rank. As is customary, he singled out individuals who played a special role, presenting each with an Eagle Scout mentor pin."	<urn:uuid:6115c116-784b-4391-b5ba-28cbe891cd0d>	0.0

I'm a workshop owner and I've been thinking about getting a band saw. What features make it good for different types of cuts, and what safety measures should I keep in mind to prevent injuries?	"Increasing Student Interaction in Class
I have just prepared next Tuesday's workshop on 'Increasing Student Interaction in Class'. It is the first time this one has been offered and I'm pretty enthusiastic about the topic. So far there are 8 people enrolled, which will just about be enough for me to take the approach which I think is crucial: this workshop, of all workshops, cannot be a pure and simple powerpoint presentation where participants sit and listen! I have to model, so far as I can, what I want to communicate. So I have worked out what I hope will be an hour's session that is almost entirely interactive, and at the times when it isn't, this too has a specific reason and point to convey. The biggest challenge for me, and probably the biggest novelty for the participants, will be the use of clickers, but I'm excited about trying these out for myself. I have to admit my participants will be my guinea pigs, but I've had a good introduction to clickers from Hannah in the Teaching Grid and this context is absolutely perfect for trying them out in safety. I trust that those attending will not eat me alive or the workshop slide into chaos and bedlum! I've done some reading to back up my thinking about the benefits of student interaction in class, although this is fairly familiar territory for me, and I have also spent some time finding and watching a variety of vodcasts on YouTube, especially about the use of clickers in class. Somewhat frustratingly, I haven't actually found a vodcast which actually models good practice in the use of clickers. Most do exactly what I've been at pains to avoid in my session: lots of talk about the benefits, lots of 'presentations', but lamentably little which demonstrates a full-length class where they are integral to the session and where the lecturer models excellent practice. Maybe there's a niche here...
Are there likely to be any other challenges that I have to cope with? Yes, if the clickers don't work, or if I haven't got a sufficiently good grasp of how they are used. I'm always a bit nervous when it's a first time using something, but I have done my prep and the TG staff will be around to help out if need be. I shall go to the Grid at least an hour early to make sure all is in order."	<urn:uuid:9860c4ac-3a4c-4230-bd96-9b9b4d895a65>	0.0
I've noticed my sprouts sometimes ferment when I'm rinsing them - what's the proper rinsing technique to prevent fermentation during the sprouting process?	"Coconut Water Kefir
This is a popular variation on water kefir made with coconut water. Fresh coconut water is best if you can get it. Pasteurized bottled coconut water works fine too.
Updated: Mon, 05/13/2019 - 8:51pm
- 4 cups of coconut water
- 1 Tablespoon of water kefir grains
- Fruit (optional). Blueberries, mango, lilikoi, pineapple and guava work well.
- Sterilize a quart-sized glass jar and it's lid. Wash you hands, utensils and work space well.
- Rinse the kefir grains in non-chlorinated water and add them to the jar. Cover with coconut water.
- Set on the counter, in a dark place, with the lid loose. Leave for twelve hours.
- Check for fermentation. It should taste yogurty, not sweet and have a slight fizziness. If it is still sweet, or tastes like “weird coconut water” leave it out for another 12 hours, then test it again.
- Once it is fermented to your liking strain out the grains. Be careful to keep them clean and not touch them. They like to be handled with wood, plastic, ceramics or glass - not metal.
- The kefir is ready to drink. If you want to store the kefir, add some fruit to the liquid, then tighten the lid of your bottle or jar and refrigerate. The kefir will ferment more slowly in the refrigerator and get more fizzy. The fruit will supply it with some sugar to eat while it is fermenting.
- Store the grains in fresh water and sugar in a jar in the fridge, rinsing and changing them every week. Or use them ferment another batch of kefir, starting again at Step 1.
- Making coconut kefir is said to be hard on water kefir grains. It is recommended to set some of the grains aside, storing them in sugar water, to keep them strong and healthy for later use."	<urn:uuid:905004b1-3946-4df7-b084-d267e9d39031>	0.0

Pages 10 (2510 words)
Analysis and Evaluation of Moises Silva's ""A Case for Calvinistic Hermeneutics"" Hermeneutics defines the discipline and subject of completely deriving theories, principles and other methods that are used in day to day interpretation of texts. This is specially used to make a better and easier understanding of texts and information that is written in a complex manner…
There is a need to replace the complex ancient words with evolving words that are understood in the current context, especially with the readers. Traditional hermeneutics have focused on ensuring the ancient texts are traditionally interpreted to derive reasonable meaning according to the scriptures.1 This is an incident where many people encompass their knowledge in deriving meanings to texts that were written by ancient writers during the time of the events. In essence, the concentration on such interpretation is to derive the primary meaning of the historical scriptures, without distorting the meaning of the stated expressions. Therefore, skills and knowledge must be utterly used to make a possible meaning out of the scriptures, without relaying discordant information. According to Moises, the Calvinistic hermeneutics is an expression of the interpretation from the Calvinists. The Calvinists have their interpretation in accordance to the intended message from the historical writers, which is acceptable and understood. The Calvinists have their own theories, principles and methods that are entirely used in expressing their interpretation of the scriptures. ...

What makes leather production better for the environment in developed countries?	"The choice of an investment location by a multinational enterprise (MNE) is determined not only by firm‐specific variables that define the motive of foreign direct investment (FDI), but is also determined by variables that define locational aspects. The purpose of this paper is to report on the study of the constituents of production and logistics environment of a host country and its effect on FDI decisions of MNEs. The concept is introduced of supply chain capability (SCC) of countries, a long‐run variable based on the production and logistics environment, as shaping the FDI of MNEs.
The research uses regression analyses on secondary data to test the research hypotheses.
The analysis substantiates the basic proposition of SCC of a country being a determinant of FDI, and that its effect varies with the size of the host country's economy. Further, the study suggests a differential impact of SCC on developing and developed countries. The study also confirms that SCC is a determinant of vertical and export‐platform FDI but not of horizontal FDI.
The study has limitations, in that the unit of analysis is a country. Countries, however, are not homogeneous in their SCC. Thus, regional differences or sectoral differences have not been taken into account.
By providing a holistic view, SCC helps MNEs in taking a more integrated view of a location's attractiveness. The study also has relevance and prescriptive value, especially for small developing countries which are seeking to improve their attractiveness as a FDI destination.

As someone interested in ocean conservation, I'd like to know what's the difference between how marine protected areas help with scientific research in the Philippines versus Australia?	"New data could help inform conservation policies
By Summit Voice
SUMMIT COUNTY — University of British Columbia researchers say they’ve identified key areas where fishing pressure — driven by the lure of profits — outweighs the appetite for conservation.
The fisheries scientists combined economic data and fisheries population growth rates to develop a conservation risk index that shows the economic-conservation trade-offs of fishing.
The most at-risk areas include the northeastern coast of Canada, the Pacific coast of Mexico, the Peruvian coast, the south Pacific (offshore of New Zealand in particular), the southern and southeastern coast of Africa, and the Antarctic region.
According the study results, these areas are the most biologically and economically vulnerable to overfishing.
“This index gives us a clear guide to determine the appropriate conservation and fisheries management policy for each region,” said William Cheung, an assistant professor in UBC’s Fisheries Centre, who presented his research during a press briefing at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Vancouver, Canada.
“The most vulnerable area may need to be protected with special management approaches – such as marine protected areas, while others may benefit from economic incentives to better manage the ecosystems – such as territorial use rights in fisheries, or TURFs,” saidRashid Sumaila, professor and director of the UBC Fisheries Centre.
The index can also help conservation managers use scarce resources in a targeted, efficient and effective way to ensure the conservation of seafood and marine ecosystems, Sumaila adds.
“Fishing has a major impact on marine biodiversity, causing the depletion of many species,” said Cheung, who grew up in Hong Kong and focused his earlier research on fisheries in the South China Sea — one of the most over-exploited areas in the world’s oceans.
“I witnessed how overfishing can damage marine ecosystems and the goods and services they provide — but in order to solve the problem, we need an understanding of both biology and economics. Biology determines whether a stock is more vulnerable to fishing, while economics determines how strong the incentive is to overfish the stock now.”
The conservation risk index is based on two numbers: the discount rate and intrinsic population growth rate for fisheries. The discount rate for the fisheries is how much a dollar of fish would be worth now if one were to get this dollar one year later – similar to the long-term lending interest rate of central banks. The intrinsic population growth rate is the difference between the birth and death rate."	<urn:uuid:80a6bafb-fdfb-47a9-a344-106f9f56e362>	0.0

Uranus in Taurus square Mars in Aquarius brings to life the humanitarian needs behind the laws of the land, and the relationship between humans and nature. The need to stand up for what is fair and ethical for the group and not for only the individual means “we are all in this together.” It may link the ideals of human law to a larger, natural law. Or, in a surprising manner, show how nature’s power can eclipse human power—and almost in an instant. There is a deep and important relationship to Uranus’s mission in Taurus and the idea of the Mars mission through Aquarius, the ruler of Uranus. This is an important month to examine humanitarian values, even though it is challenging on many levels. A push from Mars may awaken Uranus energy. Uranus and Aquarius are both linked to genius. Genius is the ability to act and think in ways that are new/novel and have never been taught to us.

How does the U.S.-Japan Okinawa Reversion Agreement of 1969 handle the issue of nuclear weapons in Okinawa, and what special provisions were included?	"Mark E. Manyin
Specialist in Asian Affairs
Since the mid-1990s, tensions have spiked periodically among Japan, China, and Taiwan over the disputed Senkaku (Diaoyu/Diaoyutai) islets in the East China Sea. These flare-ups run the risk of involving the United States in an armed conflict in the region. Japan administers the eight small, uninhabited islets, which some geologists believe sit near significant oil and natural gas deposits. China and Taiwan both contest Japanese claims of sovereignty over the islets.
U.S. administrations going back at least to the Nixon Administration have stated that the United States takes no position on the territorial disputes. However, it also has been U.S. policy since 1972 that the 1960 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty covers the islets, because Article 5 of the treaty stipulates that the United States is bound to protect “the territories under the Administration of Japan” and Japan administers the Senkakus (Diaoyu Islands). Under the treaty, the United States guarantees Japan’s security in return for the right to station U.S. troops—which currently number around 50,000—in dozens of bases throughout the Japanese archipelago. Although it is commonly understood that Japan will assume the primary responsibility for the defense of the treaty area, in the event of a significant armed conflict with either China or Taiwan, most Japanese would likely expect that the United States would honor its treaty obligations.
Each time tensions over the islets have flared, questions have arisen concerning the U.S. legal relationship to the islets. This report will focus on that issue, which has four elements:
- U.S. administration of the Senkakus (Diaoyu Islands) from 1953 to 1971;
- the application to the Senkakus (Diaoyu Islands) of the 1971 “Treaty Between Japan and the United States of America Concerning the Ryukyu Islands and the Daito Islands”—commonly known as the Okinawa Reversion Treaty, approved by the Senate in 1971 and entered into force the following year (the Daito Islands lie to the east of Okinawa);
- the U.S. view on the claims of the disputants; and
- the relationship of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty to the islets."	<urn:uuid:3fefd35e-e8e6-413b-8dc8-bb5ec4a19c20>	0.0
best temperature and conditions to store feijoa fruit long time	"In general, the skin holds a little tighter to the fruit than in the standard tangerine.
Now that you’re hungry for all these different types of oranges, how do you know how to pick out and store the best of these citrus wonders? Here are a few tips.
|Tips for when you’re at the store
- Except for tangerines, all citrus should feel firm with a smooth, tight skin.
- The fruit should be heavy in the hand. If you pick up two or three, choose the heaviest one in the bunch.
- Some citrus are coated with a thin, food-grade wax so they don’t dry out in storage. Thus, they may not smell as ripe as they actually are.
- Look for sales. Because citrus are perishable, grocery stores are often eager to turn over the stock. Get them while the getting’s good!
- Avoid any oranges and the like with soft or squishy spots.
|Tips for when you’ve got the fruit home
- Store oranges, tangerines and mandarins at room temperature for a few days, maybe up to a week.
- Longer than that, put them in the crisper drawer for up to six weeks.
- However, remove them from the fridge an hour or so before eating so they’re not ice-cold. They taste best near or at room temperature.
Everyone loves those little orange sections in salads — the perfect little morsels without any white pith. They’re called supremes — and they take a little practice to make. Here’s how:
Cut off a small slice of the fruit’s top and bottom so the round citrus can stand steadily on the counter. Use a sharp paring knife to cut the rind off the flesh in long arcs, starting at the top and following the natural curve of the fruit to the bottom. Cut far enough into the flesh to remove the white pith but not so far as to damage the pulp. Once peeled, hold the fruit in your hand and use a paring knife to cut between the flesh and the white membranes separating the individual segments. Allow the segments to fall into a bowl. Discard any membranes, the pith and the peel. Click here to see a how-to video"	<urn:uuid:0787932e-7a7d-45c5-9cd8-68098b7ff127>	0.0

In this case air stones are also recommended as they prefer well oxygenated water. It is a good community fish that can be kept with other peaceful fish. Suitable tank mates include peaceful cyprinids such as the Harlequin Rasbora, Trigonostigma heteromorpha and many of the other rasboras, Kuhlii Loach and its relatives, many of the Tetras, smaller catfish like Corydoras species and smaller Rainbowfish. Some of the peaceful barbs also work well but it should not be kept with those fishes that are notorious fin nippers like Tiger Barbs, Clown Barbs, guppies, as well as other anabantoids, including Bettas.
Breeding Dwarf gouramis
The Dwarf Gourami can breed in captive condition. The male gourami builds a floating bubble nest in which the female lays eggs. The water level of the tank should be reduced to 7–10 cm during spawning and the temperature should be approximately 82 °F. The aquarium must be planted with suitable plant species like Ceratopteris thalictroides, Limnophila aquatica,Riccia fluitans and Vesicularia dubyana. To build a bubble nest the male uses bits of vegetation in its nest. In nature it adds leaves, twigs, roots, peat fibers, and other debris to build a nest. The spawning session lasts for two to four hours and the female produces 300 to 800 eggs. After spawning the female should be moved to a different tank. The male picks up eggs in his mouth and put them in bubble nest and continues to guard the eggs until they hatch. The eggs hatch in about 12-36 hours, but the fry stay in the bubble nest and continue developing. In about 3 days fry become free swimming and leave the nest. At this time the male should be removed to prevent eating the young."	<urn:uuid:868f3c36-7a1e-4618-9d5c-1c60eacbfbf0>	0.0

how did gunpowder spread from china west	"The Great Fire of London was huge, destroying the majority of the city.
The great fire swept through the city from Sunday 2nd of September to Wednesday 5th of September 1666. The portion of the city inside the ancient roman walls was completely gutted. It came close to the aristocratic district of Westminster, Whitehall, and most of the suburban slums, but it was extinguished before it reached them.
St. Paul's Cathedral was consumed, as were 13,200 houses, and 87 parish churches (out of a total 95).
About 75 thousand people were left homeless.
Only 6 people were officially recorded as being killed in the fire, though in reality the number must have been higher. Despite this the real numbers were also traditionally very low, though it is accepted that many refugees did die in the impromptu camps which resulted. Personally i find this surprising, however, I suppose once the fire was in full flow, the whole city knew about it, and fled from the fire as it spread. Despite this though i think the real figure must have been much higher, at least hundreds, and probably thousands. This was 1666, and the real number of people in London would have been impossible to know, many of the missing poor would have gone unreported as missing, and the fire would have been so fierce that remains would have been hard to find, especially under the rubble of the city.
The fire started in Thomas Farriner's bakery on pudding lane, in the early hours of the Sunday morning, spreading west across the city. The wind fanned the flames and the fire quickly got out of control. Spreading west, then north the fire spread through the center of the city.
Eventually the strong easterly winds died down, and the firefighting force used gunpowder to demolish buildings in the path of the fire to create effective firebreaks.
The Fire put an end to the plague at the time, which is thougth to have actually saved a great many lives.
The city was reconstructed on much the same street layout.
What is clear is that many people will have died, and many more would have been displaced, Charles II encouraged refugees to move elsewhere away from London, as the city was not able to cope with the population which wished to stay in the city."	<urn:uuid:735a62d0-c002-443d-9127-673de7106549>	0.0

I'm doing research for my college assignment and was wondering what's the main difference between how old school scientists and modern researchers think about their own influence on what they study?	"Since at least the end of World War II, the United States has arguably been the major center for advanced research in science and technology. This has been possible, at least in part, because many of the best and brightest students and scholars have come to study or carry out research at our world-class research universities and in our centers of industry.
One wonders, however, how much longer the United States will enjoy this primacy if our government continues to place ideology above scientific results, both in public policy initiatives and in support of fundamental research.
Concern about government distortion of scientific results has been growing among scientists over the past six years. In February 2004, for example, 60 prominent American scientists, among which I was privileged to count myself, voiced their concern over the misuses of science by the current Bush administration — including the manipulation of public access to information resulting from scientific studies, disbanding scientific advisory committees, placing unqualified individuals on these committees, and suppressing or altering reports by government scientists. Since that time, more than 9,000 additional scientists have signed on to this call for scientific integrity in government.
Attempts to distort science have not been limited to the federal government. In numerous states, including my own, Ohio, state school boards have attempted to alter the teaching of high school science to give students the impression that various bedrocks of modern science, including evolutionary biology, are somehow “suspect.” Via a disingenuous campaign called “Teach the Controversy,” various groups that oppose the teaching of evolution on religious grounds have helped to convince many among the public that evolution is not on firm scientific ground — in spite of the fact that almost all of modern biology is based on the predictions of evolution, which have successfully confronted experiment and observation for more than 100 years.
One might argue that distorting evolutionary biology for some high school students will not impede the education of our country’s very brightest students, those who may go on to become tomorrow’s scientific stars. In at least one area, however, government interference has already begun to put prominent researchers in this country at a disadvantage: stem-cell research.
Because of government restrictions on the use of embryonic stem cells, American researchers are forced to either seek private funding for their work or go abroad. There has already been a minor exodus of such researchers to places like the United Kingdom and Singapore, where there is active support for this important area of biomedical research."	<urn:uuid:acb7ebda-7098-4166-9d92-a02f2822683f>	0.0

error ellipse vs pca axis meaning difference	"We have freedom to choose what these six dimensions are. Based on my description of the problem, it would seem that the most obvious way to choose these dimensions would be exactly what I said — position and velocity. Together, these bits of information can be represented as two three-dimensional vectors, the orbital position vector and the orbital velocity vector . Together, these are called the orbital state vectors, and they are enough to completely describe an orbit.
For practical purposes, however, this is not a very useful way of describing an orbit. Yes, knowing where we are and how we are moving gives us enough information to completely describe what we are doing, but it would be far more useful to find a set of parameters that more directly describes the shape of the orbit. The traditional set is known as the Keplerian orbital elements.
Named for Johannes Kepler, who discovered that all of the planets move in elliptical orbits, these orbital elements describe the size, shape, and orientation of the orbit. For a basic two-body problem, such as a spacecraft orbiting a spherical planet, neglecting things like the gravitational influence of other bodies, the orbit will always be a conic section — a circle, an ellipse, a parabola, or a hyperbola, with the body to be orbited at one of the foci of the section. For our purposes, we will not consider parabolas and hyperbolas, which are for escape trajectories. Instead, we will focus only on circles and ellipses. For simplicity’s sake, let’s say that the planet is located at the point on the diagram below.
Let’s go through the six parameters now:
The first parameter we will look at is eccentricity. Eccentricity is a single number that describes the shape of our ellipse. On the diagram at right, the eccentricity is defined by the ratio of the distance between the foci ( and ) and the major axis (the widest distance across the ellipse — from to ). An eccentricity of zero makes a perfect circle. As the eccentricity increases towards 1, the ellipse becomes flatter and flatter. Once the eccentricity reaches or surpasses 1, it’s no longer an ellipse — rather, a parabola or a hyperbola, i.e., an escape trajectory.
The next parameter we’ll explore is the semimajor axis. This parameter controls the size of the orbit."	<urn:uuid:199c7bb4-224e-4f8e-b24a-0f986b3dd98a>	0.0
working voice actor benefits creative freedom risks equipment damage	"Overall, upgrading your processor can be a cost-effective way to improve the performance of your computer without having to purchase a new system. It can save you money in the short term and extend the lifespan of your current system, making it a better value in the long run.
What are the risks of upgrading a processor?
Damage to the computer
Upgrading a processor in a computer can be a complex task that requires technical expertise. One of the main risks associated with upgrading a processor is the potential for damage to the computer. Improper installation can damage the processor or motherboard, which can result in costly repairs or even a complete system failure.
Additionally, electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage components and cause malfunctions. ESD is a static electricity charge that can build up on your body, and it can be discharged when you touch a metal object, such as a computer component. To prevent ESD damage, it is important to follow proper grounding procedures and use anti-static wrist straps when working with computer components.
In some cases, upgrading a processor may also require the replacement of other components, such as the cooling system, to ensure proper functionality. If these components are not installed correctly, it can lead to overheating and other issues that can damage the computer.
It is important to note that upgrading a processor can be a risky process, and it is recommended that only experienced computer technicians attempt it. If you are not comfortable with the installation process, it is best to seek professional assistance to avoid any potential damage to your computer.
Loss of warranty
Upgrading a processor may result in the loss of warranty on the computer. This means that if there are any issues with the computer after the upgrade, the manufacturer may not provide repairs or support. This can be a significant risk for those who rely on their computer for work or other important tasks.
It is important to note that the loss of warranty may not be the only risk associated with upgrading a processor. There may also be compatibility issues with other components of the computer, and the upgrade may not provide the desired performance boost. It is essential to research and carefully consider the potential risks and benefits before making the decision to upgrade a processor.
When upgrading a processor, one of the main risks is compatibility issues. These issues can arise when the new processor is not compatible with certain motherboards or other components in the computer. This can prevent the computer from working properly and can result in a significant loss of productivity."	<urn:uuid:83a75781-6fd7-464f-94f9-0512e2795f0e>	0.0

mazda rx7 first version power specs	"The 2017 Mazda 6 car is yet another release that has been announced by the Mazda company which is going to be released quite soon. The model is going to offered perhaps next year and is among the vehicle which have been getting an update coming out of the production line of Mazda. Mazda has also been on a tear as they have been providing cars left and right ever since the year started and have a number of new releases already lined up. But what the 2017 Mazda 6 has that other new releases do not is the added power and the quite strong output this vehicle has.
Other vehicles that Mazda is going to produce this year do not have a great output and are solid cars which are basically measured because of its value for money equation. This is perhaps the only vehicle that promises to offer some very high performance specs and also some very premier driving ability.
The vehicle is getting a slew of changes that are going to make it much better and quite handsome. The vehicle is going to become quite a looker and it is all thanks to the recognizable language design that Mazda is giving to all of its future model. Mix the performance and great design together and we are getting a very nice concept and a very good update for the 2017 Mazda 6. You can read all about it in our review which is going to help you get a better understanding what the latest release brings. Also check out the positional release date and the price ranges as well.
2017 Mazda 6 design
The 2017 Mazda 6 actually looks pretty amazing on the outside. Because of its great KODO design that Mazda uses for all of its vehicles, the vehicle has an absolutely cool looking design which is going to be one of its man advantages. All of the vehicles coming out of the Mazda lineup are actually incorporating this type of a design language and is what makes them unique and very handsome-looking.
The changes compared to the previous model include a much more angular grille to the front of the car which makes it look a little bit meaner than before. There is a huge bumper front bumper which combines with the already great looking front part of the car making it very interesting and much appreciative for the fans. The wheel arches are also great looking and are more muscular now. Compared to the sedan version, the coupe one has a more sporty look to it which is going to get much more attention than the previous model ever did."	<urn:uuid:ec5422a5-2eca-4017-9fd3-7b483a97e01f>	0.0
domestic abuse victim workplace rights nyc	"The penal code provides for a maximum punishment of life imprisonment for rape; however, most rapes were prosecuted in the magistrates' courts, which have a sentencing limit of 10 years. There were inconsistencies in the sentences imposed for rape by different magistrates; sentences generally ranged from one to six years' imprisonment. The Fiji Women's Rights Movement and the Fiji Women's Crisis Center pressed for more consistent and severe punishments for rape. The Court of Appeal has ruled that 10 years is the minimum appropriate sentence in child rape cases. Women's activists continued to press for the formal criminalization of spousal rape, which is not a specific offense; however, husbands have been convicted of raping their wives.
Although there is no specific law against domestic violence, it can be prosecuted as assault. Police claimed to practice a ""no-drop"" policy, under which they pursued investigations of domestic violence cases even if a victim later withdrew her accusation. However, women's organizations reported that although police generally were more responsive to domestic violence cases than in the past, they were not always consistent. Courts dismissed some cases of domestic abuse and incest or gave the perpetrators light sentences. Incest was widely believed to be underreported. Traditional practices of reconciliation between aggrieved parties were sometimes taken into account to mitigate sentences in domestic violence cases. An active women's rights movement sought to raise public awareness about domestic violence.
Four women's crisis centers funded by foreign governments operated in the country. The centers offered counseling and assistance to women in cases of domestic violence, rape, and other problems, such as child support.
Prostitution is illegal, but it occurred, particularly in cities. Sex tourism is prohibited by law but reportedly occurred, particularly in tourist centers such as Nadi and Savusavu, including cases involving children. Taxi drivers, hoteliers, bar workers, and others reportedly acted as middlemen, facilitating the commercial sexual exploitation of children.
The Human Rights Commission Act specifically prohibits sexual harassment, and criminal laws against ""indecent assaults on females"" prohibit offending the modesty of women and have been used to prosecute sexual harassment cases. Under a new employment relations law that came into effect in April, sexual harassment in the workplace is a specific ground of complaint that can be filed by workers.
Women have full rights of property ownership and inheritance but often were excluded from the decision-making process on disposition of communal land, which constituted more than 80 percent of all land. Many women were successful entrepreneurs."	<urn:uuid:9f3f18e4-0735-45f8-b8d5-9bca3a48c8a1>	0.0

what genetic data format did 23andme use to project customers onto hgdp data set visualization	"First Personal Genome User Group
July 11, 2008
Last Tuesday 23andMe, the genome sequencing service, hosted the first meeting between its customers. Like Navigenics and deCode, 23andMe will sequence half a million “snips” from your own DNA to give you glimpse of your personal genetics. What you get for your $1,000 payment is lots of numbers and strings of letters, and a little bit of information of how these correspond to health studies and ancestry research. So far this is a very nerdy hobby, requiring a love of data and great patience with crude tools, bugs, and beta everything.
The idea behind gathering early enthusiasts face to face was to increase the exchange of information, methods, motivations in a way that Web 2.0 can’t do. There are ethical issues, social uncertainty, incredible technical complexity, and rapid advancement in this field; having a person in front of you who might know more than you is a great way to learn. 23andMe cleverly calls this initiative to harness customer-generated value 23andWe.
As a paying customer I attended this informal gen-con. I think of this event as the first Personal Genome User Group. We gathered at 23andMe world headquarters in Mountain View, CA, but I think we were outnumbered by the ever helpful staff on hand to answer questions. I was extremely curious about the other customers’ experience, and what they have learned by sequencing their DNA. I don’t want to speak for them, but here is what I have learned by messing around in personal quantified genomics in the last six months:
1) There is far less known about proven genetic diseases that I thought. The list of illness with established origins in genetic mutations is very short, and even then the genetic factors operate statistically. The presence of a particular gene will raise or lower the percentage risk for a health issue, at the most. So one thing I learned from having my DNA sequenced is that very few diseases have a single point genetic basis, which means that gene sequences will be just one factor in a very complex brew of influences. Personal genetic knowledge is sort of like knowing your blood type: Important to know but far from sufficient.
2) Sequencing is not just about health (and one of the reasons it should not be hijacked by the doctor squad). Your DNA can reveal much about your deep genetic past."	<urn:uuid:932d89a1-5279-4696-a6f6-87806b0e4b8b>	0.0

I'm doing research on hereditary cancer patterns. What makes some families more susceptible to ovarian cancer, and how does this affect their recommended screening approach?	"An estimated 1-3% of cases of stomach cancer are caused by inherited syndromes. Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is an inherited cancer syndrome that leads to an increased risk for both diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. Patients who inherit the genetic mutation for HDGC are at high risk for developing stomach cancer at a young age.
History of HDGC
In 1964, stomach cancer was noted in a Maori tribal family in New Zealand, following an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. CDH1 gene mutations were first described in patients from three Maori families in 1998. At this time, the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC) was formed, and the name “Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer” was introduced. Families with multiple cases of diffuse gastric cancer, lobular breast cancer, or both may be affected by hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome.
Diffuse Gastric Cancer
HDGC leads to a cancer called diffuse-type, signet ring cell gastric adenocarcinoma. These signet ring cells appear as isolated cells or in small clusters in the lining of the stomach. Unfortunately, the diffuse type of gastric cancer associated with HDGC is difficult to diagnose because the cancer is not visible on upper endoscopy (looking into the stomach with a small camera). For this reason, most cases of diffuse gastric cancer are diagnosed at late stages (III or IV), and associated with a lower survival rate.
Lobular Breast Cancer
Women from HDGC families should be followed by oncologists or breast surgeons and have clinical breast exams regularly. Screening with yearly breast MRI, which can be combined with mammograms, is recommended starting at age 30. There is a possible role for preventive hormone-blocking medications to reduce the risk of lobular breast cancer in CDH1 mutation carriers. If there are many cases of breast cancer in the family, prophylactic mastectomy may also be considered, but mastectomy is not routinely recommended.
Future of HDGC
Research on the genetics, diagnosis, and treatment of HDGC is ongoing. Centers of Excellence have been established worldwide and experts from the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium continue to work together to develop new guidelines and recommendations for patients and families affected by HDGC.

"The clinical examination at the beginning found a cervical inflammatory placard with cervicothoracic crepitation related to subcutaneous emphysema, an important element for the diagnosis .
In misleading forms and at the beginning stage, the diagnosis is essentially based on radiological data. Chest X-ray generally shows widened mediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and sometimes a mediastinal hydroaeric level. Cervicothoracic CT is gold key for early stage diagnosis [5, 9,14,15]
it allows to find strongly evocative lesions, like the modification of the density of the mediastinal fat which becomes heterogeneous. It makes it possible to specify the extent and the ratios of the cellulitis at the cervical and thoracic level, especially with the vascular structures after the injection of the product of contrast. In addition to diagnosis, CT can guide cellulitis drainage and monitor its evolution . The favorable evolution in our cases was obtained thanks to the early practice of the cervico-thoracic CT which made it possible to make the diagnosis before the stage of the complications.
The complications usually encountered during this affection are [5,16]:
- pleural empyema, pulmonary parenchymal lesions ;
- pyopneumothorax, purulent pericarditis,
- vascular lesions (ulcerations, rupture).
Other complications are possible: peritonitis by migration through the esophageal hiatus  or subphrenic abscess. Estrera, et al. Have described cranial nerve palsies (IX, X, XII), intracranial suppurations . All these complications result in rapid death in a severe and irreversible sepsis chart. Mortality of this affection varies between 36% [5,18] and 75%  with an average of 50% .
Descending necrotizing mediastinitis is a medical and surgical emergency that must be treated before the onset of its dreadful and irreversible complications.
Drainage is essential:
- endobuccal drainage by retropharyngeal puncture;
- cervical drainage with a large cervicotomy and placement of large drains a little distance from the vessels
- possibly thoracic drainage by anterolateral thoracotomy in case of pyothorax

korean royal painting color techniques durability	"Vibrant Colored Pencil Paintings Layer by Layer
by Arlene Steinberg
A painting major in college, artist Arlene Steinberg got hooked on colored pencils for their versatility, lack of mess and vibrancy. And now she paints with colored pencils using techniques from the Masters, techniques that are usually reserved for oil and acrylic painters.
Masterful Color is loaded with instruction on how to layer colored pencil colors effectively to create deep, vibrant colors that exude richness. By starting with a tonal underpainting, using grayed complementary colors, and layering local color on top, you will create rich shadows that add depth and dimension to your paintings.
Demonstrations of various underpainting combinations as well as exercises on color, value and composition lay the groundwork. Then follow along with subject-specific demos on topics such as backlit glass, colorful reflections, fabric and cut crystal to learn how the various techniques are applied. An extended demonstration helps you put it all together, leading you step by step through the entire painting process.

How do adult and fetal lung progenitor cells compare to autologous versus allogeneic CAR T-cells in terms of their therapeutic potential and implementation challenges?	"Cell Medica and Baylor College of Medicine expand partnership to develop allogeneic CAR-NKT cells for cancer treatment
London, UK and Houston, TX – November 10, 2016 – Cell Medica, a leader in cellular immunotherapy for cancer, has expanded its partnership with Baylor College of Medicine (‘Baylor’) to develop an off-the-shelf allogeneic cell therapy, taking advantage of the unique aspects of invariant natural killer T (NKT) cells.
Cellular immunotherapy offers great promise in treating cancer but may be limited in application if products require individual preparation for each new patient. Most cell-based immunotherapies utilize T cells which are naturally programmed to kill malignant cancer cells and can be further engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or modified T cell receptors to improve their use for treating cancer. As an off-the-shelf product, however, allogeneic T cells derived from healthy donors carry the risk of recognizing the patient’s body as foreign, which can cause a serious side effect called graft versus host disease (GvHD).
Baylor and Cell Medica plan to overcome this problem by developing off-the-shelf therapies based on CAR-modified NKT cells generated in large volumes from healthy donors. While endowed with powerful cancer-killing properties like conventional T cells, invariant NKT cells express special T cell receptors that are not associated with GvHD. Hence allogeneic NKT cells can be used to treat multiple cancer patients with minimal risk of GvHD. The success of this program may expand significantly the potential use of cell-based immunotherapies on a cost-effective basis for the treatment of cancer patients.
Exclusive License & Development Plan
This new project will be conducted under the exclusive license and co-development agreement between Cell Medica and Baylor, announced in June 2016. Under the agreement, Baylor will perform the research required to develop off-the-shelf NKT cell therapies with funding and strategic input from Cell Medica. Cell Medica will have an exclusive option to develop all products and technologies arising from this effort, under the terms of the licensing agreement. As announced previously, Cell Medica and Baylor expect that their collaboration will generate a significant number of new products for Cell Medica’s pipeline."	<urn:uuid:3ecf7d67-72f4-41fe-ac5c-4c8009c77bf9>	0.0
I've been asked to gather information for creating a safety plan at work, but there's so much data out there. How do I know which information is actually useful for my specific workplace?	"Bringing Big Data for Transportation to Canada
Just a few weeks ago, I joined StreetLight Data as the company’s first dedicated Canadian sales consultant for the transportation industry. In many ways, this is the natural next step in my forty-year career as a transportation engineering and mapping professional. My experience spans the public and the private sector, and I’ve been honored to contribute to several of Canada’s most important transportation initiatives. From helping to plan the Confederation Bridge in Prince Edward to creating the first turn-by-turn navigation maps of all for Canada, I’ve always dedicated myself to projects that make our country more connected and improve quality of life in our communities.
While the field of Big Data analytics is relatively new to me, I’m thrilled that my next contribution to Canada’s transportation practice will be focused on data. The lack of quality transportation data has been the missing link in so much of my work for the past forty years. I believe StreetLight Data has the right solution to this long-standing problem.
It's Time for Better Transportation Data Collection
At StreetLight Data, I will be helping public agencies and engineering firms adopt StreetLight InSight®, the first on-demand web application for customized, real-world transportation analytics. It’s a new solution to transportation data collection that gives planners, modelers, and engineers better information efficiently and cost-effectively. For me and my peers, having better information at our fingertips is the ultimate game-changer.
With the StreetLight InSight platform, transportation professionals can dedicate more of their scarce resources to the work that matters the most: Putting Big Data to work to solve the complex mobility challenges we face today. It’s time to move beyond the days where more time is spent putting together surveys or doing analyses than actually making decisions with the information we gather. StreetLight InSight makes that possible.
Why I Joined StreetLight Data
Thanks to recent product advancements, StreetLight Data is ready to establish a local sales team in Canada. In last week’s software release, we launched several important new analytics in Canada, including Trip Purpose and Visitor Home-Work Projects, which describe how people travel from home to work. (Click here to read our release notes).

As someone researching the relationship between faith and academia, what's the connection between Catholic thought and philosophical inquiry in terms of how they complement each other?	"There are tons of online articles listing the “top five signs your partner is cheating” but our advice is to avoid these articles at all costs! Do not let yourself fall into the trap of investigating your partner for signs that he is cheating; instead, seek out a couples therapist immediately to address the issues that are causing you to feel insecure and disconnected. The sooner you address the problem in therapy, the easier it will be to recover from whatever is happening in your relationship.
What’s the difference between an infidelity and an emotional affair?
There is no standardized definition of what it means to have an affair. Generally speaking, infidelity is either having a sexual relationship or an intimate emotional connection with someone other than your partner. When you first committed to each other, did you and your partner discuss the expectations for your relationship? (i.e. Is it okay to flirt with someone at work? Are you comfortable with looking at online pornography? Did you agree to have an open relationship?) Unfortunately, most couples do not discuss these uncomfortable questions and, therefore, do not know what behaviors are “stepping over the line”. It is important to clarify what constitutes infidelity in your unique relationship and not to assume that there are certain unspoken rules between you.

How do emperor penguins manage eye adaptation in different environments, and what's unique about their breeding location compared to other birds?	"Evolution has taken these birds in different directions, by producing different adaptations for life at sea. This is called divergent evolution.
There are nearly 10,000 species of bird in the world and there are probably more than 100 billion individual birds. None is exactly the same as any another. Every species is different, and every individual bird is unique.
Some families, including parrots, pigeons and hummingbirds have more than 300 species. Others, such as the ostrich, have just one or two. A family evolves as many different species as the environment can support. Each one has a slightly different adaptation.
Thrushes are a good example. The blackbird feeds on worms and berries on lawns and in gardens and woodlands, the song thrush feeds mainly on slugs and snails, the mistle thrush feeds more on fruit and the rare ring ouzel lives on mountainsides. Some thrushes, redwings and fieldfares, migrate to Britain for the winter, while the ring ouzel heads south from its snowy mountains.
Male or female?
Male and female birds rarely look quite the same either. In some species the differences are tiny, such as the slightly thicker belly stripe on a male great tit. In others, they are much more obvious – such as blackbirds, where the female is brown.
The differences depend on their behaviour: most male ducks have colourful feathers for courtship display; most female ducks have brown feathers to camouflage them on the nest.
Size can also differ. A female sparrowhawk is almost one third larger than the male. This means the female can catch birds as big as song thrushes whereas the males can only manage smaller birds such as blue tits. This stops the two of them competing for prey.
Colours for all seasons
Birds also change their colours at different times of year, by moulting their old worn feathers.
Many have one breeding plumage and one different non-breeding plumage. For instance, a male wheatear in spring has a handsome pink breast, blue-grey back and black face mask. By autumn, he has become brownish all over – just like the female.
Even within one species, each individual bird is slightly different from every other. This is usually hard for us to spot, but in a few birds it’s more obvious. Some birds of prey, such as buzzards, can also vary greatly."	<urn:uuid:dc267c30-e718-41a0-89e0-95ff306fcbf6>	0.0

Technical Death Metal band hailing from Kildare and influenced by old school death such as CARCASS, CANNIBAL CORPSE and more modern bands like MESHUGGAH. Originally formed in 2004 by brothers James and Robert Connolly who were joined by Karl ‘Squelch’ Walsh soon after.It was this line-up that recorded their one and only release, ‘The Fury Of Silence’ Demo later that same year in 2004 in Jam Studios, Kells. But Squelch left soon after the demo was released. David Knott (FIFTH DOMINION) joined later on bass and Eoin Byrne on vocal. They also made some other recordings, two covers for a compilation album and two originals, but weren’t happy with them so they were never finished properly.
They have shared the stage with bands other notable Irish bands such as ABADDON INCARNATE, COLDWAR, MASS EXTINCTION, THE SWARM, PUTREFY, OVEROTH, SKEWERED, ZEALOT CULT and NEPHRIDIUM amongst others. Eoin eventually left the band while David switched over to second guitarist with the intention of finding a new bassist and vocalist, but the band called it quits in 2010.

I'm researching the Malaysian influence on Belgian electronic music - can you tell me more about any connection between San Soda and Malaysian artists?	"Ten aircraft and 11 ships scouted more than 98,000 square miles (254,000 square kilometers) of Indian Ocean on Monday looking for the missing plane, Malaysia’s acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Monday.
Flight 370 vanished March 8 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
A new Australian Joint Agency Coordination Center is being formed to synchronize search efforts among Australian agencies and other countries taking part in the search, Hishammuddin said.
And Malaysia will ask the United States about the possibility of deploying more military assets, he said.
New details on handoff
On Monday, Malaysia’s Transport Ministry said the final voice transmission from the cockpit of Flight 370 was “Good night Malaysian three seven zero.”
That’s a departure from earlier language in which Malaysian authorities said the final transmission was “All right, goodnight.”
The new language is routine and is not a sign of anything untoward occurring aboard the flight, said CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo.
But she said it does raise questions about how Malaysian officials have handled the investigation.
“Well, it speaks to credibility issues, unfortunately,” she said.
Family members of people on board Flight 370 have accused Malaysian officials of giving them confusing, conflicting information since the plane vanished more than three weeks ago.
On Monday, dozens of Chinese family members visited a Kuala Lumpur temple. They chanted, lit candles and meditated.
“Chinese are kindhearted people,” said Jiang Hui, the families’ designated representative. “But we can clearly distinguish between the good and evil. We will never forgive for covering the truth from us and the criminal who delayed the rescue mission.”
Jiang asked Malaysia to apologize for announcing March 24 that the plane had crashed, despite the lack of any “direct evidence.”
At the daily press briefing, Hishammuddin responded, saying Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak had not used the word “crash” or mentioned a lack of survivors in his announcement that the plane’s flight had “ended” in the southern Indian Ocean.
And, he said, Malaysian authorities were not hiding anything by declining to release some details of the missing flight. Some details are part of ongoing investigations into what happened to the plane, he said.
“We are not hiding anything. We are just following the procedure that is being set.” he said.
He described a meeting Saturday between Malaysian authorities and Flight 370 relatives as “the most difficult meeting I’ve ever attended.”
“The families are heartbroken."	<urn:uuid:59fe8fde-cc01-483d-92e0-2045637e8535>	0.0

What's the deepest place on Earth and what kind of creatures live there?	"We suggest that the student read the following verses several times, and as usual in this study, compare them with other translations.
24. Then God said, ""Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind""; and it was so.
25. And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good.
Let's stop here for a moment and consider the above verses.
This is the day of the creation of the land animals and man.
Here again, in verse 24, we see the use of the phrase ""living creatures"" or ""living soul"", ""neh-fesh hah-yaw"". This further emphasizes the importance of all of God's creatures, and that Man is but one of them. All of us, humans and non-humans, have a soul and a spirit.
Remember also that God did not call forth the earth to create or make the animals, as we discussed before. It is God who made [aw-sawh] the animals as we can see from verse 25. God made [aw-sawh] the animals from what he had previously created [baw-raw].
In verse 25, God again emphasizes that each type of creature is created after its kind. God seems to imply that He wants things to remain as He created them, for He says of His creation when He saw it, ""that it was good."" And since we are talking about God's created animals, we likewise need to consider the goodness, the love, the compassion that God feels towards these beings, and feel as He does.
Let's continue with our study verses, as they relate to Man.
26. Then God said, "" Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.""
27. And God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.

On a summer day, hundreds of visitors would arrive on the island by small steamboats, row boats or canoes. The plan for locks and gates for letting out the freshet in a proper manner was left for the present to be devised in due time if found necessary. William Doster, renamed the island ""Wampanoag Island"" in and built steps from the New Street Bridge directly to the island. The privately funded canal became part of the Pennsylvania Canal system, a complex of canals, towpaths and eventually railroads. At one point in the early 's the Lehigh's water was so polluted by coal, sewage and manufacturing waste it was described as ""black flowing lava.

What's the difference between butterfly and moth development stages?	"Conservationists have released hundreds of caterpillars in a bid to boost the numbers of one of the UK's rarest moths.
Around 2,000 Barberry Carpet moth larvae have been introduced to the organically managed Cholderton Estate on the Hampshire/Wiltshire border.
The Barberry Carpet moth is extremely rare and is restricted to just a handful of sites across the UK.
Wildlife charity Butterfly Conservation timed the release to take place in the evening, giving the larvae a better chance of avoiding predators such as wasps and birds.
The cryptically coloured grey and brown moth gets its name from its association with barberry, a plant that has suffered extensive persecution in the past.
During the 1970s the Barberry Carpet suffered a dramatic decline when the plant was widely eradicated to prevent it from acting as a host for wheat rust fungus.
But, by the time scientists developed rust-resistant varieties of wheat the barberry plant had almost disappeared, spelling disaster for the Barberry Carpet
Now steps are underway to reintroduce the moth to parts of its former range.
It is hoped the caterpillars released on the Cholderton Estate will go on to form a viable breeding colony.
The fully organic Cholderton Estate will provide an ideal home for the new colony of moths as it is managed with an emphasis on nature conservation.
The site boasts a number of established barberry plants including one bush that is believed to be the oldest in the UK.
More than 450 species of moth have been recorded on site and 34 species of butterfly are thought to breed on the Estate.
Butterfly Conservation's Moth Conservation Officer Tony Davis explained: ""The Cholderton estate is superbly managed for wildlife and we hope that it will provide a secure home for this extremely rare moth.""
The Barberry Carpet is limited to a few small sites, mainly in Wiltshire, with colonies also in Gloucestershire, Dorset and introduced colonies elsewhere. A further colony has also recently been discovered in Oxfordshire."	<urn:uuid:199ad7d1-8bb6-4894-a36e-c7db943c981b>	0.0
how did commanders injuries affect battle outcomes at cunaxa and drepanum curious about wounded leaders impact	"About UsPeripheral nerve surgery is complex from both the diagnostic and management perspectives. Because it is a young field with new techniques constantly in development, few surgeons are exposed to the full range of nerve surgery techniques during training. And after training, few opportunities exist for mastering the full range of those new techniques or for incorporating them into routine practice.
This educational website was developed to review established practices and to provide detailed information about many of the newer ideas and techniques now being used in peripheral nerve surgery. Dr. William W. Campbell, Professor and Chairman of the Department of Neurology at the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, through the Comprehensive National Neuroscience Program and the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, provided start-up funds for this project. A key impetus for this project is the urgent need to develop and disseminate better strategies for treating wounded soldiers returning from continuing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Many advances in medicine stem from a desire to improve outcomes of wounded men and women who sustain devastating injuries from warfare. Some of those injuries to peripheral nerves can lead to loss of function. However, newer techniques – in particular, nerve transfers – described on this website can improve patient outcomes by restoring some degree of function. Nerve transfer is but one new modality for treating severely damaged peripheral nerves. This website describes it and many others for treating these challenging problems, and should prove helpful for a range of specialists, including plastic surgeons, neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and general surgeons among the many health care providers taking care of patients with severe peripheral nerve injuries."	<urn:uuid:cfd14b32-319c-43f7-9478-1c9bdb46807e>	0.0
geographical regions showing significant decrease marine cartilaginous species	"The current study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the H9N2 HA, that includes sequences from all of the geographical regions where H9N2 has been reported. This investigation shows how host species and geographical distribution have shaped the evolution of distinct lineages of H9 HA. This reveals clades that are both geographically and host species dependent. From these analyses new hypotheses can be generated for more specific events such as migrations or intra-species infections.
Materials and Methods
The complete set of H9N2 hemagglutinin protein sequences were downloaded from the NCBI on the 22nd of May 2013. The search term used for searching the protein database was H9N2 hemagglutinin. The sequences were exported in FASTA format.
The complete set of H9N2 hemagglutinin nucleotide sequences were downloaded from the NCBI on the 9th of September 2013. The search term used was ((H9N2 hemagglutinin) NOT precursor) NOT partial. The sequences were downloaded in FASTA format.
A dataset for the complete set of Korean H9N2 hemagglutinin sequences was downloaded from the NCBI on the 15th of June 2014. The search term used was ((H9N2 hemagglutinin) NOT H5) Korea).
After removal of long truncations (>40 amino-acid residues) as well as a group of sequences that were actually from other AIV subtypes, the final protein dataset contained 2,045 sequences, the final nucleotide dataset contained 1,052 sequences of which the Korean nucleotide subset contained 64 sequences.
The edited protein and nucleotide datasets were then broken into sub-groups based on the sequence annotations, using a short text matching program written in Perl. The data was split into subsets based on geographical location and host species.
The geographical subsets were based on national boundaries except for China, which was divided into its regions. Where a Chinese region had 10 sequences or less then phylogenetic analysis was not carried out. National borders have been identified as barriers to influenza transmission and so these are appropriate geographical subsets (Wallace & Fitch, 2008). A subset was created for the Americas including all of the North American and the single South American (Argentinian) sequence."	<urn:uuid:3a12bd5a-4996-4a1c-a5b9-36ddb452e264>	0.0
I'm interested in military units from the 1700s - can you tell me what happened to the Jung Braunschweig regiment at the end and why did the Seven Years War start in the first place?	"Former cavalry officer James Brown, a veteran of Australia's inconclusive campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, sees the country heading towards another messy war in an atmosphere of open public discussion and informed national debate. Unfortunately, most of the debate is about a war that ended almost 100 years ago.
Brown, military fellow at the Lowy Institute for National Policy, believes Australia's increasingly enthusiastic commemoration of an imperfectly remembered Anzac past actually helps prevent us from coming to terms with our contemporary military situation.
He is awkwardly handsome in classic junior-officer style, with the confident bearing of a man well accustomed to making life-or-death decisions, such as whether to turn his guns on enemy insurgents, and which bottle of wine to bring to his first dinner with his future father-in-law, the Liberal politician Malcolm Turnbull.
Brown first became interested in Anzac when he heard politicians making speeches about Afghanistan at the end of the last decade.
""And there was no substance in any of it,"" he said, ""just cliched, hackneyed phrases: we've got to support this and that, references to Anzac and World War I.
""And I thought we probably deserve better, we probably deserve a bit more thought. And I was really curious about why these guys didn't get it.
""It's their job, and they didn't know who we were fighting in Afghanistan. They didn't know the difference between infantry and armour. If you'd asked them to articulate what the strategy was, they couldn't tell you.
""Afghanistan was becoming more and more unpopular, and yet at the same time these reports were being done about the centenary of Anzac. I just couldn't reconcile those two things: it didn't make sense.""
Brown and I meet for lunch at North Bondi RSL, where Brown is vice-president of the sub-branch. The walls hang with reminders of the real cost of modern war: photographs of three sub-branch members killed in Afghanistan.
They all belonged to the Special Operations Engineer Regiment based at Holsworthy, which has a special relationship with the sub-branch. They were invited as part of a deliberate strategy by the executive.
While most sub-branches are dwindling, or packed with non-military affiliates, North Bondi has more than 400 members, many of whom are still in uniform."	<urn:uuid:85059da2-ff7b-408a-b45e-704e9ff5db99>	0.0
I'm fascinated by collaborative artworks - can you explain how two different artists, Coninxloo and Van Mander, worked together to create the Judgement of Midas painting?	"We caught up with celebrated artist, Daisy in Dots, to talk about her connection to country, her inspiration, and seeing her artwork come to life on a custom InStitchu jacket lining.
Tell us about yourself. How did you land at doing what you do?
I am an intuitive modern contemporary Aboriginal artist and proud descendant of the Muruwari people. My work is deeply rooted in my connection to the Motherland – the trees, water, sand, sun, Earth and animals. I have a strong eye for visual beauty… prior to transitioning into full time painting, I worked as a Visual Merchandiser for a number of major global retail brands.
Tell us about your amazing artworks.
Painting is a spiritual process for me. I paint to convey the beauty I see in all things and to express my gratitude and acknowledge the Country I am living, walking and breathing. My artworks are inspired and influenced by my experiences growing up on Yugambeh Country (Gold Coast). I’m particularly fascinated by the beauty of the land, sea and sky. The sun, in combination with my choice of soft, earthy, feminine paint colours has become my signature style I am most recognised for.
What are the materials and tools you use as an artist? Do you stick to traditional processes, or do you explore your own techniques?
I use a variety of sticks, paint brushes, brush ends and sponges to create the perfect dots. I like to mix my own colours but am also a huge fan of Derivan Matisse acrylic paints. I predominantly paint on canvas but have also recently started painting on ceramics too.
How do your pieces and your style reflect a broader culture and tradition in art?
Story telling is at the heart of what I do and is something I have always been passionate about. I paint intuitively, the same way my ancestors did. It is a deeply spiritual process and something I was called to do. It is a privilege and honour to share my connection to Country and culture with the world through my art. All Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural groups have different perspectives, interpretations and understandings of the stories and knowledge. First Nations people are the oldest known living civilisation on Earth and their knowledge has been passed between generations for over 70,000 years.
Take us through the process of conceiving a particular artwork? How does it all begin, how does it begin to unfold?"	<urn:uuid:1aa993b0-ec7b-4c06-af50-11586a10519f>	0.0
Could you tell me about the unusual dining traditions that Europeans followed on Ascension Day during the Middle Ages?	"This storyboard does not have a description.
Feudalism arose in Europe because of the need for a way to pull society back together after the Roman Empire collapsed in the West...
Feudalism began around the 8th century. However, it really began to develop around the 10th century in Europe...
Feudalism drew on older traditions of Germanic peoples to create order out of the chaos that followed the end of the Western Roman Empire.
LAND LAND and MORE LAND!! There probably wasn’t anything more important than land in the Middle Ages.

geothermal system temperature depth relationship modern power plant applications clay mineral indicators	"For the most part, maintaining a geothermal system isn’t a do-it-yourself project. Geothermal heat pumps are generally considered low-maintenance. The heat pump components are located indoors, sheltered from the elements, and the underground heat exchange loops are guaranteed for up to 50 years, seldom presenting leakage issues. The little maintenance that is required is critical to getting the dependability, performance and low operating costs you expect from the system.
Professional geothermal service requires training and expertise specific to geothermal technology, as well as the specialized equipment that goes along with it. Here are four things you should know about what’s required.
Change the Air Filter
Any homeowner can tackle this task. All heat pumps, including geothermal models, rely on higher airflow rates than standard forced-air HVAC systems. Keep your system’s airflow up to specs with the simple DIY task of replacing the system air filter monthly.
Check the Flow Rate and Temperature
The heat exchange fluid circulating through the underground loops must run at a specific gallons-per-minute figure; 6 to 9 gpm is typical. To a trained technician, readings outside that range may indicate air in the system, pump problems or obstructions. Fluid temperature measurements entering and leaving the heat pump in both cooling and heating mode are also indicators of the overall health of the system.
Heat Pump Tuneup
Basic heat pump maintenance includes measuring refrigerant level and troubleshooting any low readings. Wiring connections to the thermostat and thermostat operation are also tested, as is a proper operation of supplemental heating mode.
Clean Indoor Coil
The surfaces of this critical component sealed inside the air handler must be kept free of dirt and dust accumulation by regular cleaning with approved chemicals. A dirty coil severely inhibits heat transfer and impacts system efficiency and performance.

Hey, I've heard that some cities are letting regular people decide how to spend their money. Which Finnish city is leading the way in giving citizens control over spending decisions?	"The city had its own ""Ken Livingston moment,"" a reference to the Mayor of London's vehicle congestion charge, which for the Romans meant strict restrictions on vehicles entering Rome by day. Despite this density and the immigration that caused it, Rome, like London, was no parasite. Its artisans and shopkeepers added value to their wares, and they had a sense of pride in their city. Jones thoroughly debunks a popular view of Rome as a city of villas, and of citizens bathing in calm repose amid luxury.
Roman entertainments, roads, buildings, aqueducts, brothels, and food distributions, are the concerns of the second chapter, while the Millennium Dome and the BBC--which the government should ""throw out"" in favor of private initiatives--are his modern targets. Chapter Three tells us how the Roman authorities paid for all this--they focused not on extorting Roman citizens, but rather on bleeding other people dry using the army. Jones' Mediterranean world ""was in a fairly constant state of conflict either for self-protection or in order to extract the wealth"" of others. (45) Inside Rome, the ruling aristocracy used the revenue to create a sense of personal beneficence and of loyalty among the populace. The contrast Jones creates with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs today begins with its spending of our money--not money taken from strangers--in a way that divorces our ""payments"" from any direct benefit to us. One suggestion Jones offers is whether Queen Elizabeth should provide some kind of Res Gestae for the British people--a return to the quid pro quo of personal benefaction found in Rome. Is Jones serious about trying to support the English state by taxing foreigners, and then distributing the spoils by personal largesse? Is it properly ironic to claim that the ""lesson for our government"" is to ""concentrate on wondering how to screw it [taxes] out of someone else. That's the way to stay in power.""? (50)
Chapter Four shows us how the Romans kept control over this cauldron--the key was to gain and keep the support of the population. We have heard very little of the Greeks so far--the first four chapters are consumed almost totally with the Romans. Chapter five, on the Athenian democracy, sets us on a path to a deeper discussion of the nature of government and of citizen participation."	<urn:uuid:574136f7-986c-4ff4-8876-fff7da28dcdc>	0.0

what happens at grain boundaries during material separation process carbides	"The sleeve may be coated with a finished coating, which gives a surface having a Rockwell hardness of around ""C"" 40 or greater. Such coatings can be formed from heavy metal carbides such as tungsten carbide, cemented carbides and tungsten carbide based cemented carbides with the addition of titanium, tantilum, and niobium carbides, silicon carbides and columbium carbide, cobalt, nickel, nickel-chromium-boron alloys and the like. There may also be present minor amounts of chromium oxide, calcium oxide, silica and magnesia. Cobalt, nickel, or nickel-chromium-boron alloys are usually present as a soft metal binder or matrix for cementing the tungsten carbide type materials. Also, other coatings may be used such as zinc, both pure and containing six percent antimony, aluminum, high carbon steel, tin, chromium, copper, bronze, brass, babbitt, cadmium, nickel, monel, stainless steel, silver, gold, molybdenum, tantilum, nichrome and the like.
The coating is applied to a sleeve having a thickness that is substantially greater than that of a foil, which is preferably any type of noncorroding material, that has been prepared for maximum adhesion. The thickness of the sleeve required for coating is generally around at least 1.5 mm (0.05 in.). The preparation techniques include threading, grooving and blasting with sharp sand or steel grit to present a clean, fresh surface of sufficient roughness to furnish good anchorage for the coating.
The hard coating is applied to the prepared surface of the sleeve by the spray process known as powder spray metalizing, although wire spray metalizing can be used where the hard metallic materials are available in wire form and flame plating, plasma arc spraying and sputtering may also be used. After the cylindrical sleeve has been spray coated with at least 0.001 inch (0.0254 mm) of coating, the surface is treated to remove a fraction of the coating. This finished treatment is by brushing, grinding, sanding or polishing. Such a treatment gives the surface a finish ranging from a mat finish to a mirror finish.
For a more complete understanding of the present invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which:

I see you're taking JP's class too...very cool!
A really strong drawing. Even without fancy rendering, volumetric lighting, colour dodge and rim lights this is still a great picture.
One of my faves from class. Sick dude!
duuuuuuude. this is awesome.
Your work kicks so much ass!
Nice drawing Gino.
Nice! Reminds me of something we'd have put in Wall-E.
Very nicely done sir. Good to see you flexin those sketch muscles.
this is really awesome!
Hey Gino, just thought I'd let you know I've just about got the high poly done for the model of this thing :D you can check it out here if you want. http://www.polycount.com/forum/showthread.php?p=1401955#post1401955Let me know if you have any suggestions or fixes for what I've done so far.

where has musician charlie romo performed trying to find venues concerts appearances	"This was followed in 2008 by the autobiographical collection co-penned with David Preston, ""Lifejacket"", also on Linn Records. In 2009 Shaw recorded his long-awaited solo album, “Somewhere Towards Love” (Splash Point Records) which continues to represent beautifully his increasingly popular solo shows.
Shaw’s career in performance began unusually for a jazz musician on the Alternative Cabaret Circuit, alongside such performers as Julian Clary, Rory Bremner and Jo Brand. Shaw was spotted by Dave Illic, jazz critic for City Limits and was described as “the voice of the decade”.
During the next few years Shaw moved from the singer-pianist format to working with his new band to an eventual move into jazz. Shaw has toured extensively in the UK - regular venues include the Purcell Room, Queen Elizabeth Hall, Blackheath Concert Halls, Ronnie Scott's, The Vortex, the Jazz Café and The Barbican. Ian has played at all of the major jazz festivals in the UK including Cork, Brecon, Liverpool, Birmingham, Edinburgh (where he was nominated for a Perrier Award), Grimsby, Glasgow, Cheltenham, Scarborough, Swanage and St. Ives.
In Europe he has proved popular in France, Germany and Italy with numerous live appearances. He has also performed regularly in the States including Jazz at the Lincoln Center (New York), Cine Grill (Hollywood), the Fairmont (Chicago), The Nest i(Washington DC), Fez Club (New York), the Ellington Church (New York), the Pasadena Auditorium (California), the Miami Film and Music Festival and the Arizona Jazz Party. He has also performed at the Hanoi Opera House and Ho Chi Minh City Opera in Vietnam.
His appearances on TV include guest slots with Jools Holland, Top of the Pops, The Jack Dee Show, Christmas Night with the Stars (BBC), C4’s The Happening, TVAM, BBC Breakfast Show, BBC 2’s A Night of Love, BBC 2’s Jazz at the 606 and, more recently, numerous appearances on the Performance and Artsworld channels.
Collaborators over the years have been many and include Quincy Jones, Abudullah Ibrahim, Guy Barker, Kenny Wheeler, John Taylor, Iain Ballamy, Mornington Lockett, Barb Jungr, Cleo Laine, John Dankworth, Cedar Walton, Joe Lovano and Joe Beck."	<urn:uuid:e628d045-d879-482a-b1d9-7c34529f559b>	0.0

I love learning about traditional drinks - what's the main difference between how sake and sherry are aged, particularly the manzanilla type?	"18 Dec 2012
Old Pulteney 1974 (G&M)
Posted by: Ruben Luyten In: Old Pulteney
Old Pulteney 1974
(43%, Gordon & MacPhail 2009)
Nose: starts coastal and slightly sour, but folds open nicely and displays everything a good sherry cask should have. Figs, leather, polished oak… with an above average amount of mint and coastal notes (wet limestone, sea breeze). Lovely notes of tropical fruits as well (papaya, kumquat). Excellent. Mouth: still some lovely fruity notes (oranges, tangerine) and fruit tea with an oaky sourness. Interesting balance of sweet & sour (I love Madeira). The oak is loud although it’s not excessively dry. Fades on soft herbs, liquorice and a hint of mustard seed and Manzanilla sherry. Finish: medium long, with Seville oranges and the same oaky touches.
I’ve never had such an old Pulteney, but this was really interesting. Especially for nosing, as the oak is a little disturbing on the palate. Sold out but occasionally seen in auctions."	<urn:uuid:2505e4c8-fafe-4cad-8dae-17ee50874344>	0.0

What does research show about the patterns of transmission for people who get infected with West Nile virus compared to those with measles-related brain inflammation?	"119]||- Clonally expanded T cells from the CSF of MS patients recognize viral motifs||- No difference between MS and healthy subjects in the level of TTMV infection|
|CMV||[120-124]||- T cells specific for CMV- elicited inflammation and worse demyelination in MS animal models|
- CMV has been found in demyelinating plaques and in the CSF of MS patients
- Enrichment of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells in chronic inflammatory lesions of the MS brain
|- CMV infection is associated with anti-inflammatory activities, which could lead to a less severe disease course|
- CMV infection acquired during childhood reduced the risk of developing MS or CIS in subjects up to 18 years
|Measles||[125,126]||- Measles antibody titers were significantly higher in blood samples of MS than in control cases|
- Higher levels of measles antibodies in CSF were found in more disabled patients with a malignant disease course
|- No correlation was found between the presence and level of serum anti-measles antibodies and anti-MBP T cell activity|
- The measles vaccination is not associated with MS
|Rubella||[127,128]||- Rubella virus multiplies to low titer in glial cell cultures derived from rats, and induces damage to oligodendrocytes and myelin||- No evidence|
|Coronavirus||||- Some coronaviruses are neurotropic and disrupt the blood-brain barrier, causing immune-mediated demyelinating-like lesions in rodents||- No evidence|
|HSV-1||[130-132]||- HSV-1 antibodies were found in the CSF of MS patients||- Prior HSV-1 immunity could be protective against MS|
Convergent evidence points to the role of EBV in neuroinflammation. Common patterns were observed in the epidemiology of infectious mononucleosis (IM) and MS[10,11]. MS risk is about 2-3 folds higher among individuals with a clinical history of IM, as compared with those without a history[12,13]. Compelling evidence has demonstrated that individuals who are not infected with EBV rarely, if ever, develop MS."	<urn:uuid:ddd221b5-1f55-499e-af76-d42d95b478ec>	0.0
We're heading to Amsterdam next month and need advice about exchanging money when we arrive. Is it better to change money at the airport or wait until we get to the city?	"Trouble paying my rent or service charge

practical applications enzyme behavior constants	"In conventional statistics, the standard deviation measuring the amount of variation in this mean value is defined as:
This standard deviation is then used to calculate the two token rate and bucket size values as follows:
Here, this embodiment of the invention includes the determination of the various constants K1–K8 by any method. For instance, the constants K1–K8 can be determined empirically using rate samples from a number of DDOS attacks, or experimentally by establishing different values for each constant and determining the effectiveness of the resulting TokenRate and TokenDepth values for blocking DDOS attacks. Finally, the constants K1–K8 can be determined analytically using various mathematical criteria.
Calculating this standard deviation statistic requires the computer 10 to buffer T samples for each bin. As T must be statistically significant in order to represent an adequate measure of the degree to which a bin count can vary, a large amount of memory may be required. To alleviate this drawback, an alternate embodiment seeks to approximate σ in a less computationally intensive manner. Subsequent to the calculations of process (1) above, an approximation of the standard deviation is assessed:
for (i=1, N)
for (i=1, N)
Here, a standard error statistic is calculated for each bin as a function of the difference between the percent of current traffic falling into that bin, and the percent of traffic that has historically fallen into that bin. Note that this is similar to the standard deviation statistic for each bin, which is a function of the difference between the bin count and the average of all bin count samples for that bin. Note also that equation (4) requires the buffering of T bin counts for every bin, whereas equation (9) does not. The stderr(i) quantity can then be used as a less computationally intensive approximation of σ in equations (5)–(8).
The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the present invention are presented for purposes of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Obviously, many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical applications, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.

What advice did Ravana give before his death?	"So Ravnos from CbR is Dracian from WoD Gypsies, and ""Ravnos"" from WoD Gypsies is probably Ravana who was destroyed in Bangladesh, or possibly another 3rd generation Ravnos, if there are any others who have survived this long, or if there were any others at all.
Also, according to the Erycies Fragments, there were 6 of the Second Generation (the other 3, to my best guess, being Ravnos/Dracian, and the King and Queen of Nod, whom Haqim killed, and with whose blood he embraced himself). Also, in the prophesy of Ravana's death, it refers to the Wanderer, third Childe of Caine, whose descendants destroyed themselves in madness.
So, to conclude, Ravnos was Dracian, of the 2nd generation, he embraced his lover, Ennoia, aka Deanna, mother of the Garou and the gypsies. He also embraced Ravana, and possibly others. Ennoia was of the Ravnos Clan until Caine cast her out for orchestrating Ravnos/Dracian's (although according to WoD Gypsies she was not involved) death at the hands of the rest of the third generation, who ruled the Second City. She then founded Clan Gangrel.

I need strong glue for boats - super glue or resorcinol better?	"- Rub warm water on the glue stain
- Put the toothpaste over the glue and then rub gently with fabric to remove it.
How to Remove Super Glue from Glass Table
Removing super glue trace can be a challenge and sticky work. For the glass table, you may use acetone, as mentioned in previous points. However, you need to pay attention to the following things below:
- Never scratch the glue with nails, as it may damage and ruin your nails.
- Be cautious when using sharp objects such as razors or knives. They may cause scratches if they slipped and hit the glass surface.
- Use acetone as little as possible. There is no need to use the whole bottle of acetone to get rid of the stain. Besides, you may risk drying your skin as it is an alcohol-based product.
- Handle all materials and chemicals carefully. Make sure that you prevent spillage by being as careful as you can while working.
Glue trace is actually a hard mess that’s easy to solve. It can be cleaned easily by using the simple method to remove super glue from the glass above if you do it carefully and properly."	<urn:uuid:3aa41412-472a-45a2-9e2f-804fd0e14aa7>	0.0
How many tries did Jonah Lomu score in World Cup versus regular Tests?	"“It was like the United Nations – we had 11 players from 11 different countries. They called themselves a Band of Brothers,” recalls Dick Best.
“It was a good place to be and a very happy time.”
After back-to-back wins on the road, away to Saracens and Bedford, the Exiles started life at The Stoop with a bang, hammering 1997/98 champions Newcastle Falcons 56-8 in front of 3,951 spectators.
It sent the Exiles top of Allied Dunbar Premiership One for the first time in the club’s history. The Craic was certainly mighty at The Stoop that night.
“That created the momentum and drew people to come and watch us,” says London Irish and Ireland winger Justin Bishop.
For Best, it was a winning yet “bizarre” return to the ground he’d spent 23 years as player, coach and director of rugby, before taking over the reins at London Irish in 1996.
Defeats followed to Wasps, Leicester (by a point) and Northampton Saints, while there was a draw at Bath.
In the first of the season’s battle of landlords versus tenants, it was Quins who came out on top (17-16).
“It was strange,” says Justin Bishop. “When it was our home game the ground was branded up green, and then for their home game it was branded up as Harlequins.”
There were extraordinary revelations at hand after the Quins defeat, with Dick Best confirming that Irish were one of six Premiership sides interested in signing New Zealand World Cup star Jonah Lomu, no less.
The cups provided Irish with some of their sweetest moments that year – none more so than a 47-7 Tetley Bitter Cup Round 5 humbling of Leicester Tigers at The Stoop on 29 January 2000.
Kieran Campbell (2), Rob Gallacher, Neal Hatley and Richard Kirke all crossed, while a “near-faultless” Jarrod Cunningham kicked 22 points.
The Stoop reverberated to the sound of The Fields of Athenry and O’Shea, O’Shea, O’Shea.
“That ranks as one of the best results by that team,” reflects Dick Best. “We were riding high on the field, and it was very enjoyable off it.”
It was Leicester’s worst cup defeat for 28 years."	<urn:uuid:8386bdeb-2c2a-4279-9c2f-6997d6883fc1>	0.0
api separator refinery wastewater treatment purpose	"As a result of the growing fire, the valves controlling a water deluge system designed to cool the sphere became inaccessible to operators and could not be opened.
""The consequences of this accident could have been even more serious, under slightly different circumstances,"" Bresland said. ""Refineries should minimize the presence of hazardous substances near units where they may be exposed to fire hazards and should ensure that emergency systems remain operable if a disaster strikes.""
The CSB made recommendations to the American Petroleum Institute (API), a leading oil industry trade association that develops safety practices that are widely followed in the U.S. and overseas. The CSB called on the API to develop a new recommended practice for freeze-protection of refinery equipment and to improve existing practices related to fireproofing, emergency isolation valves and water deluge systems. The report also called on the refinery's owner to improve freeze protection, fireproofing, hazard analysis and emergency isolation procedures at its 16 North American refineries.
The CSB urged the refinery to implement its strategic plan to eliminate the use of chlorine for water treatment in favor of inherently safer alternatives such as bleach. The CSB also recommended that refinery staff work with United Steelworkers, which represents employees at the plant, to upgrade hazard analysis procedures.
The CSB is an independent federal agency charged with investigating industrial chemical accidents. The agency's board members are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. CSB investigations look into all aspects of chemical accidents, including physical causes such as equipment failure as well as inadequacies in regulations, industry standards and safety management systems.
The CSB does not issue citations or fines but does make safety recommendations to plants, industry organizations, labor groups and regulatory agencies such as OSHA and EPA. Visit the CSB Web site at www.csb.gov."	<urn:uuid:58c1d2cd-632a-423e-a6b0-c44279894836>	0.0
What led to the beginning of the Space Race?	"Q: You did the programming for 5 of Mattel’s earliest handhelds there: Auto Race, Baseball, Brain Baffler, Football, and Horoscope Computer. Were these the only handhelds (released or otherwise) you worked on? Did you work on any that weren’t released?
Mark Lesser: I also programmed Missile Attack, which was a variation of the Auto Race program. The game involved protecting a city from attack. Later this was changed to Flash Gordon which was just a different theme. I don't know if either was actually released (Ed. According to the info on this page - http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Mattel/FlashGordon.htm it was never released as Flash Gordon. However, it did see release as Missile Attack originally, and then Battlestar Galactica or Battlestar Galactica: Space Alert).
Missile Attack http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Mattel/MissileAttack.htm
Battlestar Galactica http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Mattel/Battlestar.htm
Plus a US Magazine version! http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Mattel/Proto.html)
Q: Auto Race has the distinction of being the first all-electronic game. How did Rockwell (and yourself) come to be involved with programming these? And did you write the programs or did you port code written by others (such as George Klose and Richard Cheng)?
Mark Lesser: Mattel approached Rockwell with the idea of converting a calculator into a handheld game, and George Klose and Richard Cheng came up with a one sheet description of an auto race game, using blips of light. They had the general idea of what the game should look like, but no one had any concept of how to implement the game, or even if it was feasible much less marketable. I started by consulting with the engineers at Rockwell to determine what chip we had that might be modified to implement such a game. We came up with one of the simple handheld LED calculator chips which had 511 bytes of ROM space for a program. This chip would need to be redesigned to allow for a display of the playing field and the score digits and to make sounds and read the input switches. It was up to me to do the actual chip redesign and to write the program from scratch."	<urn:uuid:04156b39-39fe-4f9d-adf1-f75ea9b3c8a7>	0.0
How many cuneiform tablets from Nippur are in the Hermitage collection?	"A history of Zero
|Ancient Indian Mathematics index||History Topics Index|
The first thing to say about zero is that there are two uses of zero which are both extremely important but are somewhat different. One use is as an empty place indicator in our place-value number system. Hence in a number like 2106 the zero is used so that the positions of the 2 and 1 are correct. Clearly 216 means something quite different. The second use of zero is as a number itself in the form we use it as 0. There are also different aspects of zero within these two uses, namely the concept, the notation, and the name. (Our name ""zero"" derives ultimately from the Arabic sifr which also gives us the word ""cipher"".)
Neither of the above uses has an easily described history. It just did not happen that someone invented the ideas, and then everyone started to use them. Also it is fair to say that the number zero is far from an intuitive concept. Mathematical problems started as 'real' problems rather than abstract problems. Numbers in early historical times were thought of much more concretely than the abstract concepts which are our numbers today. There are giant mental leaps from 5 horses to 5 ""things"" and then to the abstract idea of ""five"". If ancient peoples solved a problem about how many horses a farmer needed then the problem was not going to have 0 or -23 as an answer.
One might think that once a place-value number system came into existence then the 0 as an empty place indicator is a necessary idea, yet the Babylonians had a place-value number system without this feature for over 1000 years. Moreover there is absolutely no evidence that the Babylonians felt that there was any problem with the ambiguity which existed. Remarkably, original texts survive from the era of Babylonian mathematics. The Babylonians wrote on tablets of unbaked clay, using cuneiform writing. The symbols were pressed into soft clay tablets with the slanted edge of a stylus and so had a wedge-shaped appearance (and hence the name cuneiform). Many tablets from around 1700 BC survive and we can read the original texts."	<urn:uuid:36642d73-15f0-4d00-b82d-f3e3fb3b1a60>	0.0
How does mining help native people and what rules check it's done right?	"Oh...Come on! Close the city and tell the people that something's coming to call Death and darkness are rushing forward to take a bite from the wall, oh You've nothing to say They're breaking away If you listen to fools The mob rules The mob rules... Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded, the end is always the same Play with fire, you burn your fingers and lose your hold of the flame, oh It's over it's done The end, the big death If you listen to fools The mob rules... You've nothing to say Oh they're breaking away If you listen to fools Break the circle and stop the movement, the wheel is thrown to the ground Just remember it might stop rolling and take you right back around You're all fools, fools rules rules The mob rules Be sure to integrate and provide an answer to the why question in your thesis. Consider our discussions of mob psychology: why people in crowds behave the way they do, how irrationally people act in crowds, how their individuality is lost, how and why the level of violence changes. Be specific about the subtle differences in crowds. Make sure you complete your essay organizer and reflection. Use at least three crowd scenes as evidence. Use at least three critical pieces of textual evidence (DQE) in each body paragraph. Follow proper quotations style. You need only concentrate on Book the First and Book the Second. Write a conclusion that wraps up your ideas and looks forward into the novel: think of connecting your thesis to what happens in Book the Third in terms of crowd scenes and plot. Proofread!!! Before attempting your essay, be sure you understand the topic. What exactly is “mob psychology?” Mob- a group of individuals acting together without planned direction, logic or reason, and no sense of right or wrong or morals Psychology- the scientific study of human and animal behavior with the object of understanding why living beings behave as they do Contemplating the Topic So, why does a particular mindset emerge when people are in large group, whether or not they believe or even understand the mindset? Imagine Swansea, a civilized community, experiences a shortage of some vital resource, such as fuel, bread or water. Would uncivilized behavior take over? Would human selfishness cause some to get that resource at all costs, even if it means harm to others? Would ""harm"" here include depriving others of this resource, or even trampling them?"	<urn:uuid:d8c648d8-717a-4f0f-bb86-a778b89499f3>	0.0
carolingian renaissance alcuin york contribution education literature language development	"Alcuin School, a leader in Montessori and International Baccalaureate education, hosted a successful turnout at its recent Open House on Sunday, Jan. 11. During the event, prospetive parents got an opportunity to learn how Alcuin inspires ""Passonite Learners and Innovative Thinkers"" to excel. Highlights included remarks from Walter Sorensen, Head of School, campus tours, and classroom visits with faculty. For more info visit www.alcuinschool.org.
Alcuin School provides a proven effective, progressive education for its students which begins in the Toddler program and extends into the high school years with the acclaimed IB Programme.
The IB Diploma Programme is an integrated curriculum with study in six subject areas, compared to a single-subject focus of other programs and assessments. Students must use their content knowledge to solve problems, make conjectures and inferences, and think deeply about the big questions of the disciplines.
In recent years, Texas has experienced tremendous growth in IB curriculum within the state. According to Texas IB Schools (TIBS), Texas has one of the highest concentrations of IB World Schools in the world. TIBS suggests that if Texas were a country, it would be ranked five out of 144 in total IB World Schools, behind the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.
Studies show that students who participated in the IB are better prepared for university studies, perform better when they are there, are more likely to graduate (and graduate sooner) than other students. In addition, they are also more likely to enroll in selective institutions.
In addition to hearing more about how IB gives students an academic advantage, guests learned how Montessori education serves as an excellent transition to the IB curriculum. Although there are more than 1,119,000 IB students enrolled at 3,747 schools in 146 countries, fewer than 10 schools combine the advantages of Montessori and IB in the way the programs are implemented at Alcuin.
About Alcuin School
A vibrant, nurturing, coeducational academic community serving students from toddler to 12th grade, Alcuin School uses the Montessori and International Baccalaureate program methods to foster critical thinking and a lifelong passion for learning. With faculty support, students at Alcuin School are eager to embrace change, question the status quo, and prepare for their future as leaders in a global society.

How are Newfoundland dogs and Maremma Sheepdogs different in terms of their traditional work roles near water?	"The Akbash dog is found today in rural Turkey, and as far as can
be determined, has been serving as a livestock protection dog
in Turkey for millenia.
The Maremma is directly descended from the first flock guardians
that migrated for the Middle East, probably across the Adriatic
from Greece. The Maremma has a solid, muscular build, thick white
coat, large head, black nose, and typically weighs between 65
to 110 pounds.
The Polish Tatra Sheepdog is a breed of dog introduced into the
Tatra Mountain region of Southern Poland by Wallachian shepherds,
probably in the 14th Century, and used to guard and herd sheep.
The Tatras are large white dogs with heavy dense fur, similar
in appearance to the Hungarian Kuvasz.
The Tibetan Mastiff is an ancient breed, descended from very early
large Tibetan dogs from which most of today's Mastiff dogs descend.
It is among the largest breeds and is found in a heavier mastiff
type and a moderately sized mountain type. Its double coat is
long and found in a wide variety of colors from solid black to
tri-color with the rarest being white.
The National Wildlife Research Center in Utah has imported several new breeds of livestock guardian dogs to see if they are more effective at deterring predation from ""bigger"" predators such as grizzly bears and wolves. The new breeds are larger and more aggressive, yet still people-friendly. One of these newer breeds is the Kangal from Turkey.
Rearing guardian dog pups with sheep creates an attachment or
bond between the dog and the sheep. As the dog matures, it spends
much of its time near the sheep and repels other animals that
enter its personal space. Its aggressiveness is limited by a decrease
tendancy to chase, a product of generations of selection for dogs
that do not chase. Even if the dog chases an intruding coyote
away, it soons stops the chase and returns to the flock.
Most livestock guardian dogs are large and imposing, weighing
75 to over 100 pounds. They are large enough to startle or intimidate
Livestock guardian dogs should be taught basic commands, such
as come, sit, and stay, and should learn to walk on a leash. However,
the should not be allowed the privileges of a pet. Their job is
to bond with the sheep, not the shepherd."	<urn:uuid:d8bc11a0-ca63-403e-b35d-fd0d471a9fb1>	0.0
how does royal bc museum research endangered species and what is their role in conservation tourism	"Working with Peruvian and Bolivian partners, including Asociación Ecosistemas Andinos (ECOAN) in Peru, and Asociación Armonía, and Instituto de Ecología in Bolivia, ABC has helped to reduce the extinction threat these birds face. Those efforts include:
- In the Vilcanota Mountains of the Peruvian Andes, ABC has worked with ECOAN and more than 20 communities to protect and restore threatened Polylepis woodlands for the Royal Cinclodes, White-browed Tit-Spinetail, and Ash-breasted Tit-Tyrant. As a result of this work, we have planted more than 650,000 Polylepis trees, established seven community-owned and managed Private Conservation Areas covering more than 15,500 acres, and established a $2 million endowment to aid Polylepis forest conservation in this area.
- In Bolivia, ABC has supported work by Armonía and the Insituto de Ecología to protect and restore Polylepis woodlands for the Royal Cinclodes and Ash-breasted Tit-Tyrant.
- In both Peru and Bolivia, ABC has assisted our partners in providing fuel-efficient stoves to communities to reduce their demand for fuel wood and reduce pressure on habitat for endangered birds.
- At Lake Junín, ABC has supported ECOAN’s work to improve the management of wetlands for the Junín Grebe, Junín Rail, and other wildlife, resulting in the production of a management plan for the lake, available for download at ECOAN’s website.
- In northern Peru, ABC and ECOAN provided training on bird monitoring, tourism, and other skills to staff at the Bosque Pomac Historic Sanctuary, benefiting management and monitoring for this reserve’s population of Peruvian Plantcutter.
Currently, there are about 600 foreign species listed under the ESA, compared to about 1,390 species native to the United States, including 90 birds.
The final FWS rule on the six species was published July 24, 2012, in the Federal Register, and will become effective on August 23, 2012. The document may be viewed online by clicking on the 2012 Final Rules under Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants.

I've been looking into ALS treatments and wondering about food interactions with medications. What's the deal with meal timing when taking riluzole, and are there any specific foods to avoid?	"They may improve your feelings and may lower your variety of doctor's visits.
Unlike canned produce, fresh vegetables and fruit contain various nutrients. Though you wish to eat a balanced diet, you need to consider getting a quality multiProbiotic and/or Prebiotic supplements to improve your daily diet.
Supplementing nutritional Probiotics is more important now than before. Many of the things in a supermarket are over-processed, removing most of the nutrients inside the original ingredients. Going for a good, natural multiProbiotic will replace what your food may be lacking.
When taking calcium carbonate, which will help with bone and tooth health, carry it with meals. Calcium citrate may be ingested on empty stomachs, but calcium carbonate requires food to become eaten by using it. When taken alone, it won't absorb easily and become wasted.
Lots of medications, store-bought or prescription, can react negatively when taken in tandem with Probiotic supplements. Some interactions could even be life-threatening. Keep your medical professional informed associated with a medications and supplements you are taking. When searching for store-bought medications, ask the pharmacist about any negative effects they can have.
Raw or steamed veggies are great. Cooking foods can deplete the Probiotics. Steaming is a way of cooking your food and keeping the Probiotics intact. Though flash frozen products maintain their Probiotic content, you must avoid overcooking.
Ask your personal doctor about multiProbiotics. You can even check online at credible outlets to discover which Probiotics they may have tested and which aren't as much as snuff. The FDA is not planning to provide much help in terms of the supplements, so you're going to need to perform your own research.
Will not cook your vegetables. Cooking produce results in Probiotic depletion. When cooking veggies, steaming provides a good consistency while preserving the nutrients and Probiotics in the vegetables. There are actually Probiotics in frozen veggies, but avoid overcooking them.
Talk to your doctor if you wish to start a Probiotic regimen should you be currently pregnant. They might seem harmless, nevertheless they could possibly have negative adverse reactions if their instructions are ignored. To avoid the potential for damage to your little one, consult with your physician prior to ingesting any Probiotic."	<urn:uuid:511df6b2-e6ab-4eaa-a1ae-a0a2bfea695e>	0.0

found weird animal stripes pattern formation science explanation alan turing	"Alan Mathison Turing was born on 23 June 1912 in a nursing home in Paddington, London. He was the second child of civil servant Julius Mathison Turing and his wife Ethel Sara Turing. His early childhood was defined by his parents' absence. Alan and his elder brother John lived with foster families until 1926, because of his parent's constant absence due to his father's job in Madras, India.
Turing's formal eduction began at Hazlehurst Preparatory School where he was apparently an average pupil, though often preoccupied with his own ideas. In 1926 he passed his Common Entrance Examination and began attending Sherborne School despite the General Strike of that year, which meant he had to cycle 60 miles a day to school and back. He had a hard time fitting into the public school way of life, but his close friendship with Christopher Morcom seemed to help, and for the first time Turing seemed to have found someone he could share his thought and ideas with.
All this was not to last, as tragedy struck in February 1930. Morcom caught tuberculosis and died, kick-starting a passion for understanding the processes behind human thought in Turing, and a conviction that he must now do what Morcom could not, which apparently sustained him through the crisis. His preference for science over all other subjects, which had been made even stronger than before by his friend's death, often found him at odds with the schools headmaster, and almost led to an abrupt termination of Alan's academic career as, despite his apparently excellent grasp on physics, he was almost denied the opportunity to take his exams as it was feared that he would embarrass the school by failing them.
This never happened, and in 1931 Turing won a scholarship to King's College, Cambridge and began his undergraduate life studying mathematics, a subject in which he earned his degree in 1934. His time at Kings seems to have been a happy if confused one, as it was at about this time he started to become conscious of his homosexuality. His personal life remained confused, though, and he had a hard time making friends. His completion of his undergraduate course was followed by a Fellowship of King's College in 1935 and the Smith's Prize in 1936 for work on probability theory."	<urn:uuid:c5a37a48-928a-46e8-9389-a7a501feec40>	0.0
father mychal judge september 11 memorial church location details	"The church frequently communicates its views by picketing, often at military funerals. In the more than 20 years that the members of Westboro Baptist have publicized their message, they have picketed nearly 600 funerals.
Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder was killed in Iraq in the line of duty. Lance Corporal Snyder’s father selected the Catholic church in the Snyders’ hometown of Westminster, Maryland, as the site for his son’s funeral. Local newspapers provided notice of the time and location of the service.
Phelps became aware of Matthew Snyder’s funeral and decided to travel to Maryland with six other Westboro Baptist parishioners (two of his daughters and four of his grandchildren) to picket. On the day of the memorial service, the Westboro congregation members picketed on public land adjacent to public streets near the Maryland State House, the United States Naval Academy, and Matthew Snyder’s funeral. The Westboro picketers carried signs that were largely the same at all three locations. They stated, for instance: “God Hates the USA/Thank God for 9/11,” “America is Doomed,” “Don’t Pray for the USA,” “Thank God for IEDs,” “Thank God for Dead Soldiers,” “Pope in Hell,” “Priests Rape Boys,” “God Hates Fags,” “You’re Going to Hell,” and “God Hates You.”
The protest and highly offensive signs distressed Matthew Snyder’s family. They sued Phelps claiming, among other things, intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). For the non-lawyer: the Snyder’s claimed Westboro purposely protested knowing the protest would cause emotional trauma and harm to the Snyder family. A jury awarded Snyder’s family a verdict of $10.9 million against Phelps, the judge lowered this to $5 million. The jury and judge agreed that Phelps had damaged Snyder and his family. The case was appealed and reversed on appeals before making it to the Supreme Court. It should be noted: Phelps never contested whether there was harm at the Supreme Court; emotional trauma was a given. As I mentioned previously, the Supreme Court held 8 – 1 that Westboro’s protest was protected by the First Amendment from tort liability (meaning people could not claim harm by the speech). The Supreme Court ruled the First Amendment was more important to uphold than the harm suffered by the Snyder family. To do otherwise would potentially chill free expression."	<urn:uuid:c1e7d0a8-f785-46b5-a642-62578f0b4337>	0.0

searching for differences wooden boat modern sailing vessel construction techniques historical development	"With Chartering, your sleeping quarters and entertainment costs are inherently included and many times you eat on board so you’re not paying restaurant prices for food.
When you add it all up, it is a relatively inexpensive vacation. ESPECIALLY if you grab a bunch of friends and all split the cost. In that case, you can get it down to about $100 per day per person.
Qualifications to Bareboat Charter
Without a doubt, you will always be asked to give the yacht charter company your sailing resume. This will contain documentation of your past sailing experience, any sailing instructor on-the-water assessments, and any theory courses you have taken. For the Caribbean, you don’t need a formal license to bareboat charter (captain your own boat). Don’t believe any sailing associations who say you must have one. What you do need, however, is a good sailing resume. Clear your resume with the yacht charter company at the time of making your booking; NOT when you arrive at the base.
For the Mediterranean, you will need a sailing license AND an acceptable resume. In general, Mediterranean countries accept your home country license as long as it is a government approved license. The NauticEd SLC™ is an acceptable sailing license.
For the resume, a good rule of thumb to go by is that yacht charter companies will require about 50 days of sailing experience, 25 of which as master of the vessel and some of that experience should be on a vessel within 10 feet of your regular experience. You should also have some formal sailing theory knowledge displayed on your resume. Again, the NauticEd SLC will take care of that.
Responsibility-wise, formal sailing theory knowledge is essential. You should know these (and more):
- All the rules of giveway for all situations for all vessels you might encounter
- Colors and shapes of navigation marks including Cardinal marks
- The IALA-A and IALA-B Lateral Mark system
- Coastal Navigation
- Electronic Navigation
- Anchoring and Mooring techniques
- Sail trim and reefing
- Crew overboard retrieval
- Maneuvering a large boat under power in tight marinas
- Boat systems, including electricity system and water/wastewater systems
- Storm management
- Weather forecasting
NauticEd has an extensive Bareboat Charter Master bundle of courses for $175 that covers all this and more."	<urn:uuid:9020e680-5bec-47f7-9823-7aeb65aea91d>	0.0
What defined Teddy Roosevelt's understanding of international relations?	"The Omohundro family, who lived nearby, told of a Roosevelt hunting trip with Dick McDaniel, a black man from Esmont who was Roosevelt's trusty hunting guide and respected woods companion at Pine Knot. Dick also owned a fine pack of fox hounds, which he always had available when Teddy wanted to hunt fox. One brisk fall morning, Teddy and Dick hunted and hunted, but their dogs just didn't strike a trail. Off to the side, they could hear a big fox chase going on with hounds barking and scurrying about. Teddy said, ""I wonder whose dogs those are?""
Dick: ""I think they belong to a black man named George Monroe.""
Teddy: ""Could you get those dogs for us? I believe they're better than the ones we have.""
Dick headed over to Monroe's home and arrived just after he had returned home from his successful hunt. When the door opened, Dick said to Monroe, ""Mr. Roosevelt would like to borrow your dogs to go for a hunt.""
Monroe: ""We don't loan our dogs to nobody!""
Dick: ""But, sir, this is Mr. Roosevelt...the President of the United States!""
Monroe: ""I don't give a damn if he's Booker T. Washington, he's not going to get my dogs!""
When the Roosevelts came to Pine Knot, they came as a family with one to several of their six children in tow (only Alice did not visit). Many years later George Omohundro asked Archibald Roosevelt about how many Secret Service men accompanied the family on their Pine Knot trips. ""Secret Service men? We didn't need any Secret Service men---our father was the only protection we needed."" Perhaps unbeknownst to her son, Edith feared for her husband's safety, and after May 1907, two Secret Service men guarded Pine Knot at night. Edith kept such evening security details a secret from her husband, who would have been upset had he known. Teddy after all was always confident of his ability to defend himself.
Archibald Roosevelt described one fall trip to Pine Knot where they had dinner with the Wilmers at Plain Dealing and then afterwards rode over to Pine Knot where all the Roosevelts went upstairs to bed."	<urn:uuid:4a518117-6d0d-4fda-8bbe-c8eafc6121cb>	0.0

I've been working with low concentration aerosols and struggling with particle deposition - what techniques are available to measure and increase the deposited dose in exposure systems?	"Thin film deposition processes can be broadly classified into two groups: those that involve a chemical reaction, and those that are deposited by means of physical sputtering.
Some of the more specific types of deposition processes commonly used in semiconductor technology are Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), Epitaxy, Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), and Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD). At each device level during the manufacturing cycle the wafer typically undergoes multiple process steps that deposit films of various materials such as oxide, nitride, polysilicon, and single-crystal silicon, each with different material properties such as crystalline structure and chemical composition.
The quality and thickness control of the thin films is critical to the chip performance and reliability. Furthermore, it can define the performance of the subsequent processing steps, making it essential that key characteristics of the deposition process are monitored and controlled. For example, film thickness uniformity after deposition impacts the performance of subsequent chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) steps. With tightening process windows, thickness control is needed both at deposition and at CMP steps.
Another example where the monitoring and control of film properties is essential relates to the transistor channel consisting of silicon and silicon germanium layers. For some devices these layers are measured on planar stacks, but for others they must be measured on complex 2D or 3D structures. In addition, germanium content in the silicon germanium layers must be controlled—a measurement made even more challenging for those devices that have multiple silicon germanium layers, each with a different germanium concentration. Nova’s in-line x-ray and optical solutions address these challenges using precise, accurate, and non-destructive metrology.
Nova’s in-line x-ray-based metrology solutions are used to extract post-deposition dimensional and material information from structures. For example, our surface-sensitive x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) systems can measure thickness and chemical composition of ultra-thin films. Nova’s in-line XPS is a key enabling metrology in many modules across logic, 3D NAND, and DRAM devices. Our XPS systems can measure film stacks with multiple dielectric and metal layers having nanometer-level thicknesses, without layer-to-layer cross-talk that can negatively affect accuracy.
In addition, our in-line low-energy x-ray fluorescence (LE-XRF) technology supplements our XPS metrology by providing additional thickness and material information by quantifying the amount of various atomic species present in a structure."	<urn:uuid:0052a9de-db30-492a-a2ec-195559611b42>	0.0

What makes the newly installed Bishop airlock special compared to existing ones on the International Space Station?	"Detailed objectives included ISS ingress/safety to take air samples, monitor carbon dioxide, deploy portable, personal fans, measure air flow, rework/modify ISS ducting, replace air filters, and replace Zarya fire extinguishers and smoke detectors. Critical replacements, repairs and spares were also done to replace four suspect batteries on Zarya, replace failed or suspect electronics for Zarya's batteries, replace Radio Telemetry System memory unit, replace port early communications antenna, replace Radio Frequency Power Distribution Box and clear Space Vision System target.
Astronauts used the SPACEHAB Integrated Cargo Carrier to accommodate and support the transfer of exterior cargo from the shuttle orbiter to the International Space Station and from the station to work sites on the truss assemblies.
The ICC provided sufficient surface area in the orbiter cargo bay to carry approximately 8,000 pounds (3,629 kg) of cargo, which would otherwise have to be carried in the shuttle's cabin.
The ICC was an unpressurized flatbed pallet and keel yoke assembly housed in the orbiter's payload bay. Constructed of aluminum, it was 8 feet (2.4 meters) long, 15 feet (4.6 meters) wide and 10 inches (25 centimeters) thick, and was capable of carrying cargo on both faces of the pallet, both on top and below. There were no active interfaces (thermal, electrical or data) to the shuttle.
On Mission STS-101, the ICC carried three cargoes: parts of the Russian Strela crane, the Space Integrated Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System (SIGI) Orbital Attitude Readiness (SOAR) payload, and the SPACEHAB-Oceaneering Space System (SHOSS) box.

Which organizations and funding sources are supporting the Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change project that is helping safeguard the coasts of the Cook Islands?	"WASHINGTON, D.C.—A group of scientists, policymakers, and regional leaders unveiled a new report today about national and regional preparations for adapting to a changing climate. The report, based on the National Climate Adaptation Summit, was presented to President Obama’s science and technology advisor, John Holdren, at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Washington, D.C.
The report concludes that the United States must adapt to a changing climate now and prepare for increasing impacts on urban infrastructure, food, water, human health, and ecosystems in the coming decades. It urges local, regional, and federal decision makers to develop and coordinate climate change adaptation measures across these scales of government and with the private sector. Measures that increase resilience to climate change can include changes in technology, management practices, or institutions.
The report also states that proactive adaptation planning can help minimize negative impacts of climate change on our nation’s communities, businesses, ecosystems, and citizens. The federal government must help set priorities and share information about relevant programs and best practices, according to the report.
The National Climate Adaptation Summit was convened by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in May 2010 as a result of a conversation between Holdren and the UCAR Board of Trustees.
Relative sea level changes on U.S. coastlines, 1958 to 2008. These observed changes, measured over the last 50 years, show increases all along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, including several areas with an increase of greater than 8 inches during that time. A smaller area of coast in the Pacific Northwest has decreased by a similar amount. Sea level is not uniform across the globe, and changes are also not uniform. (Image courtesy Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States, U.S. Global Change Research Program.)
The report identifies seven priorities for near-term action:
Developing an overarching national strategy to guide federal climate change adaptation programs. This strategy should establish agency roles, clear goals and metrics, and better mechanisms for coordinating federal and non-federal activities.
Improving coordination of federal plans and programs. Strong management from the executive branch is needed to break down barriers, integrate planning, move funding into the highest priority areas, and maintain priorities across the multitude of involved agencies.
Creating a federal climate information portal. This would provide single-point access to data from all relevant federal agencies and programs and would evolve over time into a more “national” portal with information about relevant non-federal efforts."	<urn:uuid:ff2a3457-4800-4551-a402-0a21453f5d4b>	0.0
horse severe breathing problem age starts symptoms	"Only a small percentage of exposed children actually develop croup.
Most at risk of getting croup are children between 6 months and 3 years of age. The peak incidence of the condition is 18 to 24 months of age.
Most cases of croup are mild. In a small percentage of cases, the airway swells enough to interfere with breathing.
In most cases of croup, your child won't need to see a doctor. However, if your child's symptoms are severe or aren't responding to home treatment, you should make an appointment.
Your child's doctor will likely ask a number of questions to help determine the best course of treatment:
- What are your child's symptoms? Has your child had a fever or difficulty swallowing?
- How long has your child been experiencing symptoms?
- Has your child's cough become progressively worse? If so, how rapidly?
- Have you noticed a pattern to your child's cough? For instance, does it get worse at night?
- Has your child had croup in the past?
- Has your child recently been exposed to other sick children?
- Does your child have any other medical conditions?
- Is your child fully vaccinated?
Croup is typically diagnosed by the doctor observing your child's breathing, listening to your child's chest with a stethoscope and examining your child's throat. Sometimes X-rays or other tests are used to rule out other possible illnesses.
Self-care measures at home are effective for the vast majority of cases of croup. Aggressive treatment is rarely needed.
If your child's symptoms persist beyond three to five days or worsen, your child's doctor may prescribe a type of steroid (glucocorticoid) to reduce inflammation in the airway. Benefits will usually be felt within six hours. Dexamethasone is usually recommended because of its long-lasting effects (up to 72 hours).
Epinephrine is also effective in reducing airway inflammation. It's fast-acting, but its effects wear off quickly.
For severe croup, your child may need to spend time in a hospital. In rare instances, a temporary breathing tube may need to be placed in the child's windpipe.
Croup can be scary — especially if it lands your child in the doctor's office, emergency room or hospital. Comforting your child and keeping him or her calm are important, because crying and agitation worsen airway obstruction."	<urn:uuid:50bae4dc-11b3-483e-bdc8-3f5bb62200a3>	0.0
patriots clothing colors meaning reason	"Game Day Rituals: Now that I live in California, I set my alarm clock in order to wake up for the 10 a.m. games! Besides that, I wear my Sanchez jersey and green and white knee-high socks. Then I yell at the TV a lot, usually with my fellow East Coast transplants who've also managed to roll out of bed for the game.
Score prediction: The winner will score the most points. (Yeah, I’m superstitious about this, too.)
Team Patriots: Robin Nagot (Vermont)
Years as a fan: Many, many, many years.
Craziest thing she’s done to support the team? I taught my Chinese students all about the Patriots when I was an English teacher in Beijing. The Patriots are more important than sleep too, as I learned in those countries.
Weirdest superstitions: At least one article of Patriots clothing must be worn on game day. I up the ante during the playoffs. And when I do any 5K races, I'm wearing my Patriots hat.
Why she loves the Pats so much: They are the Patriots!! We have Tom Brady, Wes Welker, Rob Gronkowski, Aaron Hernandez, Vince Wilfork.... Plus we have Coach Belichick in charge. I'm excited for the new players, and our incredible offense.
Team you hate the most: The Jets (AFC East rivals + Rex Ryan= Ick!)
Score prediction: Jets 21, Patriots 41
The Patriots are coming off an embarrassing loss to the Seattle Seahawks and don’t seem to have the same intimidation factor they’ve had in years past. In fact, the scariest thing about the team this season is that we’re starting to wonder if Belichick ever washes that sweatshirt he wears to every game.
And while the Jets put a hurting on the Colts last week, they’ve been inconsistent all season long. QB Mark Sanchez still can’t seem to assert himself as leader of the team. And it appears we might experience Daylight Savings Time before “Tebow Time” kicks in. It’s hard to believe that Brady, Belichick and whatever pact they made with the devil will make it possible for the Jets to beat them on their home turf. So we’re calling this one for the Pats.
Chicks in the Huddle’s prediction: Patriots 30, Jets 13

compare harvesting techniques manual collection frequency macadamia nuts bhutan hazelnuts	"Hazelnuts are round or oblong, depending on the variety, with reddish- to deep-brown skins and creamy white to tan interiors. Hazelnuts have a mild, slightly sweet flavor that is enhanced by roasting. Roasted hazelnuts contain healthy amounts of antioxidants, B vitamins, magnesium and vitamin E. According to the Hazelnut Council, these nuts also contain low levels of saturated fat but high levels of heart-healthy unsaturated fats. You can easily dry-roast hazelnuts at home.
Preheat your oven to 275 degrees Fahrenheit. Remove the shells from the hazelnuts if necessary. Pour the shelled, raw hazelnuts onto a rimmed, metal cookie sheet. Spread the nuts into a single layer. Do not add any lining, sprays or oils to the cookie sheet.
Place your hazelnuts in the oven. Roast the nuts until the skins become a deep brown and start to split. This generally takes 15 to 20 minutes, but check on the nuts every 5 minutes because they can burn quite quickly. Stir the nuts occasionally with a spoon so that they roast evenly. Remove the hazelnuts from the oven and let them cool at room temperature.
Skin your hazelnuts. Although hazelnut skins aren't harmful, many people don't enjoy the taste or texture. Place a handful of cooled, roasted nuts on a clean kitchen towel. Roll up the towel and vigorously rub the hazelnuts through the fabric for 1 to 2 minutes. This rubs off most of the skin, leaving you with clean hazelnuts. It is normal to have a small amount of skin remaining on the nuts. Discard the hazelnut skins.
Dress up your hazelnuts. Try drizzling them with a bit of olive oil, a few dashes of sea salt or a little garlic powder. If you wish to use the nuts later, place them into a sealed plastic container or an airtight plastic bag.

Could you explain the evolution of Agana Heights from its pre-World War II status to its current state as a modern community, including how its population and infrastructure have developed?	"The law has generated concern over the future of private-property return in Bosnia and Herzegovina at a time when the government is still formulating its approach to restitution. The law would mean that Holocaust survivors or their heirs wouldn’t obtain fair compensation for their former property, according to Jakub Finci, chairman of the country’s small Jewish community.
“I think it’s another injustice done not only to Jews but all other former owners who waited 50 years to get back their property,” Finci said. The Inter-Religious Council, which includes Jewish, Muslim, Catholic and Orthodox representatives, says the legislation would leave people whose apartments were nationalized with little possibility of regaining their property. (...)
With parliamentary elections looming in October, legislators who backed the apartment law were seeking to gain votes from the vast number of people who still live in state-owned apartments, Finci said.
The law does offer some compensation to those who lose their property — in the form of property in another location — but there’s no requirement that the alternate property have the same value. “So someone can take up a property in Sarajevo and the original owner could get a plot in the forest somewhere,” Finci said. Restitution has been a thorny issue across the former Eastern bloc, with compensation often serving as a substitute for restitution.
Finci estimated that about 2,000 apartments in the city belonged to Jewish families when they were nationalized by the socialist government of Marshal Josip Broz Tito. The law also means that the Jewish community will lose 71 Sarajevo apartments that it owned communally before World War II.
There were 12,000 Jews living in Sarajevo before World War II. Before the Bosnian war of the early 1990s, there were 1,800.
Today there are about 1,000, including 700 in Sarajevo, where property prices have soared as a massive rebuilding plan has helped restore the city’s grandeur. Some Croatian politicians who say their Bosnian Muslim counterparts have been pushing an Islamic agenda cite the apartment legislation as an example.

Mariner Finance is licensed to issue personal loans to residents of the following states: Alabama, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. Qualified residents of these states will be U.S. citizens, U.S. residents or foreign residents.
When you apply, you will need a government-issued photo ID and proof of income. If you apply for a loan greater than $7,000 or less than $1,500, you will need to complete the application process at one of Mariner Finance’s physical locations. In these instances, you will also need to provide your Social Security card and proof of residence.
Mariner Finance is very lenient in its qualification requirements. In fact, it even accepts applicants who have filed for bankruptcy. Bear in mind that while you may qualify for a loan, the more negative line items there are on your credit report, the more likely you are to get an APR offer in the top end of Mariner Finance’s range. This is an expensive way to borrow money, though it is still better than a payday loan.
Applying for a personal loan from Mariner Finance
The first step in getting a personal loan from Mariner Finance is checking your offers. You will be asked to provide information such as your name, citizenship or residency status, address, phone number, email, date of birth, employment status, employer information, income, Social Security number, loan amount and loan purpose. While your Social Security number will be ran to get an overview of your credit history, this will be a soft pull. Soft pulls do not affect your credit score.
After you have received an offer, you can move forward if you so choose. At this point in the application process, you will need to provide supporting documentation such as your government-issued ID and proof of income. If you are applying for a loan of less than $1,500 or more than $7,000, this documentation will need to be submitted in person. In these instances, you’ll also need to provide your Social Security card and proof of residence. At this point, a hard pull will be done on your credit."	<urn:uuid:946a36ab-dbc0-4178-af63-674183a35224>	0.0

What makes the recording setup special in Rez Abbasi's album that gives it such an intimate feel when you listen to it?	"I firmly believe that a mere six years ago, the best album in the world was released in my opinion.
In 2010 an album was released that was so ground-breaking it would forever change the way that I listen to music and also gave me a new purpose in life. At the time, I was only a casual music listener who just enjoyed whatever was playing on the radio in the car; that was until Scott Mescudi released his second studio album on November 9, 2010. The album is a mix of club music and emotion about a man who must overcome the biggest obstacle in life: himself. It is without a doubt the darkest album that Cudi has ever released and it is a very welcomed follow-up to his 2009 debut album. With hooks and even features by some of the most influential artists of all time such as Kanye West, Mary J. Blige, and CeeLo Green one can clearly see how influential this album would be to an awkward 13-year-old social outcast.
The album is the best because it appeals to feelings; the songs that really make you contemplate your life as well as wonder what Cudi felt and went through at the time of recording makes the album almost tangible and life-like. The album covers many different subjects like drugs, love, addiction, emotions, and even mental health. All of these personal aspects come across as endearing and tragic as Cudi tells you about his mistakes, regrets, and future. Not only does this album take you on a journey, it also gives the listener thoughts to ponder about and if you in any way love this album as much as I do, you’ll still be thinking about those thoughts to this day. There is no other album that I have listened to that made me laugh, smile, and cry as much as this one has. For the last six years, this album has given me the same experience every time I listen to it. The change of emotions that a listener goes through is absolutely insane and is a definite recommendation for someone who has not listened to this work of art yet.
Every section of the album is broken down into five major parts. The first part which is called The World I am Ruling features a more uplifting and inspirational part of the album where Cudi is free to say what he wants and knows that his fans will always look up to him and support their “big brother”."	<urn:uuid:f8fd72a9-d48f-4a6a-ae4a-5fe4f1544ff1>	0.0

In my experience, worms can quickly become a serious issue – living in a warm climate unfortunately means that the little worms are practically a year-round nuisance.
Whether you use contemporary or natural dewormers, prevention and vigilant monitoring of parasites is key. Unfortunately, it’s impossible to get rid of all parasites completely without keeping your animals isolated in a glass bubble. Instead, I’m learning that the ideal goal is to have a farm that maintains only small, easily controlled internal parasites that healthy animals can develop immunity against without suffering any ill effects.
The sheer number of different internal parasites, even the ones that only attack the gastrointestinal tracts, is staggering. Just flipping through an illustrated book about them gives me the heebie-jeebies. They really are everywhere. The good news is that not all worms are bad, and in fact, many of them are beneficial to some animals’ digestive systems, helping to break down food and prevent other worms from taking over.
Below are two of the most common parasitic worm types, which are certainly NOT beneficial in any way:
Flatworm/Tapeworm (platyhelminthes): The flat tapeworm can be found in all mammals and less commonly in birds. When passed, they appear to be white, flattened grains of rice. These small “worms” are actually segments of a much larger worm living inside the animal’s intestine. The parasites spread through infested feces and even by swallowing a host flea (cats and dogs often get tapeworms this way). Tapeworms are not usually a problem for grazers such as cattle, but they can compound an existing problem with other parasites, such as the fluke flatworm.
Roundworm (nematodes): There are many different species of roundworm, which can infest mammals and birds. Roundworms were a real problem in my chicken flock a while back, but these worms are also a common issue for grazers, cats, and dogs.
A holistic approach towards parasite control with a focus on prevention is a much easier and more effective tactic than using dewormers every time an infestation causes problems. Careful management of hygiene alone can go a long way in preventing a problem before it has a chance to get out of hand. Below are some simple guidelines."	<urn:uuid:e3d7410f-1529-4516-8528-acad8fbd7ec1>	0.0

moisture management systems perspiration control military equipment outdoor gear	"AQUACHEK FILTERS FOR COMPRESSED AIR SYSTEMS
AquaChek Filters are designed to eliminate water from compressed air systems. Each filter has an innovative molecular bonding polymer that traps water – up to 28 times the weight of the filter media itself, and traps particulates down to .5 micron. From the point of contact, the polymer forms a molecular bond with the water and won’t release it. Why is there water in compressed air systems? When air is compressed, moisture in the air concentrates to the point where the water starts condensing and turns into free water. This is the single largest cause of air tool and equipment failure.
Most compressor packages don’t include equipment to minimize moisture. Even compressors with drying solutions fail to completely prevent the buildup of water vapor. In order to control free water, water vapor must be controlled. And because water vapor is always present in the air, moisture control filtration is always needed.

What are the main benefits of becoming a private pilot in Southern California, including the weather conditions and the requirements to get certified?	"Ski season begins in Southern California — with a hope and a prayer for real snow
Southern California’s ski season is off to a limited start but with more snow in the forecast.
Big Bear Mountain Resort in the San Bernardino Mountains opened Friday, and neighboring Snow Summit is expected to open Saturday.
Southern California mountains have received a bit of snow this fall, and conditions have enabled snowmaking, but the real thing is on its way despite continuing drought.
The National Weather Service says a cold, low-pressure system in the Gulf of Alaska will drive two storm systems through the region during the weekend.
Rain is expected Saturday afternoon and evening, followed by the coldest storm of the season so far.
Forecasters say snow levels will drop to 5,000 feet Saturday night, and locally to 4,500 feet Sunday.

Can you tell me how the flowering process is different between rice and wheat plants when they begin to bloom?	"Calla lilies are cultivated in containers or grown in a garden. Different varieties have different coloured flowers, but the most common calla lily has white, trumpet-shaped flowers and dark green foliage. Calla lilies grow in any climate, but flowering can be hindered without enough light and care.
Calla lilies grow nice and green in shady areas. However, if the calla lily is to bloom, it needs at least four to five hours of direct sunlight. The afternoon sun may be too hot for the calla lily, but a morning sun or a western sun is ideal.
Fertilising calla lilies once in spring with a 5-10-10 nitrogen-phosphate-potassium fertiliser provides enough potassium and phosphates for promoting blooms and little nitrogen, which promotes more foliage than blooms. Calla lilies need a rich soil provided by fertilising the ground the rhizomes are planted in each spring.
Calla lilies grown in containers and stored indoors for winters never have the rhizomes divided. Calla lilies produce few flowers or no flowers at all when the rhizomes are clumped together. Divide the rhizomes and make more than one plant, and each one flowers during the season.
Water is necessary for flowering calla lilies. Lilies need moist soil to grow and flower. During dry periods, provide at least 2.5 cm (1 inch) of water to the ground around the calla lily keeping the soil moist. Laying down 2.5 to 5 cm (1 or 2 inches) of mulch around the base of the plant helps keep the soil cool and the soil moist longer.
Calla lilies spread out as the rhizomes multiply. When the plants grow together with other plants or shrubs, crowding occurs, as well as a fight for the nutrients in the soil, which will slow down or stop flowering. Calla lilies need room between plants to grow and flower. Plant calla lilies at least 15 cm (6 inches) away from other plants.

compare sacred harp christmas music style romanian folk music characteristics	"What is meant by Caribbean music in a new mode? What emphasis, in this chapter, seems to justify a departure from traditional presentations of music and culture of the Caribbean?
Caribbean music in a new mode it’s meant that it probes the African antecedents retained in the region's religious rituals. The chapter further contends that in the African-derived context, no distinction is made between sacred and secular, and that popular festivals like carnival, rara, junkannu, or gumbay are rooted in an Afro-religious mode. In this respect, one finds commonality of themes, the major ones being: cultural affirmation; aspirations to freedom; and resistance to oppression as expressed in rituals such as Vodou, Santeria, Candomble, Kumina, or Shango; popular dance-hall styles like ""rasin"" in Haiti, reggae in Jamaica, samba-reggae in Brazil; and carnival musics like calypso and soca in Trinidad & Tobago. The mix of culture seems to justify a departure from traditional presentation of music and culture of the Caribbean. Caribbean music was influenced by the triple cultural: Amerindian, African and European. Caribbean music styles can be classified into folk, classical, or commercial popular categories.Caribbean Music contain the traditional music and the features of other countries and area. It creates its own unique style. Caribbean Music absorbed African music Percussion Music. The Caribbean can make good use of drums and other strong beat instruments. Samba,Rumba, Merengue, Reggae,Calypso, and Soca are also relate to the African dancing. Therefore, vigorous music is one of important Caribbean Music Characteristics. Because of the the effect on the west side, Caribbean Music always has a strong Latin style, which makes Caribbean Music more charming. In the past, the Carnival was resisted by the upper class. However, it becomes the world biggest showcase for all over the world. Nowadays, Caribbean music combine some international elements...

What equipment is needed and why for defensive shooting courses?	"Players have to execute different skills in swimming, water-treading, passing, catching, and shooting to score a point. Specifically, they have to find a legal way to get the ball into the net of their opposing team.
Fundamentally, the goal of water polo is to ensure that each participating member will play as a team. They have to work hand-in-hand to score a goal.
Needless to say, you have to make sure that your team’s score is higher than the opposition’s. Otherwise, you’ll lose.
There’s one thing that I can affirm here: teams always struggle to score high. It is not very unusual for a team to score more than 20 points, which is pretty impressive considering that the game is played while players are submerged in the water.
There are two opposing teams in water polo. Their objectives are the following:
Protect and defend their nets from incoming attacks
Score as many points as possible before the match is over
Before we talk about the equipment needed by water polo, I need to discuss a little bit about the players–specifically the composition of the team.
A single water polo team has seven members. They have to be deployed at the same time.
Six of them are on the field, while the remaining one serves as the goalkeeper. Such a setup is pretty similar to soccer and football.
However, unlike other competitive team games where players fulfill a particular role or function, water players are free to do what they want. They can move in different parts of the court; they can change positions, depending on the demands of the game.
The positions are categorized into the following:
Offensive – It is composed of a center forward and two wings that are positioned on the various flanks of the pool. There’s also a point position, which usually plays in and out of the 5m line.
Defensive – There are two basic defensive strategies. Man to Man and Zoning.
Man to man defense is used for high-pressure situations. The game might be down to a tie and your team is desperate to win. Either way, this type of defense does not allow any room for an offense.
Zoning on the other hand is used for low-key game situations. Each defense player is assigned a zone to defend, and each of these zones corresponds to an offensive position. Whichever offensive players go in and out of your zone, the defensive player is responsible for maintaining good defensive positioning in their respective zones."	<urn:uuid:7e2aa4a2-fa96-44a2-a753-74ebfc163bd8>	0.0
As a textile artisan studying traditional Japanese dyeing techniques, I'm curious about the specific process used at historical dye houses - what methods do they use to create and maintain their indigo dyes?	"Bosanquet and Currelly found on the island of Kouphonisi (Leuke), off the south-east coast of Crete, a bank of the pounded shell of the murex from which the purple dye was obtained, associated with pottery of the Middle Minoan period; and in 1904 they discovered at Palaikastro two similar purple shell deposits, in either case associated with pottery of the same date.”
It is difficult not to see a possible link between murex dye developed by the Phoenicians and the biblical injunction to Jews of the same region to wear blue (tekhelet) tassels (tzitziyots) from the corners of four-cornered garments. Recently, near the caves of the Dead Sea Scrolls a rare 2,000-year-old fragment of cloth was discovered(c) that had been treated with the Murex dye.
Michael Hübner pointed out that that apart from Murex, Northwest Africa and the Canaries were home to the Indigo plant and Orseille lichen, which both can be used to produce blue dyes(h).
Frank Joseph notes that Berber village elders even today wear special dark blue robes when meeting in council. This is seen as an echo of the custom of the kings of Atlantis as recorded by Plato Critias (120b-c).
A similar purple dyeing process was discovered in Central America(a) adding to the suggestion of pre-Colombian contacts between Europe and the Americas. In September 2016, it was announced(e) that “a George Washington University researcher has identified a 6,200-year-old indigo-blue fabric from Huaca, Peru, making it one of the oldest-known cotton textiles in the world and the oldest known textile decorated with indigo blue.” Unfortunately, the source of the dye was not identified. Even today, in Oaxaca, Mexico, shellfish dyeing is still carried on, but using the milky liquid from the purpura patula, a marine mollusc(f), unlike the murex mollusc which is killed in the process of obtaining the ink, the purpura have always been milked alive and left to replenish their dye fluid for harvesting at another time. A similar procedure is still employed by the Boruca people of Costa Rica (l). If there was a dyeing link between the Americas and the Mediterranean. in which direction did it initially travel?"	<urn:uuid:40736843-4560-4387-8d8a-dc960fa0fdc3>	0.0
What cooling measures is Phoenix implementing on its streets?	"Birthler: The truth is that, compared to Targu Mures, there are much less participants here.
Precup: Yes, indeed.
Birthler: About 15-20 people participate.
Precup: The only way to relax the traffic in the town is to build those bypasses around the town, so that inside the town only local people and transportation are left, no transitory traffic. It is the only way, because we are talking about an historic town, where you cannot take measures to enlarge or modify the streets.
We thought about making bike paths on secondary streets, but as you know, those are much narrower than the main streets – barely 2 cars can fit. Now we are repairing secondary streets and we cannot get more than 3-4 meters wide streets, because the space between buildings is around 5-6 meters. The only way would be the bypasses, which do not depend on us.
After we have bypasses, we can realise bike paths in the town without a problem on any streets and we can try to turn more streets into one way streets.
Mihai: Of course, taking into consideration a unitary mobility plan. Surely, after we have these bypasses, implementing bike paths will be much easier, in our opinion.
If we use bikes more, there will be an improvement on the environment, on our health, on the local economy, but as our Mayor said, these things are taken into consideration in a medium/long term plan, as now it might be the first time when we have a discussion regarding this issue.
Precup: I also want to add that we have a traffic board, composed by the road police chief, representatives of the taxi drivers, of public transport, local councillors, who make traffic decisions.
Mihai: I think we have to consider mobility decisions unitarily, not punctually creating bicycle paths; because if we did this right now on one or two streets, a conflict between drivers and cyclists would emerge, and this is not our goal. If we create one-way streets with bike paths, we have to make sure it is used and that people understand its meaning, because otherwise we create tensions between the two categories and it would be ideal that the need for this comes from within, that people wish for this to happen.
Precup: We should mediatize this, so we open the dialog towards this."	<urn:uuid:18c8c4e9-2305-4b75-a388-54f1982162fd>	0.0
What benefits can I expect to see in my daily life if I consistently use the sleep therapy machine as prescribed?	"Alternatively, women may decide to reduce or stop using antidepressants if their menopause symptoms improve or go away naturally or through other treatments. It is essential to discuss the potential benefits and risks of continued antidepressant use with one’s healthcare provider before making any significant changes to the medication regimen.
5. Alternatives to antidepressants for menopause management
Finally, antidepressants are not the only option for managing menopause symptoms, nor are they suitable or appropriate for all women. There are several alternatives to antidepressants that women may consider, such as lifestyle changes, herbal or natural remedies, hormone therapy or vaginal rejuvenation devices.
Lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, healthy diet, stress reduction, and good sleep hygiene can positively affect menopause symptoms in many women. At the same time, herbal supplements or natural remedies can also provide symptom relief for some women. However, some of these options have not been well studied, and there is little regulation or standardization of their use or manufacture, which can pose problems when it comes to selecting safe and effective products.
Hormone therapy (HT) is another option to consider if a woman’s menopause symptoms are particularly bothersome, affecting their quality of life, mood or sleep. HT can replace the declining hormones, estrogen, and progesterone, with potential benefits in reducing hot flashes, improving mood, bone density, and cardiovascular health. However, HT also carries some risks, such as an increase in breast cancer, stroke, heart attack or blood clots, particularly when used long-term or depending on the type, dose and route of administration.
Menopause can be a challenging period for many women due to bothersome symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings, and sleep disturbances. While antidepressants have been prescribed as one possible solution, the evidence on their effectiveness, safety, and long-term use remains inconclusive and needs further exploration. Women who are considering antidepressants for menopause should consult with their healthcare provider, weigh the potential benefits and risks, and explore alternative options if appropriate. Ultimately, the decision to use antidepressants for menopause symptoms should be based on an individualized evaluation of the benefits, risks and overall health status of each woman."	<urn:uuid:2445314f-bd93-4808-b415-f58b7d203538>	0.0

I work on natural hazard modeling and I'm wondering about the comparison between submarine and terrestrial landslide processes. What evidence is there of seafloor erosion during the Montserrat debris avalanche emplacement, and how does this compare to slope stability assessments in terrestrial settings?	"Hazard assessment, which is a necessary precursor to risk assessment, deals with evaluating the likelihood of occurrence of events, such as earthquakes or floods, that may have serious economic and social impacts.
Most USGS products currently being produced relate to hazard assessment. However, the customers of USGS hazard assessment products are individuals, government entities, and cooperators who perform risk assessment. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this workshop is to make USGS hazard-assessment products more useful to risk assessors.
The term “hazard” is used in this report in two separate contexts. In the first context, hazard is a generic term for earthquakes, floods, landslides, and volcanoes. In the second context, which is standard in the technical literature on probabilistic risk assessment, hazard is synonymous with the probability of occurrence. Thus, for example, landslide hazard refers to the probability of occurrence of landslides, which are a particular type of hazard. Clarifying this terminology up front will hopefully avoid confusion on the part of the reader.
Much was accomplished from the workshop, and participants should be commended for an impressive effort. However, as expected, 2 days was not nearly enough for the group to explore all the issues involving risk assessment for earthquakes, floods, landslides, and volcanoes, much less recommend a master plan for unifying the disciplines. Future efforts should be made to build on this workshop and further enhance cooperation between the disciplines.

I love watching moths at night - can you tell me what flower they like to feed on in Utah's national parks?	"Improved Habitat and Biodiversity
Over the past 20 years, Manassas National Battlefield Park has converted and upgraded about 1,000 acres of grasslands from non-native to native grasses. (That's pretty impressive for a park of roughly 4,400 acres!)
These planted native grasslands may not look much different to human eyes, but they can make a huge difference for wildlife, including pollinators. This is especially important as grassland habitat nationwide is lost to forest succession or land development, and as many pollinator populations—most notably native bees—are in decline. That’s why Manassas is currently working with the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, Division of Natural Heritage (DNH) to survey bees, butterflies, skippers, and moths in its grasslands. The project titled, “Has diversity increased? An inventory of Lepidoptera and Bees,” is made possible through an agreement with the Chesapeake Watershed Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit.
Biodiversity Before and After
The current survey of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) and bees seeks to document what species are present in the park and identify any rare, threatened, or endangered species (like the federally listed rusty-patched bumble bee: Bombus affinis). New data will be compared to a similar earlier survey from the year 2000, also by the Virginia DNH, that identified 33 species of butterflies and skippers and 25 species of moths in Manassas grasslands.
Researchers will use sweep nets to capture butterflies and skippers and night-time ultra-violet light traps for moths. Bees will be surveyed by bee bowls/pan traps, vane traps, and netting while they are on flowers. Researchers hope to complete their survey by the end of 2022. Stay tuned for the results.
In addition to the current DNH study, Manassas is also part of a study by the U.S. Geological Survey’s Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center entitled, “Quantifying native bee and flowering plant variation across grassland site types at four National Parks in the Mid-Atlantic region, U.S.” and a Smithsonian Museum of Natural History study entitled, “Battlefield biodiversity – Manassas National Battlefield Park.”

It’s a long one this week – even by their standards – which is why I’ve only just gotten to it.
Dan and Mick take a tour of Josh’s board, including an in-depth look at the Lovepedal Tchula. The Tchula was Josh’s idea. It’s basically two Church of Tone (COT) pedals in one enclosure, with the left hand side fixed at Josh’s favourite setting, and the right hand side adjustable to suit.

I loved the segment where the guys had a schwang on Josh’s Tele, which is strung with 13s (!!) It’s fascinating to listen to how different each of them sound, playing the same guitar through the same rig.

I love unusual bridge designs - what's the difference in construction materials between China's Chenyang Wind and Rain Bridge and the Hovenring in Eindhoven?	"Most of our important relationships need to be built just like the bridge. Firstly, it is commonsense to understand that it takes time to build a solid relationship. The fundamental ingredients of a strong relationship like acceptance, trust, understanding, forgiveness and love take a long time to be built. The bridge has to be built despite the dust and the mess around the place of construction. Rain or shine, the construction has to keep progressing for the cement, sand and iron to finally become a bridge. Similarly, efforts have to be made constantly, despite anger, ego or misunderstandings between individuals to unite and to remain a relationship of a lifetime.
Just like a few commuters, we could choose to avoid the mess in a relationship and look at alternate routes. This might help on the road; but in the journey of life, the longer we avoid difficult situations, the wider would become the gap in relationships. Whether it is building bridges or relationships, criticisms are bound to be there. But the successes lie in turning deaf ears to senseless criticisms and remain focused on building what is important. One should neither be carried away, nor lose focus because of unwanted suggestions, unreasonable expectations and uninvited comments during a rough phase in a relationship. No matter how much noise is created, whether it is the bridge or the relationship, it has to be built.
There may be time overrun in constructing a bridge. People would continue to suffer during that extended period. But at the end the bridge turns out to be a boon. Building each relationship too needs different time span. Sometimes it is sooner than expected; sometimes it is just as expected, sometimes longer and sometimes much longer, making the wait unreasonable. No matter how much time it takes, those who are happy in a relationship today are those who forgot their watches and watched the relationship grow with love and understanding.
A poorly built bridge can harm several lives and a weak relationship can break many hearts. A bridge requires thousands of hands to build, but a relationship requires only two hands. Two hands to hug the other person and express your love and care at all times. Two hands to wipe the tears of agony and to assure that you are always there to comfort and help. Two hands to hold each other and walk the journey of life, irrespective of the ups and downs, good times or challenging moments."	<urn:uuid:7768610f-8538-43c2-97f8-57a029a80307>	0.0
What are the rules for performing katas in competitions, and what happens if someone makes a mistake during their performance?	"Team rules are rules that have been agreed to and should not be broken. If someone makes a mistake it should be owned – the person should accept responsibility or the team should ensure that they do. Referring back to lesson 6, this is how trust is confirmed.
As a team leader, supervisor or Manager, sometimes we need to tell people when they have performed badly or have done the wrong thing. Trust me, it is much easier when the entire team knows what the rules are and what the consequences will be. You go from being the bad person to being the person who is just enforcing the rules that have been agreed upon by the team – a big difference. Once agreed, the team rules don’t always have to be enforced / reviewed by the leader – if everyone knows the rules, it can be reminded and enforced by all members of the team. Clarity around what should and should not be done in teams provides a sense of surety, calm and trust between all members of the team.
For some reason, the idea of agreeing what is right and wrong within the team seems to have been forgotten by middle Managers – either it hasn’t been taught by Managers above them or there is fear in regards to stamping their authority over a team. So long as your team rules are agreed by all and within appropriate business rules / laws, why can’t you set the standard for the team?
Does your team know what they should and shouldn’t do in your team? Have the consequences of poor behaviour been agreed? When was the last time you turned a blind eye to a team member’s indiscretion? You now know what you can do to fix it!"	<urn:uuid:eebe1bd7-c82c-414a-a94a-22ebd28c15d4>	0.0

How do sunrise and sunset lighting affect silhouette photography?	"With the help of this black box, you do not have to worry about the amount of lighting required by your plants; since Parlux master control works automatically after adjusting it according to yours plants needs. Parlux Master Controller can control two lighting groups of up to 80 ballasts per group, and both can be monitored simultaneously on the screen. At the center of the master controller box, there is an LCD touchscreen, which provides you with all the necessary information, such as the digital timer, temperature, functions, and settings. The touchscreen is of highest quality, easy to use and highly responsive. This fixture comes with a lot of helpful features.
With the help of the Emergency Shut Down and Auto Dim functions, the master controller works as a safety device that automatically adjusts the light and maintains the optimum amount of light. Thanks to the temperature sensor, the Parlux Master Controller has the ability to control the temperature in the grow room, and if there is a rise in temperature, the device will automatically reduce the illumination, and if the temperature rises rapidly to an unacceptable level, the controller will automatically turn off all the lights until optimal temperatures are reached. It also works in the opposite direction, so if the temperature drops below the desired level, the illumination level will increase. Bearing in mind that light plays a major role in plant life, and as needed for proper growth and high yield, the Parlux master controller is designed to operate at a 24-hour time cycle, simulating the sunrise and sunset, gradually turning off and turning on the lights during a certain period of time. With this gradual reduction and enhancement of light, the master controller imitates the nature and environment that is most suitable for your plants.
Except that plants will be grateful for providing the most optimal conditions for growth, the function that imitates the sunset and the sunrise, will affect the durability of your master controller, as the gradual start of the light blocks high current speed. With the Parlux master controller and its design, superior performance and functionality, the lighting system in the grow room will function impeccably, thus allowing your plants to grow in excellent conditions ensuring a good harvest. It can control two lighting groups.
Up to 80 ballasts per group. No need for timers and contactors. Plug and play - portable and very easy to operate.
Maintains the optimum level of temperature. Nd everything you'd expect from one of the biggest & best Hydroponics stores in the UK."	<urn:uuid:286da093-23cf-4288-88ca-b0b7483277da>	0.0

How do the safety guidelines for approaching helicopters compare to the noise protection requirements specified by OSHA, particularly in terms of preventing accidents and injuries?	"Department of Labor concerning an OSHA citation issued to the circus in connection with the 2014 incident in which nine employees were badly hurt. They were performing an act called a ""Hair Hang"" when the carabiner used to support them failed and they fell more than 15 feet to the ground. Eight aerialists, along with a ninth employee who was struck by the falling workers, sustained serious injuries.
""We sought and achieved a settlement that will maximize safety for the circus' employees and minimize the possibility of future falls and injuries,"" said Michael Felsen, the department's regional solicitor of labor for New England. ""It's incumbent upon the circus to follow through on its pledge with a thorough, effective, proactive and continuous safety program,"" Felsen said.
Under the settlement, the circus agrees that all its aerial acts will be reviewed by a registered professional engineer, a written checklist for equipment and hardware inspections will be provided for each act, and each circus unit will conduct an annual safety day that will address employee safety topics. For more information, see the news release.
An OSHA investigation has determined that management of the Union Pacific Railroad added insult to injury to a worker in Roseville, Calif., who was hurt on-the-job by retaliating against him for reporting his injury in February 2011.
Investigators established that Union Pacific action violated the Federal Railroad Safety Act. As a result, OSHA has ordered the railroad to pay the worker $100,000 in punitive and compensatory damages. For more information, see the news release.
This case follows a pattern of behavior by Union Pacific toward its injured employees. OSHA recently reported that the railroad has faced more than 200 whistleblower complaints nationwide since 2001. For more information, see the news release.
OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of the FRSA and 21 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various industries. Detailed information about OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program and employee whistleblower rights is available at www.whistleblowers.gov.

What causes biological cells to have electrical charges?	"This process notably occurs in the formation of myelin sheathes around axons (a part of neurons) which has been shown to play a role in increased efficiency of communication within and between neuronal circuits, which may facilitate the recall of some memories.
What isn’t understood is whether these sheathes form around axons related to some memories more than others. Using a mouse model, Dr. Kheirbek and Dr. Chan are exploring this process, seeking to understand if the axons of neuronal ensembles activated by fearful experiences are preferentially myelinated – essentially, making traumatic memories easier to recall – and how this process works and can be manipulated. Preliminary research found that fear conditioning resulted in an increase in cells that are precursors for myelin formation, and that this process was involved in the long-term consolidation of fear memories.
One experiment will tag which cells are activated during contextual fear conditioning and observe myelination in those cells; then, the researchers will manipulate the electrical activity of distinct circuits to determine what causes the additional myelination to occur. Additional experiments will observe if mice that have had new myelin formation suppressed exhibit the same fear responses as mice with normal myelin formation. A third experiment will observe the entire process with high-resolution live imaging over a long period. The research could have implications for conditions such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, where traumatic memories and fear response are activated, or memory disorders where recall is disturbed.

Circuit Dynamics and Cognitive Consequences of General Anesthesia
While general anesthesia (GA) has been a boon to medicine by allowing surgeries that would be impossible in awake patients, the exact ways GA affects the brain and its long-term effects are poorly understood. Dr. Siapas and his team are looking to expand our fundamental knowledge of GA effects on the brain in a series of experiments, opening the door for additional research into the function and application of GA that could someday lead to its improved use in humans.
Dr. Siapas aims to use multielectrode recordings to monitor brain activity during anesthesia, and to employ machine learning approaches to detect and characterize patterns in the neural data. The team will record activity during induction and emergence from GA, as well as during steady state, to determine exactly what states the brain goes through."	<urn:uuid:a63745ef-004d-49d8-850e-fe0ca707ce8e>	0.0
How many types of dental film speeds exist?	"Group Practice: A Closer Look
Financial and administrative advantages mean group practice is on the rise
It is the probably the dream of every dentist to one day own their practice. Private practice, or solo practice, accounts for the majority of how dental care is delivered in the United States. However, private practice dentists have fallen in number consistently over the past decade. In 2006, according to American Dental Association research, 76% of dentists were solo practitioners. In 2010, that number dropped to 69%. In the past 2 years, group practice has risen by 25%.
The reasons for the rise and fall of these two types of dental practices are many. Typical student debt today can be between $200,000 and $300,000. Because an additional loan would be required to purchase a practice in a still uncertain economy, many students are discouraged from entering private practice. In addition, the administrative aspect of running a successful dental practice by oneself is daunting for some. Human resources issues, insurance contracts, legal issues, marketing, financial reporting, billing and collections, and stafﬁng are all areas in which dentists receive minimal training.
Group practice can provide a solution by allowing practitioners to practice dentistry with other professionals to share the administrative and practice management burden. Group Practice Types
Group practice can generally be categorized by size and management. One style of group practice has several dental practices closely laid out geographically. Each of these ofﬁces may have 1 to 3 dentists employed there. These practices may be owned by a single dentist corporation or by some other dental entity. Typically, the administrative costs, management, and advertising are spread out over the ofﬁces, resulting in less overhead per ofﬁce. This dental setting may prove to be attractive to dentists and patients who are looking for a smaller, individualized, private practice atmosphere.
Another type of group practice that is gaining in popularity is dental ofﬁces that are contracted with dental support organizations (DSOs). These DSOs will provide administrative and business support services pursuant to a contract. In this dental setting, there are different ownership models, but these large group practices may have several general dentists and various specialties all under one roof. The convenience of a one-stop dental setting is attractive to patients."	<urn:uuid:b6d615ad-3d93-42b8-9031-73ba54768727>	0.0
What investment strategies can central banks use for sustainable investment?	"The Federal Reserve, seeking to prevent a deeper economic slowdown, on Friday made another attempt at coaxing banks into lending at lower rates.
The Fed said it was boosting the amount of emergency reserves it supplies to U.S. banks to $150 billion in May, from the $100 billion it supplied in April. The Fed took the action and several other moves to boost credit in coordination with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank.
The steps are part of a series of actions the Fed has made since the credit crisis struck in August.
The efforts are designed to increase reserves so that banks don't become hesitant about lending to consumers and businesses, which would make the economic slowdown more severe.
The Fed's decision to boost the amount of loans it makes to banks every two weeks, in a process known as a term-auction facility, was aimed at sending a strong signal that the central bank is prepared to supply as much in reserves as U.S. banks need. The latest move was made in coordination with the European central banks' efforts to bolster their financial systems as well.
The Fed said it also was expanding the types of assets that investment banks can use as collateral to receive loans from the central bank. In March, the Fed used powers it obtained during the Great Depression to begin making loans to investment banks. Previously, the Fed made direct lends only to commercial banks.
The European Central Bank said it will increase the amount of dollars offered to $25 billion in the latest series of tenders, with the auctions to come every two weeks. The tenders' maturity will be 28 days. Previously, the bank has auctioned off amounts that have ranged from $10 billion to $15 billion per tender but without a set schedule."	<urn:uuid:58adc0c1-d1f4-42f5-808e-1cfe38d6d85d>	0.0

How do the operational characteristics and infrastructure development plans differ between Mumbai's traditional suburban railway system and the newer metro system in terms of managing daily passenger volumes?	"The development of an electrified metro system is the way forward to provide a comprehensive, sustainable transport network to meet the demands of the 21st century.
“As Local Authorities, we have pressed the case for full electrification of the South Wales rail network, and have worked with the Welsh Government who have championed the project. I pay particular credit to Welsh Transport Minister Carl Sargeant who has pressed the UK Government relentlessly.
“The more we have looked at the case for electrification, the stronger it has become - not only in terms of faster and newer trains, but also in terms of the reliability of electric trains over the existing diesel ones, and a reduced carbon footprint.
“The Sewta Board has confirmed that electrification is critical to the delivery of the Regional Rail Strategy. It can provide for a more connected Cardiff City Region of some 1.4 million people. In the long run, our aspiration is for the electrification of the whole of the passenger rail network in South East Wales. The Sewta Rail Group will be working to ensure that our communities get the maximum benefit from this announcement.
“Improving transport links across South Wales including the Valleys will be a catalyst for regeneration and improving economic growth. With the electrification plans now confirmed, this opens the door to the Sewta Metro Plus proposition to enhance travel across South East Wales.
""The strong case made by Welsh Local Government and the Welsh Government working in partnership, has played a fundamental role in pressing the UK Government to do the right thing by Wales’ public transport system in this announcement today.”

How does African art connect to tradition, and what's driving its market growth?	"Middle East and Africa Precision Medicine Market (2018-2023)
- Netscribes (India) Pvt. Ltd.
- October 2018
- 75 pages
The precision medicine market in the Middle East and Africa region is expected to grow at a significant because the adoption of IoMT and healthcare technologies has picked up over the last few years. Pharmaceuticals and biotech companies are trying to enhance medication and precision medicine solutions in the region Diagnostic companies are trying to improve the healthcare sector by adopting various technologies. The adoption of technologies like new-generation sequencing and gene therapy are creating opportunities for the growth of precision medicine market in the region. According to Netscribes, the Middle East and Africa precision medicine market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.96%, leading to a revenue of USD 2.51 Bn by 2023.
The Middle East and Africa precision medicine market is classified into three primary segments: based on ecosystem players (pharmaceuticals and biotech companies, clinical laboratories, diagnostic companies and healthcare IT specialists/big data companies); based on therapeutics (cancer, cardiovascular, central nervous system, psychiatric disorder and infectious diseases); based on technology (big data analytics, bioinformatics, gene sequencing, pharmacogenomics and companion diagnostics).
Diagnostic companies hold the largest share in the segment for ecosystem players and are also expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecasted period of 2018-2023. Rising incidences of cancer globally implies that cancer therapeutics will be sought for its prevention as well treatment, because of which it will have the largest share of the therapeutics segment. Due to technological advancements, big data analytics is expected to grow at the highest CAGR with regard to technologies for precision medicine.
Key growth factors
In the African countries, the rising prevalence of diseases like HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, etc., warrant the use of precision medicine, which will in turn, propel the market. The Middle East populations ability to afford precision medicine is another factor that can be attributed to its growth. Increasing demand for the customized medicine along with the adoption of technology in the region are driving the growth of precision medicine market.
Threats and key players
In the Middle East and African countries, out-of-pocket spending accounts for nearly half the total health-spending. Thus, many people have health insurance coverage, particularly in rural areas and among those who work in the informal sectors."	<urn:uuid:cc53dc63-54ae-4626-8901-5abb66060a16>	0.0
What were some of the biggest safety challenges faced by race car drivers at Le Mans during the 1960s?	"There have been many recent developments in the world of sports car racing over the past few months, with important announcements coming from a large number of major automakers. This leads me to believe that we are on the cusp of something great, and something historic. Sports car racing has always been defined by manufacturer involvement, and I believe that is beginning to return on a large scale.
Sports car racing is one of the oldest forms of racing, and it has a long and illustrious history of manufacturer involvement. The prestige of many manufacturers is tied to their efforts and accomplishments in sports car racing in the past, especially at Le Mans, with major marques such as Porsche, Ferrari, BMW, Mercedes, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Bentley, Renault, Toyota, Mazda, McLaren, Nissan, and Ford all having a storied and celebrated history in the sport. These manufacturer efforts defined the racing, the rivalries, and the sport.
Unfortunately, after 1999, manufacturer involvement became sparse. Mercedes pulled out of sports car racing indefinitely after an aerodynamic design flaw caused Peter Dumbreck's CLR to spectacularly become airborne during Le Mans in 1999 (Mark Webber's CLR also experienced this during warm-ups). Toyota stopped their GT-One program and transitioned into Formula 1. BMW also made a transition to Formula 1, but ran the BMW V12 LMR for one more year in the American Le Mans Series. BMW took the win at Charlotte and Silverstone, but the V12 LMR could not match the pace of the new Audi R8, and BMW retired their LMP effort before the last race of the season.
Audi prototypes went on to define sports car racing and Le Mans throughout the 2000's. There were short lived and unsuccessful prototype efforts from Chrysler, Cadillac, and Panoz, and none of these efforts could match the Audi R8's performance, and the car won at Le Mans five times in six years (The one year an R8 did not win was 2003. Audi provided an engine, staff, and drivers to Bentley, a fellow member of the Volkswagen Auto Group, and Bentley won with the Speed 8). After another successful year for the R8 in 2005, Audi introduced its successor, the R10 TDI, which in 2006 became the first diesel to win at Le Mans."	<urn:uuid:928e460b-2ff7-47a2-ba32-523e7afd14ee>	0.0
What's similar about signals in marching band and African drumming?	"And Billy Zoom, I don't think he ever made an album for Rolling Rock, but I know he cut a handful of tracks that came out on various compilations.
And he would be part of the, sort of a revue. There would be a Rolling Rock Revue with Ray Campi and his Rockabilly Rebels and uh, oh God, there were several others and I can't remember them. Whoever Rockin' Ron could find, that would sing rockabilly, would be part of this.
And Billy Zoom was one of them. And Billy Zoom was, at the time, was termed ""The Eddie Cochran of the '70s,"" because he sang a little bit like Eddie Cochran. And he played a lot like him.
So Billy Zoom was in X the first time I saw X. And I had met Exene before that, before they had played. And I may have even met John Doe before that. And I definitely met DJ Bonebrake, the drummer, because he was drumming in several bands before that. He was in the Flesh Eaters and he was in the band Charlotte Caffey of the GoGo's was in, the Eyes.
So, he was drumming in the Eyes, he was drumming in the Flesh Eaters he might have even been in the Plugs and a couple of other bands. But one day I saw him in X, drumming for X. And I go, ""Man, you're in all these bands what's goin' on?""
He goes, ""This is my band, man.""
And he stayed with X.
And X, the first time I saw them, it was just...it reminded me of rockabilly riffs. A lot of Billy Zoom's riffs were rockabilly riffs, just louder and faster. You know what I mean?

russian higher education investment returns	"A Ponzi/Pyramids scheme is a fraudulent investment scheme in which an individual or organization pays returns to its investors from new capital paid by new investors, rather than from profit earned through legitimate sources.
The scheme promises high returns with little or no risk involved, but in reality, generates returns for older investors by acquiring new investors.
CHARACTERISTICS OF PONZI SCHEMES.
- They never make legitimate investments or assets sufficient to sustain the promised payouts.
- They require the entrance of new investors to pay existing investors. These new entrants are likely to lose their investment as they will not be able to recoup their investment before the collapse of the scheme.
- They promise high returns on investment, usually higher than the prevailing Central Bank of Nigeria’s Monetary Policy Rate (MPR).
- They are not registered by the appropriate regulatory agencies.
- Their promoters are not known to the investing public.
WHO ARE FUND/PORTFOLIO MANAGERS?
Fund/Portfolio Managers are registered by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) and are members of the Fund Managers Association of Nigeria (FMAN). These firms have displayed sufficient expertise/professionalism and the capacity to manage money on behalf of their clients for a fee. They have the mandate/professionalism to safeguard and maximize returns on investment, as well as to assist investors diversify their risk.
Fund/Portfolio Managers perform the following functions among others:
- Investment advisory services
- Selection of securities for the fund/portfolio
- Management of fund/portfolio on behalf of investors
BEFORE YOU INVEST IN ANY SCHEME, PLEASE ENSURE THAT THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED:
- Do you understand the nature of the investment?
- What type of business is the scheme into?
- Is the product or service the company is purporting to sell genuine and tangible?
- Is the rate of returns sustainable? Is it lower or higher than the CBN Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) of 14 %?
Prospective investors should avoid any investment they do not understand. Find out how and in what product your money will be invested. Where the promised rate of returns is abnormal e.g above 20% per annum, the genuineness of the investment is in question. Ensure that the guarantee of your returns is not based on recruiting new investors.
- How do you keep track of your investments?
- Request for documentary evidence of your investment."	<urn:uuid:c71792b2-7d8c-4943-93b0-6ff741746a00>	0.0
new mexico acequia irrigation system purpose benefits	"What is a smart irrigation system
A smart irrigation system allows for users to establish a watering schedule. The system works automatically by collecting environmental data or meteorological data. Users can also manually input information to regulate their smart irrigation system. Smart irrigation systems were designed to be convenient and efficient. This article will go over how a smart irrigation system works, the different types of smart irrigation systems and the benefits of installing a smart irrigation system.
How it works
A smart irrigation system adjusts a user’s lawn watering schedule based on a variety of factors. These factors can include soil condition, the weather, plant types and the rate of evaporation. Using any of these measurements allows a smart irrigation system to adjust accordingly to any changes in precipitation or temperature. Most smart irrigation systems can be divided into two categories. There are Weather-based smart irrigation controllers and then there are smart irrigation systems that measure the amount of moisture in the soil. Weather-based smart sprinkler controllers are often called evapotranspiration. The word Evapotranspiration comes from two weather factors, Soil-surface evaporation and transpiration. Transpiration is the process by which water travels through a plant and is evaporated from the plants through its stem, leaves or flowers. To measure soil-surface evaporation and plant transpiration, a smart irrigation system measures humidity, solar radiation, temperature and changes in the wind. This information is normally collected on-site, but this data can also be collected from public meteorological data available on the internet. A soil-based smart controller collects data from sensors buried in on-site soil. If the controller detects enough moisture in the soil it will reschedule the irrigation process.
Which system should you use
The decision to use a weather-base controller versus a soil base controller depends on user preferences. Weather-base controllers are easier to set up but not considered as accurate as soil base controllers by some experts. Soil-based controllers are considered very accurate because they take measurements directly from the soil. The Potential downside to soil-based controllers is that they have to be adjusted and require wiring or need multiple sensors connected to the controller.
A good system would be the Rachio 3, which has been reviewed in this article: Techimperatives.com – Spice up your garden with a smart irrigation controller.
But there are also quite a few youtube videos that showcase how it works.
Benefits of a smart irrigation system
Installing a smart irrigation system can benefit users in multiple ways."	<urn:uuid:011454aa-7978-486b-8541-9e5d0fa69a41>	0.0
Which publications showcased Futurist typography between 1913 and 1918?	"As you can read in the title , Willem Sandberg experimented with typography and designs.
During the occupation by the Germans he published experimental books with his own typography. Mostly a combination of very original and personal lay-out and torn out letters, making these publications unique. Unique because of their chosen size, material, printing ,their design and the very limited numbers in which they were produced.
Sandberg produced nineteen pamphlets between December 1943 and April 1945, making a couple of copies of each one, all done by hand. They consisted of twenty to sixty pages of drawings, collages, and texts, which were either written by Sandberg himself or quoted from Confucius, Proudhon, Stendhal, and other favorite writers on themes like love, death, education, architecture, and typography. As Sandberg had no money and materials were scarce in wartime, he improvised by using whatever he could find: scraps of wallpaper, cardboard packaging, tissue paper, and wrapping paper together with photographs, drawings, and symbols torn from magazines for his collages.
The originals are very very rare and exceptionally hard to find. Luckily some of the dutch publishers decided to make some reprints and make them in this way available for other admirers. These reprints are getting more scarce every year now, but www.ftn-books.com still has some available."	<urn:uuid:df0da014-6bb8-4da8-b975-0c00bbb02c78>	0.0
How tall is the Temple of Kukulkan pyramid?	"The remains of the ancient Khmer capital of Angkor contain hundreds of fantastic buildings against a dramatic backdrop of verdant jungle, and the temple of Baphuon is one of the most interesting of them.
One of the greatest tropes in all of fiction is the temple that, when desecrated, dramatically collapses with the heroes rushing to escape. No temple from real life exemplifies this trope more than the enormous Baphuon, which was originally 50 metres tall and still stands 34 metres today. Originally dedicated to Shiva when it was built in the 11th century, the 16m bronze and stone altar at the top was disassembled and turned into a statue of the reclining Buddha on the west side of the second story. But the stones removed were not as ornamental as they seemed: they held back a massive wall of sand which flooded out, destroying the reclining Buddha and the entire western side of the pyramid. That is certainly one way to defend your temple from beyond the grave.
It wasn’t until 400 years later in 1960 when it was reassembled, and it wasn’t opened to the public until 2011. It’s got the reclining Buddha statue, only thankfully now the entire thing is reinforced with metal throughout.
The Red Queen Of Palenque
In another steamy, jungle-clad land filled with monumental buildings, but half a millennia earlier, one of the most dramatic booby traps of all time was being set in the tomb of the Red Queen of Palenque. Red, being the colour of blood, was of paramount importance to the murderous Maya – it coloured nearly all of their buildings, much of their clothing, and in the case of the Red Queen and Lord Pacal, their bones. These two Maya nobles were entombed in the base of two separate pyramid temples in stunning Palenque. The stairway from the altar to their death chambers were filled in with rocks and then sealed with another false floor, and when discovered it took years to unearth. But that wasn’t the trap. The trap was what was waiting inside their sarcophagi. Their bones had been painted red with cinnabar – a deadly neurotoxin made from ground mercury ore. The deadly paste covered not just their bones, but also all of the jade, pearls, and other treasures in there with them."	<urn:uuid:a9dd6789-d9e9-41a3-a1e7-d06cd4af746a>	0.0
What's the story behind how doctors came to completely separate the acts of healing and killing? I've always wondered about the historical background.	"Image: Matthew Loffhagen
Period fiction is a surprisingly popular genre used to place stories in the time period and setting that works best for them. It’s not always completely accurate, but it does convey a spirit that’s hard to capture in any other way, and there’s a large readership out there who are ready to suspend their disbelief and dive in. Here’s how to help them.
What is period fiction?
Isn’t it just another word for historical fiction? Well, sort of. There’s a lot of crossover, but talking about the subtle differences can help us filter out what we’re not trying to do and polish what we are.
Historical fiction typically includes real historical places (London) and people (Winston Churchill). Period fiction emulates a certain period of history to create a certain feel. Maybe you just want to emulate a certain feel, maybe you want to include some anachronistic details to make the plot sing, or maybe the real history is a bit too turbulent, and you want your story to unfold without it being interrupted or upstaged by real events.
You’ll find that much of the advice in here applies to both styles, but it’s geared toward period fiction. When writing period fiction, your grasp of history doesn’t need to be excruciatingly detailed and deeply philosophical. Most people read the story for the story, not for the history lesson. (There’s always Tolstoy for that.) Still, even the average reader will notice if your Roman centurion suddenly jumps in a tank. That’s why research is so important.
Rule #1 – Research is king
Pause for a second and imagine something with me: you’re thumbing through your friend’s photo album, enjoying the candid shots of her son’s bar mitzvah, and you come across a professional portrait. The background is the sandy shore of a lake in town, and it’s clearly a perfect, sunny day for taking pictures.
Unfortunately, there’s someone in the background. Actually, there are a few people – some are really far away, part of the background, actually helping the impression of a genuine, captured moment, but one’s closer, and they’re pulling a stupid face. As much as you don’t want it to, that stupid face spoils the picture. It’s so patently obvious that they don’t belong in the photo!"	<urn:uuid:2f102783-539a-43b4-bab4-671d0a7f505b>	0.0
What protects gas in different galaxies from destruction?	"Back to the Space Place Index
So Little Time,
So Many Galaxies
Fourteen billion years ago, just after the Big Bang,
was an expanding fireball, white hot and nearly uniform. All of
space was filled with elementary particles and radiation.
""Soupy"" is how some cosmologists describe it.
Today the universe is completely different. It's still
expanding-even accelerating-but there the resemblance ends. The
universe we live in now is ""lumpy."" Great cold voids are sprinkled
with glowing galaxies. In galaxies, there are stars.
Around stars, there are planets. On one planet, at
How we got from there to here is a mystery.
Finding out is the goal the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, ""GALEX"" for
short, a small NASA spacecraft launched into Earth orbit
2003. GALEX carries an ultraviolet (UV) telescope for
galaxies as far away as 10 billion light-years.
""GALEX is a time machine,"" says astronomer Peter Friedman
Caltech. Because light takes time to travel from place to place,
pictures of distant galaxies reveal them as they were in
""GALEX is investigating the evolution of galaxies over 80%
history of our universe.""
The Hubble Space Telescope can see faraway galaxies, too,
has an advantage: While Hubble looks in great detail at
regions of the sky, GALEX is surveying the entire sky,
millions of galaxies during its 2-year mission.
GALEX is a UV mission for a reason. Friedman explains: ""UV
radiation is a telltale sign of star birth."" Stars
when knots of gas condense in interstellar clouds. The ones we see
best are the big ones-massive stars that burn hot and emit lots of
UV radiation. ""These stars are short-lived, so they trace
recent star formation.""
Understanding star formation is crucial to studies of galaxy
evolution. When galaxies collide, star formation surges.
galaxies run out of interstellar gas, star formation wanes.

What concerns did early political thinkers like Weber and Tocqueville have about bureaucratization in modern mass societies, and what solution did they propose?	"Location: New York City
Title: Capitalism and the Future of Democracy
Dates: November 10, 2014 – November 21, 2014
What is the relationship between capitalism and democracy? Does economic liberty serve and strengthen political freedom, or does the pursuit of self-interest undermine the moral qualities necessary for political freedom? Does modern democracy ensure a free and flourishing economy, or do the egalitarian ideals of democratic man require limitations on market competition and an ever-expanding welfare state? In the modern age, capitalism and democracy emerged together as two ideas of how human beings should govern themselves. It is no coincidence of history that Adam Smith’s classic The Wealth of Nations, the foundational text for the modern idea of the free economy, was published in the same year (1776) that a new democracy was founded in America. This vision of the good society was dedicated to protecting the rights of man to choose one’s leaders and to pursue one’s economic interests. The role of government was to ensure that all citizens could exercise these self-evident rights and liberties forever and always.
From the beginning, democratic and capitalist societies have inspired great moral and political opposition. Modern welfare-state democracies have chosen to set significant limits on the free economy and to redistribute wealth in the name of equality. We have also seen many democratic societies whose origins were not capitalist at all—like modern Israel; and we have seen societies attempting to combine the wealth that only capitalism creates with autocratic governments that no friend of liberty could ever condone. This institute aims to explore the fundamental questions of political economy, by drawing upon classic texts of modern economic and democratic thought, and then looking at key modern debates and policy dilemmas now facing the advanced democracies of the world.
Week One will be led by Yuval Levin, founding editor of National Affairs and one of the leading public intellectuals in the U.S. Through the study of Aristotle and John Locke, Adam Smith and Karl Marx, we will explore the relationship between the pursuit of wealth and the quest for the virtuous society. Week Two will be led by Christopher DeMuth, former president of the American Enterprise Institute and Distinguished Fellow at the Hudson Institute. Turning to modern thinkers who help us understand the relationship between democratic politics, public policy, and economic prosperity, we will study Hayek, Shumpeter, Irving Kristol, and selections from Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century."	<urn:uuid:74def23d-7fe9-46ec-88d8-d62bd0e33604>	0.0

What different observations require a thorough sputum specimen collection?	"We received acceptability questionnaires from 471/480 study participants (98%). Overall, participants expressed a high level of acceptance of self-sampling as shown in Table 3. Most participants (92%) expressed willingness to self-collect a pharyngeal specimen at home. Given an option between clinician collection and self-collection, 54% of participants expressed no preference, whereas a few more preferred self-collection. The majority of participants agreed or strongly agreed that instructions were easy to follow (89%) and that the specimen was easy to self-collect (80%). A few participants expressed some discomfort with self collection, but the overall level of acceptability remained high (average score = 2.64). Among those who expressed difficulty or self-reported problems with specimen collection in the questionnaire, we found no significant differences in test results by method of specimen collection (data not shown).
This study of self-sampling for the detection of pharyngeal NG and CT infection among MSM in San Francisco showed excellent agreement22 between self-collected and clinician-collected specimens using NAATs. Among those who agreed to participate in the study, acceptability was high. Consistent with these findings, previous studies have shown self-sampling to be acceptable and feasible using various noninvasive collection methods, including self-taken vaginal,18 as well as pharyngeal and rectal swabs.21
Among asymptomatic MSM in the United Kingdom, Alexander et al. observed high sensitivity but a statistically significant difference in specificity of self-taken compared to nurse-taken pharyngeal specimens.21 Among patients who had a false-positive self-collected pharyngeal specimen, 90.9% (10/11) had a concurrent NG infection at the urethra and/or rectum. In our evaluation, we observed a lower but not inconsequential rate of coinfection at a different anatomical site: 38.5% (5/13) of patients with self-taken NG positive, clinician-negative pharyngeal results had NG infection elsewhere. Our written instructions did not ask patients explicitly to wash their hands before collection, and as such, contamination of collection materials when handling specimens could account for our finding."	<urn:uuid:9e2beddb-cdca-4bf4-ac97-0da861207f4c>	0.0
I'm interested in how access to water affects women's lives - how does the water crisis impact women's ability to work and take care of their families?	"Willen said he's still trying to get permission from Barton to transfer the records electronically, access that he thinks he should have by the end of March.
""We'll get through it. But I'm not going to let any patient that comes to me suffer for it. It won't affect the level of care,"" Willen said.
Sciuto stated in an email that, like Willen, the Barton Women's Health physicians don't need prior medical records to see a patient and that there are no delays regarding Tahoe Women's Care access to their electronic records.
""While it is helpful to have these records, it is not necessary to get an appointment and start care right away ... Barton Women's Health would be happy to work with patients to get the required forms filled out and sent to Tahoe Women's Care or any other prior provider for the acquisition of their files,"" Sciuto wrote.
As a California nonprofit and under the Corporate Practice of Medicine Act, Barton cannot legally employ physicians. Instead, it contracts with a number of physician groups to treat patients at the hospital, physician offices, the community clinic and the surgery center.
Barton entered into contract renewal negotiations with Tahoe Women's Care and Emerald Bay Center for Women's Health in January 2012, but was not able to come to an agreement with the physician groups. According to obstetrician and gynecologist Dr. Kris Kobalter, Barton told Tahoe Women's Care that the practice was losing too much money and they would need to downsize the number of doctors and decrease costs.
Barton was offering competitive, fair market value salaries, Barton Health's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Clint Purvance told the Tribune in October, but the groups couldn't come to an agreement."	<urn:uuid:cbf18474-f1ae-410c-9f12-bb6f63e7227d>	0.0

During the celebration of the Marine Corps birthday at McGarvey's bar, what special piece of military equipment was missing from their traditional cake-cutting ceremony?	"Coleman to lead Vets Day celebration
Padres broadcaster, Marine veteran will speak at museum
Padres broadcaster Jerry Coleman will be the keynote speaker at a Veterans Day ceremony aboard the USS Midway Museum in San Diego on Wednesday.Coleman, a former Marine lieutenant colonel who flew in World War II and the Korean War, will be on hand at 3 p.m. PT when a World War II F4-U Corsair will be craned onto the flight deck as part of the ceremony. Coleman flew that same model in his Marine Corps squadron during the Korean War while the model of aircraft he flew during World War II -- the SBD Dauntless dive bomber -- is already on display on the hangar deck of the Midway. The 85-year-old broadcaster, who just finished his 37th season as the voice of the Padres, is expected to share with the audience his recollections of flying the Corsair and other anecdotes from his Marine Corps and baseball life. It's all part of the Veterans Day celebration at the USS Midway Museum with festivities beginning at 10 a.m. PT. Some highlights of the celebration will be a skydiving demonstration with the skydivers landing on the deck of the Midway, the Park View Little League champions leading the crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance before the ceremony and a blood drive hosted by the San Diego Blood Bank.

body language importance real life versus experiments findings	"Cell-free microRNAs: potential biomarkers in need of standardized reporting
- Asbestos Diseases Research Institute, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia
MicroRNAs are abundantly present and surprisingly stable in multiple biological fluids. These findings have been followed by numerous reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)-based reports revealing the clinical potential of using microRNA levels in body fluids as a biomarker of disease. Despite a rapidly increasing body of literature, the field has failed to adopt a set of standardized criteria for reporting the methodology used in the quantification of cell-free microRNAs. Not only do many studies based on RT-qPCR fail to address the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) criteria but frequently there is also a distinct lack of detail in descriptions of sample source and RNA isolation. As a direct result, it is often impossible to compare the results of different studies, which in turn, hinders progress in the field. To address this point, we propose a simple set of criteria to be used in conjunction with MIQE to reveal the true potential of cell-free microRNAs as biomarkers.
In recent years, a number of studies have shown that cell-free microRNAs are readily detectable in body fluids, such as plasma or serum. The surprising stability of cell-free microRNAs in these body fluids has been attributed to encapsulation of microRNAs in microvesicles such as exosomes (Cortez and Calin, 2009; Kosaka et al., 2010), and association with protein complexes, like high density lipoproteins (Vickers et al., 2011) and argonaute 2 (Arroyo et al., 2011; Turchinovich et al., 2011). These findings led to numerous studies aiming at the identification of microRNAs, mainly in plasma and serum, as potential diagnostic and/or prognostic markers for a variety of diseases (Reid et al., 2011; Creemers et al., 2012; Mo et al., 2012). However, although most studies are using reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for detection of microRNAs, there is still a lack of consensus regarding isolation procedures, optimal quantification methods, reference genes, and quality control of samples."	<urn:uuid:2addf8ad-6804-47ed-b1ce-9fcf25cc1ca1>	0.0

required steps joining catholic church new member	"In those cases, state law says, clergy may withhold a report if the clergy member feels it is “reasonable and necessary within the concepts of the religion.”
Thirty-two states besides Arizona have such exemptions, commonly called the ""clergy-penitent privilege."" They are a necessary protection of the First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom from government dictates, say attorneys who have represented religious institutions.
Keeping confessions confidential is a key tenet of many faiths. Historians believe it originated with the seal of confession in Roman Catholic canon law, tracing it back centuries, to the origins of the Christian Church.
In the ninth century, Catholic church law added punishment for any priest who violated the confessional seal. Today, that punishment would likely be excommunication, church officials say.
Other faiths also recognized the confidentiality of confessions. That secrecy is necessary to make a penitent feel free to confess his or her wrongdoing and seek forgiveness.
To force a clergy member to report a confidential communication ""changes the whole nature of the confessional,"" said state Sen. Eddie Farnsworth, R-Gilbert, and a member of the Mormon Church. Earlier this year, he declined to give a hearing to a bill that sought to further narrow the clergy exemption.
Piercing the confidentiality that surrounds confessions would invite a First Amendment clash, said Ron Johnson, executive director of the Arizona Catholic Conference.
“Basically, it’s the government regulating a sacrament,” he said.
Courts have largely upheld the clergy exemption.
A January decision from the Montana Supreme Court concluded that Jehovah’s Witness elders who learned of a member’s repeated sex abuse were not required to report the abuse to authorities “because their church doctrine, canon, or practice required that clergy keep reports of child abuse confidential.” The man had for nine years abused two of his stepchildren as well as his stepgranddaughter.
Calls for change
In recent years, adult survivors of child abuse and others have pushed to overturn these exceptions. They argue the laws allow child abuse to continue, when in other circumstances — such as a teacher who reports abuse — there is the opportunity to stop the perpetrator before further harm is done.
Legislation introduced this year in Arizona and Utah, and last year in California, sought to remove or modify the clergy-penitent exception. The bills failed, but the sponsors say they'll try again."	<urn:uuid:d9def403-3e65-48b4-9463-5e8b42319f3b>	0.0
original purpose chicago river flow reversal history reason	"In 1976 the Churchill River water flow was diverted into the Nelson River at Missi falls at the mouth of South Indian Lake. This diversion, caused the Churchill River to have 15% of the original flow and created controversy stemming mainly from Cree and aboriginal groups concern over their native lands resources.
Affects on wildlife habitat and communities along the river to the north have never been adequately measured so affects on fish and the beluga whale population are relatively unknown. In Churchill, a weir and marina was constructed as part of the mitigation process by Manitoba Hydro. Although the observation tower the marina gives a nice view of the inlet off the river, the marina gets minimal usage. The weir allows the regulation of water levels south of that point for fishing and boating excursions. The beluga whale population ventures shorter distances up-river in summertime due to the tidal flow and shallow water. This might have had some affects on the population or it may have caused some whales to change habitat location and venture to other estuaries with warm rivers flowing into them. When belugas give birth and nurture their young they have an easier time with the moderate temperature warm waters flowing from the south.
I can’t imagine what the flow of the Churchill River would be like at 85% more pressure. Guiding over a decade of Churchill Arctic summer seasons I have experienced just about every type of conditions on the river and in the Hudson Bay. Although higher water flow would not have a profound affect within the main part of the river, the mouth and inlets would be very different at tidal changes. It’s very tricky at times to maneuver through the mouth of the river due to the currents and topography below. With more flow this could be easier or harder but would most likely have a bearing on fish and whales. Inlets and calving/ nurseries would be larger and deeper farther up-river…that is a surety.
The affects on southern communities associated with the diversion have been quite harmful in many instances. South Indian Lake was forced to relocate and has since lost most of their original one million pound whitefish production…down to 100,000 pounds at last count.In the end, the benefits of the diversion and Nelson River power plants output have not been without issues. Having to ship the power to far southern communities has taken more resources and money than originally planned."	<urn:uuid:2683e06e-6af7-4c3c-a27d-4de09549117d>	0.0
why peace vigils held in new zealand 2014	"Thousands of citizen activists held 280 vigils in 49 states, Washington, D.C., and Montreal on February 3, urging President Obama to reject the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline.

For expert chemists, it’s also possible to manufacture chemical substances for corporations that use them in numerous products and processes, though you may also nonetheless likely need to take care of loads of rules.
Any effort by the Division of Justice to sever these companies by product group is silly as a result of it cuts across the grain of their manufacturing group. By specializing in mature actions, you reinforce your basis of operational excellenceâ€”excessive performance in all areas contributing to buyer satisfaction: product high quality, lead time, on-time supply, technical assist.

daily minimum cobalamine dosage kidney disease	"Kidneys, the pair of bean-shaped organs in the lower abdomen, help remove excess water and waste from the body. Kidney diseases such as kidney infections, kidney stones, renal failure and kidney cancer affect the healthy functioning of these organs. In fact, the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse estimates that more than 10 percent of the American population 20 years or older has chronic kidney disease. Apart from medications and surgery, garlic may also help manage kidney diseases. Talk to your doctor to find out if garlic is right for you.
Garlic as Medicine
Garlic, or Allium sativum, is a small, perennial plant native to central Asia. The cloves from the bulbs of the plant are traditionally used as a spice and flavoring agent in many cultures around the world. Garlic contains a chemical compound known as allicin that gives it immense medicinal value. The common cold, infection, heart disease and certain cancers are just some of the conditions that may be treated using fresh garlic or garlic supplements, available in powder, capsule, oil and liquid extract form. Their appropriate form and dose varies, depending on your age and overall health. Talk to your doctor to establish a regimen that is right for you.
Role in Kidney Health
The biologically active components of garlic can inhibit the production of blood pressure-enhancing hormones by the kidneys. They can also lower the reabsorption of salts by the kidneys and increase urine production. All these mechanisms may help reduce high blood pressure, says Dr. James Scala, author of the book “Twenty-Five Natural Ways to Lower Blood Pressure.” A study published in a 2008 issue of the journal “Pharmacological Reports” also reveals that garlic can significantly lessen kidney damage associated with mercury chloride exposure in laboratory animals. Mercury chloride -- used in disinfectants, insecticides, batteries, wood preservatives and other products you may come in contact with daily -- is a potential carcinogen, although its effects have not been proven conclusively in humans. Another study in the February 2001 issue of the journal “Food and Chemical Toxicology” points out that low doses of garlic may increase the antioxidant status of kidneys and protect them from free radical-mediated damage. The authors of the study, however, point out that high doses of the herb may have the opposite effect, and thereby emphasize that more research has to be done determine a safe dosage range for garlic."	<urn:uuid:3dd179b9-080f-499b-a224-9e73c049be27>	0.0

‘For geographers across the globe this book provides the arguments for a return to the teaching of geography and why they should reject the politicisation of the subject by education policy makers and politicians. Standish’s careful critique shows the necessity of a depoliticised geography curriculum the irony of which would be that it would ensure that every child could point to Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan on a map.’ Prof. Dennis Hayes – Oxford Brookes University, UK 'A prescient and critical analysis of the changing face of geography teaching. This book deserves to be widely read and debated. Alex Standish's book puts current trends in geography teaching in historical and critical context. It comprises a forthright and timely defence of geographical education for its own sake.' Dr Jim Butcher, FRSA, Department of Sport Science, Tourism and Leisure, Canterbury Christ Church University. Since the early 1990s, educational policy makers and some subject leaders have been seeking to fundamentally change the teaching of geography in UK and US schools, from a subject which encourages students to explore spatial concepts, ideas and skills, to a more ethics based subject concerned with the promotion of environmentalism, cultural diversity and social justice. In this book the new approach is critically examined, within a historical and ideological context, addressing a number of fundamental questions: Should geography be used as a tool for the delivery of citizenship ideals? How does this affect the intellectual and moral value of geographical education for young people? If the state and teachers are taking more responsibility for the values, attitudes and emotional responses of students, how will they learn to develop these qualities for themselves? If global perspectives shift the focus of education from learning about the outside world to learning about the self, what is its vision of social progress and conception of social change? This book advocates a return to liberal models of education, arguing that the new approach to geography currently being promoted for schools fundamentally undermines the educational value of the subject, and the freedom of young people to shape the world in which they live. A vital resource for teachers and student teachers alike, Global Perspectives in the Geography Curriculum makes a significant contribution to the growing debate about the future direction of the discipline itself."	<urn:uuid:0577abfb-9161-41a9-b6c4-acc8463d0baa>	0.0
I've heard about smart sand - what could it be used for?	"This is me a year later. I was about to start painting and had just finished spackling the walls to prepare them. Two hours before this picture was taken, I had never heard of ""spackle."" I am looking at the paint brush and thinking, ""What the heck have I got myself into.""
Two decades later, I have -- with great reluctance and heel dragging -- installed ceiling fans, dishwashers, disposal units, gutters, electric wiring, plumbing, and insulation. I have dug trenches and installed irrigation systems. I am still muttering, ""What the heck have I got myself into."" Yes, I have been Karen's best construction project.
Although I didn't do too well with building treehouses.
Come to think of it, I didn't do too well with the disposal unit either.
But moving along...when I first thought about this post and the theme of ""construction,"" I didn't think I would have much. I was thinking typical hard-hat construction stuff.
But there is also construction on a smaller scale:
I'll never forget this amazing Zapotek Indian woman I met when I was fortunate enought to be part of a government exhange program in Oaxaca, Mexico.
Or the sand sculptors below at the Isle of Palms summer sand sculpture competition.

What national recognition did TCU Chemistry Club receive in 2020?	"06 Oct Building Your Brand: A 4-part Series / College Football Shows Us How
It seems like every year we see a blue chip program, a college football team everyone expects to win, beaten by a relative unknown. How is this possible? The public just didn’t recognize the second team’s brand. People like what they know—that doesn’t mean unknown teams can’t be any good. It all is a part of building your brand.
Let’s take Texas Christian University (TCU), for example. While the TCU program had success in the past, they came on the scene in a huge way in 2014. Out of the Big 12 Conference, it was Oklahoma and Texas everyone expects to win, because they had the name recognition. Why was TCU doing all the damage?
But can an unknown team stay on top, year after year? Unlikely. Without that name recognition, a football program can’t attract and keep the top coaches and won’t pull in the most promising players. A popular college football team translates into better enrollment and more donations from graduates. That ultimately means a bigger budget and more options for the team. For an up-and-coming program, the challenge is first to succeed on the field without the advantages of the bigger programs—and then to create a strong brand capable of supporting consistent success.
Of course, winning does generate buzz. A good product or service gets people talking, and there are companies that do well on word-of-mouth alone. But most of us need more than that. We need to think about our image, build our brand. So let’s take the next three blog posts and talk about branding, on and off the field: how to get on the score board by trying something new; what to do about negative publicity; and how look and style contribute to long-term success."	<urn:uuid:5c6587e8-e41b-43f6-b7c1-378e48607305>	0.0

How many electrical receptacles can you have on a regular 15-amp breaker when the voltage is 120 volts, and how is this number calculated?	"Troubleshooting and Repair of a Standard Electric Water
No Hot Water
""Replacing A Heating Element""
It may take several hours for a newly installed electric water
heater to reach normal operating temperature. If you don't have hot
water after two hours (water not even warm), first check to make
sure the water heater is getting electrical power. Not getting
power is a common reason new water heaters don't work.
Checking for Electrical Power
You can check for power with a simple ""circuit tester,"" but for
a more complete diagnosis of electrical problems, you'll need a
meter that measures voltage.
To check for power, turn the circuit breaker marked ""water
heater"" off (or remove fuses). Remove the water heater's upper
access panel. Carefully remove the insulation and plastic cover.
Identify the power supply wires. Usually, these connect to the top
two screws of the upper thermostat. Turn the circuit breaker back
on and check for voltage on the top two screws of the upper
The label on the water heater indicates what voltage the water
heater requires. Most residential units are 220/240 volts (but some
are 110/120 volts). Verify your water heater is getting the correct
voltage. If it is not getting the required voltage, there are
probably issues with your home's electrical system. A qualified
electrician may be needed to fix your electrical problem. Turn the
circuit breaker off, replace the plastic cover, insulation and
Testing Thermostat for Power with Voltmeter
If the unit is powered with the correct voltage, and still does
not produce any hot water, the upper heating element has probably
burned out. A water heater must be completely full of water before
electric power is applied or the upper heating element will burn
out (this is called Dry Fire). The Installation Instructions
require that a hot water faucet be opened and the hot water allowed
to run full for at least three minutes before turning the power on.
This is to make sure all of the air has been removed from the tank,
and the tank is completely full of water. If the upper element has
burned out, it can be replaced. Replacement heating elements are
inexpensive and widely available. After the heating element has
been replaced, make sure the tank is completely full of water
before turning the power back on."	<urn:uuid:9ae613e6-701d-4820-a50b-56cc8a7f9979>	0.0
mud kitchen outdoor learning setup requirements	"The table can be your kitchen and water table so that your picnic table is free for meals and card games.
- Hammock—I like those little packable hammocks. String it up and take a nap. If you’re extra adventurous, sleep in your hammock overnight (just be sure to make a plan on how to stay warm)!
- Fishing gear and mud bug traps—Toss in your mud bug traps as soon as you’re setup at camp and go fishing at dawn and dusk. Check your mud bug traps and have a crawfish feast for dinner!
- Easy-up—These are great if you are camping in a very sunny campsite or in the rain or snow. Bring one for your camp kitchen and one for your picnic table.
- Mobile propane heater—There are some really slick heaters on the market. If you are camping in the snow, or in a colder environment, bring a mobile heater. Be prepared though, those things chug propane super fast.
- Totes—I like to have all my gear organized and compartmentalized into totes. One tote for the kitchen, one tote for the tent, and one tote for the food. Staying organized will help things go smoothly.
- Collapsible sink/bowl—Bring two of these for your camp kitchen. They are designed to hold a lot of warm water and are perfect for cleaning dishes.
- Camp Shower – If you like to stay extra fresh and clean, here are some great camp shower ideas to include in your camping packing list.
- Games and toys—You are bound to have some downtime while camping. Bring some card games or other fun activities. For ideas, check out my things to do while camping list.
As you put your family camping packing list together, go over this list and consider your personal needs. There are some things that can be used as a substitute, so don’t panic if you feel like you need to go on a shopping spree to go camping.
Have fun with it. The more you camp, the more you’ll learn what you really need and what you can’t live without. For your first time, its a good idea to over pack a little.

What makes reinforced PTFE a better choice than molecularly enhanced PTFE (TFM) for valve seats in temperature-varying systems?	"However, with extreme amounts of stretching in either direction, the pore size of such membranes eventually increases as the mass of PTFE nodes is depleted. At this point the bulk material behaves more plastically and further stretching simply elongates the fibrils and increases the distance between nodes until macroscopic holes are produced.
PTFE dispersion grade resin is approximately 95% crystalline, and has a very high melt viscosity. When heated to temperatures above 327° C., the PTFE crystallites deform into an amorphous polymer. When cooled below 327° C., some of the liquid structure remains; thereby increasing the amorphous content of melted PTFE in comparison to virgin PTFE. Such heating and subsequent cooling of the polymer is called sintering. The sintering of shaped microporous PTFE structures produces a thermosetting effect upon the polymer, thus enabling shape retention and thermal stability. Microporous PTFE membranes are typically sintered by creating a high temperature zone in the final stages of the tenter frame apparatus.
In the prior art process of producing PTFE extrudate, difficulties arise in attempts to produce uniform extrudate having satisfactory molecular orientation to facilitate adequate transverse stretching. The molecular orientation of the extrudate ribbon is highly influenced by the Theological properties of the polymer formulation, the pressure applied to the system, and the design of the die. Various grades of PTFE resin provide distinct Theological conditions during extrusion due to different physical and molecular characteristics, therefore different grades of resin produce different degrees of molecular orientation even under the same extrusion conditions. PTFE extrusion systems are complex and difficult to control. Examples of these difficulties are found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,187,390.
In U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,125, there is disclosed a process of producing fibrillated IPNs of PTFE and polyorganosiloxanes. The IPNs are formed by either a sequential method or a simultaneous method. The simultaneous method involves the pre-blending of polysiloxane compositions with the organic lubricant used for extrusion. The siloxane/lubricant blend is then dispersed into the particulate PTFE resin, which is then extruded under similar conditions as those of the prior art."	<urn:uuid:a5a624ea-0508-4dfe-b5aa-7ee8e8df9c4d>	0.0

I've heard people talk about the difference between APIs and web services - could you explain how these two things are different from each other?	"Plus, when we're finally reunited, things get steamy. More importantly, though, this little game allows us to keep our own sense of independence, which is crucial for us to staying happy with ourselves.
5. Don't Answer To Anyone But Each Other
A therapist I once worked with told me that worrying a lot about what other people think can be very destructive to a relationship. She suggested my boyfriend and I forget about what the people around us want for us, and instead jot down what we want from each other and from our lives.
Now, when we feel pressure from the outside to get married or have kids or a certain type of job, we come back to these promises and remind each other that we're the only ones we have to answer to at the end of the day.
6. Cool Down Before You Sit Down For A Serious Talk
Nine times out of ten, when something nearly unforgivable is said, it's done out of hot and heavy anger. To avoid spouting the worst possible things at one another, someone once told me to walk away when I'm mad and only come back after I've calmed down. When put into practice, it works wonders. Getting all the strong emotions out of the way before we talk helps us move through the conversation quicker than we would if we came to the table boiling with anger.
7. Never Put Each Other Down In Public
Although there's nothing wrong with innocent teasing every now and then, it's a different beast entirely to embarrass each other when you're in social settings. You should be each other's biggest fans, not one another's enemies. Even if you're not having the best day together, my mom taught me that the worst thing you can do is treat each other like crap in public. Not only does it make everyone else feel uncomfortable as hell, it makes things way, way worse between the two of you.
8. Don't Take Things So Seriously
If there's no laughter, there's no life to the relationship. I doubt there are very many happy, longterm couples out there who don't joke around with each other often and keep things light. I've heard from multiple people that laughing is the key to any healthy romantic relationship, and science agrees. Studies have shown that couples who laugh together more often are happier and more likely to stay together for a long, long time."	<urn:uuid:89e1971e-33d9-4498-a44e-92f7770dede8>	0.0

how scientists track monitor bee movement behavior research methods	"The field of behavior change suffers from significant fragmentation and poor reporting. Here, we describe two large-scale initiatives — the Human Behavior Change Project and Science of Behavior Change program — that aim to introduce complementary systematic and rigorous methods to advance the science of behavior change.
The burden of disability-adjusted life years, prevalence of chronic health conditions and existence of other global challenges such as pollution are common, costly and often preventable . Behaviors are critical targets of intervention to improve physical and mental well-being, longevity and the environment. However, the science behind, and findings of, behavior change interventions are frequently fragmented and inconsistently reported, and interventions are often unsuccessful in initiating and/or sustaining behavior change. As a result of fragmentation and poor reporting, much research wastes opportunities to build forward momentum, limiting opportunities to harness and synthesize findings to systematically improve behavior change interventions, and the science informing them. Here, we describe two recent initiatives on behavior change — one from the United Kingdom and one from the United States — that were developed specifically, albeit independently, to tackle these problems. Although by no means the only international behavior change initiatives, we highlight them here because they both aim to advance behavior change science through an emphasis on common, systematic and rigorous methods, and they take different, but complementary, approaches in this pursuit. We believe that uniting these and other initiatives will cultivate a more cumulative science of behavior change that can inform policy, practice and scientific progress. The UK initiative Funded by the Welcome Trust and led by researchers at University College London, the universities of Aberdeen and Cambridge, and IBM Dublin, the Human Behavior Change Project (HBCP) is a collaboration of behavioral scientists, computer scientists and system architects (www.humanbehaviourchange.org). HBCP is developing a method and user interface to enable policymakers, practitioners and researchers to answer variants of the ‘big question’ in behavioral science: What behavior change interventions work, compared with what, for what behaviors, how well, for how long, for whom, in what setting and why? HBCP researchers are harnessing advances in behavioral and information science to build a behavior change intervention ontology (BCIO) and interactive knowledge system to organize the existing and accelerating evidence about behavior change interventions. The BCIO aims to establish a controlled vocabulary and connections between behavior change techniques and behavioral outcomes via underlying mechanisms of action, while taking into consideration moderation by intervention exposure (reach and engagement) and context (population and setting)."	<urn:uuid:88e61c26-60ec-46ba-be50-bd3521d4b95d>	0.0

Risk factor assessment Players completed a preseason baseline questionnaire including history of previous concussion and/or injury in the past year.
Main outcome measurements On-ice skills testing was based on the Hockey Canada Skills Test (HCST) battery which included forward agility weave, forward and backward speed skate, forward to backward transition agility, and a 6-repeat endurance test.
Results Comparing players with a history of concussion and those without, there were no differences in HCST component scores. There were also no differences in HCST scores between those reporting a previous injury within 1 year and those without. Males were faster than females on all HCST timed skill components, except for forward agility weave without the puck. Midget players were faster than Bantam players for transition agility with and without the puck, forward speed with the puck, and backward speed with and without the puck.
Conclusion There were no apparent associations between history of concussion and/or injury and sport-specific skill performance. Our results provide reference values for HCST component scores that can allow assessment of risk and provide a foundation for prevention studies.

How much did it cost to send a letter before 1840?	"This article needs additional citations for verification. (April 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
Philately (//; fi-LAT-ə-lee) is the study of postage stamps and postal history. It also refers to the collection, appreciation and research activities on stamps and other philatelic products. Philately involves more than just stamp collecting or the study of postage; it is possible to be a philatelist without owning any stamps. For instance, the stamps being studied may be very rare or reside only in museums.
The word ""philately"" is the English transliteration of the French ""philatélie"", coined by Georges Herpin in 1864. Herpin stated that stamps had been collected and studied for the previous six or seven years and a better name was required for the new hobby than timbromanie (roughly ""stamp quest""), which was disliked. The alternative terms ""timbromania"", ""timbrophily"" and ""timbrology"" gradually fell out of use as philately gained acceptance during the 1860s. He took the Greek root word φιλ(ο)- phil(o)-, meaning ""an attraction or affinity for something"", and ἀτέλεια ateleia, meaning ""exempt from duties and taxes"" to form ""philatelie"".
As a collection field, philately appeared after the introduction of the postage stamps in 1840, but did not gain large attraction until the mid-1850s. Some authors believe that the first philatelist appeared on the day of the release of the world's first postage stamp, dated to May 6, 1840, when the Liverson, Denby and Lavie London law office sent a letter to Scotland franked with ten uncut Penny Blacks, stamped with the postmark “LS.6MY6. 1840."" In 1992 at an auction in Zurich, this envelope was sold for 690 thousand francs.
Already in 1846, cases of collecting stamps in large numbers were known in England. However, without reason for collection, stamps at this time were used for pasting wallpaper. The first philatelist is considered to be a postmaster going by Mansen, who lived in Paris, and in 1855 had sold his collection, which contained almost all the postage stamps issued by that time."	<urn:uuid:291b9906-b7b8-411b-a0cf-a1c49090b788>	0.0

What tools are used in Yoruba divination and what does Ogun use iron for?	"All these were put together, dissected and processed by our hard working rapporteurs headed by a respected Professor from Harvard who used the combinations of computers, words processor and other forms of modern communication gadgets to give us and acceptable resolution, declaration and communique which was dutifully placed before the general Assembly of Yoruba people by me in form of a motion and seconded by Chief Kehinde Sofola SAN and adopted by the General Assembly without any dissent.
Of course, the outsiders who still don’t understand the strength of unity of the Yoruba world wide tried unsuccessfully to play the religious card to cause division a day before the summit.
They posted on the internet that the gathering was that of Christians. We laughed them off when our attention was drawn to the publication.
Firstly, Chief Sofola SAN the leader of Yoruba council of Elders is a Moslem, and he is a prime mover of the summit. Governors Aregbesola, Ajimobi and Amosu , strong supporters of restructuring are devout Muslims, Alhaji Wale Osun the leader of Afenifere Renewal Group ARG another mover of the summit is a Muslim leader from Ogun State and so also is one of our resource persons at the summit, Alhaji Taofeeq Akinwale ,a highly cerebral Muslim cleric and SA to the Governor of Oyo on Muslim Pilgrimage.
They also tried playing the political card by saying that it was going to be the gathering of PDP but we quickly reminded the proponents of the satanic view that most members of ARG are APC members, The VP who was represented is APC, five of the six South West Governors are APC, most of the members of the State and National Assemblies going to be present are APC, most of the Professionals, Clergies, Academics and students’ bodies going to be present are a political.
I had gone this far to show the likes of Pa Yakasai that the train of Restructuring is taking off in the Southwest with all the gatekeepers and crtical stakeholders in Yorubaland on board. Any one left out in Yoruba land will have himself/herself to blame.
I know the Yakasai of this world are still wondering why and how such huge and unprecedented crowd could have gathered in Yoruba land for the purpose of taking a common stand by a supposedly divided ethnic nationality."	<urn:uuid:c1954761-9e0e-4c5f-b772-13ed58cd96af>	0.0
As an event organizer working with accessibility initiatives, I'm curious about the features and design considerations of RAC Arena's new Quiet Room for people with sensory sensitivities. Can you describe its purpose and amenities?	"Located on a triangular site wedged between the existing church steeple and the education building, the building form that rises from three-stories below grade is carefully chiseled to fit within its urban context. The architecture of the new building is contextually contemporary with finely detailed brick façade punched with glazed openings, cast stone and steel, and comfortably fits in with the existing church steeple, the education building and other nearby development. The building steps back on the upper floors to create a gradual transition between the single-family residential neighborhood on the north and the commercial development abutting other sides of the property. The interior of the building is filled with natural light, which is achieved by strategically sized and placed windows. The attractive elements of the building’s design and the streetscape improvements complement and enhance nearby revitalization and redevelopment initiatives.
It is extremely rare that sustainability and affordability go together. At vPoint, sustainability was an integral part of the project design process. Located at the heart of Arlington—a transit oriented development (TOD), yards away from the metro station, bus lines and various other amenities, the project is imbued with green amenities like hi-performance mechanical systems, high-performance windows, energy efficient/water saving appliances, energy efficient lighting, reflective roof, electric car charging stations and green power. These are just a few examples of how this development pushes the green envelope. The most sustainable quality is the diversity of use on site from church to day care, office to education, along with affordable and market rate units.
In addition to the green features mentioned above, vPoint is abound with amenities like designer kitchens, stainless steel appliances, in-unit washing machines, high-end fixtures, wood flooring, a resident’s lounge and business center, an outdoor space that includes grill and lounge seating, and a conference room that can transform into a mini-event space. The existing onsite amenities like the church and day care center adds to the appeal.
The project recently earned the LEED Gold Certification. It also won the Urban Land Institute Smart Growth Award, and the 2012 Washington Building Congress Craftsmanship award.
With minimal amenities and less than inspiring design of their buildings, affordable housing has never been fully integrated with their neighbors, and this has been the status quo for decades. vPoint is clearly a game changer for affordable housing that co-exists with market rate units and other civic uses, offering features, location and amenities that used to be the exclusive domain of high-end condos."	<urn:uuid:b0ec931b-be8c-4e51-a080-6f7476cd0ee1>	0.0
How can I make sure I'm getting accurate and reliable results when measuring application launch times on my computer?	"Hiding out in my clinic is an extraordinary health screening tool. I just got it back from being totally upgraded.
Computer regulation thermography (CRT) is a tool used to get a functional picture of all the organ systems in the body. Testing is performed by measuring many different points on the skin which correspond to specific internal organs and tissues through viscerocutaneous reflexes. Thermography has been used in Europe for more that 20 years, and has recently been computerized to make interpretation easier and more accurate.
How does CRT work?
The autonomic nervous system, which controls automatic body functions, determines circulation to internal organs as well as the skin. It does this by altering the amount of dilation and constriction in blood vessels. Environmental temperature impacts the autonomic nervous system and, therefore, affects blood flow. By measuring the temperature of many different points on the skin before and after a cold stimulus, we can monitor changes in circulation. The actual temperature, as well as how it changes in response to the cold stimulus, provides information about the function of organs and tissues that correspond to the points being measured.
What will the thermography test be like?
After adapting to room temperature, the first set of measurements is taken. A ten-minute cooling phase follows before measuring the points a second time. After the results are interpreted, they will be explained during a follow-up appointment. Treatment will be based on the test's results, the patient's specific situation, and the doctor's assessment.
Why is CRT important for you?
Regulation thermography is effective in the early detection of many physical imbalances and diseases. Often times symptoms are affected by areas of the body that may not at first seem directly related. Thermography can help determine what additional lab work; if any; may be needed to determine the source of ill health; and can help avoid many unnecessary, expensive lab tests.
What can be determined by CRT?
CRT can discover possible sources of chronic disease and infections. Breast, ovarian, and prostate health can also be assessed. Possible cardiovascular, stomach, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder problems can be detected using the CRT. Unknown causes of infection and inflammation, allergic or toxic reactions to food, the presence of intestinal mycosis or dysbiosis, and possible correlations between dental health and disease can all be determined using CRT. Your overall vitality can be estimated by CRT.
How much will CRT cost?"	<urn:uuid:7a1ab9b8-db85-4654-9254-924f8b345039>	0.0
I want to visit Cairo for a few days and I'm curious about both its historical importance and what modern tourist attractions I can see during a short stay. What's the city's historical significance, and what main sights can I explore if I only have a couple of days there?	"Moscow is a whole new city in the summer, from the beginning of June onwards the temperatures rise into the low thirties. Many locals will tend to take this chance to get out of the city either vacationing or spending weekends at their dacha, which is a second or seasonal home.
A lot of theatres tend to close for the season or will go on tour although there are shows prepared for the tourist season.
The summer months are a great chance to visit the Golden Ring and other attractions surrounding Moscow. If you do go exploring in the countryside, make sure to bring insect repellent!
What should I do?
As Summer tends to be a little more tourist focused in the city it's a great chance to see the arena surrounding Moscow, such as the Golden Ring which is one of Russia's most beautiful interesting areas.
With the flowers in full bloom, it's a great time to visit Moscow's many beautiful parks and gardens such as the Hermitage Garden and Sokolniki Park.
Best Summer Excursions:
3 day Golden Ring Tour
The Golden Ring tour will show you round the historical Golden Ring, Vladimir, Suzdal, Yaroslavl, Orstov, Veliky and Sergiev Posad. It is a chance to visit and explore a variety of UNESCO heritage sights, learn about many historical Russian towns, and you can visit the largest Orthodox monastery in Russia.
You'll feel like you're in a fairy tale with its intricate stately architecture, beautiful coloured onion domes and breath-taking natural scenery.
Relaxing River Cruise on Radisson Boat

As a chemistry researcher studying both dental health and ionic compounds, I'm curious about fluoride's dual nature - how does it function in dental treatments, and what chemical properties make it dangerous in high doses?	"What cosmetic dentistry procedures will give me the best-looking smile?
At The Dental Studio in Flower Mound, Texas, Dr. Yasi Sabour is approached by her patients regularly about the smile makeover process. Individuals with imperfections of the smile or extensive tooth loss or damage may want to talk to a professional about how they can restore the smile for proper function and health. In situations like this, Dr. Sabour may consult with patients about the advantages of cosmetic dentistry and how the smile can be improved.
What is cosmetic dentistry?
Cosmetic dentistry refers to any dental treatments used to enhance the smile, and they may be used in helping patients achieve a full smile makeover. A smile makeover may be referred to as “full mouth rehabilitation” or “full smile restoration.” Regardless of the name, the goal is the same: repair the smile’s appearance, function, and overall health. This customized plan is designed to get you the best-looking smile with high-quality cosmetic and restorative dentistry treatments to help you smile again with confidence!
What cosmetic treatments might be included in a patient’s smile makeover?
Because Dr. Sabour customizes cosmetic dentistry solutions to a patient’s unique needs, no two smile makeover plans are the same. However, here are a few of the more commonly integrated procedures that can be part of one’s course of treatment:
- Professional teeth whitening. For some patients, teeth whitening is the first step and can often effectively address a dull or discolored smile. We offer professional-strength options that provide better results than kits available over the counter.
- Dental crowns. Crowns are caps made of porcelain that are fabricated for the patient to match their existing teeth. This allows the crown to be placed over a tooth to protect and seal it while blending in with the smile.
- Dental composite. Certain imperfections can be addressed quickly and easily in the office with dental composite, a unique resin material that can repair chipped, cracked, or gapped teeth (for mild imperfections with not bite issues involved).
- Porcelain veneers. Another way to cover imperfect teeth is with porcelain veneers, which are thin porcelain dental prostheses made from a strong and durable material that looks just like natural tooth enamel. These restorations are often used on the teeth near the front of the smile, referred to as the “anterior teeth.”

How did black and white minstrel shows differ in blues clubs versus traditional venues?	"You need to be able to trust and be grateful for your process, otherwise you’ll never achieve “success” or when you do, you won’t be able to actually enjoy it.
Do you have any events or exhibitions coming up? Where would one go to see more of your work? How can people support you and your artwork?
The best way to support me directly though is to buy my album and merch on my Bandcamp, or come out and see a show! I play locally often and have been touring — sometimes in venues like House of Blues and other times on the Pacific Beach boardwalk! I like to play all kinds of shows, pop up and create those intimate experiences in all sorts of spaces. All that info can be found on my website and on my social media pages.

When it comes to ensuring safe driving, how do the recommended precautions differ between elderly drivers and teenage drivers?	"You share the road with motorcyclists in Cleveland every day when you are driving in your car. If you are thinking about parking your car to ride your motorcycle to experience a bit of freedom and excitement, you may want to brush up on some safety tips first.
Motorcycles may be a cool alternative to regular automobiles, but they are not as safe. For instance, they do not offer as much protection as most motor vehicles, and the stakes are much higher in accidents. Besides the risk of falls, motorcyclists are in danger of sustaining serious and life-threatening injuries in motorcycle accidents. You should always wear proper safety gear and follow all traffic laws and courtesies. Here are a few hazards that motorcyclists encounter every day on the roads that you should keep watch for:
1. Inexperienced motorists
New drivers mean more driving errors. Because such drivers lack proper experience behind the wheel, they are likely to make crucial mistakes that make the roads more dangerous for others, especially bikers. Common errors that inexperienced motorists make that cause motorcycle accidents include failing to yield the right of way, not checking for motorcyclists when driving, changing lanes, making left-hand turns and traveling too closely behind motorcycles.
2. Distracted and drunk/intoxicated drivers
Defensive driving is a must, especially when you are on a motorcycle. Distracted and intoxicated drivers are a danger to everyone, not just bikers. People who drink, use drugs and medications that cause impairment, text and other activities that impact driving behaviors often fail to identify potential hazards. This often results in them operating their vehicles recklessly, making it harder for bikers and motorists to safely anticipate and avoid dangers and situations that lead to avoidable accidents.
3. Commercial vehicles
Bikers must pay extra attention when sharing the roads with commercial truck operators. Semis, trailers and other large trucks have blind spots that cars and SUVs do not have that make them extremely dangerous to motorcyclists. Keep in mind that if you are on your motorcycle around commercial trucks, drivers may not be able to see you.
With proper precautions and sufficient distance between your bike and other vehicles, it is possible for you to steer clear of the above dangers and remain accident- and injury-free."	<urn:uuid:f0c0907a-d619-4d6c-8a57-8128faa3a24e>	0.0
Who sang lead vocals on Big Brother's album Be A Brother?	"Bunny Wailer was a giant of reggae music who co-founded the Wailers along with Bob Marley (1945–1981) and Peter Tosh (1944–1987).
- Died: March 2, 2021 (Who else died on March 2?)
- Details of death: Died of complications of a stroke at a hospital in Kingston, Jamaica at the age of 73.
- We invite you to share condolences for Bunny Wailer in our Guest Book.
Wailer was born Neville Livingston, and he became close to Marley at a young age as they grew up together in Kingston. They began playing music with Tosh and formed the Wailers in 1963, adding other members later in the year. Playing ska music in the pre-reggae days, the Wailers had early hits including 1964’s “Simmer Down.” Wailer tended to sing harmonies to Marley’s and Tosh’s lead vocals, though he wrote and sang lead on songs including “Dreamland.” The Wailers played a central role in popularizing ska and, later, reggae to an international audience, with later hits including “Stir it Up,” “Get Up, Stand Up, and “I Shot the Sheriff.” But as their fame grew, Marley was placed more in the forefront of the group. Their management placed Wailer and Tosh in the background – and booked a U.S. tour of rock clubs that felt problematic to Wailer’s and Tosh’s Rastafarian values. The two left the Wailers in 1974.
Wailer released his solo debut, “Blackheart Man,” in 1976. Marley and Tosh both contributed backing vocals and played on the record, as Wailer sang backup on Tosh’s “Legalize It” that same year. As his solo career developed, Wailer branched out into other styles including dancehall and disco over the course of more than two dozen albums. He won three Grammy Awards for Best Reggae Album in the 1990s, and he was honored with Jamaica’s Order of Jamaica in 2012 and Order of Merit in 2017.

electrolyte balance exercise impact diabetic nondiabetic	"17.0 ± 1.8 g/4.5 h, P < 0.002) and a comparatively minor increase in the release of the ingested glucose into the systemic circulation (60.2 ± 1.4 vs. 53.0 ± 2.2 g, P < 0.02; Table 1, Fig. 2). Assuming complete absorption of the ingested glucose during the 4.5-h postprandial period (47), net initial splanchnic glucose sequestration was reduced in diabetic subjects (14.8 ± 1.4 g or 19.7 ± 1.8% of ingested load vs. 22.0 ± 2.2 g or 29.3 ± 2.9% of ingested load, P < 0.02; Table 1).
Renal and hepatic glucose release.
Before glucose ingestion, diabetic subjects had greater renal (4.69 ± 0.69 vs. 1.12 ± 0.25 μmol·kg−1·min−1, P < 0.01) and hepatic glucose release (11.5 ± 0.9 vs. 8.34 ± 0.34 μmol·kg−1·min−1, both P < 0.01; Fig. 3), consistent with a previous report (42).
After glucose ingestion, patterns of renal and hepatic glucose release were similar in both groups; renal glucose release increased to peaks at 30–90 min and remained above baseline for 2–3 h, whereas hepatic glucose release decreased immediately and remained suppressed during the entire postprandial period. However, in diabetic subjects, mean rates of renal glucose release were approximately twice as great as in nondiabetic subjects (4.68 ± 0.74 vs. 2.34 ± 0.54 μmol·kg−1·min−1, P < 0.03), and mean rates of hepatic glucose release were approximately three times as great as in nondiabetic subjects (4.58 ± 0.82 vs. 1.45 ± 0.53 μmol·kg−1·min−1, P < 0.01)."	<urn:uuid:23e36f83-2c11-49e5-8416-2dd16f9292aa>	0.0

What papers should I keep in a waterproof box?	"How to get my cat from peeing on the couch?
Lucy keeps peeing on the couch! I'm going crazy. Yes she uses her litter box daily and I am constantly cleaning it out every day. Both my cats have their own litter box. About one ever week or two, Lucy pees on the couch. I should take stock out in Nature's Miracle! This all started two years ago. First We got rid of our futon, then last year we moved in with my fiance, Lucy peed on our microfiber couch. We delt with it, professional cleaners, plastic, etc. We moved again last October and Over Christmas, My husband bought me a beautiful new leather sofa. Guess what... a week later, Lucy peed on it! I can't win! Three houses, three sofas, each in a different location. Leather is easier to clean, but this is ridiculas! I tried the no stay boundary spray, positive and negative reinforcement. She didn't have a UTI, I took her to the VET several times over the last year Nothing seems to work. Please help. I really don't want to get rid of her, but she is ruining our furniture
- Cast your vote for which answer you think is best!
It seems like Lucy doesn't like change, especially in environments. However, she shouldn't be urinating on the couch if you are keeping her litterbox as clean as you say. What about the cat litter you are using? Cats do not like scented cat litter. Does the litter need to be changed more frequently and not just scooped? Try adding a third litterbox. You should have one more litterbox than cats - in your case - you need three litterboxes. Keep them scrupulously clean! Scrub those soiled areas with Nature's Miracle and let it thoroughly dry. Lucy shouldn't want to go on that same spot. If it were my new couch, I would take it one step further and keep a blanket or sheet on the couch with a waterproof protector underneath (like you would use for a child who pees the bed). I always keep a sheet on my couch just to keep it clean from my cats, but they never pee on it. I hope this helps some."	<urn:uuid:4316fee6-f80d-42d7-bf39-b02c8741a34a>	0.0
I'm an x-ray technician trying to understand different injuries. Which scan is better for finding broken bones: regular x-rays of ankle fractures or x-rays of hamate hook fractures?	"Bone cancer X-rays
What does bone cancer look like on an X-ray?
Reading X-rays is a specialist job. Most of us can't make much out of them, unless it is something really obvious like a complete break in a bone.
Bone cancer may show up as a thinning of the bone, so the affected area may look paler and less dense on the X-ray. Cancer can lead to a break in a bone, called a pathological fracture. A pathological fracture happens in abnormal bone because it is weak. It can happen after a minor knock or when doing routine activities. Pathological fractures can show up quite clearly in X-rays, like any other break.
Most cancer cells in bones have spread there from another part of the body. These are called bone metastases, or secondary bone cancers. Primary bone cancer can look quite different and may show as an expansion on the side of the bone where the tumour has grown out from the bone itself. This may look like a shadowy area extending out from the affected bone. The tumour can lay down calcium deposits in this outgrowth and these may show up on X-ray as clearly defined white patches. Your doctor may call this sclerotic changes or sclerosis. Sclerosis means hardening. Secondary prostate cancer in the bones commonly has a dense, sclerotic appearance.
Sometimes the bone has a lacy appearance. The cancer causes holes to develop in the bone, making it look like lace or net. Your doctor may describe these changes as lysis or lytic changes. Lytic means cells that hat been broken down.
The type of primary bone cancer called osteosarcoma often looks dense (sclerotic) on X-ray. Or it may be a mixture of thickened areas and holes. Doctors call these areas sclerotic and lytic. You may see these terms used on the X-ray report.

compare lever classes pulley systems trans neptunian objects gravitational effects	"T Sumner, P Wass, D Hollington
eLISA is a mission under development as the European Space Agency’s third Large class mission in its Cosmic Vision programme. The goal is to explore the science theme ‘The Gravitational Universe’ by studying gravitational waves emitted by compact objects in the near and distant universe. Gravitational wave observations offer a new and unique means of studying our Universe and probing the intricate details of General Relativity. As well as enlarging our understanding of physics and astronomy, they offer an unprecedented opportunity to discover completely new physics unprobed by electromagnetic observatories.
The evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (eLISA) is a satellite mission which will observe gravitational waves in the frequency range between 0.1mHz and 0.1Hz from a wide variety astrophysical sources. This will allow precision tests of General Relativity and a new means of doing astrophysics and cosmology.
More details about the project
eLISA will enable tests of General Relativity to unprecedented precision. In particular it will provide:
- A guaranteed direct detection of gravitational waves unless they propagate in a way not described by General Relativity. Stellar binary systems exist in the Milky Way which are guaranteed ‘calibration’ sources for the eLISA observatory.
- Test of propagation of gravitational waves at the speed of light
- Measurement of polarisation states of gravitational waves
- Mapping of the space-time metric around super massive black-holes by the tracing the gravitational signal generated by the inspiral of stellar mass compact objects.
- Detailed tests of numerical relativity predictions
eLISA will open up a new window on the universe for astrophysical observation:
- Population study of thousands of compact white-dwarf binary systems in the Milky Way. This will provide information about the evolution, life cycle and distribution of these systems which eventually give rise to Type Ia supernovae.
- Mergers of massive black-holes at the centres of galaxies will be observed from throughout the lifetime of the universe allowing a study of the progenitors of massive black holes, the galaxy merger history of the universe, as well as the energy loss processes associated with the merger coalescence and ringdown of SMBHs.
eLISA provides an opportunity to probe a stochastic background of gravitational waves originating in TeV scale processes in the very early universe."	<urn:uuid:7c2077b2-2fa9-4650-8f32-b78524428e7c>	0.0
What do recent studies say about how wearing a helmet affects reaction time and risk-taking behavior while skiing?	"Air pollution: How it affects your eyes? Helpful tips to protect your vision!
Studies have also linked high air pollution levels to increased occurrences of dry eye syndrome.
Zee Media Bureau
New Delhi: Air pollution, which is a mixture of natural and man-made substances in the air we breathe, can affect humans, plants and animals. Air pollution has been linked to a wide array of health effects. Among them are heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, both chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma.
The national capital, Delhi, has been witnessing high levels of air pollution for around two weeks after Diwali celebrations, putting its residents at high health risks, especially the elderly, children and people with respiratory illnesses.
But did you also know how air pollution impacts your eyes and vision? Polluted air can increase your risk of eye problems, ranging from simple irritation and burning to severe allergy, cataract and even cancer. The most common ones being redness, itching and burning sensation, watering eye, difficulty in vision, discharge, allergic reaction, including severe itching, eyelid swelling and risk of conjunctivitis.
Studies have also linked high air pollution levels to increased occurrences of dry eye syndrome. Dry eye syndrome is a chronic condition in which your eyes can’t produce the right amount of tears to stay wet. This lack of moisture makes your eyes feel gritty, scratchy, or itchy, or produces a burning sensation.
While you can’t always prevent dry eye syndrome as acquiring of this condition increases with age, there are many steps you can take to minimise your risk of infections. These include:
- Wearing sunglasses or goggles while outdoors.
- Avoiding vigorous eye rubbing in case of irritation.
- Taking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated - if you don’t have enough water in your body, you won't be able to produce the amount of tears you need for pain-free eyes.
- Using lubricating eye drops given by eye specialists.
- Not wearing contact lens and eye makeup if eyes are feeling sore.
- Not smoking since cigarette smoke quickly dries out your eyes and cause constant eye irritation.
- Installing a high-quality air filter at home to keep outdoor air pollutants out of your nest.
Besides following the above guidelines, you can reduce your risk of eye infections by minimising your exposure to outdoor air pollutants and staying indoors as much as possible."	<urn:uuid:77f9c49d-a04e-422c-b02f-3026484e703b>	0.0
What precautions should I take with water and dairy products when traveling to make sure I don't get sick, and how can these items make me ill?	"Hunters can't just load all of their hunting gear on your boat and go on their way. Firearms are dangerous enough just as they are. But toss them into boats (that comes with their own unique dangers) and you could be cooking up a recipe for disaster. So to minimize the risks in favor of boat safety, you need to make sure you're transporting your firearms the right way.
To maintain safety, see to it that you follow these safety precautions if you're boat hunting with one other person:
Exiting the hunting boat follows the same steps, with one owner exiting first and taking his firearm, and then the second exiting next and taking his firearm. Following these steps should help keep every hunter safe when hunting from a boat.
Tips for Hunting with More Than One Person
What safety precaution should you take when hunting from a boat with another person? It's enough work to figure out how to keep your boat safe when hunting alone, but what precautions should you take when hunting from a boat with a partner? Here are some tips.
Tips to Avoid Capsizing and to Keep Your Boat Stable
One of the problems with boat hunting is that the strength of your gun's recoil and the exaggerated movement of the water surface make for a highly unstable situation. So to avoid capsizing when you take a shot, consider these safety precautions from expert hunters:
What to Pack When Hunting From a Boat
It's easy to overload your boat with gear and other items when you're not used to packing light. Everything might seem like an essential when you're on dry land. But it's important that you keep your hunting boat as light weight as possible to prevent accidents.
There are two types of safety equipment you need to make sure you have on any boating trip- that which is required by laws of your state and that which is optional but may save you when things go wrong. Let's look at both and what hunters pack in more detail.
Required Safety Equipment
These are items that state or federal boating regulations require each boater to have onboard. Failure to do so may result in a fine if your boat is inspected by authorities. Of course, they are also items you may need in an emergency. Below is a list of the most commonly required items, although it may change slightly depending on where you are boating.
Optional Safety Equipment & Hunting Gear
These items may not be required by law, but they can be vital in an emergency."	<urn:uuid:312b06e2-e69c-4829-9de7-980c99889471>	0.0
I keep seeing news about 'the Cabinet' in different countries. What exactly does this term mean when talking about governments around the world?	"We also have teams here focused on the local market. We are seeing acceleration in the local market in terms of kinds of projects and the sophistication of those projects. India, by history, would be characterized as a very big, small business market but I think it is transitioning to becoming a large, business market.
In your emphasis on the local market, you were ahead of Indian IT firms.
We are a 100-year-old company. We see these patterns. All things tend to rise in the world but not at the same pace. There is a phenomenon around technology and its use. It's the enabler of modern society. Countries which make a commitment to become a modern society, a 21st century infrastructure /business, they are inherently going to make a big commitment to technology. IT tends to grow until it reaches a certain percentage of GDP, then it begins to slow. IT in India has easily grown two-times the GDP.
In the near term, what will be the focus areas for IBM in India?
We are seeing a shift in India towards more end-toend solutions. We see it in governments and in business. We see them taking on bigger, longer-term, transformational initiatives. There's new commitment to infrastructure. Businesses want to move to best practices, tighter integration, more comprehensive delivery of services with increasing focus on customer loyalty programme.
As the Indian middle class grows in size and the amount of disposable incomes rise, businesses of all kinds will be focused on how they service the growing populace of people who have money to spend. Discretionary funds affect banking, retail. These will be huge opportunities in these sectors.
IBM works closely with private Indian companies. Is the Indian government a big target for you?
Yes. Indian governments—both state and federal. States spend more money than the federal one. The government is our largest industry. Government tends to be many different entities around the world. We sell lots of technology to lots of government. Governments have been big clients of IBM's.
Will you give us Indiaspecific numbers, especially about your employee count?
We are working our way through to the first 1,00,000. India is our second largest country from a population perspective. I would anticipate we will get bigger but not at the rate at which we grew over the past five years. In the product areas we play in, we are typically No."	<urn:uuid:9ff5159d-694e-4e04-948b-c165b93ca960>	0.0
I've been reading about the relationship between attention and driving safety - what have studies discovered about where drivers focus their gaze when navigating curves on the road?	"Fleet managers have a lot on their plate when it comes to their fleet operations. This includes daily logistical planning, route planning and driver monitoring tasks. However, fleet managers must also ensure that fleet safety remains their highest priority. Luckily, evidence suggests that an effective fleet telematics policy holds the key to improving fleet safety.
A leading study published in September of 2020 notes and highlights the relationship between fleet telematics and fleet safety. It also addresses key risk indicators for drivers while out on the road as well as how organisations can use fleet telematics to reduce these.
This post condenses and summarises the key factors from the study that fleet managers should know.
Learn why a modern fleet telematics policy should be a priority.
The Most Important Fleet Driving Safety Indicators
The study concluded that driving behaviours themselves are a leading driving safety factor. In particular, the following driving behaviours were highlighted as being the biggest safety indicators:
- Vehicle speed (compared to the respective road speed limit)
- G-Force factors, namely harsh-braking and vehicle swerving from driving too fast
- Hard acceleration and aggressive cornering
Fundamentally, the study notes that identifying and analysing these safety indicators are key to improving driver safety. These should be at the forefront of the fleet manager’s safety strategy.
The study also points out that fleet managers should focus on a small number of safety indicators when it comes to communicating with and evaluating drivers.
This is because a high number of safety indicators can provide too much data to work with and prove confusing. It is also because these above-mentioned indicators were by far the biggest safety factors themselves.
Furthermore, the study also notes that implementing an effective fleet telematics policy is a great way to address such safety indicators.
Learn More: Reduce Fleet Driving Risk Factors
Organisations/Fleet Managers Should Assist Drivers
Fleet managers are also responsible for assisting their drivers in promoting safe driving habits. The study notes that inefficient driving on behalf of fleet drivers is unlikely to change by itself. Therefore, a fleet manager’s proactive feedback- and data-based approach is key in affecting driver safety indicators.
Implementing fleet telematics that specifically focuses on driver behaviour is an efficient way to assist drivers. A good fleet telematics policy promotes safe driver behaviour through data to highlight room for improvement as well as driver behaviour progression."	<urn:uuid:f12bf1f2-fda6-4f51-827b-0e84ea1e8a57>	0.0
how to file insurance claim after natural disaster first steps process	"In many cases, you may be able to sue your insurance company for diminished value as a result of a car accident. In a situation where the other driver was the one at fault for the crash and their insurance company is willing to pay for the repairs on your vehicle, they might also be required to cover any diminished value that occurs as a result of the repairs. Diminished value is the amount of money that your car is worth after it has been repaired, which may be less than its pre-accident value. You’ll need to check the law for the state you live in, but you can file a claim with your insurance company for this money. If you need a free consultation to better understand diminished value, we suggest that you contact our auto accident lawyer on Long Island at Winkler Kurtz, LLP. For more information on this topic, please continue reading this article.
It’s important to note that not all states allow diminished value claims, so be sure to check with your local laws before filing a claim. Additionally, you may need to provide evidence that the repairs caused the diminished value of your vehicle. This could include receipts for the repairs, photographs of the damage, and any other proof that may be required by your state’s laws.
To file a successful claim for diminished value after a car accident, there are a few steps that you should take. The first is to obtain an estimate of the diminished value of your vehicle from an auto appraiser or another qualified professional. This will help you determine how much money you are entitled to receive in compensation for the diminished value of your car.
The next step is to contact your insurance company and let them know that you would like to file a claim for diminished value. Be sure to provide all the necessary documentation, such as receipts for repairs or photographs of the damage, to help make your case. Keep in mind that it can take some time for insurance companies to process claims, so be patient throughout the process.
Finally, if your insurance company refuses to pay for the diminished value of your car, you may be able to take them to court. An experienced auto accident lawyer on Long Island from Winkler Kurtz, LLP can help you prepare for a legal battle and ensure that you receive fair compensation for the damage done to your vehicle. Contact us today for more information about filing a diminished value claim."	<urn:uuid:84bfb383-5246-4fce-a57f-733c30ca33ba>	0.0

What makes Mozart’s Requiem unique?
Mozart’s Requiem is a choral masterpiece whose genesis is shrouded in mystery – one that makes the piece all the more fascinating and emotionally stirring. He was only able to complete the Requiem and Kyrie movements, and managed to sketch the voice parts and bass lines for the Dies irae through to the Hostias.
Who really wrote Mozart’s Requiem?
Requiem in D Minor, K 626, requiem mass by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, left incomplete at his death on December 5, 1791. Until the late 20th century the work was most often heard as it had been completed by Mozart’s student Franz Xaver Süssmayr.
What is the theme of Requiem by Mozart?
Mozart Requiem – Analysis. A Requiem is a Roman Catholic mass for the dead: while it includes movements that are part of the daily mass (Kyrie, Sanctus and Agnus Dei), there are several other movements with texts of mourning and remembrance.
Who killed Mozart?
But today Antonio Salieri is best remembered for something he probably didn’t do. He’s remembered for poisoning Mozart.

I've heard about famous naval battles and I want to know - which ship had more successful battles: George Dewey's USS Olympia or HMS Victory?	"Leaving the Old North Church follow Hull Street toward Charlestown. About a block from the church you will be at Copp’s Hill Burying Ground.
Copp’s Hill Burying Ground
Founded in 1659, it was the largest cemetery in the Colonies at that time. Copp’s Hill is the final resting place for two puritan ministers that were involved with the Salem Witch trials. Also buried here is Robert Newman, the Sexton of the Old North Church, who is believed to have been the one that hung the lanterns for Paul Revere in the church’s steeple. Edmund Hartt the builder of the USS Constitution also lays at rest here. In Copp’s Hill Burying Ground it is believed that close to 1,000 free African-Americans are buried there, one of which is Prince Hall who formed the countries first Black Masons Lodge and was instrumental in ending slavery in the Bay State. During the battle of Bunker Hill, because of its height, Copp’s Hill was used by the Red Coats to train their cannon on Charlestown.
Continue on Hull Street to Commercial Street, turn left and head over to and across the Charlestown Bridge. Once you are across turn right along Constitution Road toward the tail ship docked at the Boston Navel Shipyard- The USS Constitution, “Old Ironsides.”
The USS Constitution is the oldest commissioned ship in the US Navy. She was launched in 1798, and was made famous while helping to defend our nation in the war of 1812. It was during the naval battle with the HMS Guerriere that a British sailor, seeing their cannonballs bouncing off her sides, gave her the famous nickname “Old Ironsides”. Her unique construction of a three-layer wood sandwich of american hardwoods gave Old Ironsides her strength. The copper fastenings for the ship where made by Paul Revere. When she was in service the USS Constitution had a crew of 500; Today the she is manned by a crew of about 70.
After you leave the USS Constitution your next stop will be the Bunker Hill Monument. It’s not hard finding this site because of its 221 foot granite obelisk that towers over Charlestown. We crossed over Chelsea Street, under the Tobin Memorial Bridge and climbed up Tremont street to the monument."	<urn:uuid:a949b681-9775-41d6-81e9-b7527fb538c8>	0.0
largest fire arizona history where how many acres burned	"The California wildfires for the 2018 season have been dubbed the most destructive in the history of California. A total of 7,579 fires have burned 1,667,855 acres of land, a new record according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the National Interagency Fire Center. Fiscally, these fires have caused $2.975 billion in damages.
Some of the most destructive fires ever recorded have happened this season, like the Mendocino Complex Fire, burning more than 459,000 acres to become the largest complex fire in the state’s history. A complex fire is two or more individual incidents located in the same general area which are assigned to a single incident commander or unified command, according to the National Park Service’s Fire Terminology glossary.
Camp Fire in Northern California, which started on November 8th, has claimed 83 lives, making it the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California’s history. 536 people are still missing; this number is down from past weeks. The fire decimated whole towns, like Paradise, California. The fire destroyed homes, buildings, cars, parks, basically everything in sight; 18,000 structures were burned to the ground. As of November 21st, the fire was 80% contained.
The Woolsey Fire in Southern California also started on November 8th and was highly publicized due to the region it engulfed. The fire destroyed buildings, houses (including those of celebrities), and highways in the Los Angeles area; 1,500 structures destroyed and 341 damaged. This fire is 98% contained as of November 20th. In both fire cases, the Camp Fire and the Woolsey Fire, mandatory evacuations took place.
How do these fires start? Why are they so bad?
Wildfires can start in a number of ways, as long as there’s a spark. From there, the fire needs oxygen, heat, and fuel to expand. Because California has the oxygen in the form of wind, heat in the form of summer weather, and fuel in the form of trees and other plants, the fires explode in size and spread rapidly.
Scientists have said that increased amounts of natural fuel (dead trees, grasses) and atmospheric conditions (global warming) have contributed to California’s fire susceptibility. Global warming has led to higher temperatures and less rain, which means there’s more dryness in the environment."	<urn:uuid:c514c48c-f85a-4ca9-84f1-7d9274a13e7c>	0.0

carciofi alla giudea history jewish ghetto rome	"Poets and painters, sociologists and rabbis, businessmen and doctors, Zionists and Bundists, and even the young leaders of what would be the first armed uprising anywhere in Nazi-occupied Europe—they were, by Ringelblum’s design, a cross-section of the rich diversity of Polish Jewish life before the war. For three years, the group met secretly each Saturday, hence the name, Oyneg Shabes which means “the joys of Shabbat.”
Ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto, 1943.
For the Oyneg Shabes no subject was taboo. No detail too small. Under Ringelblum’s meticulous direction, members of the secret society tried to create a portrait of all aspects of Jewish life in the Ghetto. They wrote essays about corrupt Jewish police and collaborators, about young smugglers, underground schools, religious affairs, the secret economy, and prostitution. They collected poetry, Ghetto humor, songs and folklore. The Archive recorded statistics on deportations and deaths. They collected issues of the dozens of underground newspapers circulating in the Ghetto. And, because Ringelblum had close relationships with members of the Zionist youth movements, he was also able to support and document the emergence of their plans for armed resistance.
Ringelblum encouraged everyone, not only Oyneg Shabes members, to write. He ran essay contests for children to write about their lives in the Ghetto. The Archive also collected artifacts: armbands, official Nazi pronouncements and Judenrat issued IDs. Candy wrappers, tram tickets, theater posters, announcement of concerts and lectures—the stuff of daily life was also included. Moreover, in an ongoing effort to make sense of what was happening beyond the Ghetto walls, Oyneg Shabes members debriefed eye-witness survivors of destroyed Jewish communities who managed to straggle into Warsaw.
At first Ringelblum believed he and his collaborators were collecting the raw material from which, after the war, they would write volumes of history. As the stark truth of the Nazi machine for total annihilation of the Jews emerged, it became increasingly clear that they themselves would probably not survive, but rather that they were collecting the raw data from which others would write their history after the war."	<urn:uuid:26f5eaf6-920b-4405-b034-178caf27f86b>	0.0

But what it did do was give all of us- gamers who had been playing games for a very long time now, as well as non gamers, who were usually intimidated by game controllers- a new way to play games, and to have fun while doing that.
Yeah, the series has had its share of downs (Wii Music comes to the mind), but on the whole, games like Wii Sports Resort demonstrated that even these ‘casualized’ games were made with the typical Nintendo veneer of quality, and that, most of all, they would be fun to play through- with everybody.
Online gaming may have ultimately been the driving force in the rise of multiplayer gaming, but as far as social multiplayer gaming is concerned, nothing beats a quick session of Wii Sports.
13. Fire Emblem (NES, SNES, GBA, GCN, DS, Wii)
Fire Emblem still remains a bit of an enigma. The SRPG franchise never saw a release outside of Japan for nearly twenty years, with the NES and SNES installments of the series skipping out on western releases entirely. In fact, the first taste that western audiences had of Fire Emblem wasn’t even in a Fire Emblem game- it was in Super Smash Bros."	<urn:uuid:cdd276f4-5ec2-470a-b842-a40c8e676ddc>	0.0
What research methods are scientists using to study coral survival, and what specific threats have they discovered through their investigations?	"Chapter 3. Psychological Science & Research
Psychologists study the behaviour of both humans and animals in order to understand and improve the quality of human lives.
Psychological research may be either basic or applied in orientation. Basic research and applied research inform each other, and advances in science occur more rapidly when both types of research are conducted.
The results of psychological research are reported primarily in research reports in scientific journals. These research reports have been evaluated, critiqued, and improved by other scientists through the process of peer review.
The methods used by scientists have developed over many years and provide a common framework through which information can be collected, organized, and shared.
The scientific method is the set of assumptions, rules, and procedures that scientists use to conduct research. In addition to requiring that science be empirical, the scientific method demands that the procedures used be objective, or free from personal bias.
Scientific findings are organized by theories, which are used to summarize and make new predictions, but theories are usually framed too broadly to be tested in a single experiment. Therefore, scientists normally use the research hypothesis as a basis for their research.
Good theories are falsifiable. This means that the relationships between the variables that are predicted by the theory can be shown through research to be incorrect.
Scientists use operational definitions to turn the ideas of interest — conceptual variables — into measured variables.
It is important for psychological research using humans and animals to be ethical. Our ethics codes are developed from the moral principles of weighing risks against benefits, acting responsibly and with integrity, seeking justice, and respecting people’s rights and dignity.
Researchers must follow specific ethics codes, providing rules for how to conduct studies. Some historical events that impacted our ethics codes today are the Nuremberg trials, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Belmont Report.
Decisions about whether psychological research using human and animals is ethical are made using established ethical codes developed by scientific organizations and on the basis of judgments made by the local Ethical Review Board. Informed consent, deception, and debriefing are all considered when deciding if research will be approved.
Psychological studies start with a research design that vary according to its strengths and limitations, and it is important to understand how each differs.
Descriptive research is designed to provide a snapshot of the current state of affairs. Descriptive research allows the development of questions for further study but does not assess relationships among variables. The results of descriptive research projects are analyzed using descriptive statistics."	<urn:uuid:ceda3fe0-3ee3-46fb-9513-b212a3ec051e>	0.0
how to measure tv screen size diagonal corner bezel screen difference	"LONDON South Korean electronics giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. claims to have developed the world's first 40-inch display panel made from a single sheet of organic light-emitting diode material. The OLED prototype has a wide screen format of 1,280 by 800 pixels and is driven by an active-matrix backplane of amorphous silicon transistors.
Samsung launched an OLED development initiative in 2001, and the 40-inch panel follows Samsung's development of OLED prototypes at 14.1-inch diagonal size and 21-inch diagonal size in 2004 and January 2005, respectively.
This latest prototype has a maximum screen brightness of 600 candela per meter2, a black-and-white contrast ratio is 5,000:1. The ultrathin shape of the panels will allow future TV set designers to create televisions with a total thickness of only 3 cm or less, Samsung said.

What are the implications of recent legislation on exposing cruel practices in industrial farming operations, and how does it affect transparency in the industry?	"This includes lighting, pumps, meters, boilers, heaters and low-energy, livestock-watering fountains.
- On-Farm Solar PV Program assists producers with the purchase of grid-connected solar panel systems that can be used to generate electricity and reduce emissions on farms.
- Irrigation Efficiency Program helps producers invest in new or upgraded low-pressure irrigation equipment, improving water efficiency and reducing energy use.
- Accelerating Innovation Program
- Facilitates collaboration between agricultural societies, industry organizations and producer groups to collaborate through proof-of-concept and commercialization of new products, new processes or new business practices in Alberta.
- Assists primary producers, agri-processors and other for-profit companies with the early adoption of new technologies or practices that have the potential for sector-wide impact.
Farm fuel exemption
Marked farm fuels are exempt from the carbon levy. This means that the carbon levy does not apply to dyed diesel or gasoline used in farming operations. Agriculture is the only economic sector with a levy exemption.
The farm fuel carbon levy exemption uses the same eligibility criteria as the Alberta Farm Fuel Benefit (AFFB) fuel tax exemption. The AFFB program registration number will also be used for the carbon levy exemption certificate.
Carbon levy exemptions
In addition to marked farm fuel, some other fuels are exempt from the carbon levy, including the following:
- purchases of fuel on-reserve or at other prescribed locations by eligible First Nations and individuals for personal and band use
- marked gasoline and diesel used by farmers in farming operations
- biofuels, including biomethane, biodiesel and ethanol
- inter-jurisdictional flights
- fuel sold for export
- industrial exemptions in cases where fuel is used in industrial processes but not combusted
- natural gas produced and consumed on site by conventional oil and gas producers (until Jan 1, 2023)
- the use of heating fuels on sites subject to the Specified Gas Emitters Regulations (SGER)/output-based allocation regime
For a full list of carbon levy exemptions, see pages 94-96 of the 2016-19 Fiscal Plan (3.0 MB)
Large industrial emitters
Large Industrial Emitters will continue to be subject to the SGER framework until the end of 2017, when the province will transition to an output-based allocation approach. Further details will be available after stakeholder engagement.
The new framework, which is endorsed by energy leaders, is designed to reduce the amount of carbon pollution in every barrel of oil."	<urn:uuid:2ff3d45d-fec9-4e96-bafe-4a8a0f54eb4e>	0.0
What are the main features of ars subtilior music?	"Ars Lyrica Houston
""Award-winning American mezzo-soprano Jamie Barton, whose assured and eloquent vocalism provided a strong start to Ars Lyrica Houston’s 2015 ̶16 Zilkha Hall season on Sept. 13, probably doesn’t sing much medieval or Renaissance music. Her potent voice is more suited to the opera stage or recital platform than to the choir loft. But the rest of Western classical music seems to be her oyster.
Winner of the Metropolitan Opera’s National Council Auditions in 2007, the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Competition in 2013, and the Richard Tucker Award last April, the Houston Opera Studio alumna has sung in opera houses and concert halls all over the world. Her repertoire ranges widely, from Monteverdi, Bach, and Handel through Mozart, the bel canto era, Verdi, and Wagner on up to Honegger, Menotti, Poulenc, Bernstein, Previn, Rorem, Hoiby, and Heggie. But like many mezzo-sopranos of recent times — think Cecilia Bartoli, Joyce DiDonato, and Vivica Genaux — she seems to have a special affection and affinity for Baroque composers.
Thus, she has become something of a house mezzo for Ars Lyrica Houston, which specializes in historically informed performances of music from the 17th and 18th centuries. Her work with the ensemble — founded in 1998 by harpsichordist, conductor, and University of Houston Moores School of Music professor Matthew Dirst — has focused on some rarely performed pieces. The group has used her as soloist on its recordings for Sono Luminus of Domenico Scarlatti’s comic intermezzo La Dirindina and Hasse’s Antonio e Cleopatra, the latter garnering a Best Opera Recording Grammy nomination in 2011. But Barton and the 13-member Ars Lyrica ensemble climbed a little further out of the musical weeds on Sept. 13 with a program devoted to Vivaldi, Gluck, Handel, and Haydn.
Conducting from the harpsichord, Dirst got the Baroque ball rolling with the Ouverture, Allegro, and Gigue and the opening aria “Ombra mai fu” from Handel’s Serse."	<urn:uuid:c4b34b01-1e8e-4fa5-84cc-a7b02ab3e07a>	0.0
My uncle keeps saying he doesn't have a gambling problem, but we're all worried. I've heard there are special meetings where family members can talk to him about it - what's involved in making that work?	"Letting It Outwell ,im falling in love with a good friend.... i don't know what to do. in a way, i want to let him know how i feel.. but thats always hard.
the feeling of getting rejected and never seeing him again. and i know that everything takes time but sometimes i can't stand it. I've heard the saying that if he's a real friend, then he'll understand. maybe he will maybe he won't. people are wierd. when i first came out to people, they said that i'm confused and i don't know who i am.. but i know exactly who i am and how i feel. i want to be with him forever but i don't want to lose a friendship. we talk about everything together, hang out all the time. and sometimes i feel like he knows me more than my family does even though he doesn't know that im gay.
i wish these things weren't so damn complicated.
i know he's straight and i wish he wasn't. but maybe i'm just greedy. i respect him and his feelings so thats why i don't want to let him know. i remember everyone's reaction when i told them i was gay. it always surprised them. sometimes they laughed, denied it, or didn't really care.
or they would say ""i know my brother isn't gay"", ""how do you know your gay"", and its hurtful. i don't want to go through that again. i wish they would just know.
i have really good friends who understand me. most of them know that i'm gay and it doesn't bother them anybit. and sometimes they would even joke about it. but i've also heard stories of how people get beat up and even die for the way they are. one of my best friend told me that it doesn't matter if im gay or not because its not him so it doesn't matter. i wish more people would think like that.. well i don't really know where im going with this story but i've heard this is the place to let it all out... thanks jimmdean001

benefits drawbacks peer mediated instruction discipline school settings	"The relationship between parent and peer attachment: The role of affect regulation
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between parent and peer attachment. It was hypothesized that aspects of affect regulation (Neuroticism, Emotional Sharing, and Positive Affect) would account for some portion of the relationship between parent and peer attachment. ^ Parent-child relationships are generally children's first (and formative) relationships: As such, parent-child relationships are likely to serve as models for all future social and emotional experiences. Affect-regulation has been implicated as influential in the link between parent and peer relations. Affect regulation can be characterized by the capacity to label affects, to contain emotional distress, and to respond behaviorally with adaptive emotional coping. Parent attachment style may exert an indirect effect upon peer attachment through specific coaching and nonspecific modeling of affect-regulation skills. ^ The participants in this study were 114 undergraduate psychology students from the subject pool at Fordham University. Participants demographics were as follows: 78 female, 22% male, mean age of 19 years, 77% Caucasian, 9% Hispanic, 6% Asian, 2% African-American, and 4% described themselves as “Other.” ^ Four inventories were used in this study: The Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment; the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; the Emotional Sharing subscale of the COPE; and the Neuroticism subscale of the NEO-Five-Factor Inventory. Note that all scales were administered intact, in their entirety. ^ Standard multiple regression analyses were used to test the direct effects of parent attachment on peer attachment. The indirect effects of parent attachment on peer attachment, mediated by measures of affect regulation, were examined using simultaneous-entry multiple regression strategies in accordance with Baron and Kenny's (1986) criteria for establishing a mediated relationship. Analyses indicated that aspects of affect regulation mediate the relationship between parent and peer attachment. More specifically, this study found that Neuroticism and Emotional Sharing mediated the relationship between Mother and Peer Attachment, while Neuroticism and Positive Affect mediated the relationship between Father and Peer Attachment. Study limitations, as well as various research and clinical implications are presented. Several directions for future research are suggested as well. ^

As someone studying crop quality parameters, I'm curious about the early test results for the 2021 hard red winter wheat harvest. What were the key measurements for moisture content, protein levels, and test weight?	"The U.S. winter wheat harvest is underway and early projections indicate another sizable crop is coming out of the fields. With U.S. carryover stocks for all wheat up nearly 45 percent from a year ago, prices have seen downward pressure in recent weeks. As a result, U.S. wheat is once again very competitively priced with other origins.
USDA’s latest projections place 2010/11 winter wheat production at 1.5 billion bushels, a three percent decline from 2009/10. This reduction is due mainly to what USDA expects to be a 30 percent drop in soft red winter (SRW) production compared to 2009/10. The outlook for HRW and winter white wheat is much different, however, with USDA projecting larger crops for both classes.
USDA expects increased harvested area and greater yields to offset an 11 percent decrease in HRW planted acreage. The largest production increases are expected in Texas, where the crop is expected to double, and Oklahoma, where USDA’s forecast calls for a 67 percent increase from last year’s crop. USDA currently pegs the HRW crop at 979 million bushels, which would be an increase of 40 million bushels from last year and eight percent above the five-year average. Winter white wheat production is pegged at 219 million bushels, an increase of nine percent from 2009/10. Crop conditions are also up from last year with 66 percent of the winter wheat crop rated in either good or excellent condition, compared to 44 percent a year ago.
HRW FOB values prices ran well above other origins for much 2009/10 marketing year. In fact, HRW FOB values out of the Gulf were nearly 40 percent greater than Russian wheat prices in June 2009. That situation has changed dramatically, however. In the latest Egyptian GASC tender on May 28, 2010, 11 percent protein HRW was offered at $179.50 per metric ton FOB, only one dollar more than a winning Russian bid of $178.50 per metric ton. Commercial traders indicate that HRW FOB values have fallen even further in the past week to approximately $160 per metric ton, a level not seen since September 2005.
The latest USDA commercial sales data indicate buyers are taking advantage of lower HRW prices."	<urn:uuid:e2619244-3c40-4db8-b41e-c4a702b1647e>	0.0
dust collector box design requirements proper airflow considerations	"Tracking can also be accomplished using time-clock mechanisms or, e.g., two-dimensional arrays of photosensitive devices for determining the sun's position with an attendant feedback control mechanism.
The collector area should be selected in accordance with the energy requirements for a particular utilization device and the solar intensity in the geographical region of interest, generally up to 1.9 kw/m2, as affected by the geographical climate, desired periods of use during a year, typical usage periods during a day, etc. In general, collector areas of approximately 1-3 m2 will suffice for a number of household applications. As an example of the usefulness of such readily achievable collector areas, it should be considered that a typical electrical cooking unit has a power rating of less than or about 1 kw. Accordingly, a collector of an area of about 1 m2 could supply sufficient energy to replace or supplement the conventional energy supply of such a cooking unit depending on time, location and conditions. Other conventional energy using devices have similar ratings, i.e., in the few kilowatt range, e.g., normal hot water heaters, space heaters and many other devices, some of which are discussed below. Collectors having effective areas in the mentioned range could capture sufficient solar radiation to provide the energy requirements for a wide range of such existing devices with, using this invention, minimum interruption of their existing environment.
The degree of beam concentration effected in this component of the system is also not critical. Factors of convenience, cost, commercial availability of components, etc. will be prime considerations in this regard. Generally, the concentrated beam diameters will be in the range of a few cm.
The particular design of the collector/concentrator/collimator is not critical. Systems using lenses, mirrors or combinations thereof are all suitable. Preferably, all surfaces are appropriately treated so that the transmission of this component of the system is maximized, e.g., lenses should be coated with anti-reflection coatings, reflective surfaces should have maximal reflectivities and smoothness, etc. Larger components may be of unitary construction or can be of segmented design wherein several lenses or mirrors are so situated as to act as a single large lens or mirror. Non-limiting, exemplary systems include lens systems wherein a large collecting lens is situated with respect to the focal point of a smaller collimating lens such that the outgoing concentrated and collimated beam is of the required smaller diameter than the incoming beam of parallel solar radiation."	<urn:uuid:c1cca1eb-72ee-4159-9c17-31ca3720dbc7>	0.0
What solutions exist for wildlife conflicts in energy facilities?	"Last check: )
The Shulaveri-Shomu and other Neolithic/Chalcolithic cultures of the Southern Caucasus use local obsidian for tools, raise animals such as cattle and pigs, and grow crops, including grapes.
At least in the Caucasus Mountains, these people probably herd cattle.
In the best known of these elite tombs, a person is buried under a canopy held up by poles topped by gold and silver bull figurines that appear similar in artistic conception to some standards from the burials of Alaca Höyük in Central Anatolia.
Energy priorities of the Caucasus countries, therefore, are two-fold: to diversify their energy supplies; and to cash in on transit revenues as their neighbors develop export facilities which traverse their territory.
In the Southern CaucasusArmenia remains a close ally of Russia, whereas Georgia and Azerbaijan increasingly cooperate with NATO and other international organisations, distancing themselves from Russia.
Georgia and Azerbaijan on NATO's role in the Caucasus at the meeting of the EAPC on December 15th, 2000 and references to NATO in the
In the Caucasus - and generally in the Caspian area - the objective of the U.S. until recently was primarily to maintain access to the region, particularly to its oil and gas resources, while at the same time avoiding involvement in regional conflicts or direct confrontation with other major powers.
The major threats to biodiversity in the region are illegal logging, fuel wood harvesting, and the timber trade; overgrazing; poaching and illegal wildlife trade; overfishing; infrastructure development; and pollution of rivers and wetlands.
As a result, CEPF investment in the Caucasus is focused on conserving the hotspot's globally threatened species, the majority of which are found in specific sites in five target conservation corridors: Greater Caucasus, Caspian, West Lesser Caucasus, East Lesser Caucasus, and Hyrcan.
It is possible that the Mountain Jews are descendants of Persian-Jewish soldiers who were stationed in the Caucasus by the Sasanian kings in the fifth or sixth century to protect the area from the onslaughts of the Huns and other nomadic invaders from the east.
It is thought that the Jewish Tats of the Caucasus are their direct descendants; however, this remains not very likely because the Tats speak an Iranian language."	<urn:uuid:dde3a0ad-ee53-4a22-83a1-38c5550d9342>	0.0

- Scanner duties and missions - whether it's a search and rescue (SAR) mission or an airborne photography mission or something else, the scanner's main job is to... well, scan! This is the reason the airplane is up in the air on most missions.
- Basic aircraft and navigation familiarization - this was particularly helpful to the non-pilots in the class and a good reminder for everyone.
- Survival and urgent care issues - we talked about both survival and urgent care issues related to the people we might be searching for on a SAR mission and survival gear for ourselves as air crew. Can you guess what the most important survival tool is if you find yourself in an emergency situation after a crash or other off airport landing? If you don't know, you'll just have to take the next MS Ground School and find out...
- Air to air and air to ground communications - besides talking about proper communications technique, we took at look at some of the communications equipment we might expect to find in CAP planes, which are not all the same.
|Capt Johnson Discussing Grid Searches|
- Weather and how it affects search planning and scanning effectiveness - whether it's fog, smoke, dust, rain, haze, clouds (or lack thereof), the position of the sun, etc., all of these factors impact how effective we are on any given mission. Some of these factors we can work with, others ... sometimes it's best to call it a day and come back later when the weather has changed.
- High altitude and terrain considerations - not only does high altitude affect aircrew (and survivor on the ground) safety, the presence or absence of higher altitude terrain also impacts search patterns and how best to be effective."	<urn:uuid:2a909201-19cf-4a84-9899-75fcc3f34f36>	0.0
inherited grandma antique ring make it bigger possible problems	"When my mom’s mother lived with my folks near the end of her life, and Dad turned on TV for a ballgame, there was a problem. Or I thought there was a problem the first time I visited and witnessed this phenomenon.
Grandma Brown believed a person should stand up when the national anthem was sung, even at a remote location.
She reached for her walker and slowly rose to her feet and placed her hand over her heart.
“Raymond?” she said in an expectant voice.
“Yes, Miz Brown.” Dad, a banty rooster of a man, stood and put his hand over his heart. I glanced at them and quickly stood.
We remained that way until the end of the song, and then we applauded, and then we sat back down. That’s the kind of person Grandma was.
I never conned Jim into climbing out of his recliner to stand when The Star Spangled Banner was sung before a game, but he would call me into the living room to witness it. I rarely knew who was singing, but I stood there until the roar of the crowd at the end. I felt a swell of patriotic pride and nostalgia at the same time.
My mom inherited Grandma’s little secretary desk, where I’d seen Grandma sit many times. She wrote a column, “Calla’s Corner,” for the weekly newspaper about the goings on in the small Arkansas town where she lived and where I was born. Our family made the paper when we’d visit from Missouri. “A good time was had by all” frequently ended the two-line mention.
Grandma sent birthday cards to everyone she knew. To her grandkids, she’d stick in pieces of gum, taped to a card. She’d write our names on the flat sticks of Juicy Fruit, which meant we had to share with our siblings. There was always postage due on the envelope, for she never learned that the extra weight of gum required an extra stamp.
Grandma had an eighth grade education. When she came for my college graduation, she tried on my cap and gown, since she’d never worn one. She would have been a scholar in a different time.
I inherited Grandma’s secretary. I kept it for six years like my mom kept it, a shrine to Grandma. It still held postcards from her courtship with Grandpa well over a hundred years ago."	<urn:uuid:8e0587bd-acd0-4b10-82b6-9cad1fa58e58>	0.0
what special fluid absorbs water vapor from air in drupps system	"How Geothermal Heating and Cooling Works
Outdoor temperatures fluctuate with the changing seasons but underground temperatures don’t change as dramatically, thanks to the insulating properties of the earth. The earth absorbs and stores approximately 47% of the sun’s solar energy. As a result, the temperature of the earth four to six feet below grade is fairly moderate and stable. A geothermal system, which typically consists of an indoor handling unit and a buried system of pipes, called an earth loop, and/or a pump to reinjection well, capitalizes on these constant temperatures to provide the most energy efficient heating and cooling system available.
The science behind the magic
The heat exchanger, also known as the loop system, captures the stored solar energy in the ground and delivers it back to the geothermal system in the house. There are 4 different types of loops. Your loop system is the heart of geothermal technology. Regardless of the option you select, it will deliver over 500% efficient comfort and savings for many years into the future. We will help you select the proper loop system based on a site survey and by conducting a detailed energy analysis of your home. Installing a geothermal loop system is like getting a 70% discount on energy for the life of your home.
The pipes that make up an earth loop are usually made of polyethylene and can be buried under the ground horizontally or vertically, depending on the characteristics of the site. If an aquifer is available, we might design an “open loop” system, in which a well is drilled into the underground water. Water is pumped up, run past a heat exchanger, and then the water is returned to the same aquifer, through “reinjection.”
In winter, fluid circulating through the system’s earth loop or well absorbs stored heat from the ground and carries it indoors. The indoor unit compresses the heat to a higher temperature and distributes it throughout the building, as if it were an air conditioner running in reverse.
In summer, the geothermal HVAC system pulls heat from the building and carries it through the earth loop/pump to reinjection well, where it deposits the heat into the cooler earth/aquifer.
Unlike ordinary heating and cooling systems, geothermal HVAC systems do not burn fossil fuel to generate heat; they simply transfer heat to and from the earth."	<urn:uuid:55c7ba28-3251-4379-9dd2-2370399ddd6d>	0.0

Beams, which support the floor joists over higher spans, are designed in the form of laminated joists also known as built up beams, or one piece solid insert bearing beams, trim from logs or manufactured. Electricians and plumber may often lower or drill in to the joist work to install utilities, Vinyl Laminate Flooring which is accepted, so long as they don’t remove more material than what’s required by codes. This sort of floor system is usually the least expensive to install.

Vinyl Laminate Flooring Special Offers » Truss floors are simply that. These are made of small dimensioned lumber, interconnected in a webwork routine by the use of metal or wood plates. In the case of long span truss work, bearing measures of at least 3″ are very common. Trusses course greater distances than framed floor assemblies and can be made to span the entire building, eliminating centre load bearing works with. They are moderately more costly than framed floor assemblies, but provide a remarkably strong floor with little deflection or “bounce” to it. Another advantages to this type of structural system, is that tool installations can be run between the webwork components. Never allow investments to trim or drill into the members of the truss, Vinyl Laminate Flooring for they are created specifically for the launching conditions they’ll undergo through the life of the building."	<urn:uuid:aa6acba3-4efa-47c9-b896-c0eccf5b684a>	0.0
Which is older, Levittown suburb or the Delaware Aqueduct bridge?	"This photo, taken on June 29, 1923, shows workers taking a break during the construction of Broad Street, over the top of the new subway that was being laid in the bed of the old Erie Canal aqueduct over the Genesee River.
This view is looking northwest from the corner of what became Broad, and South Avenue, next to where the Rundel library building was later constructed.
Four tracks were laid in the floor of the Erie Canal aqueduct, explain Ron Amberger, Dick Barrett, and Greg Marling in their richly illustrated book Canal Boats, Interurbans & Trolleys: The Story of the Rochester Subway.
To support the vehicular deck of Broad Street over the top of the subway, “massive concrete walls with arched openings, corresponding with the original architecture, were placed on the aqueduct’s outer walls. A third arched supporting wall was constructed along the center of the bridge,” Amberger, Barrett, and Marling explain."	<urn:uuid:ffc07ddf-604f-4390-ac6b-ab94be4a9929>	0.0
outdoor mural painting church artwork protection	"State Sen. Tom Davis was within his rights to express concerns last week about a piece of student art displayed at Robert Smalls Middle School that included the controversial quote, ""You can't have capitalism without racism.""
But he aired his criticism publicly -- on Facebook and in email to the media -- before he had all the facts, including that the painting had already been removed from display. As a state senator, his words almost certainly carry more weight with school officials and the public at large than the average person's; he should be more mindful as a result.
The quote is from a 1964 speech by Malcolm X. Robert Smalls principal Denise Smith said the painting was part of a Black History Month project in which eighth-grade advanced art students researched the civil rights movement and teamed up to create artwork based on that research.
Smith said attribution for the quote, originally missing from the exhibit, was added later and conceded it should have been there from the start. She also said students should have included more context in the display.
""In retrospect,"" Smith wrote in her email, ""because this artwork display illustrated a period of American history, the students should have included appropriate text along with their paintings that provided the proper historical context. Without that context, someone viewing the paintings might have mistakenly believed that the students or the school were endorsing a particular political or social viewpoint, which certainly was not the case.""
Her response was reasoned in a way that Davis' initial communications were not. In an email to school district administrators and Board of Education members, Davis said he received a photo of the artwork from an outraged constituent. Even as he sought an explanation, he concluded it was inappropriate for display at a public school. Before anyone from the school district could respond, Davis shared his email with the media and posted a photo of the painting on Facebook, where he called for it to be removed.
Had he waited 20 minutes for Smith's response before posting to Facebook, Davis would have learned the painting had been taken down even before he requested it. And he would have learned it was a single painting and not the ""mural"" he described.
The painting was part of a rotating, month-long exhibit of student art that also depicted Maya Angelou and the Harlem Renaissance, as Smith explained in her email to Davis.
In this context, the Malcolm X artwork, while perhaps still objectionable with the quote, seems hardly worth the uproar Davis seemed intent on creating."	<urn:uuid:851b6da3-018d-474e-b85e-41cc3d8965bf>	0.0
reframing negative thoughts psychological therapy methods low versus high income	"Patients with eating disorders have also been found to have problematic personality traits such as perfectionism, neuroticism, obsessionality, negative emotionality, harm avoidance, low self-directedness, low cooperativeness, avoidant personality disorder, high constraint, high persistence, low novelty-seeking, high impulsivity, sensation-seeking, and borderline personality disorder (Vitousek and Manke, 1994; Cassin and von Ranson, 2005). The disordered eating behavior seems like one more comorbid symptom of a complex psychological disorder.
Of course, psychological factors matter. It is trivial to acknowledge that behavioral disturbances like eating problems may sometimes arise in response to complex or stressful situations which also generate psychological disturbances. It is equally obviously true that an individual will not engage in treatment at all without making a decision to pursue recovery, and that this decision-making is in part a psychological act. Given the ambivalence with which most people with eating disorders view both their illness and the possibility and desirability of recovery (Williams and Reid, 2010), this decision must not be taken for granted, either prior to the start of behavior change in treatment or at any point in the ongoing decision-making required to sustain change through treatment and in post-treatment life. But acknowledging the significance of these psychological factors is quite different from claiming that the “real” and “underlying” problem is a psychological one, for example at the level of enduring traits, and that treatment must proceed accordingly. As described above, the stronger claim has not yielded effective psychologically based treatments. In the rest of this section, therefore, we investigate five specific forms of reasoning that underpin it, and what makes these approaches both attractive and problematic.
Correlation Versus Causation
One reason why the psychological story persists despite its failure to generate effective treatments may be a confusion of correlation and causation. As noted, a multitude of correlations have been observed between eating disorders and other psychological problems. Once a correlation has been observed, a sensible next step is often to investigate possible causal links. Anxiety in general, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as a specific expression of anxiety, are amongst the most common focal points for research on the causes of eating disorders (Matsunaga et al., 1999; Levinson et al., 2019)."	<urn:uuid:d77f9b2c-d8d2-42d8-bb2f-b1ab4cad1bdd>	0.0
turkey cooking time per pound and safety precautions	"To keep the burgers juicy, don't pack the meat too tightly.

Was pretty skeptical about this recipe that they wouldn't be juicy and that they'd hold together with all of the spinach sticking out in every direction. I followed the recipe exactly, they held together and are juicy and delicious.
I've made these many times, always to rave reviews. I usually follow the exact recipe, except I use thawed, well-squeezed spinach instead of fresh. They're even better as regular sized burgers. I think they stay moister that way.
Very tasty! I had them bunless and still very good. I saved to use again and again and RIGHT after I had them for dinner I forwarded the recipe to a friend - they were that delicious and such a nice change to the same old ground turkey meals.
Definitely the best turkey burger I've made at home. I usually don't like ground turkey because it's both bland and overly-turkey flavored at the same time. But these easy-to-make (I used thawed, well-drained frozen chopped spinach) sliders were delicious with sharp cheese and barbecue sauce on pretzel buns.
SF Bay Area
Probably the best turkey burger I've had. We made these as full-size burgers and they were juicy, flavorful, and just as satisfying as a classic beef burger. In an effort to get more veggies into our diets, I increased the spinach quite a bit—using a half pound for a double-batch. Made 8 large patties and grilled over charcoal."	<urn:uuid:6b8949dd-92c1-4d80-9a03-e442b8a31a6d>	0.0
toxic waste dump locations minority communities research history first study	"You can then let Minemax Scheduler find an optimal solution that jointly considers the block’s source locations as well as its range of possible final destinations. Using this integrated approach will lead to a truly optimal solution that maximizes the net present value of the project. The integrated approach is particularly beneficial for modelling accurate trucking requirements because we calculate truck hours based on correct cycle times to the final waste dump location rather than “rough estimates” to an arbitrary point.
This allows us to use the correct total truck hours as a maximum capacity constraint for the optimization process. To improve the accuracy even more, we can also use trucking costs as an input to the financial model used by Scheduler to make its optimization decisions. Not convinced yet? Let’s take a closer look at some examples.
Traditional vs Integrated Approach
To compare these two approaches, we modelled an example of a mine operation with one pit, one waste dump and one processing plant to optimize a 12-year schedule in Minemax Scheduler.
The Traditional Approach
First, we modelled our example using estimated waste trucking to demonstrate the traditional approach. For this, we used estimated cycle times from the block pit location out to a centroid of the waste dump, determined the total truck hours and used them to constrain the capacity of the schedule. Then we ran an optimization on the model to find the best schedule that maximizes NPV, and viewed reports with trucking requirements per time period.
The movement chart for the traditional approach shows an optimal schedule utilizing a maximum of 50 trucks to move the ore and waste material.
The Integrated Approach
Next, we modified the basic model using the integrated approach. We imported a detailed waste dump model split into separate dump lifts and smaller “cells” on each dump lift, set appropriate precedences between the cells and calculated waste truck hours based on cycle times to the individual cells in the waste dump. Then we optimized the model and viewed the reports with the movement chart showing the trucking requirements per year.
The movement chart for the integrated approach shows a need for up to two additional trucks between years 2010 and 2014 when compared to the traditional approach.
This means that if we used the traditional approach for this scenario, we would have underestimated the number of trucks in our schedule, leaving us one or two trucks short of being able to move all the material according to the planned schedule. So the mine plan that was produced using the traditional approach is in effect, not practically achievable."	<urn:uuid:adcbaf34-2b99-4e2f-9763-d06c30103041>	0.0

software development lead need comparison between integration testing error metrics vs quality metrics framework hierarchy for decision making	"The Proper Metrics
One of the major topics I teach at our financial analysis workshops and every Efficiency Sales Professional Boot Camp is how to use proper financial metrics. The difference between the simple metrics that most efficiency salespeople use and the proper metrics that efficiency sales professionals use can often mean the difference between hearing a “no” and a “yes.”
Unfortunately, your prospects may be very attached to popular, substandard metrics like simple payback period, return on investment, and internal rate of return. In some cases, they may even be resistant to proper metrics like net present value, modified internal rate of return, or savings-to-investment ratio because they don’t understand the calculations and would rather use what they already know.
When a prospect is using substandard metrics to drive capital budgeting decision-making – especially with expense-reducing capital projects – it's your job to play the adult in the relationship and to share with that person (in a “tough love” way if necessary) that those metrics are not going to serve them best.
Unless you know for a fact that your prospect is already using the right metrics to evaluate projects, it’s a good idea to include both “popular” and “proper” metrics on your financial summary spreadsheet. This will allow you to compare the metrics they are used to seeing with the ones you recommend they start using, and through that comparison, demonstrate why they should be using more advanced metrics to evaluate the project.

drywall repair versus primer application which process requires more coats for optimal results	"Read Roof Restoration Melbourne – The Complete Guide.
Peeling of Painted Colorbond or Metal Roof Tiles
Metal is more durable than any other roof material but also has a slightly different set of rules for painting. For metal roofs, the correct installation makes a much bigger difference than with tile roofs because they’re harder to repair. When one or more tiles crack, they can be replaced at practically no cost, but damage to a metal roof means the entire section should be replaced.
Why Metal Roofs Flake
In the best case scenario, the cause is merely that the primer and/or paint are incorrectly applied or that they had expired. Repainting a Colorbond roof requires experience and correct preparation to ensure the coating will not flake off.
In the worst case scenario, the cause is structural weakness of the roof or that it has approached the end of its usability cycle.
Even the slightest dents in the structure of the roof might mean that’s where water will pool. As soon as you have pooling water, it’s only a matter of time before it starts seeping beneath the paint, leading to flakes.
What To Do When Your Metal Roof Flakes
We suggest you don’t spend too much time or money on quick fixes. When a metal roof experiences flaking paint, it’s time for a serious do-over, not a quick fix that will again fail in a few months’ time. Metal roofs do not tolerate patch jobs, since the patching lines are where water can easily seep through the roof.
The roof should be stripped bare before applying a primer and then repainting. However, we recommend replacing the roof completely. This is because modern metal roofs are imbued with several durable coats of paint by the manufacturer, who regularly gives a lengthy warranty on the colour and the structural quality.
How To Prevent Flaking Metal Roof Paint
A good primer is the key to preventing metal roof paint from flaking but also the correct application of it.
The primer shouldn’t be thinned too much or the paint won’t stick. It should also complement the metal type by chemical composition to ensure the tightest possible bond. When the primer is done right, almost any kind of paint will stick to the roof, giving you unparalleled flexibility and durability.
The primer should dry out completely before paint is applied. The manufacturer’s instructions will often explain how to calculate drying time."	<urn:uuid:141d8f2a-c346-4ccf-9b63-d417f939fdf6>	0.0
Which dessert is traditionally eaten during Chinese New Year and Epiphany?	"Drinks / Dessert
16. Coconut Ice cream
Made from Thailand’s favorite ingredient coconut milk, this creamy, icy confection is best eaten on a hot day at Chatuchak. There are many vendors around Chatuchak which serve this, with a variety of toppings like sticky rice, corn, and crispy mung beans.
17. Mango Sticky Rice (Khao Niao Mamuang)
Mango Sticky Rice is a signature Thai dessert. We heard Platinum food court sells a kick ass one. Best eaten drizzled with coconut cream on top.
18. Belgian Waffle
Can be found at several BTS stations, we got ours at Platinum food court. Fresh off the griddle, the waffles are soft on the inside and slightly crisp on the outside encasing a generous amount of fillings. It’s so good (and cheap!!) that I’ve heard people pack these back to Singapore in large boxes.
19. Red Ruby (Tub Tim Krob)
Best eaten after a hot and spicy meal, this sweet and refreshing dessert is also found at street food stalls. The red rubies are actually crunchy water chestnut pieces and can be eaten with a variety of other ingredients like sweet potato pieces and tapioca. Commonly eaten with coconut milk, best with shaved ice.
20. Durian Sticky Rice (Khao Niaow Tu-rean)
Though not as popular a dessert as its mango counterpart, this is a definite must eat for durian lovers. Unlike the mango version, this is generously drowned in coconut milk so forget about your waistline for once and eat to your heart’s content.
21. Thai Iced Tea (Cha Yen)
Forget the pseudo versions you find in Singapore. The kick ass ones are found in Thailand, with a rich creamy unique flavor which Thai tea leaves impart. We LOVED the ones sold at Rod Fai night market, near the beef noodles stall at the food section near the main road. (Stall name: Bangkok Tea)
22. Toast with coconut custard
23. Butterfly Juice
Made with butterfly pea flower which is nutrient rich, this aesthetically pleasing drink is slightly sweet and tastes like the lemon barley we have during CNY. Great for quenching your thirst. This natural food coloring sauce is the same as the ones used to color nyonya kuehs/glutinous rice dumplings."	<urn:uuid:b35e31f8-6acd-4334-a5bb-a83211be6aab>	0.0
old pictures stored how long display safe	"Can I eat a week old hard boiled egg
Hard-boiled eggs, peeled or unpeeled, are still safe to eat up to one week after they were cooked. Keep them stored in the refrigerator, and you should consider writing the boiling date on each egg to know if they’re still good!
Can you eat hard boiled eggs after 10 days
Your best bet for making hard boiled eggs last is to keep them in the refrigerator, according to The American Egg Board. Hard boiled eggs still in their shell will remain tasty for about a week when properly stored (which means in a fridge that is no warmer than 40°F), but peeled eggs should be eaten the same day.
Do eggs expire
“The shelf life of an unrefrigerated egg is 7 to 10 days and for refrigerated egg it’s about 30 to 45 days,” notes Dr Batra. But that doesn’t mean you can pop a 2-month old egg for a quick omelet. – Eggs can last for about 5-6 weeks if refrigerated properly.
Is it safe to eat hard-boiled eggs left out overnight
As with all cooked foods left out at room temperature (aka the Danger Zone), hard-boiled eggs are no longer deemed safe after two hours. Instead, drop the eggs post-boil in a bowl of ice water, and transfer the cooled eggs to the fridge for longer shelf-life.
How long do eggs last in the refrigerator
6 weeksFresh eggs can be kept refrigerated for up to 6 weeks but always check the use by date displayed on the carton. It is best to put eggs in the fridge as soon as you get them home.
How can you tell if eggs are still good
Fill a bowl or glass with about four inches of cold water and gently place your egg(s) inside. Very fresh eggs will sink to the bottom and lay on their sides. If an egg stays at the bottom but stands on its small end, it’s still fine to eat; just not quite as fresh.
Do eggs need to be refrigerated
In the United States, fresh, commercially produced eggs need to be refrigerated to minimize your risk of food poisoning. However, in many countries in Europe and around the world, it’s fine to keep eggs at room temperature for a few weeks. … If you’re still unsure, refrigeration is the safest way to go.

What is the required body length proportion for male Great Danes?	"One of the joys of this breed is the variety of styles seen in the breed, but any variations must always be assessed in consideration of the breed standard. This is a hands-on breed, requiring careful examination under the coat for structural reference points in order to adequately assess qualities that may be altered by creative grooming or obscured by excessive coat. Judges should ensure they place hands under the coat to feel for the forechest, tip of shoulder blades, length of upper arm, depth of body to the elbows, tight fitting elbows, good length and spring of rib, short, deep loin, bend of stifle, hindquarter muscle mass and correct tail set and length.
Size, Proportion and Substance
The judge’s initial impression of the Golden Retriever should be a dog of moderation and over-all balance. There is a disqualification for size, with no exemption for puppies. The standard has a disqualification for deviation in height more than one inch over or under the prescribed size range. Many puppies do not reach the minimum size by six months of age and judges should not hesitate to measure suspected over-sized or under-sized exhibits.
The standard calls for a proportion ratio of 11:12 based on the height from withers to ground and length from prosternum to seat bone. To the average eye, this is only slightly off square. The distance from withers to elbow and elbow to ground should be approximately equal. Many Goldens today are lacking the correct proportions and appear long and lower to the ground than what the standard requires. Length in the body should come from a well developed rib cage which extends well back, as the Golden should be relatively short-coupled and not long in loin.
The head is one of the hallmarks of the breed. Correct head structure is important to the retrieving function of the breed, relating to vision, scenting and carrying of the game. The head should be clean cut with a broad, slightly arched skull and a definite stop. The skull and the deep, wide, slightly tapering muzzle have nearly parallel planes, with the muzzle nearly as long as the skull. Strong muzzles and back-skulls are necessary for carrying heavy game, as a large goose can weigh 10 to 12 pounds.
Full dentition is preferred, with a scissors bite. Undershot or overshot mouths are a disqualification."	<urn:uuid:47d7f7c8-2cba-4f91-a8fe-eb17ee9c865f>	0.0
environmental factors cold stress list	"Scientists are investigating the contribution of biobehavioral factors (hostility, anxiety, and heightened cardiovascular reactivity to stress) in the etiology, pathogenesis, and course of CHD. Racial differences in stress-induced physiologic responses are also being examined.
The nature of the relationship between acute and chronic forms of stress and cardiac morbidity and mortality is particularly relevant to minority populations, because stress induced by environmental, social, and discriminatory influences can be significant. One study is investigating whether the effect of acute and chronic exposure to established risk factors (depressive symptoms, major life events, and lack of social support) for CVD over a 5-year period is related to a 2-year increase of subclinical CVD in a sample of women undergoing menopause. Fifty-four percent of participants will be black. Another study is examining whether racial disparity in AMI-recovery outcomes in older individuals is partially due to stress related to age and racial stigmas. Fifty percent of the population will be black. Other studies are seeking to clarify the physiologic pathways through which stress affects cardiovascular outcomes?including hemodynamic, sympathetic nervous system and neuroendocrine mechanisms, and inflammatory processes. The ultimate goal is to determine whether stress management interventions can alter these physiological indicators and improve cardiovascular outcomes.
Additional research supported by the Institute includes studies that are addressing the genetic basis of behavioral risk factors and the relationships between risk-promoting variables (psychosocial stress, smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, lack of adherence to cardiac medications), presumed mediating variables (sympathetic nervous system activity and insulin metabolism), and CHD risk factors.
The Institute supports several investigator-initiated studies to develop and evaluate interventions that seek to improve cardiovascular outcomes. One study is seeking to determine the efficacy of a personalized health plan intervention that incorporates mind?body techniques targeted at reducing various risk factors for CVD?such as insulin resistance, inflammatory markers, and self-reported negative effect. Participants select their own goals on which to focus, and the intervention is tailored to their individual risk profile. Twenty-nine percent of participants will be from minority populations. Another study is evaluating the effectiveness of stress management training combined with exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation as a way to reduce stress in vulnerable cardiac patients. Approximately 25 percent of participants are black."	<urn:uuid:0648ad54-49e4-4eae-a209-80195f4c4c1b>	0.0

When he gets into those moods there is absolutely no way to get the kid to listen to you. Like when he rides the vacuum, and eats sandor shaving cream.The more you tell that kid to stop, the more he does it. I honestly don’t know which one of the two are going to give me more hell when they’re teenagers.
He’s also a bottomless pit. This kid eats as much as Jordan and I combined. And it always tastes better when it comes off of someone else’s plate. Like when he threw a fit the other morning because Jeff only gave him one bite of his breakfast sandwich. “I wanted three bites! I wanted THREEEEEEEE BITEEEESSSSSS!!!” Or the time when he refused to eat the chicken I cooked for dinner, instead climbing down off of his chair and running away. When he came back 5 minutes later he had an entire mouthful of dog food.
Regardless what he’s eating (and nine times out of ten it’s not something that’s made for human consumption), he makes a mess out of it every time.
Then there’s how Carter used to squint at me whenever I said, “Look at me!” “Look at me!”. And called Jeff “Deedee”, blocks “dada”, tires “babas”, balloons “beebees” and sewer lids “blllbbllll”.
Then there was the time he burnt his arm on a lightbulb in a chicken coop. Still has the scar to prove it! Or how C just didn’t “get” trick-or-treating. Thankfully we hit the safe trick or treating event downtown the day before Halloween, where we quickly discovered that C wanted his candy and he wanted it NOW. 10 businesses (and 10 temper tantrums later) we were done. Needless to say, C did not go trick or treating Halloween night.That Jordan and Carter have learned how to play with each other over the last year."	<urn:uuid:a637eb1f-e4a2-4bc9-9860-89d1d236852c>	0.0
How does competition work in the Tomiki aikido system?	"Re: Is is it still Aikido if you take away the Japanese clothes, etiquette and other things?
Yes and yes. Yes, the instructional paradigm of aikido includes transmission from reiho. The etiquette happens to be Japanese and based upon a pre-modern Japan in many respects. Yes, aikido is still aikido without these alternative transmission devices. I think you can argue a need to replace those elements lost without the transmission device. I think you can argue aikido does not offer a complete education if it does not contain the elements. Of course if you argue this you need to consider the entirety of excluded curriculum as being damaging to aikido...
I think we should naturally strive towards a goal of expressing aiki in any surrounding, under any conditions. This is difficult enough, let alone placing constraints on what you wear or how you act...
I can appreciate the need for rei to help with all those lessons you learn by observation. I do not mean to discount their value and personally I belive that those lessons need learning. But I do not think removing them makes aikido less - it just places a creative burden on sensei to find a way to effectively teach those lessons.
I am glad that aikido was not developed in the US in the 90's. Can you imagine the balloon pants...? Please Hammer, don't hurt 'em."	<urn:uuid:70e051a2-5af4-4b20-81d2-a389752833e2>	0.0

What are the risks of pacemaker surgery?
Pacemaker surgery generally is safe. If problems do occur, they may include:
- Swelling, bleeding, bruising, or infection in the area where the pacemaker was placed
- Blood vessel or nerve damage
- A collapsed lung
- A bad reaction to the medicine used during the procedure
Talk with your doctor about the benefits and risks of pacemaker surgery.
How will a pacemaker affect my lifestyle?
Once you have a pacemaker, you have to avoid close or prolonged contact with electrical devices or devices that have strong magnetic fields. Devices that can interfere with a pacemaker include:
- Cell phones and MP3 players (for example, iPods)
- Household appliances, such as microwave ovens
- High-tension wires
- Metal detectors
- Industrial welders
- Electrical generators
These devices can disrupt the electrical signaling of your pacemaker and stop it from working properly. You may not be able to tell whether your pacemaker has been affected.
How likely a device is to disrupt your pacemaker depends on how long you're exposed to it and how close it is to your pacemaker.
To be safe, some experts recommend not putting your cell phone or MP3 player in a shirt pocket over your pacemaker (if the devices are turned on).
You may want to hold your cell phone up to the ear that's opposite the site where your pacemaker is implanted. If you strap your MP3 player to your arm while listening to it, put it on the arm that's farther from your pacemaker.
You can still use household appliances, but avoid close and prolonged exposure, as it may interfere with your pacemaker.
You can walk through security system metal detectors at your normal pace. Security staff can check you with a metal detector wand as long as it isn't held for too long over your pacemaker site."	<urn:uuid:b5754a98-5569-4d4e-b295-013d24ff0539>	0.0
How do places like Point Pelee and Cape Race function as natural bird sanctuaries, and what environmental concerns arise from artificial lighting in these wildlife areas?	"A 1993 royal decree designated 23 protected areas covering about 3,273,300 ha, equal to around 18% of the country’s total land area, and brought them under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Environment.1 More details of the 23 recognized protected areas can be found here (full maps can be viewed here).
The protected areas system established by the royal decree divides the areas into four categories:2
- National parks: areas reserved for nature and scenic views, protected for scientific, educational and entertainment purposes.
- Wildlife sanctuaries: areas preserved in their natural condition to protect wildlife, vegetation and ecological balance.
- Protected landscapes: areas to be maintained as scenic spots for leisure and tourism.
- Multi-purpose use areas: areas necessary for the stability of water, forestry, wildlife and fisheries resources, for pleasure, and for the conservation of nature while allowing some economic development.
The Cambodian system uses the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s classification for protected areas. The national parks and wildlife sanctuaries comply with category II and IV of IUCN’s classification system. The protected landscapes and multiple use areas conform to category V and VI of the IUCN’s classification system respectively.3
In addition, the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) designated:
- Six protected forest areas administered by the Forestry Administration (FA)4, and
- Eight fish sanctuaries administered by the Fisheries Administration (FiA).5
In 2008, the RGC adopted the Law on Protected Areas introducing and defining a new zoning system to manage the protected areas in Cambodia.6 Chapter III of the law underlines the expansion and modification of protected areas categories which now include Ramsar sites, biosphere reserves, natural heritage sites and marine parks. This law is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Environment.7
By late 2017, Cambodia had almost 50 protected areas. These covered more than 7.5 million hectares – approximately 41 percent of the country’s total land area.8

What are the immediate environmental effects of hurricanes on coastal marshes, and how do these areas help reduce financial losses from storm damage?	"First, although the intensity of a hurricane depends on many factors, warmer seawater tends to promote stronger storms. Average sea surface temperatures have been rising, and some parts of the North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico are warmer than average at the moment, which is a key reason why both Harvey and Irma became so strong so quickly.
Second, a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapour, which can result in heavier rainfall. That is true not only for hurricanes but also for weaker storms across the world. Even relatively mild tropical storms can cause great damage by dropping huge volumes of rain over one area.
Third, apart from strong winds and heavy rainfall, hurricanes cause damage through storm surges as their winds push seawater ahead of them. Storm surges can inundate extensive low-lying coastal areas, sweeping away everything in their path. Sea levels have been gradually rising globally, making storm surges bigger and deadlier.
Scientists are still not sure about the other ways in which climate change may be impacting hurricanes. The main reason Harvey created such extreme flooding around Houston was that it stalled over the city and dumped rain for several days without moving on. We do not know if climate change played a role in creating the atmospheric conditions that made that happen.
Nor can we yet predict whether climate change will affect the number of hurricanes that occur every year. Some studies have suggested that while numbers will drop, strengths will increase.
Also uncertain is how natural climate variability affects hurricanes. Numbers have increased markedly in the North Atlantic since the 1990s, but this seems to be due, at least partly, to large-scale changes in ocean circulation that occur over many years or decades.
However, it is clear that the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans will be at risk if Trump and his administration continue to deny the existence of climate change and its impact on the threat posed by hurricanes.

how many people orange county recycling plant serve	"ORANGE, Calif. (KABC) -- For many years, Mary's Kitchen in the city of Orange has been a place that offered comfort and hope, a non-profit that serves up hundreds of meals a day to the homeless community. But now it looks like the kitchen's days are numbered.
With its future up in the air, many who look for a warm meal, a shower, a place to volunteer, pray or have a sense of community are worried about what's to come. The city of Orange officially gave Mary's Kitchen 90 days to vacate the property.
""The city has said that we have not complied over the years with serving the homeless in a proper way, but I've been here two and a half years, and I've seen no difference,"" said volunteer Barry Gearin.
Gearin admits among their clients, some people are suffering from mental illness; and says fights happen outside the gate about once a month. But he adds, the volunteers know how to deal with it.
""Just talk to 'em, talk to 'em, hey quiet down let's get something to eat,"" said Gearin. ""Redirect. That's pretty easy, that's not that difficult. Like I said, it doesn't very often.""
In a statement, a city spokesperson told Eyewitness News, ""We are working with Mary's Kitchen in a collaborative manner to come up with an exit strategy, which for them may include a new location with a new model. Our hope is for a positive outcome.""
The CEO of Mary's Kitchen says she is in talks with her attorney to see what options she has for her nonprofit and the people they serve in Orange County.

watering hours nassau county lawns allowed	"Provides First-time Homebuyers with “American Dream” of Homeownership
MINEOLA, NY – September 14, 2009 – (RealEstateRama) — Nassau County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi today hosted Nassau’s first Neighborhood Stabilization Program lottery for first-time homebuyers to purchase foreclosed properties in Nassau County. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program seeks to revitalize communities that have been negatively impacted by foreclosures. The Long Island Housing Partnership, Inc. (LIHP) conducted the lottery proceedings, and worked with Nassau County to determine which potential homebuyers met eligibility requirements.
“Nassau County has had more than 6,000 foreclosure filings, and communities all over the county are affected more and more every day by this crisis. Foreclosures not only hurt the people who lose their homes, but they also bring down the values of other homes. We all take a hit when there is a foreclosure in our neighborhood,” said County Executive Suozzi. “The Neighborhood Stabilization Program funding provides relief to communities that were hardest hit by the foreclosures, and gives first-time homebuyers the opportunity to get into a home of their own. Everyone wants a piece of the American Dream, and this lottery makes home ownership a reality for people who may not have thought it was possible”
To date, Nassau County has purchased or is in contract to purchase 15 foreclosed homes. All homes remain affordable, with price ranges between $195,000 – $290,000. Most properties are single-family three-bedroom homes.
Earlier this year, Suozzi announced that Nassau County entered into an agreement with Fannie Mae – the first of its kind in the country – to purchase six foreclosed properties from Fannie Mae, demonstrating how the public sector and lending institutions can work together to assist at-risk neighborhoods. The County will use $10 million of its federal- and state-funded Neighborhood Stabilization Program grants to finance the costs of further property acquisition and renovation. Nassau County’s goal is to rehabilitate 100 homes.
Suozzi urges any first-time homebuyer who is interested and is not yet in the lottery to call the Nassau County Homeownership Center at 516.571.HOME or the LIHP at 631.435.4710 for an application. Applicants will be placed on a first-come-first-serve waiting list for future available properties."	<urn:uuid:d0b2087a-3182-4f6d-aba5-4021a79b7f5a>	0.0
advantages draining water pipes versus leaving faucets running winter vacation home	"No Water Dispensing From Hot Side of Faucet? (Here's a Fix)
Whether you’re doing the dishes, taking a shower, or simply washing your hands, having hot water in your home is essential. If there’s no hot water coming out of your faucet, you could be facing a major dilemma.
The main reason that water won’t come out of the hot water tap is that the water heater is leaking. Hot water won’t come out of your faucet if your pipes are frozen or if the diverter valve is stuck and damaged. Your faucet may not dispense hot water if you haven’t flushed your water tank in over 3 years.
We’re going to take a look at all of the different things that could be causing this issue. There are easy fixes to get hot water up and running again in your home. Let’s dive into the factors that could be causing the disruption.
Check Every Faucet
The first thing you’ll want to do is check all the faucets in your home to see if hot water will come out of any of them. Sometimes a single faucet can get clogged, causing a block in the flow of water.
If the water temperature is fine, the problem lies in your faucet itself. If it’s a major problem, calling a plumber to get the job done for you may be the easiest solution.
Just Getting Cold Water
If there’s no hot water coming out of the designated side of the faucet, it could be your water heater. This is especially true if the cold side is working just fine. Water heaters malfunction for a number of different reasons.
There could be a leak, a sediment build-up, or it could’ve just come unplugged. Flush the water heater, allow it to heat up, and try the faucet again. No worries, there are details on how to flush the water heater later on.
Look for Frozen Pipes
If you live in a state that experiences brutal winters, you’ll be well aware of what frozen pipes can do. They can stop water from flowing to all of the faucets in your home. If you’re not getting hot or cold water or just lukewarm water, this could be the culprit.
You’ll need to have the pipes thawed out before the water will start coming out of the faucet again. To unfreeze the pipes, you could use a hairdryer or a heat gun."	<urn:uuid:c99743f1-d2eb-49cd-858a-be8eb1dc6433>	0.0
rainbow cave and house rock which natural force shaped them both	"The sixth room is named Kin Nor La Tat Sa Na or Kin Na Lee Tad Sa Na. This wall's room is a white color. People believe that whoever see it would have a long life and they will be praised. In this room, there is also a turtle limestone and a sacred spring that never dry and it's being used as a holy water of the famous preacher.
The seventh room is Pruksa Him Ma Pan. the one who discovers this room imagine that this stalagmite is simple as a bat spread its wing. I try to imagine it but I can not see any point that look like a bat at all. A rocky garden is on the other side of the room. Many tree are in stalactite and Columnar Pillar shape. People believe that whoever traveling to this room will have a lovely house, being loved and their offspring can reply on them.
Now come to the eighth room, it is named Tuai Tape Natural Park. People believe that this is a conference room of a holy of the cave. Tourists like to worship here because they believe that they will have a good fortune, get away from suffering and disease.
When observing inside of the cave, I recommend you to follow the stated route, don't get out off the way because you can get lost. The air inside the cave is extremely hot, not different from Sauna. My shirt get soaked with sweat and when I reach the cave mouth, I have to take a deep breath otherwise I would have fainted.
I think the stalactite in the cave is beautiful but the lighting at some point is not elaborated. Some of the light is beautifully setting up. But, It would be more beautiful if the lights are put between the rock, it would become more attractive.
Before I head to the next destination, I have to change my cloth first because the shirt is getting wet. So, if I sit in the car, a car seat would also get wet too.
I use a direct road to get me back to Ratchaburi again and visit a Khao Ngu Stone Park before I enter the city.
Khao Ngu Stone Park originally is a rock blasting area and an important rock crushing in Thailand since Rattanakosin period. After that the government and populace see the decline of the terrain so they cancel the blasting concession then its becomes an abandoned and poor mine."	<urn:uuid:2f532c77-0d6d-4787-aacb-242b688988b9>	0.0

When should I pick my snow peas and regular pea pods from the garden to ensure the best quality?	"Taylor Pea Sheller - The Little Pea Sheller that Can - Call (855) 743-5537 To Order
The 'Lil Pea Sheller is the biggest pea sheller for large gardens and light commercial use. The ""Little"" Pea Sheller is excellent for shelling black-eyed peas, crowders, lady fingers, white acres, and English peas. It can even handle mature butter beans.
Taylor Pea Sheller Operator Side View
The Taylor Pea Sheller is much larger and more heavy duty than other residential/ light commercial pea shellers. The top quality 1/3 HP motor powers specially designed rollers made from high tensile strength material. The rollers are easily adjustable to accommodate a wide variety of peas and beans.
The Taylor Pea Sheller can hull 3-4 bushels per hour. I have found this claim to be quite realistic.Anyone who is serious about shelling can probably hull even more with the Little Pea Sheller!
Taylor Pea Sheller Exit Guard
Taylor Pea Sheller- Safety First!
The Taylor Pea Sheller has the best hair and hand guards I have seen. The rollers are protected by guards in the front AND exit. Hands and hair cannot practically get caught in the rollers.
The belt guard completely encloses the moving belt and drive wheels. All moving parts are protected against accidental contact.
The Taylor Pea Sheller is Simple to Operate
Just lay the unshelled peas or beans in the tray and slide them forward. The beans drop down into the basket and the hulls are ejected out the front. It doesn't get any easier than that!
Taylor Pea Sheller-Built to Last
In today's throw-away society it is nice to find something that is high quality and highly affordable. The Little Pea Sheller fits that description perfectly. The 'Lil Pea Sheller is built in America. I visit the plant regularly because I go to pick up my orders. These are good, down-home Americans that take Good Ol' Fashion American Pride in their workmanship. The Taylor Pea Sheller is something that your grandchildren will pass on to their grandchildren!

What security measures should be taken for parking and vehicle safety?	"Improving school security
There’s no sure way to put a cost on a human life, yet we attempt to put a price to it almost daily; whether determining the extent of medical treatment; engineering vehicles we drive; or taking steps to thwart the actions of a sick man like the one who mowed down 20 children and six adults at the Sandy Hook School.
At some point we question that, while extra treatments and medication may lengthen a life, whether what is gained in time is offset by what is lost of quality of life. Cost enters this discussion, too.
Cost is often the driver in motor vehicle engineering. Safety is a valid marketing consideration, but there’s a point where we’re prepared to take the risk even as we know the possible consequences. Otherwise, we would all be driving tanks.
The same can be asked of the safety of our children.
In response to the Newtown massacre, the National Rifle Association CEO, Wayne LaPierre, suggested all schools should have armed guards. At least one community in Arizona has followed his advice and armed parents, on a volunteer basis, to watch over schools.
Here, the response has been more tempered. Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney, Mayor Scott Avedisian and acting School Superintendent Richard D’Agostino don’t favor armed school guards, whether they are members of the Warwick Police Department or contracted security personnel.
D’Agostino implemented a policy of locking elementary school doors and has been reviewing security at secondary schools. This is a reasoned approach, and one within the existing capabilities and resources of the department.
Will it stop a Newtown tragedy?
There’s no way of knowing, although, as those who want more security will point out, the doors at Sandy Hook were locked. An armed guard would have probably made the difference in that case. That said, we agree with Pilgrim Principal Marie Cote that, regardless of all the measures that can be taken, someone who is determined will find a way to do it.
In weighing the options, we need not only consider child safety and security, but also the environment we are creating. Schools need to be safe places, not forts. Vigilance is a part of the equation. We all need to be sensitive to what is happening around us and how it impacts us. Good drivers do that all the time. But, do we seriously want to drive tanks to make us safer on our highways? Do we seriously want our kids attending armored schools? That’s not a direction for our schools."	<urn:uuid:52847589-3984-498e-abab-1bf0208df4cb>	0.0

Which creates more environmental problems: modern soil sensors or Third Revolution farming?	"A natural landscape is a landscape that has not been changed in anyway by human activity. Formed by the earth’s changes through millions of years, a natural landscape is unique in every habitat and eco-system. Nature always finds a way to use it’s natural resources as they become available to surrounding organisms. If left alone, nature will always flourish and it’s diversity creates systems which live and feed off of each other, giving and receiving to one another to keep the circle of life flowing until it’s environmental conditions are changed.
Mimicking the natural landscape and the processes that occur naturally on Earth are needed when using the earth’s soil for food and livestock production if we are to keep the soil a renewable resource. The more diverse the landscape, the more the plants and animals help each other flourish and stay healthy for human consumption.
When trying to create a biodiverse farm all organisms must be taken into consideration. Not simply the seeds or animals alone but the relationship that they will have with the soil fauna, weeds, pests, predators and all other native or domesticated species that exist on the farm. Aquatic diversity also plays a part in the biodiversity of a farm when there are water ecosystems in place.
Humans are dependent on agricultural biodiversity and our current practices only promote uniformity and consistency of species’ being raised. This only benefits the corporate buyer who processes or packages the food for distribution. It is reported that over 90% of crop varieties have disappeared from farmers’ fields. Domesticated animal breeds have been cut in half. In fisheries alone, many species have gone extinct while other fishing grounds are being harvested beyond sustainable means.
Agricultural biodiversity provides sustainable food production, conservation of land and life support to other organisms. It also creates services for conservation such as wildlife protection, water and air quality and treatment programs and soil protection practices. Agricultural biodiversity strengthens food production and enhances all genetic resources. It promotes soil fertility and plant and animal growth. It helps breakdown pollutants and maintain a clean and healthy atmosphere.
If farming can start to create more biodiversity within it’s sustainable practices, mankind has a very good chance to increase the level of food health, human health and environmental health on the planet. -KATIE FLYNN"	<urn:uuid:e8bc11ed-7edf-4128-b754-47c938f764a9>	0.0
human body systems movement expression creative dance compare metabolic effects sedentary behavior	"As outlined in the aims of the present study, the primary outcomes will explore the effects of the intervention on postprandial glucose/insulin responses (pre–post) and energy balance – reflected by changes in resting metabolic rate (pre–post), physical activity energy expenditure (monitoring–intervention) and postprandial thermogenesis (pre–post). Secondary outcomes will explore changes from pre- to post-intervention in body composition, substrate oxidation, lipid profile, leptin concentration, c-reactive protein concentration, adipose tissue gene expression, postprandial lipaemia and postprandial appetite regulation/perception. In addition, differences in physical activity intensity and dietary composition between the monitoring and intervention phases will be examined. As it is not the objective of this study to compare these differences between the cohorts, two sets of analyses will be conducted on a per protocol basis -– one for the lean cohort and one for the overweight/obese cohort. Both will centre upon a two-way mixed model analysis of variance featuring a factor for diet allocation and a factor for time-point. This will permit an examination of the effect of each diet on the outcomes of interest (i.e. pre vs. post/monitoring vs. intervention) and whether this effect varied between the three dietary conditions. Pre-existing differences between groups at baseline will be examined using a one-way analysis of variance featuring a factor for diet allocation. Significant differences emerging from these tests will be explored using appropriate post-hoc tests to adjust for multiple comparisons and isolate the source(s) of variance. In addition to these analyses at the group level, individual responses will also be closely scrutinised to examine whether outliers could be affecting the interpretation. Further analysis, such as sub-group analysis, may also be conducted in light of patterns emerging in the final dataset. Baseline characteristics of participants who withdraw during the intervention will also be compared against the final population using t tests. Statistical significance will be accepted at P < 0.05.
Despite the growing popularity of IMF , research exploring its effects on human metabolism remains scarce. The novel examination of postprandial responses and the components of energy balance being employed in this study will highlight the extent to which IMF regimes can impact human metabolism. The isocaloric contrast of IMF and daily calorie restriction will also add a further dimension by thoroughly benchmarking IMF against current nutritional strategies for improving metabolic health."	<urn:uuid:ef20cfe6-3f3c-45c0-b724-72966010a3b0>	0.0

MADDOW: In Washington, Democrats like Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan find themselves looking into CSPAN cameras and making this kind of case for what the Democratic Party stands for.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. TIM RYAN (D), OHIO: The issue that we are talking about in Ohio, in Wisconsin is an issue of respect for the average worker in the United States of America. The issue is: are we going to respect work in the United States of America? Are we going to respect the workers in the United States of America while all these fat cats have gotten off scot-free? And we turn around and tell the workers in Ohio and Wisconsin and Indiana and the Big Ten Conference, you got to take the hit. It‘s unfair and it‘s disrespectful and it is not an American value.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MADDOW: When is the last time you heard Democrats talking like that in Congress?
Democrats are placing themselves on the side of Americans who have to work for a living and against the corporate interest and the political party those corporate interests pay for who are trying to strip them of their rights. This is happening among Democrats at the state level, right? The Wisconsin 14, those Wisconsin state senators have been out of the state 14 days now. They show no signs of wavering.
In Indiana—Indiana—Indiana, land of Democrats like Evan Bayh—in Indiana, state Democrats there did what the Wisconsin Democrats did. In Indiana, they fled the state. Once they fled the state, Republicans caved, and then the Democrats decided to stay out of the state in opposition to privatizing the state school system, too.
Indiana that happened? The fighting progressive Democrats of Indiana?
Indiana and Wisconsin Democrats have galvanized to take the kind of
stand and to show the kind of spine that the Democratic base has frankly
been weeping for my entire adult life."	<urn:uuid:490b29b9-2aa2-45b9-9ef7-ea6dac130dc3>	0.0
home clinic baby development checkup difference	"Many people realise that the web is a vast source of info, but may not fully grasp its potential usefulness for everyday tasks, like when it comes to searching for medical professionals like dentists Adelaide. Many websites have compiled thousands of reviews and ratings of the dental clinics and practising individuals. These reports are written and submitted by individuals who sought dental help every day just like you.
All you need to access such information is to use your home computer or at a location that offers internet access. Simply go on the web and search for dentists in your area. You can narrow your search by including your city in your search. For example, you can try searching ‘dental clinic Adelaide’. The internet is a good way to find what you are looking for without the need to leave your own home and even better, it can be done completely anonymously.
When looking for the most positive review for Adelaide clinic and practitioners, be sure to read several to get a consensus for to see if it matches your needs. It is wise to generate a short list of some possible candidates before going further. Remember that you’re looking for a dental clinic or an individual dentist who will not only take care of your teeth but all your family’s as well.
Once you have shortlisted a few dental clinic or individual dentists, you should then contact them via telephone. It is important to know how the staff handles clients as they are a direct representation of the professional whose care you seek. Ask about fundamental questions like the dental cleaning fees and insurance covers that they accept. Also, you can ask for any family discounts and if they apply to you. Dental treatments can be pricey, and so you will want not only a topnotch treatment but also affordable treatment as well.
After you have chosen the dental clinic or dentist you wish to visit, you should then schedule a visit for an initial consultation with the dentist Adelaide who will be taking care of your dental needs. This is the best time to get a feel for how easy they are when it comes to communication.
Ask them about any questions regarding the method of treatment and what type of procedures they offer at the clinic. Also, clarify if the dentist will be cleaning your teeth every time you go for a checkup, or it will be done only upon your request. The bottom line is getting a dentist who can take good care of both you and your family. Also, be sure to check if they offer emergency dental services. Just do good research, and you will land in caring hands of a dentist."	<urn:uuid:c7a8d53b-d40e-4494-a705-0869513018a5>	0.0
How do both community gardening projects and flexible work arrangements contribute to better mental health and community wellbeing?	"About the service and what to expect
Staying Well is provided by Southdown, a Sussex-based housing, care and support provider committed to preventing homelessness and supporting people’s health, wellbeing and independence.

What makes gophers come into people's yards and gardens in the first place?	"In the second overtime, the Wildcats (4-3, 2-2) scored once more, undramatically on Brandon Roberson's 6-yard run, but the Gophers came back to pull within one on a Weber option.
Here Gophers went for two points and the victory with Weber rolling right and eyeing the end zone as Wildcats linebacker Adam Kadela rolled with him and eyed his running back. Weber was Kadela's responsibility, so when he saw that back blocking, he charged and got a hand on Weber before he slipped off. But by then defensive tackle John Gill had come from the backside and he hit Weber as he threw a pass that nose-dived to the ground near none of his receivers.
""My team deserved to win,"" Gophers coach Tim Brewster said. ""That's why I went for it. I felt 100 percent we'd get two.""
But that triumph, implausibly, went instead to the Wildcats, who survived again behind Bacher and with a mettle that proved as unyielding as tempered steel.
He completed 41 of 58 passes for 470 yards and four touchdowns with no interceptions. The Wildcats, in turn, ran their overtime record to 7-0 in Big Ten games and 8-1 overall. He also produced when the heat was hottest and converted each of the three fourth-down situations he faced, twice for touchdowns.
""We don't really like [close games] until they're over,"" Bacher said. ""We've had a few now that have been fun. But we'd like to play better in the first half and not have to face those situations.""
Kadela was apologetic.
""It is a little stressful,"" he said. ""You know, it's fun to be part of these games. [But] we don't want to be part of them. But we have been, and you have to take them in stride."""	<urn:uuid:c7b0edf4-784c-46f2-beb6-0df8a04b09ae>	0.0

irish monasticism spiritual elevation compared mendicant orders urban ministry	"The price of housing loses strength once the housing bubble is flirted with higher levels. At least in some territories. The appraised value of the free home is barely grew by 0.4% between the first quarter and the second quarter, Yes, the price rose 5.5% between April and June, compared to the second quarter of 2021, according to data published yesterday by the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda.
These are more moderate increases than those achieved in the first quarter of the year, when the appraised value of housing increased by 6.7% at the annual rate and by 2.4% in the inter-quarterly rate. Nationally, the price per square meter closed on average in June at 1,734 euros, a level similar to those were registered in 2011 and is down 17.5% from the historical maximum of 2,101.4 euros per square meter during the first quarter of 2008.
Data from the Ministry of Transport also shows that new housing is at higher prices than used ones. The appraised value of five-year-old real estate has increased by 2.5% (0.4% of the total free housing mentioned above) in Q2 as compared to the previous quarter and by 6.2% as compared to Q2 of 2021. At 2,031 Euro per square metre. Housing older than five years, on the other hand, shows rates close to average, with a 0.3% quarter-on-quarter rate increase and an inter-annual rate increase of 5.6%. In this case, prices reach 1,732 euros per square meter.

The fact is that since outbreak of epidemic Accommodation price advance by two speeds. While new flats appreciate strongly due to new preferences of buyers – who have gone for larger and more spacious properties after confinement – used homes have seen a more moderate growth. The lack of new construction and construction problems also suggest that this trend will increase in the coming months.
But there are only differences between New and used housing. There are areas in which the prices have started to decline quarter-on-quarter and others in which the valued value maintains its strength."	<urn:uuid:c8e0c10d-cadd-40f8-8f88-a5bd139bdc5a>	0.0
What's good about eating farmed mussels?	"Instead, a shift took place: Larger mussels and barnacles suffered, leaving smaller barnacles and some calcium-based seaweeds better off.
In nature, ""species are competing for space, they are eating each other, it's an incredibly dynamic system,"" said James Forester, a Harvard University ecologist who co-authored the study in this week's journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
""When you change the playing field—in this case by altering acidity—you can get unexpected responses,"" he said.
""Mussels usually dominate the ecosystem because they are good at overgrowing and crushing out other species that grow on the rocks,"" said co-author Wootton.
""But when the mussels decline, it means other species—no matter whether or not they have a shell—can do better,"" he said.
Nancy Knowlton is a marine biology professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, who was not involved in the study.
She pointed out the importance of adopting this ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" approach when trying to understand how various shelled species respond to ocean acidification.
An acidity-driven shift in coastal ecosystems could spell disaster for shellfish industries that rely on mussels and other similar species, Wootton warned.
A Wider Pattern?
While the field surveys did show an overall decline in mussels, the predictive models were needed to hunt for longer-term changes.
""There is inertia in the system because many of these species live for a long time,"" said co-author Wooton.
""The little changes we see in the dynamics of the ecosystem may magnify over time.""
These are the first data on ocean acidity from temperate—rather than tropical—waters. No one knows whether similar rapid changes are taking place elsewhere.
""The rules might be quite different on Tatoosh Island,"" Wootton suggested.
""There could be mechanisms going on in the waters around our island that are unique.
""We really need to get more data from other sites away from the equator to see what patterns are there,"" he added.
Marine biologist Knowlton said, ""This is typical of so many climate studies—almost without exception things are turning out to be worse than we originally thought.""

As a neuroscience researcher, I need to understand how BCI drone control works. Can you explain?	"The Creating HP Software-Defined Networks (H8D01P) course is an introductory course to SDN. The course provides an overview of SDN concepts, architecture, network design elements, how SDN-enabled applications can dynamically control network behaviour, and how SDN will make deploying new solutions more efficient and less time-consuming.
- Explain what SDN means, from a technical and a business perspective
- Understand how SDN can be integrated into the HP FlexNetwork Architecture through SDN use cases
- Explain and understand how OpenFlow is the open-standard transport mechanism used for making SDN possible
- Understand how OpenFlow enables the separation of the control and data planes
- Understand the difference between OpenFlow 1.0 and 1.3
- Explain and understand how SDN can enhance the network performance, security and simplification, via applications such as Sentinel
- Understand what it takes to transition from traditional networking to Software-defined Networking
- Install and configure the HP VAN SDN Controller
- Understand and configure how the HP VAN SDN controller communicates with different components, both internal and external to the controller, via secure channels
- Explain the HP VAN SDN Controller RESTful API, including information about RS Doc
- Demonstrate how to use a script to make API calls, focusing on application implementation rather than the development of applications
- Configure a controller team to provide high availability in an SDN environment
In this course, you will learn how SDN is used in networking environments, and how SDN separates the control and data plane using OpenFlow as the open standard transport mechanism. SDN “use cases” are used to demonstrate how SDN can be used in real-world situations to solve network challenges and demonstrate the implications that SDN will have on the current and future network designs.
You will learn how to implement the HP VAN SDN Controller into an existing network by installing, configuring and licensing the HP VAN SDN Controller. The Network Protector SDN Application running on the HP VAN SDN Controller enables automated network posture assessment and real-time security across OpenFlow-enabled network devices. In the course, you will be installing, configuring and testing this new HP SDN Application during hands-on labs.
At course completion, the learner will have a solid understanding of what SDN concepts, how it works, why it is used, and how the HP VAN SDN Controller can be implemented in an HP network."	<urn:uuid:e1ec3418-8b8f-4846-8dc7-25da482c1700>	0.0

Examples must be analyzed using course vocabulary and also must be clearly identified by date, title, etc. as available. Absolutely no use of any outside sources is permitted – you may choose an example of a work of art which you found online but you may not use online websites for content. Do not use the same example more than once on this quiz.
- Compare and contrast the Greek and roman styles of art. In your discussion, you must use two specific works of art – one for Greek and one for Roman. remember to discuss how these works reveal similarities and differences in cultural values. Be sure your discussion includes references to both idealism and realism.
- Describe three Egyptian works of art (architecture, painting or sculpture) which all reflect the same specific cultural value – explain how each does so.
- Describe the history, purpose and specific features of a Gothic cathedral. Describe at least one specific cathedral in your essay and describe at least four specific features of it.
- Compare and contrast the classical and Hellenistic Greek styles – again using specific example of each.
- Compare and contrast the ancient Greek representation of humanity to that of the medieval view of humanity – again, specific example of each must be used in your essay.
- Compare and contrast the Greek Parthenon to the roman Pantheon – purposes, features, style etc – and again, what this comparison/contrast tells us about these two cultures
Please do not quote from the text – it is far better to write your own thoughts!
Submit your test in a Word Document by Sunday at 11:59pm.
This essay should be about 2-3 pages, double-spaced total. Always write in Times New Roman, Times or Helvetica, 12-point font and 1-inch margins."	<urn:uuid:d641da91-a298-4376-a4ec-3c0ee53703dd>	0.0

My basement feels damp lately. What problems could this cause?	"Let me tell you something, dear Internet. This summer? Been kind of rough. So by the time Pasha got sick and ruined the rugs, only to be followed by our basement flooding, I was well worn out. Lately, life feels too short and too fragile to be so fully occupied by such disasters. So, in a manner unfamiliar to me…
I bought a ticket to California.
(and new rugs).
I leave for a week next month. (J. will stay home to man the homefront, water the garden, care for the pup, and miss me terribly, I presume). Any recommendations for sight seeing in San Diego and LA?
I’m sure, oh so sure, that you have been awaiting news about my garden and summer crop yields and about what critters have returned to terrorize or be terrorized (yes?). It may be long neglected here on the blog, but in real life, the garden still claims a portion of my (ever-shrinking) free time and a larger portion of my should-be-doing-something-else-time (like writing papers!).
So here’s a quick (maybe?) summary of the Cottage’s Farm, although mind you that I wrote this more than a week ago, so things look slightly larger and a bit thirstier these days.
Before the heat wave melted our faces off, I’d spend the 5-6 PM hour weeding + watering + harvesting + hollering at John to look at this insert-something-amazing-here!, which he’d typically ignore, bless him, and then we’d do this:
But it’s been so hot that mostly I’ve been ignoring the dear plants until the sun goes down and then I would water them, usually while wearing my pjs, meaning I developed a charming habit of climbing into bed slightly damp, smelling of tomato plants. I’m lovely.
What are we eating, you’re asking? Well, we’re thigh-high in zucchini season. Despite best efforts, I can never spot my zukes until they are the size of my arm. And, oh my, the banana peppers! Always the over achievers. My green peppers will barely look at me, and here my banana peppers are simply spitting fruit all over the place. If I were in class and my garden were a dysfunctional family unit, I’d label the banana pepper plant the hero child.
Do you want to see the plots?"	<urn:uuid:a5ab5b86-9b26-42db-b7aa-5d1f2aa6c1d9>	0.0
Working in culinary education, I've noticed many students struggle with basic cooking skills. How do essential cooking techniques like knife skills and meal prep specifically support the nutritional needs of seniors?	"Being a chef is not the job for everyone. Chefs have to be passionate, practiced, and talented, and it can sometimes be difficult to know whether or not the culinary art is the career choice that you want. If you’re thinking about becoming a chef, here are the logistical steps you need to take.
- Find Out if the Culinary Arts is Your Passion
Whether you’re a young person trying to figure out your next step after high school or a person stuck in a career looking for a new one, it’s important to really find out if you’re passionate enough about cooking to work in kitchens for a long time to come. The first step is to practice cooking and experimenting on your own, and maybe even get a job as a cook in a restaurant that doesn’t require a culinary arts education.
- Decide Which Culinary Arts Program is Best for You
Once you’ve decided to pursue the culinary arts, it’s time to start looking at the various types of programs offered out there. You may want to specialize in a type of food, like sushi, or you may want a more well-rounded approach to cooking. Either way, do your research, and find the school for you.
- Attend Culinary Arts School
If you want to make cooking a profession rather than just a job, you need to actually get an education. Culinary Arts schools mold amateur cooks into highly trained professionals. You’ll learn all of the skills you need to work and run a kitchen, and at a top notch program, you’ll get the opportunity to learn from the best of the best.
- Get an Internship
Many culinary arts programs may require you to get an internship in a big restaurant. It’s important to not only learn about various culinary methods, but to also hone and refine your skills. Working in an actual restaurant while you’re still working on your education will help you do this.
- Get Certified
The American Culinary Federation offers standardized certifications for chefs practicing in the culinary arts. Chefs who go through a certification program end up earning 7% more than chefs who did not. An ACF certification will help you get better jobs, and it’ll ensure that your skills match the national standard.
- Look for Jobs
After you graduate from a culinary arts program, it’s time to look for a job."	<urn:uuid:82afc161-3098-44ad-865f-5560443109a7>	0.0
I'm curious about local breakfast foods when I travel - what's a typical morning meal that people eat in the Philippines?	"I love my dietician Cynthia! She is always there for me and answers all my questions (even if I think they are silly!!!!) She was super helpful today and I found out some new stuff, so I'll share it with you all.
1. What is a target amount of calories should I be aiming for daily? Now that I am 18 months out I should be shooting for 1000 to 1200 calories a day. I'm not to focus on calories, but this is good for me to know when meal planning and making choices.
2. How do I prevent this sugar drop and my blood sugar bottoming out without relying on carbs? There is no way to prevent sugar drop without some type of carbs! I have been diagnosed as a reactive hypoglycemic and therefore need to have some complex carbs in my diet at each meal or I will ""forever chase my sugar"" - More on this in a bit
3. I'm at a plateau - is there anything I can do to change up my diet to help burn more calories? On the diet end she wants me to focus on working my plan. I might not be eating enough! So make sure I'm eating the right amount of calories and intake. I'm also going to change up my work outs.
4. Are there any foods I should add? Any foods should I avoid? I'm free to eat what my tummy can handle. No more foods are ""off limits"" except the sugars still. If my tummy can't handle it I dont' eat it, but if I can - welcome to the diet!
5. I'm going to go over the way I eat (splitting meals into two to eat more often) etc. - Because I am a reactive hypoglycemic, I need to eat every 3 to 4 hours. So I have been doing something right already! I eat breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, snack - need to keep my blood sugar up!
6. I also want to ask her about why my body might now process low fat cheese well...i'm good with dairy overall it is just low fat cheese that doesn't do well. I don't want to eliminate cheese - If my tummy won't handle it - eat the real stuff."	<urn:uuid:e3531976-c261-4986-a967-eaf3324b8a5f>	0.0

The latest stroke in this picture is the ban by the Russian occupation authorities on the activities of the Mejlis, the self-governing body of the Crimean Tatar people.

In fact, the outrageous practice of punitive psychiatry, which had been widely used by the Soviet repressive machinery, is now back in service for Russia.
We urge Russia to grant unimpeded access of international human rights organizations to both Crimea and Donbas, and implement the decision of UNESCO Executive Board on establishing monitoring in Crimea at the institutional level.
The residents of the peninsula must be protected from discrimination and repressions.
The genocide of the Crimean Tatar people who already experienced the tragedy of forced deportation 70 years ago must not repeat.
In Ukraine, we highly appreciate the contribution of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Human Rights Council to addressing the current human rights situation in my country, including in occupied Crimea.
This year, we intend to bring this matter to the attention of the UN General Assembly and to submit a respective draft resolution on the human rights situation in the territory of the occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.
This resolution shall become an impartial assessment of the human rights situation in the occupied territories by the entire UN family.
People in these territories have the right to be protected.
Their children have the right to be protected.
And it is our responsibility, as the United Nations, to protect them.
I appeal to all UN member states to support the initiative of Ukraine.
We also urge you not to recognize the legitimacy of the Russian elections, which were held a few days ago in the occupied Crimea.
If you do recognize them this will play into the hands of the aggressor and encourage further repressions.
One more problem, which emanates from Russia's occupation of Crimea, is its intentions to deploy tactic nuclear weapons and means of delivery in the occupied peninsula.
This would destroy the global system of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and brutally violate Ukraine's non-nuclear status.
Moreover, Russia uses temporarily occupied Crimea for projecting its aggressive policies not only in Ukraine but also in other corners of the world, including in Syria where these policies go hand in hand with war crimes and crimes against humanity."	<urn:uuid:39206bf0-58b3-41a4-b78e-057592ef5fd7>	0.0

How do urban wetlands manage nitrogen pollution and affect air quality?	"Signed into law by President Bush on November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 enhanced existing programs and created new regulatory initiatives. Historically, the Clean Air Act addressed only major sources of air pollution and areas with severe air quality problems. Three elements of the 1990 Amendments however may have serious impact on smaller emission sources and small business, in general. These include Title I provisions designed to remedy chronic non-attainment (""dirty air"") areas, Title III prohibitions on the emissions of hazardous air pollutants, and the Title V operating permit program.
Title I Non-Attainment Provisions
Ozone pollution, also referred to as ""urban smog,"" is the most prevalent air quality problem today. It is caused by emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides associated primarily with urban areas and heavy industry. The 1990 Amendments redesignated the ozone non-attainment areas based upon the severity of the ozone pollution. The ""non-attainment"" designation means that levels of ozone in a particular geographic area exceed the federal standard. At the top of the list, with the worst ozone problem is Los Angeles, which is the only ""extreme"" ozone non-attainment area. Four other classifications of more general application consist of ""severe,"" ""serious,"" ""moderate,"" and ""marginal.""
The redesignation by severity of pollution was accompanied by a reduction in the amount of emissions that will subject a particular source to stringent new control requirements. Before the 1990 Amendments, only sources with potential to emit more than 100 tons per year of VOCs were affected by the non-attainment program requirements. Much smaller sources of VOC emissions are not included within the regulatory program. In ""moderate"" and ""serious"" non-attainment areas, facilities that emit 50 tons of VOCs will now be subject to emission controls. In ""severe"" areas, which include the Chicago metropolitan area, sources that emit 25 tons of VOCs per year will become regulated.
In the ""extreme"" non-attainment area of Los Angeles, sources that emit as little as 10 tons per year of VOCs will be included.
New sources that intend to locate in ozone non-attainment areas, and which emit VOCs in amounts exceeding specific thresholds, are subject to the most stringent requirements."	<urn:uuid:462735dc-6f11-4336-a66f-6a979e002e58>	0.0

I'm studying plant evolution and I'm curious about what makes mosses unique in their life cycle - what's the critical developmental change they need to complete their life cycle?	"When the cycle is charged, the charging voltage is 2.40-2.50V/ cell (the set value at 20℃) to carry out constant voltage charging. When the temperature is below 5C or above 35℃ for charging, the starting point is 20℃, and the charging voltage is adjusted to -4mV/cell for every change of 1 ℃.
The battery for electric scooter is the power source of electric vehicles, is the lead-acid power battery, lead-acid battery cost is low, cost-effective. Because this battery can be charged, can be used repeatedly, because it is impossible to charge in time in the process of riding an electric vehicle, often more than 60% of the depth of discharge, deep discharge, lead sulfate concentration increase, vulcanization will be quite serious.
It is also a large current discharge. The cruising current of a battery car at 20km is generally 4A, which is higher than the working current of the battery in other fields, and the working current of Overspeed and overloaded electric vehicles is even greater. Have carried out 1C charge 70%, 2C discharge 60% cycle life test, can reach the charge and discharge cycle 400 times life of a lot of batteries, but the actual use of the effect is far from the same.
This is because high current operation increases the discharge depth by 50%, which accelerates battery vulcanization. In addition, the battery life of three-wheeled electric vehicles is shorter, because its body is too heavy, the working current is more than 6A, and electric vehicles a year charge and discharge cycle more than 300 times is very common, short-term charging, because electric vehicles are vehicles, charging time is not much, to complete 36 volts or 48 volts within 8 hours of 20 Amperes charging, This must improve the charging voltage (generally for a single section of 2.7~2.9 volts) when the charging voltage exceeds the single battery oxygen evolution voltage (2.35 volts) or hydrogen evolution voltage (2.42 volts), the battery will be due to excessive oxygen evolution and open valve exhaust, resulting in water loss, increase the concentration of electrolyte, battery vulcanization aggravation, the service life will be short."	<urn:uuid:176c8573-ef1c-4c6a-b1b4-52f77f0a7dc7>	0.0

Schoenberg and other twelve-tone composers such as Alban Berg
and Anton von Webern carried this trend to its most extreme
form by abandoning tonality altogether, along with its
traditional conception of melody and harmony.
The Impressionists, including Debussy and Ravel,
sought new textures and turned their back on traditional forms,
while often retaining more traditional harmonic progressions.

What are the specific benefits that a developer gains from setting up an upstream branch in their daily coding workflow, and how does this relate to the fundamental concepts of version control?	"Many of the cis-regulatory motifs have been successfully identified by phylogenetic footprinting, which makes use of cross-species sequence conservation as a functional signature [2–6]. Based on this rationalization, we aimed to test if the complexity of transcriptional regulation depends on gene function, by looking at the sequence conservation at the proximal upstream region. This is the first whole genome study providing statistical evidence of significant conservation in upstream regions of human genes involved in certain biological processes and functions.
There have been studies on how gene function is related to degree of conservation and evolutionary rate in the protein-coding region. For example, Clark et al.  detected functional categories that showed accelerated evolution of the protein-coding region in human compared to chimp, based on site-specific dN/dS ratios. The functional categories include 'olfaction', 'signal transduction', 'cell adhesion', 'transport', 'developmental processes', 'ion channel' and 'extracellular matrix'. In , Dorus et al. reported that the protein coding regions of the genes linked to nervous system development show positive selection in the primate lineage compared to rodents, by using housekeeping genes as a control. Bustamante et al.  compared within-species polymorphism and between-species divergence to detect positively and negatively selected human genes. Functional categories with an excess of positively selected genes included 'sensory perception', 'defence/immunity protein' and in particular, 'transcription factor'. Some discrepancy exists among studies, since  detected 'ectoderm development', 'extracellular matrix' and 'voltage-gated potassium channel' as categories with an excess of negatively selected genes.
Little is known about how the proximal upstream regions evolve in those genes that are detected to be positively selected, even though it is an interesting question whether the noncoding regulatory regions will show a similar pattern as the coding regions. Interestingly, we detected a significantly higher upstream conservation in these adaptive genes, particularly those involved in development, cell communication, signal transduction, transcription factor and neurophysiological functions. One possibility is that there is opposite purifying selection on the upstream regulatory region and the protein-coding region. The other possibility is that a relatively high regulatory complexity exists in these genes and that their dense cis-regulatory elements provide higher promoter conservation. We speculate that the latter explanation is biologically more intuitive. According to , a complex network can rapidly achieve the ability to buffer mutations."	<urn:uuid:6ca40d73-2939-4668-b585-d1936fa8dc0a>	0.0
How do little tunnels made by worms in the ground help plants and the soil?	"One of the best companion plants for peppers is marigolds. These easy-to-grow flowers attract bumblebees, which are useful for pollination. They also serve as an effective barrier against the wind, preventing pepper plants from toppling over. Similarly, French marigolds are reputed to boost the flavor of peppers, while attracting pollinators to increase their yields.
Although it’s a good idea to plant cowpeas next to peppers, they may be incompatible. Cowpeas tend to attract Green Stink Bugs, which prefers hot pepper plants to other plants. While cowpeas may be beneficial, you’ll need to wait two years before you can plant them next to peppers. Another great companion plant is lettuce, which is unobtrusive in the garden and won’t compete with the pepper’s deeper roots. Additionally, lettuce will shade the ground surrounding pepper plants, which will prevent weeds from growing.
What Are Companion Plants?
Companion planting is an effective method to grow vegetables and other types of plants in close proximity to peppers. These plants will increase the health and yields of your pepper plants while at the same time attracting beneficial insects and pollinators to the garden. Peppers are sensitive to pests and diseases, so choosing companion plants that are not a threat to the pepper plant will ensure a healthy crop and less damage to your plants.
In the garden, lettuce, and spinach are excellent companions for peppers. These plants do not compete for nutrients and reduce weeds around pepper plants. The lettuce also helps peppers retain moisture and reduces the amount of shade that they receive. Tomatoes and peppers are part of the nightshade family, so avoiding plants in the Brassica family will prevent peppers from thriving. Lastly, peppers benefit from the shade of herbs.
Peppers thrive in moist soil, so pairing them with a variety of plants that benefit the soil and the peppers will help to prevent insect pests. Companion plants will also help to prevent dry summers. Some plants are ideal for this purpose: they will protect the pepper from slugs and cabbage worms, while other plants will help peppers to produce high-quality fruits and vegetables.
Best Companion Plants For Peppers
Among the many companion plants for peppers, basil and parsley are excellent choices. They help trap aphids and encourage predators. These are some of the best companion plants for peppers.

As a maritime archaeologist studying recovery techniques through history, I'm curious how the excavation approaches differed between the Antikythera wreck and the Mary Rose - what can we learn about the artifacts and human remains recovered from each?	"The training provided in this course and the experience you can acquire can be of importance in your future if you are thinking about archaeology in a professional level.
If you are thinking for the first time to be a volunteer in an archaeology field school, this course could be right for you. This program accommodates participants with or without previous experience.
You can learn from the beginning excavation techniques and methodology. During the excavation you will find archaeological remains from the classical period including Roman pottery, amphorae, glass, etc. that you will learn how to identify in the laboratory.
The comprehensive experience that you will gain in this course will help you to decide if you want to pursue archaeology in university or as a profession
Previous knowledge or experience in archaeology or computer systems is not required.
Field School life & language
The fieldwork focuses on Classical archaeology, and specifically on Roman archaeology.
On a normal working day at the Field School, students wake up in the morning and have breakfast at the students' residence before the staff members pick them up with the vans. Then we take a ride to the North of the island to get to the beautiful port of Sanitja, where the Roman city of Sanisera is located. Once there, students devote 4 hours to fieldwork, where they learn proper excavation techniques to improve their skills, while they dig in different buildings in an area of the city very close to the sea.
During fieldwork students recover the materials located in the rooms and other contexts, including tons of Roman ceramics such as amphorae and fine wares, glass wares, faunal remains and metal pieces such as adornments, tools and coins.
After fieldwork we go to the Sanisera Archaeology Institute, where students have a sandwich break to get some energy back! Our center holds the laboratories, where students work with the Roman pottery found on site. The main aim is to wash, label, classify and prepare the materials' inventories. Also students are given lectures on Roman pottery typologies (both for amphorae and fine wares), History of the site, archaeological practice and methodology and Classical History in the Western Mediterranean.
Digging at the Roman city of Sanisera is a first-hand experience to get an insight on the Classical world in a Mediterranean island.
It runs 7 hours a day, and is divided between excavation, lab work, exercises and lectures. For every seven course days, there are two days off."	<urn:uuid:b44bda63-800a-4c6b-a70e-d93f74047571>	0.0

How did John Cassavetes and Andrei Tarkovsky approach working with studios?	"A rapist is stalking the quiet streets of Galen. The town doctor (John Cassavetes) and sheriff (John Ireland) are horrified by the vicious crimes and perplexed by the strange evidence left at the crime scenes. The doctor discovers the attacks only occur when Tim, his daughter’s boyfriend, has nightmares. Is Tim responsible, or is there a more sinister force at work?
A word of warning to slasher fans. The rape scenes in The Incubus aren’t designed for cheap titillation like those found in a Troma film. These rapes are brutal. The screams of the actresses portraying victims makes the scenes even more realistic and disturbing. If such imagery angers you, then look elsewhere for your slasher thrills.
John Cassavetes is miscast as a small town doctor. His bedside manner includes yelling and slapping patients. It doesn’t matter how traumatized a patient is because he gives them all the same diagnosis, “You’ll be alright.” Still, Cassavetes is the best actor in the cast. Ireland just stands around looking helpless.
John Hough’s direction is the spark that makes The Incubus shine. Camera angles get stranger as the plot grows weirder. Writer George Franklin throws in a wicked twist ending, but fills the story with unresolved subplots and stale dialog. An incestuous relationship between doctor and daughter, the doc’s involvement in a lover’s death, and witchcraft are just a few of the open ended storylines. We never learn how the killer picks victims, either.
Even though The Incubus has a number of suspenseful moments and a crazy yet entertaining star, the brutality of the rape scenes make it a difficult film to watch. The film’s final blood drenched image carries the emotional impact of a punch to the stomach.

mental health trans youth empowerment barriers outcomes	"The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned about the potential negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the mental well-being of health and social care professionals. Symptoms of mental health problems commonly include depression, anxiety, stress, and additional cognitive and social problems; these can impact on function in the workplace. The mental health and resilience (ability to cope with the negative effects of stress) of frontline health and social care professionals ('frontline workers' in this review) could be supported during disease epidemics by workplace interventions, interventions to support basic daily needs, psychological support interventions, pharmacological interventions, or a combination of any or all of these.
Objective 1: to assess the effects of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic.
Objective 2: to identify barriers and facilitators that may impact on the implementation of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic.
On 28 May 2020 we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus databases and WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing. We also searched ongoing trials registers and Google Scholar. We ran all searches from the year 2002 onwards, with no language restrictions.
We included studies in which participants were health and social care professionals working at the front line during infectious disease outbreaks, categorised as epidemics or pandemics by WHO, from 2002 onwards. For objective 1 we included quantitative evidence from randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series studies, which investigated the effect of any intervention to support mental health or resilience, compared to no intervention, standard care, placebo or attention control intervention, or other active interventions. For objective 2 we included qualitative evidence from studies that described barriers and facilitators to the implementation of interventions. Outcomes critical to this review were general mental health and resilience. Additional outcomes included psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression or stress; burnout; other mental health disorders; workplace staffing; and adverse events arising from interventions.
Pairs of review authors independently applied selection criteria to abstracts and full papers, with disagreements resolved through discussion. One review author systematically extracted data, cross-checked by a second review author."	<urn:uuid:dad4d730-5454-4d16-9410-79aba24b3fc5>	0.0
I'm curious about how companies measure if they have a good workplace environment - what are some concrete ways they track this?	"With organized retail in India pegged at Rs 25,000 crore (Rs 250 billion) -- out of a total of Rs 800,000 crore (Rs 8,000 billion -- and a double digit growth rate, marketing companies are setting up shops to provide differentiated services to clients. Till now sales people were the link between the retailer and the producer. But sales personnel are busy selling a product and do not have a fair idea of what retailing is about. The focus is to prioritise retail. That is, not only to sell a product to a consumer but to get the consumer to interact with the product. Gone are the days when retailing meant mere availability of a product. With competition becoming stiffer companies are looking at 'experiential' marketing. Also the lack of proper metrics to measure marketing spends is a serious issue.
In today's swiftly changing business environment, there is no option but to be in the know - to be constantly on the move, keeping tabs on the shifting trends in the market place and maneuvering your strategy to stay on top. The retail arena today is very different - the opportunities are incredible but exploiting them is extremely tough.
Super smart shoppers know all the rules of the game. They can instantly sense a good buy and lap it up or sniff out a bad product and dismiss it. Their expectations are tough to meet but for retailers aiming to make a big sale, there is not much of a choice but to find ways to win customers over and keep them permanently happy.
In an environment, which is still restrictive in many ways and lacks adequate infrastructure, this becomes a formidable task. So how are Indian retailers coping up and how long will it be before organized retail becomes the primary way of selling.

I mean, it's their job to protect your information.

That's a good one too. I mean, we've , we've talked about on some different podcasts, but the word ghost prepared or scary for a reason, you know, and though those ghost preparers are those that are doing a return, not signing it, I'm not going through SciTech to get registered things of that nature.

Could you explain in detail how the fact section of a case brief should be structured and what specific categories of legally relevant information need to be included?	"The SMART Goal-Setting Process
One of the most powerful methods of motivation is goal setting. The SMART method helps you set goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound. Management systems, such as management by objectives, incorporate goal-setting basics into the entire system.
Dr. Edwin Locke pioneered goal-setting research in the 1960s. Locke suggested that working toward a goal provided inherent motivation to reach that same goal. He also showed that employees are motivated by a combination of clear goals and specific, helpful, appropriate feedback. In 1990, Locke and Dr. Gary Latham published “A Theory of Goal Setting and Task Performance,” their seminal work, which reinforced the need for specific and difficult goals.
Your objectives usually fall into one of four categories: process, impact, outcome and personal. Process objectives describe who will participate, their interactions and activities. Impact focuses on the longer-term impact of your work. The RapidBI website reports that outcome objectives “let you know how you will change attitudes, knowledge and (short-term) behavior."" Personal objectives are used to measure and compare individual performance.
The SMART criteria require goals to be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound. Specificity keeps your goals straightforward, well defined and detailed. Making measurable goals prevents ambiguous statements such as “make new contacts” and replaces them with “talk to five new people each day.” Make sure your goals are reachable, since impossible goals simply set you up for failure. According to RapidBI, realistic goals don’t need to be easy--instead, they should be hard, but something toward which you are willing and able to work. Time-bound goals keep your work structured and add a sense of urgency to push you into action.
SmartER goals rely on some additional criteria including extending, exciting, rewarding and recorded. The goal should extend your abilities to keep it from seeming boring and purposeless. Exciting goals are most likely to be accomplished since they create a greater desire to do the work. According to RapidBI, for a goal to be rewarding, you should know what it will mean to you and what your outcome will be upon completion. You should record your objective and progress to increase your chances of completing the goal.
Steps for Businesses
The Management Skills Advisor website offers the following seven steps for successful SMART goal-setting in your business. First, explain what SMART goals are, including their purpose and the benefits."	<urn:uuid:91c383f1-404d-4497-8cf0-3f9403911616>	0.0

Being an expert in bridge architecture, I'm wondering how do the total lengths of the Burlington-Bristol Bridge and the Veterans Memorial Bridge compare to each other?	"Newcastle Memorial Walk wins Australian Engineering Excellence Award
Northrop Consulting Engineers are proud to announce that the Newcastle Memorial Walk project not only won the best project award in the Engineers Australia Newcastle Division Excellence Awards but has now also won a 2016 National Award for Engineering Excellence at the Australian Engineering Excellence Awards.
The Australian Engineering Excellence Awards (AEEA) recognised the industry’s most innovative and outstanding projects and people of 2016 at a gala ceremony in Brisbane.
Engineers Australia’s CEO Stephen Durkin said the awards were a wonderful opportunity to acknowledge the significant contribution engineers make to the community.
“The nominees represent Australia’s innovative and talented engineering sector.”
Each year the National Excellence Awards Judging Panel considers the nominating project winners of Division and Society Awards for an Australian Engineering Excellence Award. As Award winners in their own right, these finalists represent the very best of engineering with the national judging panel seeking to identify those unique finalists that demonstrate outstanding excellence, innovation and best practice.
ABOUT THE PROJECT
The Memorial Walk in Newcastle provides a key link between Bar Beach and Strzelecki for pedestrian traffic whilst providing amazing views of the ocean to the East and Newcastle City to the West. Opened on Anzac Day 2015, the walk also pays homage to the Anzac Spirit and servicemen from the Hunter Region that fought in the First World War, and functions as both a tourist attraction and permanent war memorial.
Integrated into the walk is 160m of suspended footbridge, floating up to 10m above adjacent ground level. Curved stainless steel trusses form both the main structural elements of the bridge as well as represent the DNA of the soldiers that fought in World War 1, as it is DNA testing which is currently being used to identify soldiers that never made it home.
Northrop Consulting Engineers developed the design of the bridge in conjunction with EJE Architecture. As the structure of the project is the key aesthetic focal point for the project, the structural components serve both loadbearing and sculptural functions.
The bridge floats above the Strzelecki cliffs, which are approximately 80m above the adjacent beach. Hence, site constraints and constructability considerations added further complications to the structural design of the bridge, with off-site construction a must from both a staging and WHS perspective. The fabricated stainless steel bridge sections and precast concrete columns were chosen as the primary structural elements as these materials allow for the strict quality control required whilst limiting dangerous site works."	<urn:uuid:b1efaea0-54ae-407c-ac0b-73f927409bb0>	0.0
mortality timeline ash trees younger than ten years infected with chalara	"Emerald Ash Borer Response Plan. Emerald Ash Borer (EAB), an invasive beetle that kills all species of ash trees, has been confirmed in Story County. With EAB confirmed in nearby communities, the future for ash trees looks uncertain. To be prepared for the arrival and to slow the spread of this destructive insect, the City of Ames is pursuing an Emerald Ash Borer Response Plan that balances public safety with a commitment to replanting trees on public land.
There are more than 2,300 public ash trees in City right-of-way, in maintained areas of City parks (including along paved trails), and at City-owned facilities. Ash trees represent 16 percent of all public trees in Ames, which is higher than the 10 percent recommended for optimum diversity. Map of Ash Trees on Public Property
The Ames City Council approved the EAB Response Plan to extend the environmental, social, and economic benefits of ash trees, and to increase the diversity of the urban forest, while being fiscally responsible to Ames citizens. The plan pursues a phased treatment and removal process for public ash trees. In the first five years, a predetermined number of ash trees would be removed based on public safety, tree defects, size, and costs. The annual removal process would spread costs over a longer time period, allow staff to reevaluate the plan regularly, and limit the visual impact on streets lined with ash trees. Some ash trees will be treated, but only to keep EAB from killing the tree before it can be removed.
Although EAB will have a major detrimental impact on our community over the next several years, this challenge also presents Ames with an unexpected opportunity to bring greater diversity to the public trees in our urban forest. Through the one-to-one replacement program, a variety of saplings will be planted at a size of 1-1/2 inch, which is optimal for establishment and survival of new trees. Since most tree removals will occur during the winter, there will be a time gap between removals and the replanting of new trees. Care and Watering Guidelines for Newly-Planted Trees
What is Emerald Ash Borer? EAB is native to Asia and was likely introduced into North America via cargo ships or planes. The beetle is bright metallic green in color and is visible to the naked eye, but small—about the size of Abraham Lincoln’s head on a penny."	<urn:uuid:4fa7ef4c-4eae-4063-8f4e-2833708aaaff>	0.0
What benefits do companies see when workers are more engaged?	"As CFOs are well aware, employment laws seem to favor workers against their employers, and they often cost firms money. But that’s not always the case.
COBRA (Health Insurance Continuation)
When the feds created those new model COBRA notices to account for the Obamacare exchanges, they also included some other key info — info that was easy to miss on first read.
Fact: Benefits are surpassing salaries as the most important perk to employees. But did these companies step out of line to enforce their benefits policies?
Here’s a compelling reason to review your ACA compliance efforts ASAP: If your firm slips up on any of the details, it could cost you big-time.
You never like to see a finance staffer leave (OK, maybe not never), but you certainly don’t want your top performer to say sayonara to your department. There may be good reason to be worried:
Granted, a generous severance package is probably the best way to give departing staffers some peace of mind when layoffs take place. But when that isn’t an option, there are other things you can do.
Companies are still waiting for answers on what will and won’t trigger Obamcare’s so-called Cadillac Tax.
After a series of extensions, it looks like the federal COBRA premium subsidy program will come to an end on Aug. 31 – unless some last-minute extension is passed.
Year-end will be here before you know it. So if Payroll has made any COBRA subsidy payments, you’ll want to make sure they’ve claimed credit on Form 941.
The latest move by the IRS suggests an increase in audits of employers’ COBRA procedures may be on tap in the very near future.
Due to the insurance exchanges created by the health reform law, the DOL felt the current model COBRA notices needed a makeover. And the changes it made could have a distinct benefit for Finance.
Still got some questions about what it is you are (and aren’t) required to report on workers’ W-2s under health reform? You’re not alone.
If you were planning on sending workers out onto the insurance exchanges with a lump-sum of cash for premium costs, you’ll want to read the feds’ latest warning.
Tax Day brought more than long post office lines — it also brought two more months of unemployment benefits to many people. And a new to-do list for Finance.

How do American and European approaches to Varroa control differ?	"European, American school systems differ in more ways than one
May 15, 2023
Perspective from an exchange student
by Julia Vesterland, reporter
The American and European education systems are much opposites. The outcomes differ in other countries due to different educational programs and instructional styles. While there are many similarities, there are also significant differences.
“I like that they (Europe) have fewer multiple-choice questions. I believe that’s better because it gives the students a chance to show what they know, even if it might not necessarily be the answer to that question you can give them some credit for what they know. It’s also about learning how to express yourself, you need to be able to do that rather than just pick a, b, c, or d,” said English and Film and Literature teacher Catherine Coleman.
For example; time management is very different between the States and Europe. In the States, the average school days are 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. with four six minutes between the classes. Whereas in Europe the school days are 8 a.m. to 4-6 p.m. with 10-15 minutes between classes.
“I think it’s important for the students to have a break between the classes. It gives them time to use the bathroom and relax before their next class,” said history teacher at Nyköpings Gymnasium Chris Jansson.
Unlike the United States, Europe usually doesn’t have any school clubs, sports or marching bands. Arts and sports help students develop important skills such as creativity, teamwork and problem-solving that are not always taught in academic classes.
The European school system emphasizes specialization and career preparation, which can be beneficial for students who have a clear idea of what they want to do after graduation. The students choose their course in grade nine and in grade 11, they choose a more specific major. Students can change their major but in most cases, they have to start over from grade 10 if they do.
“Choosing your major at 15 years old can be limiting, as students may not have had the opportunity to explore all of their interests yet. Students’ goals in life can change over time, so it’s important to have the flexibility to change course if needed,” Jansson said.
Both the American and European school systems have their strengths and weaknesses. The best system in either place is one that meets the needs of individual students and prepares them for success in their chosen career path."	<urn:uuid:d801f4d4-7478-46b8-ab2f-20d39a9775b5>	0.0

How did historical German flutes vary in their pitch levels, and what were the efforts made to standardize musical pitch across different regions?	"It’s undeniable that the way your voice sounds has a lot to do with how you come across.
As reported in the Wall Street Journal, people who hear recordings of rough, weak, or strained voices tend to label the speakers as negative, weak or tense. While people with strong voices are described as successful, sociable and smart.
Whether you’re speaking one-on-one, in a meeting or presenting on the big stage, here are 3 tips to help boost connection and credibility with your voice:
Changing your vocal habits is hard—but the good news is, you can change them!
Whip out your smartphone and use an app like Voice Memos to record your next pitch. Then, self-diagnose. Did you vary the pitch? Do you sound energized? Are you remembering to pause?
Blending connection and credibility through your voice is magnetizing. The more you give, the better others will perceive you as a leader."	<urn:uuid:d42734bb-fe3a-4914-ac01-a8ab0e83d11f>	0.0
What kind of legacy have the greatest Cincinnati Reds players left behind in terms of retired numbers and hall of fame recognition?	"As a sports fan, it’s common practice to say you’re team is THE WORST. But when I said that about the Cincinnati Reds 2016 pitching, I may have been right. Let’s start with FiveThirtyEight.com who pointed out in mid-September that the Reds’ pitching might be the worst of all time:
But it’s also symptomatic of a pitching staff that is, by another measure, the worst ever — and the only one in history that would have been better off being stocked with replacement-level players instead.
A day later, the Ringer offers Understanding the Plight of Cincinnati’s Historically Awful Starting Pitching Staff:
Even more troublingly, Reds pitchers have combined for negative 1.1 wins above replacement this season. The 1890 Pittsburgh Alleghenys — a team that went 23–113, finished 66.5 games out of first place, and featured a veteran pitcher named Phenomenal Smith — were the last team with a staff below replacement level over a full season.
The day after the season ended, FanGraphs proclaims The Reds Actually Did It:
To be absolutely clear about what we have here: By our numbers, the Reds just became the first pitching staff in modern history to finish with a negative WAR. It’s only slight, sure, and the difference between them and those 1915 Athletics is less than one win, but that negative symbol is conspicuous. It pushes the digits over to the right, so they can stand out. The Reds, as a collective, featured a major-league pitching staff that was a worse-than-replacement-level pitching staff. That’s almost unfathomable, is what that is.
Yeah, but what would Bill James say?
I didn’t do this to pick on the 2016 Cincinnati Reds; I was just doing the Reds as I was doing every team. Also, it should be noted that in a hitter’s year, in a hitter’s era, the numbers go up. If you’re 10% worse than league in 1930, that’s more runs than if you’re 10% worse than league in 1968. But the study concluded that the worst pure-pitching stats of all time by far belonged to the 2016 Cincinnati Reds.
So there you have it. The 2016 Reds pitching was THE WORST."	<urn:uuid:de5beefa-03cf-4203-8297-9b735d390eb0>	0.0

ships World War 2 launch date Pacific service	"""I think if the standards are going to be tougher, there should be more time to do PT,"" said Staff Sgt. Marc Taggart, 27, an 86th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron avionics specialist from Tucson, Ariz.
Airman 1st Class Michael Yee, 23, a C-130 crew chief, thinks the Air Force should still give airmen time during the duty day to work out, but it should be a balance of unit PT and individual exercise.
""You should be fit all year round, I do agree with that,"" he said. But the one-workout-fits-all group mentality of unit PT isn't always beneficial for airmen, he said.
The tougher proposed standards include testing airmen twice a year - instead of once - and giving commanders the authority to boot an airman from the service for two consecutive PT test failures. Right now, a discharge isn't considered until an airman has four PT failures in a year.
""I think that is a pretty significant impact,"" said Maj. Alex Garcia, U.S. Air Forces in Europe fitness program consultant. ""I think in the past folks thought if I fail a couple of times then I would get serious.""
Some trials of the new standards at Air Force bases have indicated the failure rate could skyrocket.

how matter velocity affect primordial star formation	"By observing the velocity trajectories, it can be concluded that the velocity of each follower is time-varying periodically, which can achieve the desired velocity trajectory. Also, the velocity of virtual leader can tend to zero, which accords to the modes of the leader (1). The position trajectory within t = 20 s of the UAV swarm system is shown in Figure 6; one can see that three followers can achieve the given time-varying formation when tracking the leader. The position snapshots of the four UAVs are shown in Figure 7, where the UAVs are represented by a circle, plus sign, triangle, and square respectively. Figure 7(a) depicts the process of forming a given formation in 1–7 s. It can be see that the followers approach the leader from all directions, and the leader stabilizes at one point eventually. Figures 7(b) and 7(c) further show the change of UAVs position within one period . From Figures 7(b) and 7(c), it can be obtained that the formation is time-varying and the follower moves around the leader periodically. Therefore, the effectiveness of the time-varying formation tracking control scheme is validated for the UAV swarm systems (1) and (3) with the actuator faults and switching topologies.
If the control protocol is designed without considering the actuator faults, it can be given as follows:
In order to validate the ability of handling faults of the proposed method, comparison simulations are performed for the abovementioned described quadrotor UAVs system with the proposed control protocol (7) and control protocol (29), respectively. The position error curves and the velocity error curves in the X and Y directions are shown in Figures 8 and 9, respectively. In Figures 8 and 9, the solid lines are obtained by using the proposed control protocol (7) in Theorem 1, and dashed lines are obtained by using the control protocol (29). From the simulation results, it is easy to see that the formation tracking performance is good with the proposed control method, while the formation tracking performance cannot be achieved with the control protocol (29) because it does not have the ability to deal with the actuator faults. Therefore, the effectiveness of the control method in this paper is validated.
The fault-tolerant time-varying formation tracking control for the UAV swarm systems with actuator faults and the switching topologies is studied."	<urn:uuid:5d233518-7929-4e3a-b80f-78b7e14e9954>	0.0
As someone interested in both ghost stories and inclusive theater, I'd love to know how modern theaters balance creating scary atmospheres while ensuring everyone can access the full experience. How do they manage both aspects?	"OpenCity Projects is a creative lab that explores the role of public space in designing more vibrant and inclusive cities. We believe that when diverse people mix and interact in urban environments, it creates more tolerant and peaceful places to live.

We are looking for our next editor. Continue reading
Most urban planners and city leaders agree that diversity is key to creating healthy, inclusive communities but this rarely translates to the day-to-day living experience. We at OpenCity have spent the last seven years learning about what motivates people to spend time in a place and connect with others. We turned our attention to existing public spaces, that have evolved organically, and found some great examples in Toronto. Scadding Court is one of those unique and inclusive spaces in the city that welcomes and connects a diverse group of citizens.
How do we Design for Diversity? We here at OpenCity have spent the last seven years learning about what motivates diverse people to spend time in a place and connect with others. In sharing our research findings in this emerging field, we aim to inspire others to design more inclusive places for culturally diverse communities. For us Design for Diversity is a new way of viewing, planning and designing public space.
Over the summer we launched a nine-point Manifesto, developed a framework and posted a series of blog posts sharing stories and ideas that unpack the Design for Diversity principles and explore how to apply them to the design process. The Design for Diversity Tool Kit, an aide for City builders interested in planning for culturally diverse communities, will be launching soon! Continue reading
Since 2006, OpenCity Projects has showcased how excellent public spaces and urban design help make our cities more beautiful, diverse, sustainable, and inclusive.
We have often looked to Toronto for inspiration. It’s a city of newcomers, where immigration is embraced and where almost 50% of its population have been born outside Canada. Here we’ve seen that when people mix together and integrate well with each other and their spaces everyone can live and grow together, peacefully.
Here at OpenCity, we’re always looking for new contributors to cover unique urban experiences in cities around the world. Opportunities are available for both monthly and one-time writing contributions.
We’re also very interested in the potential to share and understand urban experiences through online multimedia."	<urn:uuid:5f6bb00b-262a-4db8-903a-616ada8cda86>	0.0

im new archer need know main differences beginner bow easy hard maintain	"but overall its a great violin for beginners and children...
I have been playing this violin for about a month now and it is great for the price you pay. You need to tune her a lot, but that is just another skill you get to practice. I would definitely recommend this product, it is a steal. PS - I would get a tuner app for your smart phone as well because the tuner that comes with it can be weird at times, I tend to use both at the same time to get an idea of how it is going.
I know nothing about violins, but my son is picking it up, practicing nonstop, and the instrument has served him well. I definitely recommend this for a beginner, sounds good, well made.
I like the violin very much. It's cheap, but it works well for me when I'm a beginner. The sound is nice, too.
I liked it. Very quality
I ordered this violin for my boy, he just starts learning violin for a month. He loves it! It comes with a case which easy to carry. Very reasonable price, if you are looking for violin for beginner that is the one you should get.
I play guitar and have always wanted to try my hand at cello but decided to check out the violin first, after doing a little research I made of list of everything I'll need and this package checked it all off and then some. Before we even get to the violin I have to brag on the case, if I found a guitar version of this case I would gladly pay twice what this entire package cost just for that because it is a nice case, everything from the smooth interior to the magnets to the compartments is a great touch. I had to do a little sleuthing to figure out how to set this guy up and it was pretty easy, the bridge stays on via tension and I recommend using the smaller tuning legs bear the bridge rather than the ones at the other end, the other thing I'll mention is that a bow will not make noise across violin strings without rosin so make sure you add it, simply drag something across the surface of the rosin block to scrape up some dust and then take your bow across the block repeatedly."	<urn:uuid:5ba8c707-41a4-48cf-aaad-db55e6b5fb65>	0.0
When to plant ryegrass and what are its health risks?	"Chromosomal rearrangements differentiating the ryegrass genome from the Triticeae, oat, and rice genomes using common heterologous RFLP probes

An restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based genetic map of ryegrass (Lolium) was constructed for comparative mapping with other Poaceae species using heterologous anchor probes. The genetic map contained 120 RFLP markers from cDNA clones of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), and rice (Oryza sativa L.), covering 664 cM on seven linkage groups (LGs). The genome comparisons of ryegrass relative to the Triticeae, oat, and rice extended the syntenic relationships among the species. Seven ryegrass linkage groups were represented by 10 syntenic segments of Triticeae chromosomes, 12 syntenic segments of oat chromosomes, or 16 syntenic segments of rice chromosomes, suggesting that the ryegrass genome has a high degree of genome conservation relative to the Triticeae, oat, and rice. Furthermore, we found ten large-scale chromosomal rearrangements that characterize the ryegrass genome. In detail, a chromosomal rearrangement was observed on ryegrass LG4 relative to the Triticeae, four rearrangements on ryegrass LGs2, 4, 5, and 6 relative to oat, and five rearrangements on ryegrass LGs1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 relative to rice. Of these, seven chromosomal rearrangements are reported for the first time in this study. The extended comparative relationships reported in this study facilitate the transfer of genetic knowledge from well-studied major cereal crops to ryegrass."	<urn:uuid:0c8c78e3-6588-4f23-8d36-ade20dfc1180>	0.0
How do companies fake environmental claims and who checks their truthfulness?	"Viet Tan has questioned the efficacy of the government’s COVID-19 measures and the truthfulness of its COVID-19 reporting, and it has amplified suggestions that China is ultimately responsible for the spread of the pandemic. Viet Tan is a frequent critic of the regime, and long before the Amnesty International report, it spoke out against Facebook’s alleged complicity in taking down dissident voices. The Vietnamese government considers Viet Tan a terrorist organization, stemming from its origins as a violent revolutionary organization based in the United States.
Although it is suppressed within the country, Viet Tan continues to serve as an outlet and mouthpiece for dissident voices operating both within and outside of Vietnam, many of whom rely on Facebook and other social media platforms to get their messages out. Facebook’s latest act of cooperation with the government comes at a key moment in the country: the 2021 elections. In January, the Communist Party of Vietnam will hold its the 13th National Congress, and the National Assembly will hold its elections in May. Vietnam holds direct elections for its National Assembly, but the top positions in government are elected by the legislative body, not citizens. Those top four leadership positions, “the four pillars,” are the party secretary general, the state president, the prime minister, and the chairperson of the national assembly. Vietnam is no stranger to restricting free expression ahead of elections, and so this clampdown of COVID-19 “fake news” appears to be perfectly timed.
Key to these suppression is the April 15 decree outlawing fake news. In addition to banning COVID-19 related misinformation, it restricts all social media posts that share banned books and publications, documents deemed to be state secrets, or even maps and charts failing to show the Vietnamese claims in the South China Sea. The crackdown on COVID-19 fake news and Vietnam’s use of nationalism to unite the country against the virus have been the primary focus of much of the media attention surrounding this decree. But the broad terms by which “fake news” is being defined “provides yet another potent weapon in the Vietnamese authorities’ arsenal of online repression,” Tanya O’Carroll, director of tech at Amnesty International, told Reuters.
With a public health crisis as an excuse, the Vietnamese government is maintaining its suppression of dissident speech."	<urn:uuid:5d29ec7f-8871-4a36-afae-36d4a22d608b>	0.0

What makes Saturn physically unique among planets, and what interesting features does its largest moon Titan possess compared to other celestial bodies?	"Extract majestic document:
Relationships with extraterrestrial men presents no basically new problem from the standpoint of international law; but the possibility of confronting intelligent beings that do not belong to the human race would bring up problems whose solution it is difficult to conceive. In principle, there is no difficulty in accepting the possibility of coming to an understanding with them, and of establishing all kinds of relationships.
If these intelligent beings were in possession of a more or less culture, and a more or less perfect political organization, they would have an absolute right to be recognized as independent and sovereign peoples. Another possibility may exist, that a species of Homo sapiens might have established themselves as an independent nation on another celestial body in our solar system and evolved culturally independently from ours. Living conditions on these bodies let’s say the moon,-or the planet Mars, would have to be such as to permit a stable, and to a certain extent, independent life, from an economic standpoint.
Hypothetically other planets may have life forms. Water has been found on our Moon and Mars that can be separated into hydrogen and oxygen, using an electric current or the short wave radiation of the sun. The oxygen could be used for breathing purposes; the hydrogen night be used as a fuel. There is indication that the inhabitants of celestial bodies, or extraterrestrial biological entitle (EBE) desire to settle here.
1. If they are politically organized and possess a certain culture similar to our own, they may be recognized as an independent people.
2. If they consider our culture to be devoid of political unity, they would have the right to colonize. Of course, this colonization cannot be conducted on classic lines. A superior form of colonizing will have to be conceived, that could be a kind of tutelage, possibly through the tacit approval of the United Nations.
We cannot exclude the possibility that a race of extraterrestrial people more advanced technologically and economically may take upon itself the right to occupy another celestial body.
The division of a celestial body into zones and the distribution of them among other celestial states. A moral entity? The most feasible solution it seem would be this one, submit an agreement providing for the peaceful absorption of a celestial race(s) in such a manner that our culture would remain intact with guarantees that their presence not be revealed. It would merely be a matter of internationalizing celestial peoples, and creating an international treaty instrument."	<urn:uuid:31edbed7-8665-4cfb-b720-28205415ac6d>	0.0
whitey lockman babe ruth baseball career difference	"|# 80 Babe Ruth|
The 1933 World Wide Gum baseball cards were printed in two different variations: English only and French and English. Today, the French and English versions are slightly more expensive than the English only cards. The Goudey Gum Company was located in Boston, so at their peak of gum card manufacturing, they opened a factory in Granby, Quebec. Because World Wide Gum printed both English as well as English and French, it is suspected that these cards were sold in different parts of Canada based on local language preferences.

I run an after-school program focusing on STEM education and want to combine music-making with safety education. How can we integrate mathematical concepts into instrument creation while ensuring proper safety protocols for different age groups?	"Most programs between cost $5 to $25 to attend, and to rent the entire observatory, complete with docents to help operate the telescopes and provide educational information, costs only $165. The low cost allows many different groups to rent the observatory for their own event or class, including Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts, school groups, families, groups of campers visiting Sugarloaf, neighborhood groups, and even weddings.
“Much of our money comes from people paying their five bucks at the door,” says Cable. “We’re going to work to balance out the sources of revenue to those beyond simply revenues from our program fees. Today, we’re putting together a corporate sponsorship program together, we’d love to put an adopt-a-school program together that would allow local businesses and corporations to sponsor their local elementary, middle or high school to receive our programs and services. But right now it’s admission fees, for the most part, that fund the observatory.”
Since RFO hired an executive director, future strategic planning can continue in earnest. The organization has several goals, including creating and nurturing partnerships with universities, schools, and nonprofits, and providing more STEM education to North Bay residents and beyond; pursuing public, private and higher education research opportunities; and establishing high school and university student mentoring programs. They also plan to upgrade and update equipment and facilities; expand and diversify their board of directors; and enhance docent development recruitment and programs offered.
“We’re actively engaged in developing our board right now, getting additional members, diversifying and spreading the workload, creating standing committees, and recruiting members to serve on those committees to keep us moving,” says Cable. “One of those committees is a fund development committee, and we’re looking at writing larger federal and foundational grants. We’re going to write proposals to local and regional corporations who support STEM education and think that what we’re doing is important and are willing to support it.”
The Robert Ferguson Observatory is well positioned to reach the next level in research, education and collaboration with schools, businesses, other organizations, and the public. The knowledge of the cosmos gleaned at the observatory will very likely benefit future humanity. For them, the sky is not the limit. It is only the beginning.

how does romantic imagination compare objective realism proust work perspective	"Use SMART Objectives to Focus Goals, Plans and Performance
By Susan Berry & Randy Thomas, Ph.D. | minute read
What's so smart about SMART? Why has this acronym become part of the vocabulary of project planning and performance management?
Objectives that are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Aligned, Realistic/Relevant, and Time-bound) are likely to be achieved. When generic, off-the shelf objectives get the SMART treatment, they emerge as targets that engage focus, action, feedback and learning. These targets assist development of individual work plans, and also provide a guidance system for supervisor-staff performance review discussions.
How Do You Write a SMART Objective Statement?
First, you must decide exactly what you expect to create, and how you will recognise it when it comes to be. Now put it in words: ""Our Internet Marketing system produces a minimum of $3500 per month in product sales by 31 July 2015, with a quarterly increase of at least 5% thereafter."" The Specific, Measurable, and Time-bound aspects are built into one short declaration.
Will it happen? Much depends on whether your objective is aligned with things that really matter to you (and your organisation), and whether you can commit the resources to bring it about. In individuals and in organisations, resource distribution often reflects past priorities and requirements. As you develop your SMART objective, step back and compare proposed results with existing commitments in the larger organisation or systems you serve. This broader perspective can help you decide if:
- Your proposed result is consistent with and directly relevant to larger strategic goals and desired outcomes, and
- Your proposed result has such great pay-off potential that it is worth the resource investment it requires.
Taking on a new initiative usually means that something else must go. If you discover that current investments are not producing the gains you had hoped for, you know where you can harvest resources for endeavours you believe will be more fruitful.
Now that your objective embodies the ""Alignment"" and ""Realistic/Relevant"" aspects of SMART, you are ready to use it as a target for work plans.
Using SMART Objectives for Feedback and Learning
In complex systems, feedback is the process of comparing a target state with current conditions to signal and control the need for adjustment. A thermostat, for example, provides feedback that enables the heating system to maintain its target temperature.
In teams and organisations, feedback involves regular check-ins to compare anticipated results with current progress."	<urn:uuid:f3b9f697-b5a8-4f37-b440-9423fb5e3637>	0.0
Are social media and advocacy approaches similar between Hispanic and Native heritage celebrations?	"Chiquita's top leader spoke of resilience and dynamism during Leaders in Action event
Fernando Aguirre, chairman and CEO of Chiquita Brands International Inc., shared insights he's learned since coming to the United States as a young man during a special lecture May 15. The event was part of the BB&T Distinguished Leaders in Action lecture series hosted by the McColl School of Business at Queens.
Queens encouraged participants to use social media to capture their favorite moments from the candid talk.
Aguirre assumed his leadership role at Chiquita in 2004. The company has $3.5 billion in revenues and sells products worldwide with the Chiquita brand on bananas, healthy snacks and smoothies, and Fresh Express salads in North America. Prior to Chiquita, Aguirre worked for more than 23 years in brand management, general management and turnarounds at Procter and Gamble (P&G). Aguirre began his P&G career in 1980 in marketing in Mexico, moved to Cincinnati in 1986, Canada in 1988, and in 1991 became General Manager in Mexico.
A native of Mexico, Aguirre obtained a baseball scholarship at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree in business with a specialty in marketing in 1980. He was elected to the Athletic Hall of Fame at SIUE in 2007 and to the alumni Hall of Fame in 2009. Aguirre also attended the prestigious YPO Harvard President's seminar for ten years earning HBS graduate status in 2009. Aguirre is married and has two sons. He holds a Tae Kwon Do brown belt, plays golf, was certified as an open water scuba diver in 2007, and he is an avid reader. Most recently, Aguirre became the first Hispanic CEO to participate in the CBS hit reality television series Undercover Boss. In 2011 he was recognized as one of the one hundred Influentials by Hispanic Business Magazine, and was also honored with the Hispanic Heritage Leadership Award by the National Football League.

Coal mine methane new solutions for use of CMM- reduction of GHG emissions [Print to PDF] [Print to RTF]
Total cost:EUR 4 594 188
EU contribution:EUR 3 050 239
Topic(s):ENERGY-2007-5+6.2-05 - Extending the value chain for GHG emissions other than CO2 associated with coal production and use
Call for proposal:FP7-ENERGY-2007-2-TR
Funding scheme:CP - Collaborative project (generic)
The project aims at reducing green house gas (GHG) emissions caused by the uncontrolled exhausting of coal mine methane (CMM) to atmosphere and to explore suitable economically interesting schemes for its energetic use by the development of an universal decision guidance for optimal use of CMM under varying conditions, an analysis and comparison of the current legal and administrative situation in countries with big coal deposits (PL, CZ, RU, UA, RO, KZ and UK), the development, establishment and test of test units for new CMM utilisation technologies (use of CMM vented from a mine and CMM liquefaction) and the analysis of the emission reduction potential of CMM utilisation.
The test of the new CMM utilisation methods will be carried out in Russia (use of use of CMM vented from a mine) and the Ukraine (liquefaction). Additionally in Kazakhstan existing CMM potential will be analysed and a test sucking will be implemented. Methane has a GHP (green house potential) 21 times higher than that of CO2. By burning 1 t methane GHG emission are reduced by 18.25 t CO2eq. Therefore energetic use of CMM saves fossil fuels resources, contributes to the diversification of energy resources and reduces climate relevant emissions. By establishing and operating the two plants in Russia and Ukraine GHG emission are already reduced in the range of 135,000 t CO2 eq. However, successful project implementation will lead to a much higher overall reduction of GHG emission as the construction of additional CMM utilisations in Eastern Europe can be anticipated.
Despite the environmental advantages CMM is rarely used in the new EU and developing countries due to lacking of experiences, existing administrative and legal barriers and different economical conditions."	<urn:uuid:f22e196c-83e6-40e2-aa11-a7b2d94a6dfd>	0.0
I'm new to student loans. What's the main difference between graduated repayment and IDR plans?	"PLUS Loans for Parents
Parents of dependent students are eligible to apply for their own federal loan to help pay college expenses. We do not assume parents want to borrow to pay educational expenses. If you and your parents are interested in this program you should contact the campus financial aid office at your school. A parent may borrow the difference between the Cost of Attendance and all other student aid received by the student.
You (the student) must apply for financial aid using the FAFSA. You must also submit a PLUS loan request form available at your CUNY college Financial Aid Office.
Interest rate and repayment for PLUS loans
Plus loans taken for the 2013-2014 academic term are charged a fixed interest rate of 6.41%. The interest will not change throughout the life of the loan. Repayment of the loan begins within 60 days after the date funds are disbursed. The interest rate varies each year on new loans and is adjusted each July 1st.
To receive a PLUS loan you must:
- Request the loan from the financial aid office
- File a FAFSA
- Parents must be able to pass a credit check
- Parents and students must meet general eligibility requirements for federal student aid
- Must not be in default of any loan or owe a refund to any Federal Student Assistance program
Frequently Asked Questions
How do my parents apply for a PLUS Loan?
After completing a FAFSA your parents complete a Direct PLUS Loan application and promissory note that you'll get from your school's financial aid office. They will have to pass a credit check. If they don't pass they might still be able to receive a loan if they can demonstrate that extenuating circumstances exists, or if someone they know, who can pass agrees to endorse the loan and promises to repay it if your parents don't.
When does PLUS loan repayment begin?
Generally, within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed (paid out). There is no grace period for these loans. This means interest begins to accumulate at the time the first disbursement is made. Your parents must begin repaying both principal and interest while you're in school.
What are the PLUS repayment periods?
The repayment periods for Stafford Loans vary from 10 to 30 years depending which repayment plan you choose. When it comes to repayment you can pick a repayment plan that's right for you. You can get more information about repayment by going to the U.S."	<urn:uuid:d4da0f62-0098-4250-a19b-052c06b28c22>	0.0

Joanita Addo: I had the idea on 13 July, 2015 and we had our first training session on 22 September, 2015. I did the registration and incorporation in the first week of October.
Phyllis Ntim: What does HYMA Academy offer?
Joanita Addo: We offer classes in certain trades for people, so that they become self-employed, instead of sitting at home and not getting a job. It’s about having an impact on people and empowering them.
Phyllis Ntim: What kind of workshops do you offer?
Joanita Addo: For now, we offer beading, make-up, how to fix a weave, make wigs and fascinators trainings. We added liquid soap and parazone as training sessions as well.
Phyllis Ntim: What is the reason that you started the HYMA Academy?
Joanita Addo: After I graduated from Central University College, I realized that so many of my mates were at home, struggling to find a job. Even my seniors, those that graduated before me, were jobless. There are many people that have been jobless for five, six or seven years. They can’t get jobs. They continue sending cv’s to companies. With the Dumsor (power outage), there are a lot of companies laying-off staff."	<urn:uuid:a1064957-5292-46f3-bcb2-db137db4c08f>	0.0

I work with machine tool standards and optical measurement systems, and I need to understand the relationship between measurement uncertainty and tolerance limits. How do different machine tool standards handle accuracy specifications, and what approach is used in optical shaft measurement to ensure measurement reliability?	"Rather than measuring the initial and final lengths (Li and Lf) of the test member, dilatometry measures the difference in length δL between the test member and the reference member. Because δL is generally much less than Li and Lf, the measurement accuracy is enhanced. Error sources in dilatometry include an imperfect knowledge of the reference member's CTE and inadvertent temperature differences between the test member and the reference member.
In interferometry, the expansion of a test member is measured relative to the wavelength of monochromatic light. A monochromatic light beam is split into first and second signals which are directed along first and second optical paths before being recombined. The optical paths are configured to include reflection from opposite ends of the test member. The difference in the optical path lengths causes a phase difference in the first and second signals which affects the amplitude of the recombined signal.
Expansion of the test member causes the first and second optical path lengths to change and this change is reflected in a change in the amplitude of the recombined signal. The measurement accuracy can be on the order of the radiation wavelength which is generally small, e.g., ˜1 micron for visible light. Interferometry measurement systems are typically complex and expensive. Error sources include the temperature sensitivities of optical equipment (e.g., lenses and retroreflectors) which must be exposed to the test temperature.
Dilatometry and interferometry measurement techniques are best suited for the measurement of homogeneous test members which expand linearly. Because their constituent parts may have different CTEs, composite members often bend or twist as they expand. Conventional dilatometry and interferometry techniques are typically not configured to correct for this complex expansion.
Exemplary composite members which are subjected to thermal stress are the solar wings 22 and 24 of the satellite 20 of FIG. 1. The satellite has a body 26 which carries various communication antennas, e.g., dish antennas 28, 29 and 30 and an array antenna 31. The solar wings 22 and 24 extend in opposite directions from the body 26 and they each carry a plurality of solar cells 32 on one wing face.
The satellite 20 is typically maintained in an attitude which directs the antennas at the Earth. The solar cells 32 convert solar radiation 33 to electrical energy for operation of the systems of the spacecraft 20."	<urn:uuid:a0aaed77-d576-41b3-abda-abcfdafc108b>	0.0

As a meteorite researcher studying crystal formations, I'm curious about how the Widmanstätten pattern helps identify meteorites, and what tools are recommended for proper meteorite hunting?	"J. Engelbrecht, the owner of the Hoba West farm where it is located, donated the meteorite and the site to the state for educational purposes. The area has since become a popular tourist destination with thousands of people flocking annually to feast their eyes on the extraterrestrial rock. Hopefully, Gancedo, the second or third largest meteorite in the world, will be similarly preserved for future generations to admire.

As someone who does regular testing, I'm wondering how different measuring devices compare in terms of accuracy - are specialized high-end devices really worth it compared to standard ones?	"This includes broken ones, if you add notes like “spares and repairs” to your listing, honestly describing the condition of your device. In some cases, you’ll be responsible for the packaging and posting, as well as managing the returns, missing items, and refunds.
You can also use comparison sites like Freedom Mobiles to compare recyclers to use for your used smartphone, mobile or tablet. You will find the best prices from various recyclers listed so that your electronic devices will end up in the best hands.
Another more convenient, but maybe less lucrative option is to use trade-in sites such as Musicmagie. The process is simpler as you can send your electronic devices for free or arrange for a courier to pick them up from your home. You should receive your payment after they have listed your old electronics.
4. Donate your electronic devices to charity
There are non-profit programs and organizations to facilitate the donation of fully functioning electronic devices. They will refurbish and donate unwanted gadgets to people who can’t afford to buy them at standard retail prices. This is a great way to give your old electronic devices a new lease of life while helping people in need.
FARA Shops is a London-based charity you can donate your old appliances to. The charity will first put your device through Portable Appliance Testing (or PAT) to ensure its safety before donating it. Get-Well Gamers is another association that will donate your video games and game consoles to UK hospitals.
Don’t just throw your electronic devices away
As you can see there are no good reasons for old electronics to end up in a landfill and we’re all responsible to ensure that this planet remains clean.
Disposing of our e-waste in a responsible and eco-friendly way with certified e-waste recyclers and tech companies will ensure your gadgets don’t pollute the earth.
Giving your devices away through selling or donating will prolong their life cycle and cut down waste. Before you get the latest model of an electronic device, think about what you’ll do with your old one for our common future.
If getting rid of your device is the only option, consider the most sustainable and environmentally friendly ways to dispose of it.

How do Arctic Ocean methane releases compare between gas hydrates and pingo-like features?	"Sixty-page report points to record of almost 40 deepwater blowouts, and culture of dangerous risk exposure
by David Sassoon, solveclimate.com – May 24th, 2010
A sixty-page memorandum addressed to Renee Orr, the chief of the leasing division of the Minerals Management Service (MMS), was sent in September 2009 by an environmental investigator, warning of potential disaster in offshore drilling operations and the particular dangers posed by gas hydrates.
It was written as a public comment to the federal government’s proposed rule for oil and gas leasing between 2010 and 2015 on the outer continental shelf, and offers a wide-ranging compilation and analysis, based on meticulously documented scientific, industry and government sources, of many accidents little known to the general public.
It warns of the potential for catastrophic environmental disaster in an offshore accident, highlighting many of the potential dangers that the Deepwater Horizon explosion has now put on display. It also raises concern about the ongoing and unrecognized release of vast quantities of methane into the atmosphere, a gas 20 times more powerful as a warming agent than CO2.
“The primary cause of blowouts, spills and uncontrolled releases of gases from offshore operations is drilling into methane hydrates, or through them into free gas trapped below,” the report warns MMS. It cites much evidence compiled from accident investigations and other documents published by MMS itself, which is the federal agency responsible for assuring safety and environmental protection of offshore drilling operations, as well as leasing rules and royalty payments.

A Seed Coat Bedding Assay to Genetically Explore In Vitro How the Endosperm Controls Seed Germination in Arabidopsis thaliana
Institutions: Université de Genève.
endosperm consists of a single cell layer surrounding the mature embryo and playing an essential role to prevent the germination of dormant seeds or that of nondormant seeds irradiated by a far red (FR) light pulse. In order to further gain insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying the germination repressive activity exerted by the endosperm, a ""seed coat bedding"" assay (SCBA) was devised. The SCBA is a dissection procedure physically separating seed coats and embryos from seeds, which allows monitoring the growth of embryos on an underlying layer of seed coats. Remarkably, the SCBA reconstitutes the germination repressive activities of the seed coat in the context of seed dormancy and FR-dependent control of seed germination. Since the SCBA allows the combinatorial use of dormant, nondormant and genetically modified seed coat and embryonic materials, the genetic pathways controlling germination and specifically operating in the endosperm and embryo can be dissected. Here we detail the procedure to assemble a SCBA.

I'm curious about the strengths and limitations of scientific experiments. Can someone explain why lab experiments might not always give us the full picture in real-world situations?	"T. Denny Sanford for his generous donation of $70 million which will enable the Sanford Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory at Homestake to provide space for early experimental programs as well as the initiation of a substantial education effort.”
Berkeley Lab has been one of the principal institutes involved in the scientific proposal of the Homestake Collaboration. Speaking on behalf of Berkeley Lab in response to the announcement was James Symons, director of the Lab’s Nuclear Science Division.
“At Berkeley Lab, we have been working on the Homestake proposal for over six years and are delighted that the NSF's comprehensive review process has selected Homestake as the site of a deep underground lab in the United States. The scientific opportunities offered by the Homestake site are first rate. We’re excited at using the scientific, educational and technical resources of Berkeley Lab to assist in development of our new sister laboratory in South Dakota. These opportunities build on the historic connections between UC Berkeley, the Hearst family and the Homestake mine, and between Berkeley Lab and the state of South Dakota, which was the birthplace of our founder, Ernest O. Lawrence. We look forward to renewing the relationship with Homestake in the 21st century.”
The Need to go Deep
A number of scientific investigations require an underground environment the deeper the better. For example, there are questions important to the fields of astrophysics and physics that cannot be answered unless experiments are shielded from cosmic rays and other background radiation by thousands of feet of rock. Homestake is the deepest mine in the United States, reaching a depth of more than 8,000 feet. With over 375 miles of existing tunnels, it is ideally suited for conversion into a scientific research facility.
“The Homestake mine is a vast site capable of hosting a comprehensive suite of experiments in all major fields of science, including low background physics experiments and particle and nuclear physics experiments that require very large detectors,” said Lesko. “The site can simultaneously host multidisciplinary deep sub-surface studies in geosciences, geoengineering and microbiology.”
The Homestake proposal calls for two major deep underground facility levels. One level will serve research operating from the surface on down to 4,850 feet. Construction of the “Laboratory at 4850” will entail modification of an existing scientific site and preparation of new experimental chambers. The other facility is planned for the 7,400 foot depth level."	<urn:uuid:df8d8aa2-cee9-4c5e-ae17-abca0b7967f4>	0.0
How do temporary installations enable artistic experimentation and ensure accessibility standards?	"Web accessibility is one of the most critical components of the University of Iowa's web presence. At the same time, it is one of the most misunderstood. Following are some common questions about web accessibility at Iowa.
What is web accessibility?
Web accessibility means designing and delivering websites and content that present no barriers to users with disabilities. Accessible websites and content include design features that increase usability across a spectrum of abilities and technologies, including use by people with disabilities and users of assistive technology.
What is the University of Iowa's policy on web accessibility?
University of Iowa policy requires that all web content conform to accessibility standards described in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, version 2.0, level AA, as set forth by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Individual units are charged with developing and implementing a web accessibility strategy per the Implementation section of this policy.
The full policy is available at http://itsecurity.uiowa.edu/policy/webAccessibility.shtml.
Is accessibility required by law?
The University is subject to provisions of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and the Iowa Civil Rights Act.
- Section 504 prohibits disability-based discrimination by programs that receive Federal funds.
- Title II of the ADA requires that communications to people with disabilities be equally as effective as communications with non-disabled people in their timeliness, accuracy, and delivery method.
- The Department of Justice has stated that Internet and web sites are covered under both Section 504 and the ADA.
I don't have any people with disabilities in my audience—do I need to provide accessible web technology?
Yes. One tenet of accessible technology is that it is available to any qualified user. A user with a disability may access your website at any time, and must be able to make use of your content. Providing accessible technology from the beginning is the best way to ensure that all users can get the most from your site.
I hear about WCAG and the POUR Principles—what are these, and how do they relate to accessibility at Iowa?
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) describe a set of principles, standards, and techniques intended to provide a framework for web accessibility. WCAG version 2.0, Level AA is the content standard identified for compliance with the University web policy; all web content must conform to these guidelines.
POUR is an acronym for four high-level principles that describe functional accessibility."	<urn:uuid:d3f10fbb-e89d-417e-8293-5c6dd0e171e9>	0.0

How does the Amorphous project address the traditional barriers that prevent queer people from accessing art galleries and museums?	"PITTSBURGH.- The Carnegie Museum of Art
's opened its reinstalled modern and contemorary collection galleries, and on Monday, June 10, The Playground Project welcomed visitors, as well as summer architecture campers. The International is comprised of a major exhibition of international art, a playground, the museum's collection, and an engagement with the city of Pittsburgh. The International opens in full on October 5.
The Collection of Modern and Contemporary Art
The Carnegie Museum of Art presents an ambitious reinstallation of its modern and contemporary art collection, lead by two of the 2013 Carnegie International curators, Dan Byers and Tina Kukielski. The curators have selected over 200 objects, which include a great number of works acquired through past Internationals. Altogether, 8 large galleries have been reinstalled. Rather than de-install the museum's collection galleries for the International, as in the past, this project brings the exhibition into conversation with past iterations, and contextualizes the museum's important collection both in terms of larger art movements, and how the museum and Pittsburgh engaged with artists around the world.
The Playground Project
""The most interesting place in the typical playground is the drinking fountain.""
- Richard Dattner, Design for Play, 1969
The Playground Project presents some of the most outstanding and influential playgrounds from Europe, the United States, and Japan from the mid-to-late 20th century in order to prompt a reconsideration of our own time and the way we approach childhood, risk, public space, and education. The project also puts the concept of play into the foreground as an important way of thinking, one that has influenced the development of the 2013 Carnegie International. In addition, a Lozziwurm play sculpture, designed in 1972, has been installed in front of the museum's entrance, providing a public space for families to gather.
The Playground Project develops in two phases. Starting in June, this presentation of the most innovative playgrounds of the last century will inspire the museums summer art and architecture camps. In addition, children, teenagers, and families will be invited to respond and create with Carnegie Museum of Arts drop-in ARTventures program."	<urn:uuid:eab8db41-703f-4543-b721-10117fff613c>	0.0

Longitudinal Biochemical Assay Analysis of Mutant Huntingtin Exon 1 Protein in R6/2 Mice.
Journal of Huntington's disease
2018; 7 (4): 321-335
Biochemical analysis of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregation species in HD mice is a common measure to track disease. A longitudinal and systematic study of how tissue processing affects detection of conformers has not yet been reported. Understanding the homeostatic flux of mHTT over time and under different processing conditions would aid in interpretation of pre-clinical assessments of disease interventions.Provide a systematic evaluation of tissue lysis methods and molecular and biochemical assays in parallel with behavioral readouts in R6/2 mice to establish a baseline for HTT exon1 protein accumulation.Established biochemical methods were used to process tissue from R6/2 mice of specific ages following behavior tasks. Aggregation states and accumulation of mHTT exon 1 protein were evaluated using multiple break and assay methods to determine potential conformational flux assay specificity in detection of mHTT species, and tissue specificity of conformers.Detection of mHTT exon 1 protein species varied based on biochemical processing and analysis providing a baseline for subsequent studies in R6/2 mice. Insoluble, high molecular weight species of mHTT exon 1 protein increased and tracked with onset of behavioral impairments in R6/2 mice using multiple assay methods.Conformational flux from soluble monomer to high molecular weight, insoluble species of mHTT exon 1 protein was generally consistent for multiple assay methods throughout R6/2 disease progression; however, the results support the use of multiple biochemical techniques to detect mHTT exon 1 protein species for preclinical assessments in HD mouse models expressing mHTT exon 1 protein."	<urn:uuid:37662c73-e6a5-4bde-8639-71aeb9384706>	0.0
are shipping ice wedges and dry ice same thing	"Ice cutters will have an easier job on Lake Superior and the rest of the Great Lakes, and shipping could begin earlier than normal on the upper Mississippi River thanks to warm weather this winter.
The ice cutter Alder is currently parked in the Twin Ports as she awaits her spring ritual of cutting ice on Lake Superior. She is scheduled to begin cutting ice on Monday, March 7. She should have an easier time of it than in past years since the ice measurement on Lake Superior as of March 6 is at 12.5% versus last year at the same time of 92% and 93.8% in 2014 on the same date. Overall, the Great Lakes ice coverage as of March 6 was at 19.7% versus 83.7% in 2015 on the same date.
According to the Duluth Shipping news via the USCG, ""U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Alder will commence spring break-out operations in the Duluth-Superior area Monday, March 7, 2016. Initially, ice-breaking operations will occur inside the Duluth and Superior Harbors. The ice breaking work will expand in coming weeks to prepare Two Harbors, Minnesota; Taconite Harbor, Minnesota; Silver Bay, Minnesota; and Thunder Bay, Ontario, for commercial ship movements.""
""Unlike the past two winters, this year was unseasonably warm. Regional ice cover is not as expansive, nor did it reach traditional thicknesses. The forecast for the next seven to 10 days calls for temperatures conducive to rapid deterioration of ice. These operations will continue periodically over the next few days and weeks to prepare regional waterways for the start of the Great Lakes commercial navigation season.""
I asked Adele Yorde, public relations director for the Duluth Seaway port Authority, if the 2016 shipping season would open early due to the low ice coverage. She told me, ""No early open for the 2016 navigation season -- even with the low/no-ice conditions. With demand for iron ore so diminished, none of the fleets are clamoring to sail earlier than usual. Soo Locks still plan to reopen on schedule on March 25 (midnight leading into the March 26).

How should I maintain batteries, both for storage and cleaning?	"The need to completely transform our global energy system in response to the threat of climate change is an undertaking that demands technological, policy, and market innovation. It is easy during these times of unprecedented change to become fixated on equally unprecedented technologies. However, sometimes the best solution to a new problem is to simply rethink the tools already at hand.
Recently, I have been reminded of this fact by a remarkably unremarkable method of energy storage: gravity. Approximately 99% of grid-connected energy storage currently in use in the United States is pumped hydro, a system that uses gravity’s pull to draw water through a turbine. This method of storage is both cheaper and longer-lasting than batteries. That said, pumped hydro is constrained in its ability to meet the energy storage demands of a zero-carbon, renewables-dominated grid. It has relatively poor electrical efficiency, it requires many acres of land, and must be sited where there is a natural gradient in elevation. It requires an enormous amount of water, a precious and limited resource in many regions.
Fortunately, gravity is impartial, and our storage systems need not be limited to the movement of water. Two start-up companies—Gravitricity and Energy Vault—believe that the gravitational potential energy of solid mass may hold the key to sustainable and economical storage of energy. These companies have subtly different designs: one proposes dropping a heavy weight down old mine shafts; the other proposes stacking hundreds of concrete bricks into a tower. But the fundamental concept is the same: pull something up with excess energy, and then generate electricity through a winch and generator as it falls.
Many of us are inclined to think that the best solution to the immense challenge of energy storage has to come from a groundbreaking development in batteries or hydrogen production. Perhaps this is a foolish mistake. Based on the technology available to us right now, deceptively simple gravity systems may be one of our most versatile options and could solve many of the limitations inherent in other methods of storage.
- This technology is efficient. Energy Vault says that their system could reach 90% electrical efficiency, compared to approximately 70% for pumped hydro storage and ~35% for reversible fuel cell technology.
- This technology should last for decades, and individual components could be easily replaced should they fail. This is also true for pumped hydro storage, but is a serious limitation of modern lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells which typically last for fewer than 10 years, depending on usage."	<urn:uuid:1b710086-612f-49b1-a8a7-e9ff461769fc>	0.0

How are serious crimes like copyright violations handled differently from other types of crimes when it comes to police investigation and arrests?	"Five Victorians arrested in two drug cases
Oct. 17, 2012 at 5:17 a.m.
Updated Oct. 19, 2012 at 5:19 a.m.
Five Victoria residents were in jail Wednesday on drug charges after officers served two separate warrants and confiscated about $13,500 in cocaine.
The Victoria Police Department Special Crimes Unit served the first warrant Tuesday at 8 p.m. in the 200 block of Avenue C, according to a press release.
Robert Delgado, 21, was charged with manufacturing and delivering a controlled substance in a drug-free zone and possession of marijuana in a drug-free zone. Officers seized what they described as more than five grams of crack cocaine, more than 10 grams of marijuana, two vehicles and $296 in cash.
Sgt. Eline Moya, Victoria police spokeswoman, said the arrests stemmed from a current investigation and officers do not think the arrests were gang-related.
Four more residents were arrested at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday during a separate investigation in the 1700 block of Bonham Drive.
Jonathon Western, 38, was charged with manufacturing and delivering a controlled substance and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon.
Ricky Thomas, 50, Sadie Swannagan, 49, and Denise Madden, 50, were all charged with manufacturing and delivering a controlled substance.
At the Bonham Drive residence, the special crimes unit seized more than a pound of what officials believe to be powder cocaine with an estimated street value of $13,500, a vehicle, a firearm and more than $3,200 in cash. The arrests also stemmed from an ongoing investigation, Moya said."	<urn:uuid:f7b2fb01-0d7d-49a4-bef9-479d2dd09fd8>	0.0

what disasters affect company staff mental health	"The qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangement (QSEHRA) was designed specifically for small businesses with fewer than 50 employees. As such, it isn’t subject to many of the federal laws that affect larger employee health plans.
One such law is HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996). Outlining data privacy and security provisions for medical information, much of the legislation applies only to health plans covering more than 50 employees.
But certain portions of HIPAA apply to all plans—including the QSEHRA.
Regardless of the number of participants, all health plans must observe the HIPAA Privacy Rule. This rule controls when the health plan can and cannot share health information with the company sponsoring the plan.
In this post, we’ll review the HIPAA Privacy Rule, how it applies to the QSEHRA, and what businesses need to know to comply with HIPAA privacy requirements.
What is the HIPAA Privacy Rule?
The HIPAA Privacy Rule is a set of national standards designed to safeguard individuals’ protected health information (PHI).
For businesses offering an employee health benefit, the rule controls the conditions under which employee PHI will be shared outside the health plan, including with the company sponsoring the plan.
PHI is defined as information, including demographic data, that relates to:
- the individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health condition;
- the provision of health care to the individual; or
- the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual;
and that identifies the individual or contains enough information that there’s a reasonable basis to believe it could be used to identify the individual.
What is considered PHI under a QSEHRA?
For the QSEHRA, PHI will most often occur in the form of documentation verifying that the participant incurred a qualified medical expense.
This could include:
- Documentation of doctor’s visits
- Notes made by physicians and other provider staff
- Health care payment and remittance advice
- Coordination of health care benefits
- Health care claim status
- Health policy premium payments
- Referral certifications and authorization
- First report of injury
- Health claims attachments
PHI could occur in electronic, paper, or oral format.
What must small businesses do to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule and protect PHI while administering a QSEHRA?"	<urn:uuid:6cbced75-d311-4f3c-91c7-4d2cc8835af1>	0.0
melanoma prevention vs physical activity benefits cancer patients which more supported by research	"A multidisciplinary team at Yale, led by Yale Cancer Center members, has defined a subgroup of genetic mutations that are present in a significant number of melanoma skin cancer cases. Their findings shed light on an important mutation in this deadly disease, and may lead to more targeted anti-cancer therapies.
The study was published July 27 in Nature Genetics.
The role of mutations in numerous genes and genomic changes in the development of melanoma—a skin cancer with over 70,000 new cases reported in the United States each year—is well established and continues to be the focus of intense research. Yet in approximately 30% of melanoma cases the genetic abnormalities are unclear. To deepen understanding of melanoma mutations, the Yale team conducted a comprehensive analysis using whole-exome sequencing of more than 200 melanoma samples from patients with the disease.
The multidisciplinary team—drawing on their expertise in genetics, cancer, computational biology, pharmacology, and other disciplines—also tested the response of tumor cells with specific mutations to anti-cancer drugs.
The researchers confirmed that a gene known as NF1 is a ""major player"" in the development of skin cancer. ""The key finding is that roughly 45% of melanomas that do not harbor the known BRAF or NRAS mutations display loss of NF1 function, which leads to activation of the same cancer-causing pathway,"" said Michael Krauthammer, M.D., associate professor of pathology and the study's corresponding author.
Additionally, researchers observed that melanoma patients with the NF1 mutation were older and had a greater number of mutations in the tumors. These include mutations in the same pathway, collectively known as RASopathy genes.
Yet mutations in NF1 are not sufficient to cause skin cancer, said Ruth Halaban, senior research scientist in dermatology, a member of Yale Cancer Center, and lead author of the study. ""Loss of NF1 requires more accompanying changes to make a tumor,"" she explained. ""Our study identified changes in about 100 genes that are present only in the malignant cells and are likely to be causative. This panel of genes can now be used in precision medicine to diagnose malignant lesions and can be applied to personalized cancer treatment.""
By testing the response of the melanoma samples to two cancer drugs, the researchers also determined that, in addition to loss of NF1, multiple factors need to be tested to predict the response to the drugs."	<urn:uuid:f9e58582-de5e-4a07-9caa-c66251a44be2>	0.0
As an environmental consultant in the healthcare sector, I'm interested in how different cultural celebrations can be made more sustainable. How do traditional Christmas gift-giving customs affect environmental sustainability, and what eco-friendly alternatives are available for holiday celebrations?	"To ensure genetic diversity and reduce the impacts of genetic drift, the population would need to be made up of individuals from different regions, ethnic groups, and with varied genetic backgrounds. In addition, reproductive strategies such as inbreeding avoidance or controlled breeding could be used to maintain genetic diversity.
Repopulation of the earth would also require careful planning and management of resources such as food, water, and shelter, as well as healthcare services to maintain the health and wellbeing of the population.
The precise number of humans required to repopulate would depend on a variety of factors such as genetic diversity, demography, and environmental factors. An MVP of 500-10,000 individuals would be necessary to ensure long-term survival, but careful planning and management would be required to achieve a successful repopulation.
How many humans can the earth support?
The question of how many humans the earth can support depends on several factors, including resource availability, environmental sustainability, and technological advancements.
One crucial factor to consider is resource availability. The earth has limited resources, including food, water, and energy, which are essential for human survival. As the global population continues to grow, the demand for these resources increases, meaning that the earth can support a limited number of people.
The carrying capacity of the earth, therefore, depends on how efficiently we use our resources and how we manage them.
Another factor to consider is environmental sustainability. The ecosystems on which humans depend are sensitive to environmental changes. Overpopulation can cause environmental degradation, such as deforestation, loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and water pollution. These impacts can affect the surrounding communities and limit the earth’s capacity to support life.
Therefore, the earth’s carrying capacity depends on how well we manage the environment and minimize our ecological footprint.
Lastly, technological advancements can also affect the earth’s carrying capacity. Technology has played a significant role in increasing global agricultural productivity, energy efficiency, and waste management. By developing sustainable technologies, we can enhance the earth’s capacity to support more humans without compromising the environment.
Estimating the number of humans that the earth can support is not a straightforward answer. Several factors come into play, including resource availability, environmental sustainability, and technological advancements. Therefore, to ensure that the earth can support the current and future generations, we need to manage our resources, reduce our impact on the environment, and invest in sustainable technologies.

I've been reading about women's activism - what's the difference between how domestic workers' rights are handled in Asia versus how women's participation is supported in peace processes?	"In several European countries, including the UK, Norway and Spain, the highest smoking uptake rates are now seen in disadvantaged girls.22
A recent analysis of World Health Survey data from 50 countries19 shows how tobacco use is spreading from HICs to LMICs, particularly among disadvantaged groups, and how these trajectories differ by gender, age and stage of diffusion of smoking in a country (as described in the four-stage cigarette smoking epidemic model of Lopez and colleagues23). This analysis reveals that the key drivers of the tobacco epidemic such as increasing gross domestic product in LMICs (which increases cigarette purchasing power) and increasing educational status (which increases awareness of health risks) have a differential impact on women and men, and are mediated by gendered social, cultural and economic factors. These factors include social norms and restrictions on women's smoking, as well as shifts in women's social and economic status.
Women's emancipation and increases in status have long been associated with increases in smoking. Young urbanised women are often among the first to adopt cigarette smoking in LMICs. The link between gender empowerment (measured by economic and political participation) and smoking has been positively correlated,24 establishing that as the gender empowerment measure for women rises, so does the gender smoking ratio. While the correlation of women's status with smoking uptake may explain initiation, it may not explain the economic and gendered patterns of smoking once diffusion has occurred.25 For example, Pampel,26 using a complex set of indicators to measure a ‘gender-equality’ hypothesis that included social and cultural as well as economic independence, concluded that there was no support for a causal relationship between increased equality and increased smoking among women in HICs."	<urn:uuid:eb4938f2-f6a7-4a2d-a4fa-77e058c11c08>	0.0

Which countries have left the global nuclear arms pact?	"Truman charged that Stalin had betrayed the Yalta agreement. With Eastern Europe under Red Army occupation, Stalin was also biding his time, as his own atomic bomb project was steadily and secretly progressing.
In April 1949 the United States sponsored the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a mutual defense pact in which most Western nations pledged to treat an armed attack against one nation as an assault on all. The Soviet Union established an Eastern counterpart to NATO in 1955, dubbed the Warsaw Pact. The division of Europe into Western and Soviet blocks later took on a more global character, especially after 1949, when the U.S. nuclear monopoly ended with the testing of a Soviet bomb and the communist takeover in China.
The foremost objectives of Soviet foreign policy were the maintenance and enhancement of national security and the maintenance of hegemony over Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union maintained its dominance over the Warsaw Pact through crushing the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, suppressing the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and supporting the suppression of the Solidarity movement in Poland in the early 1980s. The Soviet Union opposed the United States in a number of proxy conflicts all over the world, including the Korean and Vietnamese Wars.
As the Soviet Union continued to maintain tight control over its sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, the Cold War gave way to Détente and a more complicated pattern of international relations in the 1970s in which the world was no longer clearly split into two clearly opposed blocs. Less powerful countries had more room to assert their independence, and the two superpowers were partially able to recognize their common interest in trying to check the further spread and proliferation of nuclear weapons in treaties such as SALT I, SALT II, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
U.S.-Soviet relations deteriorated following the beginning of the nine-year Soviet War in Afghanistan in 1979 and the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan, a staunch anti-communist, but improved as the Soviet bloc began to unravel in the late 1980s. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia lost the superpower status that it had won in the Second World War.
In the power struggle that erupted after Stalin's death in 1953, his closest followers lost out."	<urn:uuid:5cfadefa-070c-4287-8cf4-1a695d733f13>	0.0
Does peanut butter or pumpkin seed butter have more protein?	"The Best Peanut Butter Banana Protein Shake
This is the best peanut butter banana protein shake recipe that you will ever make, period. The ingredients are nothing out of the ordinary, but the combination is divine. It is so good that you will be making it for breakfast and lunch!
My friends and I like to make this protein shake after long bike rides. It is filling and easy on the stomach, and if you have a big blender, you can double the recipe to make enough for 4 people. Or you could just double it and still drink it all yourself, which is what I like to do.
Why drink wholesome?
This recipe was made with drink wholesome peanut butter protein powder . It is perfect for smoothies. Most protein powders are not good for smoothies because they are made with protein concentrates and isolates, foods stripped of everything but the protein.
Unlike real foods, protein concentrates and isolates are missing the nutrients that make food taste good. In other words, they can ruin a good smoothie. With enough trial and error, you can make these protein powders work, but how many chalky smoothies are you willing to make?
Another reason why drink wholesome is perfect for smoothies is that it is sweetened with monk fruit. Monk fruit, also known as lo han guo, is a small, melon-like round fruit native to Southeast Asia. Monk fruit sweetener is made by removing the seeds and skin, crushing the fruit, and collecting the juice, which is then dried into a powder.
We use monk fruit sweetener because it has a sweetness similar to that of sugar. Artificial sweeteners and stevia, on the other hand, are either way too sweet, or have a bitter aftertaste. Order samples to experience the monk fruit sweetness for yourself.
Now without further ado, here is the best peanut butter banana protein shake recipe.
-1 cup ice
-1 cup dairy-free milk
-½ cup drink wholesome peanut butter protein powder
-1 ripe banana
-1 tbsp peanut butter
Place all of the ingredients in a blender and blend for 30 seconds. Drink immediately.
This recipe makes more than enough for one person, so feel free to share. If you are looking for a lower calorie option, do without the peanut butter. Our peanut butter protein powder will give you the peanut butter flavor you are looking for."	<urn:uuid:ba90f2ed-e33c-4566-9cc3-6879db26e074>	0.0
What happens when thick layers of algae form on lakes?	"I have my students locate the box next to the arrow for sublimation, and write the word in the box. I explain that when conditions are right, snow and ice will sublimate, or change state from a solid to a gas - without ever going to a liquid state. This process is called sublimation.
I have my students locate the box next to the arrow for condensation, and write the word in the box. I explain that when this water vapor rises, it cools. I ask my students, ""What did you learn about the particles in matter when heat is added or removed?"" I call on a student who correctly responds that matter changes state. I confirm that yes, it does change state. The water vapor that was in a gas state condenses, or changes from a gas to a liquid. This process is called condensation.
I have my students locate the box next to the arrow for precipitation, and write the word in the box. I explain that these particles of gas, in the form of water vapor, condense on particles of dust, smoke, and salt. When they grow heavier enough, the droplets fall as precipitation. Most precipitation is in the form of rain. However, if conditions are right, then precipitation can also fall as snow, hail (ice pellets) or sleet (rain mixed with snow).
I have my students locate the box next to the arrow for runoff, and ask them to write the term ""surface runoff"" in the box. I explain that surface runoff happens when snow and ice melt, and flow into streams, rivers, and lakes. Melting snow and ice are a major source of the movement of water world wide.
I have my students find the arrow for infiltration, and write the word in the box. I explain that some water infiltrates, or soaks into the shallow layers of soil, and some goes deeper into groundwater aquifers (underground layers of rock that are saturated or soaked with water).

The firm has said that will base certain directors’ re-election decisions on a company’s ability to mitigate associated risks. “For directors of companies in sectors that are significantly exposed to climate risk, the expectation will be for the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business and management’s approach to adapting and mitigating the risk,” a company statement reads.

New research has warned that the Great Barrier Reef is facing an uncertain future as an upcoming cycle of mass bleaching is due to damage the coral significantly, without firm action being taken against global warming. The study, which was unable to take in the effects of the latest mass bleaching event, warned of a fourth mass bleaching event “within the next decade or two”, and gave northern section of the reef a “slim” chance of recovering to its former state. The Australian government’s long-term conservation plans for the reef have been called into question, as the study outlines “Securing a future for coral reefs, including intensively managed ones such as the Great Barrier Reef, ultimately requires urgent and rapid action to reduce global warming.”

legal requirements new company formation	"On Feb. 9 the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted four laws within the local self-government reform and decentralization in the second and final readings, namely:
– Law “On Amendments to Some Laws of Ukraine concerning the acquisition of authority by village, town and city mayors”.
The legal act defines the procedure for acquisition of powers and limits the newly elected heads to combine their official duties with other activities. Moreover, before the acquisition of powers a village, town or city mayor should undergo compulsory registration by the relevant territorial election commission.
– Law “On Amendments to Some Legislative Acts of Ukraine concerning the Status of a Village, Town Headman”.
The law defines the limits of headman’s duties, his/her powers, grounds and reasons for his/her resignation, guarantees of duties etc. Moreover, the document introduces a new concept of territory formation called “starostynskyi okruh” (eng. headman district). According to the concept, the boundaries of districts will coincide with the territories, controlled by the councils of amalgamated local communities (ALCs). This innovation will promote the ubiquity of the headman concept within an ALC and guarantee the rights and interests of all residents of villages and towns.
– Law “On Amendments to some Legislative Acts of Ukraine concerning voluntary amalgamation of local communities”.
This legal act enables communities to join established ALCs under the simplified procedure. The law aims at the formation of really “wealthy communities” and defines the characteristic features, under which a newly created community can be considered as wealthy.
Thus, this community should be formed around the center, determined by a perspective plan of formation of territories of local communities, and at least half of the number of residents, specified by the plan, should live there. In this case, every successive local community should join this community under the simplified procedure.
Joining an ALC provides the election of deputies to the board of the ALC, however, the election of the ALC head isn’t held. Thus, representation of all areas in the newly created community should be promoted.
– Law “On service in local self-government bodies”.
This law establishes new principles of service in local self-government bodies. The document introduces a new division of posts in local government bodies into categories, contains requirements for political objectiveness of employees, professional requirements for the post applicants, determines a competition procedure, etc."	<urn:uuid:427b36fe-43b6-4e78-bc60-1d1c3fb2a346>	0.0

regular vs changing dividend payments impact on company value advantages disadvantages	"What is a debt buyback offer?
A debt takeover bid occurs when a company redeems some or all of its outstanding bonds or other debt securities. This is accomplished by making an offer to its creditors to buy back a predetermined number of bonds at a specified price and for a specified period of time.
Companies can use a debt tender offer as a mechanism for restructuring or refinancing capital. It is similar to a public tender offer, where a company solicits shareholders to buy back the shares of the company.
Key points to remember
- A debt tender offer is a public solicitation of bondholders of a company asking them to resell their bonds or debt securities at a specified price and for a certain period of time.
- Companies will consider a takeover bid when interest rates fall, making the cost of borrowing cheaper than holding onto older bonds at higher fixed coupons.
- The takeover bid may be made in cash or by exchanging old bonds for newly issued debt securities of equivalent value.
Understanding debt buyback offers
When a company issues debt securities such as bonds, it receives a capital loan from the investors who buy it. To compensate these creditors for the borrowed funds, the issuer will typically pay regular interest or coupons to the holders of the debt in addition to promising to repay the principal when the bond matures.
Interest payments, which are often fixed, represent a cost of debt for the issuer. It is possible that prevailing interest rates in the economy will change during the life of the bond. When interest rates rise, the value of existing bonds decreases since the coupon rate is lower than the prevailing interest rate. Similarly, when interest rates in the economy decline, issuers will be forced to pay the higher coupon rates attached to the bond unless they restructure their debt securities.
One method of debt restructuring to take advantage of lower borrowing costs is to make a public debt tender offer to bondholders. In other words, corporate bond issuers are turning to debt takeover bids as a way to eliminate or reduce over-leveraged, risky or high-cost capital structures.
Although tenders have many advantages, they have some disadvantages. A takeover bid can be a long and expensive process, as custodian banks verify the bonds presented and issue payments on behalf of the creditors.
Types of takeover bids
A debt tender offer is an opportunity for an issuing company to redeem its existing bonds at a price below the original face value and, therefore, reduce its related interest costs."	<urn:uuid:32514425-27a5-466a-a65e-c5d9e99ce18f>	0.0

online welding courses possible or not	"It also produces clean plastic welds and welds high-voltage connections with little power and at low temperatures.
TUW has little vibration impact on welded parts, making it a good choice for welding medical devices, sensitive electronic components, filter membranes and other thin-walled parts, such as foils. The process produces no notches, material thinning or undesirable diaphragm effect, says Home Mojal, product manager for Telsonic Solutions Inc.
When welding plastic parts, TUW is not impacted by interference media in the weld seam, such as water, grease, silicone and oil. For this reason, the procedure is very effective at seal-welding plastic enclosures with internal electronic components.
The Soniqtwist system generates few particulates and creates neat and clean edge areas during forming operations, such as swaging and riveting. It also can be used for welding filled components.
Optimizing the Process
Mojal recommends manufacturers do several things to optimize the TUW process.
- Use an energy director in most plastic welding applications. Be aware that the energy director design criteria may differ from those for linear ultrasonic welding.
- No energy director is required in most metal welding applications. The weldment, especially the one at the anvil side, should be as stiff and rigid as possible.
- Eliminate sharp corners and edges. This will prevent vibration fatigue cracks and necking.
- In metal welding, make the joining surfaces as clean as possible.
- Coatings such as silver, gold or nickel are usually no problem—and may even increase the weldability and welding strength.
- Finally, Mojal advises suppliers and OEMs to contact Telsonic as early as possible in the development process to optimize the TUW process for each application.
|The Powerwheel System: Splicing and Terminating Wires|
In 2011, Telsonic introduced the PowerWheel system at the Productronica Show in Munich. The PowerWheel system is an offshoot of Telsonic’s standard TUW technology, Soniqtwist. But whereas Soniqtwist is for general welding, the PowerWheel is designed specifically for splicing and terminating wires.

mechanical bull injury liability waiver enforceable new york law court ruling details	"It is a busy fall for consignment law in New York. News has been making the rounds this month about a decision by the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, New York’s intermediate appeals court. The Appellate Division ruled that an auctioneer must disclose the name of any owner who has consigned the work for sale, or a sale against a successful bidder cannot be enforced. The auction world is in an uproar, but the result actually derives from a version of a very old law called the Statute of Frauds about what has to be in writing for a contract to be enforceable, for reasons that have nothing to do with art or auctions.
A few years ago, the William J. Jenack auction house in Chester, New York, auctioned for sale an object described as “Fine Russian Silver/Enamel Covered Box with Gilt Interior, Signed I.P. Khlebnikov, 19th Century. Height 1½""; Top 2½"" x 3 5/8"",” which apparently came to be seen as the work of renowned silversmith Ivan Petrovich Khlebnikov. The high bidder was a man named Albert Rabizadeh, but after the sale Rabizadeh did not pay.
A recap of the typical auction/payment process is informative: after a buyer goes to cash out with the auction clerk, the buyer gets an invoice. That invoice will ordinarily include details like the date, the bidder’s name/number, and the winning bid. If the work was sold on consignment, sometimes the owner’s name will be included too. Rabizadeh’s invoice stated only that the consignor was “consignor #428.”
Jenack sued Rabizadeh, presumably on the argument that he breached the contract to buy the object. Jenack won, and after some procedural wrangling over the damages to be paid relative to the subsequent resale, the case was appealed again.
The Appellate Division focused on New York General Obligations Law § 5-701, the New York version of what is known as the Statute of Frauds. Dating to medieval England, the Statute of Frauds is in fact the statute actually designed to prevent fraud, codifying what kinds of agreements have to be in writing to be enforceable."	<urn:uuid:a3bb9601-9651-4b49-b4e4-5c18070e197b>	0.0
controlled substances medical use regulation	"Turkey has introduced regulations for manufacturing, categorizing, distributing and importing pyrotechnic substances. The new rules require pyrotechnic substances meet minimum composition and labeling standards, as well as comply with related European Union and international standards.
The Regulation on Certification, Placing into Market and Audit of the Pyrotechnic Substances (“Regulation”) was published in Official Gazette number 29845 on 2 October 2016, entering into effect on the same date.
Notable aspects of the Regulation include:
- Pyrotechnic substances are classified into three categories, based on their types of use, sound levels and objectives (fireworks, stage and theater, and other). Each category is sub-divided further, pursuant to the hazard level, and an age limit is established for use.
- Pyrotechnic substances are subject to:
- Harmonized EU Standards (or equivalent Harmonized Turkish Standards), and
- Provisions of the CE Marking Regulation, implemented by the Council of Ministers’ Decree number 2011/2588 on 16 December 2011.
- Manufacturers of pyrotechnic substances must:
- Prepare the necessary technical file
- Implement the conformity assessment procedure.
- Organize an EU conformity declaration.
- Affix CE marking to the pyrotechnic substances.
- Manufacturers must label pyrotechnic substances to ensure they are traceable. Labels should include information such as minimum safety distance and availability to use in open air.
- Before placing pyrotechnic substances into the Turkish market, parties (including importers and distributors) must:
- Ensure conformity assessment procedures have been implemented.
- The substance bears the CE marking.
- The substances complies with the Regulation.
- The Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology can appoint impartial legal entities with adequate technical knowledge and experience to assess conformity.
- The Ministry must take all appropriate measures to address threats posed by pyrotechnic substances to the safety of health, property, the environment, or public interest, within this scope of this Regulation.

I'm doing home repairs - what's the safest way to work high up?	"The best way to repair any type of surface, whether a brick or a concrete slab, is with stucco. Although stucco can be difficult to work with if not applied correctly, it can be done for any kind of surface. With some level of DIY expertise, anyone can handle most minor stucco repairs, but it’s wise to leave the more complex repairs to professional contractors as you might end up doing even more damage than good.
With so many different types of stucco products on the market, and so many companies claiming to offer “the best,” how do you know which one you should buy? The first step is to consider the area that will need repairs, including what type of repairs are needed. For example, if your home has siding, then a specific type of stucco is probably not necessary. However, there are other types of stucco that are better suited to siding repairs.
Next, you should determine the size and type of damage that needs to be repaired. If your home has extensive damage, it may not be possible for you to repair the entire surface yourself, so having a professional come out and inspect your home is probably in your best interest. In the case of damaged areas that cannot be fixed by hand, such as a cracked driveway or sidewalk, you should contact a stucco company that specializes in driveway repairs. A professional stucco company should also be able to recommend the best products for repairing damage caused by hail, tree limbs, or other objects. The company should be able to provide you with some suggestions for choosing the products to use for the repairs and should let you know if they do any repair jobs on a walk-in basis.
Once you know the extent of your stucco damage and have determined the types of repairs that are necessary, you will need to decide whether the damage is so extensive that it cannot be repaired. For instance, if your home has multiple layers of siding, you might have to replace the entire roof. While the roof is not usually the first thing to be replaced, it’s still important to consider what it will cost to repair the other layers of the siding. If your home is completely destroyed by hail, then replacing the entire sections of the home might be the only option. It is wise to also check for leaks in the home, and make sure that you are aware of any problems before you start any repairs. to avoid problems later."	<urn:uuid:d98f3e87-1899-4e87-9d96-b38cbb6dacf1>	0.0

From an accessibility standpoint, I'd like to know if nuclear liver scans require more specialized facilities compared to bone radiography equipment?	"Piezosurgery for Treatment of Large Recurrent Mandibular Osteoma
Osteomas are infrequent benign bone tumors of uncertain etiology. They are usually situated at extremities and their occurrence in the jaws is relatively rare. There are 3 types of osteoma: central, peripheral, and extraskeletal. Preoperative presumptive diagnosis is performed by means of radiography using orthopantomographs, computerized tomographs, or cone beam scans. Treatment is surgical and consists of careful exeresis and curettage of the adjacent tissue. In recent years, piezoelectric surgery has been used to treat bone pathologies in the maxillofacial area, orthopedic surgery, and neurosurgery. When used for the exeresis of a bone lesion, the device minimizes risks and eliminates possible complications arising from affectation of the vascular and nerve structures close to the lesion.Objective:
This clinical report describes a peripheral mandibular osteoma situated in the left mandibular basilar which recurred 45 years after surgical treatment at another center.Methods:
For resection, the surgical approach followed the scar remaining from the earlier surgery and was performed using piezoelectric surgery. Surgery did not cause hemorrhagic complications, affect the sensitivity of the left labial menton, or cause paralysis of the lower lip.Conclusions:
Based on the present patient, it may be concluded that mandibular osteoma treatment by means of piezoelectric surgery makes precise exeresis possible with less affectation of the important surrounding structures such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve."	<urn:uuid:3e0842be-0b36-4177-a886-ae44aba3b8a3>	0.0

old greek story where can warrior dies after fighting somebody on marble floor	"Movie Review: Warrior (2011)
I still don’t really “get” MMA (mixed martial arts) — whenever I see it on TV it reminds me of a prison shower — but Warrior, starring Aussie Joel Edgerton and Inception‘s and soon to be The Dark Knight Rises’s Tom Hardy, has convinced me to give the sport a second look.
Warrior is, without a doubt, the best MMA movie of all time (given that the competition includes Never Back Down I and II, Fighting and Undisputed II and III), and is arguably one of the best films of the year. You might say it’s 2011’s The Fighter (the true story of Micky Ward starring Marky Mark and Batman) — a riveting family drama disguised as a violent sports film.
Without the benefit of a “true story” behind it, Warrior does have the danger of being construed as cliched, but as always, it’s all about the execution of the story. I don’t want to give too much away because the mysteries of the relationships play a big part in the film’s allure and sustaining the drama. Tom Hardy is Tommy, a child wrestling prodigy who escaped his abusive father (and trainer) with his mother as a teenager. Edgerton is his big brother Brendan, a former UFC fighter turned struggling physics teacher. Nick Nolte plays their reformed father. The event that brings them all together is Sparta, a $5 million winner-takes-all grand prix-style MMA tournament featuring the world’s top fighters, including a frightening undefeated Russian champion.
There is a sense of inevitability in this Gavin O’Connor film (he also wrote the script and co-produced), but it hardly matters because Warrior is a genuinely moving, gripping and explosive drama that touches on such universal themes as forgiveness, redemption and unbreakable familial bonds. I don’t think the film would be what it is without the top-notch performances of its three stars. Tom Hardy brings a brooding, tragic presence to the enigmatic Tommy, while Edgerton is picture perfect as the underdog fighting for his family. And Nolte pretty much has his mumbling old man thing down pat, and is perhaps the most heartbreaking character of them all."	<urn:uuid:52f7c74c-da65-4791-b595-c4b2e25c36cb>	0.0

how virtual switches handle data plane without specialized hardware	"16.1. MySQL Cluster Overview
MySQL Cluster is a technology that enables
clustering of in-memory databases in a share-nothing system. The
share-nothing architecture allows the system to work with very
inexpensive hardware, and without any specific requirements on
hardware or software. It also does not have any single point of
failure because each component has its own memory and disk.
MySQL Cluster integrates the standard MySQL server with an
in-memory clustered storage engine called
In our documentation, the term
NDB refers to
the part of the setup that is specific to the storage engine,
whereas “MySQL Cluster” refers to the combination of
MySQL and the
NDB storage engine.
A MySQL Cluster consists of a set of computers, each running a
number of processes including MySQL servers, data nodes for NDB
Cluster, management servers, and (possibly) specialized data
access programs. The relationship of these components in a cluster
is shown here:
All these programs work together to form a MySQL Cluster. When
data is stored in the
NDB Cluster storage
engine, the tables are stored in the data nodes. Such tables are
directly accessible from all other MySQL servers in the cluster.
Thus, in a payroll application storing data in a cluster, if one
application updates the salary of an employee, all other MySQL
servers that query this data can see this change immediately.
The data stored in the data nodes for MySQL Cluster can be
mirrored; the cluster can handle failures of individual data nodes
with no other impact than that a small number of transactions are
aborted due to losing the transaction state. Because transactional
applications are expected to handle transaction failure, this
should not be a source of problems.
By bringing MySQL Cluster to the Open Source world, MySQL AB makes
clustered data management with high availability, high
performance, and scalability available to all who need it."	<urn:uuid:e80ed7b7-ef16-4dbd-ab93-da8e6ac6468b>	0.0
I want to start a fish tank - what are the basics for keeping fish healthy and making it look nice?	"Overall, I would definitely recommend these fish fingers to everybody as they are filled with flavour for a bargain price of 60p, who could say no? Thanks for reading.
Whenever my son has his friend round for tea, his friend always leaves most of his food. I always make sure that he likes what I am making prior to cooking but it really makes no difference. With this in mind and with my son mentioning that he had eaten fish fingers at his friends the week before I thought I would buy a packet for this weeks feast!
Most of the fish fingers in the frozen aisle were around the £2 mark, some a little more. Fortunately in the 'specials' freezer at the end of the aisle I spotted the basics fish fingers - normally I have to seek out basics products, it is very rare to find them so readily on display!
Ten fish fingers are sold in a cardboard box. Simply packaged as with all other basics products. Plain white with the trade mark orange basics logo.
At 99p, I didn't expect too much from the fish fingers - but as they would be likely to be left on the plate anyway, I wasn't too bothered.
The fingers are covered in bread crumbs and and look pretty much the same as any branded fish finger. They are perhaps a little thinner but this is negligible.
I cooked all ten at once - in the oven on a baking tray. They take 15 minutes to cook from frozen. They can also be grilled for 10-12 minutes, or fried for 5-6 minutes.
What went in to the oven a pale-ish orangey colour, came out a nice warm autumnal brown/orange.
There isn't a horrible fishy smell as they cook, or when they are removed from the oven which is good as I find these smells tend to linger in the kitchen.
It would be rude not to try one of the fingers so I did. In the past I have found breaded fingers to be a little crispy for my liking, however long I cook them for. Not so in this case, the fingers are easily cut with a knife, they almost fall apart on cutting. The fish inside is extremely moist and I have to say very tasty. So tasty that my sampling of the product resulted in my consuming 3 of the fingers one after the other! The third with tomato sauce!"	<urn:uuid:72c48eb8-f4fd-4029-849a-43a04614d5c4>	0.0

In what way did private businesses have the power to influence television news content through their advertising?	"Hire an experienced consultant to tackle the work you don’t have the time and resources to do.
Public Relations & Community Outreach
PR builds your sphere of influence through established media channels without the burden of paying to play. Businesses and organizations rely on expert communication to the public to:
- Promote community initiatives
- Address crises
- Mobilize support
You deserve to reach your audience without paid advertising, which often proves ineffective in furthering messages in true depth. Paid ads may seem the most direct way to your audience, but discerning audiences easily spot the difference between earned media and sponsored content. Being featured in renowned local, regional and national news outlets lends credibility to your community outreach strategy.
Your business or organization has a story to tell. You must tell it well by building and promoting a narrative around what you do.
Great PR professionals find ways to make the news. They find opportune times to weigh in on key events affecting clients and stakeholders. They turn your organization into a human-interest machine — beyond the occasional press release — using established and trusted media channels to amplify the message.
Enlisting the unbiased eyes of a third-party consultant helps to adjust failing strategies, refine messaging and produce a volume of multimedia.
Digital Marketing & Website Development
We live in a digitally dominated world. So where do you tell your brand’s story? Online, of course, where you’re sure to reach your audience as they seek answers to questions and engage with content virtually all day, every day, on multiple devices.
Users act and engage online in specific ways. It’s who they are: wonderfully different and unique in every way. They seek digital storytelling for education, enlightenment and entertainment in the following places:
- Social media
- & More
Businesses and organizations must strategize helpful digital content to meet audience needs. Whether you work in B2B or B2C markets, digital marketing should establish thought leadership in your industry. Great website development and digital presence — with a little edge from SEO — boosts relevant traffic and qualified sales leads while helping to retain brand evangelists.
But storytelling for the sake of storytelling doesn’t tell your brand’s story on its own. It must be crafted, honed, developed, revised, scrapped and revised again. Here, too, an unbiased consultant proves valuable in constructing effective messaging and distributing where appropriate online.

What changes did Michigan's Funeral Representative Law from 2016 bring to funeral arrangements and who can be appointed as a funeral representative?	"Funeral Director: Unclaimed Remains Becoming National Problem
DETROIT (WWJ) With more people choosing cremation, funeral homes in metro Detroit are reporting a growing problem: unclaimed cremated remains.
Several local funeral homes say they have storage closets full of urns holding the remains of loved ones who have nowhere to go.
Patrick Lynch, director of Lynch & Sons Funeral Home in Clawson, has about 40 unclaimed remains. The past president of the National Funeral Directors Association said it’s becoming a national problem.
“When they would have a cremation in years past, they would think ‘Well, everything is all done’. But it’s not, because something does remain. The cremated remains need to be interred or placed somewhere,” Lynch said.
By Michigan law, funeral homes have to hold remains for 30 days.
After that? The kindness of strangers comes into play.
Funeral homes can keep them, or turn them over to a cemetery.
Lynch’s advice: Be very clear with your family where you want your remains to end up.
“We always discuss at the time the arrangements are being made ‘What are the family’s intention following the cremation …’ It’s alarming, actually, how many people have not thought to that point,” Lynch said."	<urn:uuid:c89cf60c-87e6-4c8b-a45b-36b5f70ad99f>	0.0
As a marine biologist studying gull feeding behaviors, I'm curious about how gulls manage to process both fresh and salt water, and what specialized adaptations they have for different feeding methods?	"I don't have a complete understanding of the structural variability in g.glaucoides, but the individuals I've seen in Newfoundland have all been very short-billed round headed individuals. I'm sure there is much overlap with Kumlien's so this is just an accessory feature to be used along with mantle shade, eye color and primary coloration.

g.glaucoides Iceland Gull, January, Newfoundland. Note the steep forehead and very rounded crown, along with short bill creating gentle expression.
This article is not meant to be a definitive work on the separation of these two subspecies, but rather a discussion of some of my observations here in Newfoundland. As I continue to get a better grasp on the potential variation that exists in g.glaucoides I hope to update this article.We're still learning more about these birds every day!For now I'll leave you with one last photo that serves to accentuate the extreme variation found within this species.

""Yellow-legged Gulls of Newfoundland""
Let me preface this post by saying this is not meant to be a treatise on the identification of Yellow-legged Gulls,there has already been lots written on that topic and better presented than I'm capable of doing here. I'm writing this purely to show what our Yellow-legged Gulls look like in hopes that it might assist other birders in finding Yellow-legged Gulls outside Newfoundland. I'll present evidence to demonstrate that Newfoundland YLGU's are likely of the subspecies atlantis and will also include criteria for separation from possible hybrid look-alikes such as HERG X LBBG. Even though its nice having the monopoly on this species for North America,I suspect a few YLGU's are flying under the radar of east coast birder in other provinces and states.
Most of what we know about Yellow-legged Gull in North America comes from the hard work done by the 'Godfather' of Newfoundland gulling, Bruce Mactavish. Bruce had been finding these mysterious Yellow-legged, dark mantled birds for years before they were ever considered a separate species and long before anyone else cared about them."	<urn:uuid:723efe8c-7675-435a-8a34-4036011658f5>	0.0
need info maintenance requirements how often seal rammed earth floor what materials use	"Don’t Throw Out the Warranty Certificate
Okay, so quartz countertops are usually manufactured and installed with a long warranty period, but that’s doesn’t mean the material is indestructible!
It’s important to remember that while quartz is hardy, it’s still an amalgam and it can crack or break in very rare circumstances. Your warranty certificate will stipulate specific maintenance requirements and who to call in this instance.
2. Avoid Household Cleaning Products
Your quartz countertops are actually so low maintenance that you really don’t need to use harsh household cleaning products in order to clean them.
In fact, some of these products contain chemicals which can loosen and damage the resin, bonds, and mineral pieces within your countertop material. If you want to be extra careful, opt for a stone-safe quartz cleaner and polish.
3. Avoid Harsh Scrubbing
If you want to dull the natural sheen of your quartz countertops, harsh materials such as scourers and steel wool will damage the top finish. Stay away from store-bought scrubbing materials and opt for a soft nylon brush to remove stains and gunk from the surface.
4. Never Use Sharp Materials While Cleaning
This is a big no-no when it comes to maintaining the quality of quartz material. It’s perfectly safe to rest knives on the countertops, but avoid using them to remove dried stains or materials.
Instead, go for a soft plastic knife or scraper to lift off hardened materials from your countertops.
5. There’s No Need to Seal Your Countertops
The great thing about quartz is that it’s a non-porous material which does not require any sealing, unlike other stone materials such as granite. The polished factory finish on your quartz countertops is enough to ensure the material will last decades if cleaned frequently, in the correct manner.
6. Keep Cleaning Simple
Seriously, the cleaning of quartz countertops does not need to be overcomplicated. All you need is a soft washcloth, some warm soapy water and you’re good to go.
It’s best to avoid common dish detergents that contain astringents or other harsh chemicals. Alternatively, go for a specific quartz cleaning cleaner and polish.
Bear in mind that warm water is always far more effective in removing stubborn stains that cold water.
7. Use a Vinegar Solution For a Deep Clean
Over time food particles and mineral deposits form a film over the surface of your countertops."	<urn:uuid:a8441a81-6ca3-498c-bbb8-61d2dac8b6bc>	0.0
body parts affected superficial blisters disease	"Polymyositis is a connective tissue disease that triggers inflammation and muscular weakness. The cause is unknown, but polymyositis is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, possibly triggered by a viral infection of muscle tissue.
The disease is more common in women than men and tends to develop between the ages of 50 to 70 years, although anyone of any age or either sex can be affected. Usually, the muscle weakness develops gradually over the course of a few weeks or months. The inflammation may spread to other areas of the body including the heart.
Since symptoms differ between individuals, polymyositis is hard to diagnose and may be mistaken for muscular dystrophy. In many cases, polymyositis is associated with other autoimmune disorders of connective tissue such as scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren’s syndrome.
Symptoms of polymyositis
The symptoms include:
- The shoulders and hips usually affected first
- Muscular weakness
- Muscle wastage
- Muscle pain
- Swallowing difficulties
- Tremors, particularly of the hands
- Wide-footed stance and walking style
- Tendency to fall over.
Progression of weakness
Polymyositis develops gradually over weeks or months. By the time the person experiences symptoms, they have already lost around half of their muscle fibres to the disease. The head, hands and feet are usually untouched by the disease. Difficulties may include:
- Profound muscular weakness in affected body parts, such as being unable to lift the arms above shoulder height or lift the head off a pillow
- Voice changes, if the muscles of the larynx are affected
- Problems with swallowing if the oesophagus is affected, with a tendency to regurgitate food
- Peristalsis (the muscular contractions of the bowel) may falter, leading to constipation
- In its later stages, abnormal shortening of muscles (contracture).
A malfunction of the immune system
The cause of polymyositis hasn’t been found, but there is good evidence to indicate that it is likely to be an autoimmune disorder, which means the immune cells mistakenly attack the muscle fibres of the body. If a small tag (biopsy) of affected muscle is examined in a laboratory, it looks withered and studded with immune system cells."	<urn:uuid:b7bca838-6387-4010-a2eb-44917dc65254>	0.0
I've been researching gas detection methods in astronomy, and I'm curious about how astronomers observe neutral hydrogen distributions at both cosmic and local scales - what techniques do they use to map neutral hydrogen in proto-superclusters versus the heliosphere?	"ARCHES Commitment to Community, Energy and Environmental Equity and Justice
The US is on the brink of a clean hydrogen energy revolution. Past energy revolutions have benefited society unequally, with benefits going more to the wealthy and powerful, and adverse impacts falling more on the poor and disenfranchised. ARCHES is committed to a just and equitable hydrogen energy transition for all, with positive benefits for everyone, especially California’s most disadvantaged. ARCHES will prioritize projects that directly result in cleaner air for impacted communities, and ensure real community involvement at all levels and genuine economic opportunity for all.
ARCHES is a public-private partnership created to facilitate California’s transition to clean renewable zero emission hydrogen (H2) energy. Its goals are to displace fossil fuels and decarbonize our economy with environmental and energy justice and equity, quality of life for our communities, and good green careers for our workers.
The federal government plans to award up to $1 billion each to up to ten regional US “Hydrogen Hubs.” The goal is to develop regional hydrogen production, transportation, storage, and end-use infrastructure to reduce the cost of hydrogen to $2/kg (and ultimately $1/kg), and displace fossil fuels as an energy source.
What is ARCHES?
The Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES) is a public-private partnership created to facilitate California’s transition to clean renewable zero emission hydrogen (H2) energy. It was co-founded by the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, the University of California, a statewide labor coalition organized by the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California, and the Renewables 100 Policy Institute. Serving as a neutral convener on behalf of the DOE and the State, ARCHES is committed to a just and equitable hydrogen energy transition, with integration of local communities in all aspects and phases of its operation, from project selection to governance. ARCHES will maintain transparency in its operations and prioritize clean renewable hydrogen projects that displace fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, create new green careers for California workers, and benefit California’s disadvantaged communities.
ARCHES Commitments to Community, Energy and Environmental Equity and Justice
ARCHES will only fund production, distribution storage and use of clean renewable hydrogen.
ARCHES will not fund blending of hydrogen in natural gas distribution pipelines.
ARCHES will include Organized Labor, Cities and Local Governments, Tribal Nations, Communities and Environmental Justice Organizations in its governance and decision-making."	<urn:uuid:8d3f75f2-bae9-40ba-b266-1f0905927f76>	0.0

New DCC Resource: Disciplinary Metadata
The issue of disciplinary metadata standards - what they are, who's using them, how to use them - has been gaining attention in the RDM community. To support this, the DCC has created a Disciplinary Metadata page for those who need help figuring out what standards might address their own needs. Rather than archival metadata standards, the resource focuses on descriptive standards that aid in data re-use; this is the information a repository manager might give a researcher curious about what his or her discipline has decided should be the minimum information kept alongside their data sets. The initial focus has been on metadata standards for tab-delimited data.

As a ruminant nutrition specialist, I'm researching methane emissions from cattle digestion. What is the role of protein in ruminant digestion, and how does this relate to their contribution to global warming?	"This is the average amount of nitrous oxide (N2O) that is in the atmosphere in a given month. The monthly average highlights the seasonal variation. The graph shows the last 3 years to highlight the seasonal variation.
Nitrous oxide has a large warming effect, with a Global Warming Potential (GWP) that is 273 times greater than CO2. Like CO2, but unlike methane, it stays in the atmosphere for a long time, on average 116 years. Besides its warming potential, nitrous oxide is also important because it depletes the ozone layer, which protects us from the sun’s ultraviolet rays.Wikipedia: Nitrous oxide Atmospheric occurrence
The primary unit here is parts per billion (ppb), which describes the average concentration of atmospheric methane per year. The secondary unit here is teragrams, which describes the average weight of atmospheric methane per year. We show this to be able to relate to emissions, which are commonly expressed in teragrams.Wikipedia: Parts-per notation
There is a light global seasonal cycle, with higher growth rates between October and March and less growth between April and September. Seasonal variation occurs both in the natural surface emissions and in the natural breakdown in the stratosphere.Wikipedia: Methane in Earth's Atmosphere

What is the examination like to determine if someone has dry eyes?
A large part of the examination is finding out what the patient is experiencing and determining the type of dry eye causing the symptoms. We examine the surface of the eye under a microscope to look at the quantity and the quality of the tear film. Additionally, we examine the eyelids and the glands inside the eyelids to insure they are healthy. More about Dry Eyes…
What are the typical treatments for dry eyes?
There are a wide range of treatments ranging from over the counter products to specialty laser procedures. Many times we start with using artificial tears and vitamin supplements that can help boost the tear film. There are prescription eye drops that can aid in tear production as well as laser procedures for patients with more advanced dry eye. More about Dry Eyes…
Are there any recommendations to help people avoid dry eye?

prehistoric ice age animals survival how did life continue during global freeze	"In the game Ark: Survival Evolved, the fastest flying animal is the Pteranodon, which is a species of pterosaur. When sprinting, the Pteranodon can reach speeds of up to 131 kilometers per hour (81 miles per hour) making it the fastest flying animal in the game.
Survival Evolved is a popular open-world survival game that features a variety of prehistoric creatures, including dinosaurs and other ancient animals. One of the creatures in the game is the Pteranodon, which is a type of pterosaur or flying reptile that lived during the late Cretaceous period.
In Ark, players can tame and ride Pteranodons, using them as a means of aerial transportation to travel around the game's vast map. The Pteranodon is a fast flyer and can reach impressive speeds when sprinting. When using its sprint ability, the Pteranodon can achieve speeds of up to 131 kilometers per hour (81 miles per hour).
It's worth noting that the Pteranodon's sprint ability has a cooldown period, so players cannot use it continuously. Additionally, the Pteranodon's speed can also be affected by factors such as its level, stats, and the weight of the rider.
Overall, the Pteranodon is a valuable creature in Ark due to its speed and agility, making it an excellent choice for players who want to quickly traverse the game's vast terrain."	<urn:uuid:4bb0f2db-bed6-4569-88ac-adfdca64e75e>	0.0
How do scientists study marine mammals in Monterey Bay?	"Conducting sonar activities more than 9.5 million times that will harm marine mammals without taking adequate steps to significantly reduce the amount of harm to these and other coastal resources cannot be consistent with California’s Coastal Management Program- whose goal is to protect, preserve, and enhance our coastal environment.
The last time the Navy came before the Commission, the Commission found that these training exercises could only be found consistent if the Navy implemented a set of measures to reduce harm to marine mammals. The Navy refused to comply with the Commission’s recommendations and conducted its training exercises without implementing the measures designed to protect California’s marine resources. Stranded whales are the most visible symptom of the deadly impacts of sonar- over the past 40 years, cumulative research across the globe has revealed a correlation between naval sonar activities and decompression sickness in beached marine mammals. Many of these beached whales show evidence of suffering from physical trauma, including bleeding around the brain, ears and other tissues, and large bubbles in their organs. Scientists believe that the Navy’s sonar blasts may drive whales and dolphins to change their dive patterns- surfacing too quickly, resulting in decompression sickness.
The Navy is poised to do the same thing again. We must bolster the resolve of the Commission and ensure that it continues to stand up to the Navy. Please help us tell the California Coastal Commission that the Navy must do more to protect our coastal resources.
Background materials on the Navy's Sonar and Munitions Program and the Coastal Commission can be found here."	<urn:uuid:efc28013-5d66-4828-aa93-122bcd250d8c>	0.0

To explain Mod Mics they use an adhesive to simply attach a microphone to any of your headphones/headsets and they work beautifully therefore eliminating your reasons to stick to “gamer” brand variety and with a mod mic you get cable clamps that you can use to simple clamp the cable into an all in one unit so its not in the way I have one myself. I recommended the 58x due to various reasons as it has some of the best sound for it’s price, its an open back, and it has fantastic imaging and sound that it allows you better pin point accuracy on where the sound is coming from which is beneficial in gaming, top that off with it has a more flat sound which caters to a very wide variety of music making it a fantastic all rounder. There is a few others I can recommend in the headphone brand variety but it may be best for you to stay in a low requirement all rounder category as other headphones are more catered towards different styles of sound."	<urn:uuid:dc9c6d18-ce03-405b-a583-ed2a6f681365>	0.0
I've been reading about unexplained phenomena in cosmic ray detection, and I'm wondering what's currently known about the mysterious high-energy cosmic rays that go beyond the 'knee' in the spectrum?	"When someone has gone through all 7 Earth Rays (colors/chakras/emotional life lessons/dimensions/frequencies), you bring them together in a moment of unity and direct connection to the zero-point portal within themselves, allowing them to experience an “awake” moment in their connection to their own source of unconditional love, after which they shoot/ascend into the ray/dimension/frequency of the subsequent seven Galactic Rays. Once you yourself have also passed through and embodied those seven galactic Rays, the next key is activated within you. The Cosmic Key. This is the Fifteenth Rainbow Ray Zero-Point Transition Portal from the Seven Galactic Rays to the Seven Cosmic Rays. Once you have gone through these seven Cosmic Rays this process repeats itself and your Creator Key is activated for the 22nd Rainbow Ray Zero-Point Transition portal to the seven creator Rays.
Through the conversation with your Higher Self, I now understand what I have been going through the past 9 years. After my activation moment of my first key, the galactic key, I noticed during my Shiatsu Sessions with souls that I connected them without any effort to their source of unconditional love. As a result, the men who came for a shiatsu sessions started to confuse this experience, with the illusion of being in love with me. It was their own source of love that they were allowed to experience in that moment. This became so bad that I eventually stopped giving Shiatsu for a period of time. LOL. Was also necessary because I had to work through all seven galactic Rays/dimensions myself. Memories, DNA activations etc. At that time I lost everything, including my health and the path of my soul took me to a magical place in the middle of the Ardennes. Here I was allowed to patch myself up again in peace and work through all seven galactic and cosmic layers. My creator key has now been activated on February 22 this year. And now I work from the 3rd rainbow zero point portal of transition. The 22nd dimension/frequency. Which means I can now work with all three keys. So I can assist others when they are ready, with the transition from terrestrial to galactic, from galactic to cosmic, and from cosmic to creator. The 22nd frequency is my home frequency. Which puts me in the middle of the process of remembering all about home, Cassiopea."	<urn:uuid:deef3564-9d14-434b-ba1f-595e98c5aafb>	0.0
How do they make metal-looking props shiny?	"We are not quite sure how to label this post, but whatever the title the shoot made for an intriguing style…The tiddly hat worn atop the models head is often referred to as a ‘Fascinator’…
The model had the basic Bodice and lace dress to which we added the finishing touches. Of course ladies would not have worn nylon in those days, but the model had some delightful ink to display on her legs that we wanted to show through, so transparent shiny pantyhose were the order of the day.
Also we showcased one of our favourite props here. An original Jean Paul Gaultier Rubber Umbrella with ornate handle, which is currently on sale on eBay.
We also employed a combination of studio lamps punching light into the scene and natural light as seen in the shot above, whilst partaking of afternoon tea.
We had many bluebells growing in our garden and so found it appropriate to make up a little seasonal bouquet to complement her intricate make up.

I'm trying to learn meditation on my own but feel overwhelmed. What do experienced teachers say is needed to succeed in any spiritual practice?	"I remember my high school teachers so much more vividly than my elementary school teachers.
It is time for administrators and teachers to come together. We need to create a culture and climate where teachers don’t think they are being targeted or looking to be caught doing something wrong. They need to feel that no matter what the situation is they will get the backing of their administration. Administration and teachers need to work together so that people want to come to work every day. I can help make that happen.
There has to be trust created. I do not need a master’s degree to create trust. All that is needed for trust to bloom is time and consistency. I feel confident in my ability to work with parents, students, teachers, and other staff in a way that people are comfortable coming to me. I know that I am able to create relationships with other people in a way that is genuine.
For all the fear and trepidation that I have there is more excitement and positivity running through my body. This will be a new journey that forces me to use everything I have ever learned in life as well as test my ability to learn on the fly. I will fall but I will not fail.

What are the 4 teaching approaches for speech disabilities?	"17 of 2002, defines, ""severe or profound intellectual disability"" to mean, ""a range of intellectual functioning extending from partial self-maintenance under close supervision, together with limited self-protection skills in a controlled environment through limited self care and requiring constant aid and supervision, to severely restricted sensory and motor functioning and requiring nursing care"".
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was ratified by South Africa in November 2007, sets out in article 1 thereof that, ""persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others"".
This ""definition"" is preferred by the South African disability sector.
As 9 October rapidly approaches, it is interesting to consider how the 2011 census determines whether a person has a disability. For census purposes, the understanding of disability is inferred by the questions that will be posed to those interviewed to determine their status.
In the 1996 census, people were asked the following in relation to their disability status:
"" Does the person have a serious sight, hearing, physical or mental disability? If yes, circle all applicable disabilities for the person: Sight 1; Hearing/Speech 2; Physical disability 3; Mental disability 4"".
By the 2001 census, the question was remodelled as follows:
"" Do you have any serious disability that prevents your full participation in life activities (such as education, work, social life)? MARK ANY THAT APPLY. None, Sight, Hearing, Communication, Physical, Intellectual, Emotional (Yes/No response options)"".
On the basis of this question, the data collected in the 2001 census indicated that there were about two and a quarter million (2 255 982) people with various forms of disability in South Africa, constituting 5% of the total population enumerated in that census.1 On a global scale, more than a billion people or about 15% of the world's population are estimated to live with some form of disability, based on 2010 global population estimates.2
There has been extensive analysis into the manner in which these questions have been formulated.3 In her presentation Disability Measurement and Statistics - The State of the Notion4, Marguerite Schneider points out that there are many individual factors that are subjectively considered when responding to the question ""are you disabled?"""	<urn:uuid:e00e1c33-e3d8-4a8b-abcd-5384aff80867>	0.0
differences between epoxy polyester vinyl ester resins boat building applications surface preparation requirements	"Click Image to Enlarge
The growing wind-energy market is spurring development of products from improved reinforcements to enormously large vacuum bags. One example is Owens Corning’s new WindStrand glass roving and fabric for wind blades.
New carbon fiber developments include both thinner veils and thicker 3D braided preforms—like Biteam’s engine bracket shown here.
The need for faster production prompted a switch from thermoset to thermoplastic composites for this prize-winning golf cart. It’s made from a moldable braided preform of commingled carbon and nylon 12 fibers from Schappe in France.
Saint-Gobain’s Uniconform continuous glass mat has an entangled loop construction that lets it fill sharp corners in molds without voids.
Many of the resins and reinforcements introduced at JEC, the big international composites show in Paris this spring, are intended to make molding processes faster and more efficient, especially for large parts such as wind blades. The continuing in flux of thermoplastics reflects that trend, since thermoplastic composites generally permit faster processing than thermosets and result in lower costs. Also prominent at the show were new thermosets for higher temperatures and new reinforcements based on basalt or carbon fibers with weight and other advantages over glass.
Basalt & other fiber news
Basalt fibers, a promising new reinforcement, are becoming more readily available. Kamenny Vek in Russia has started up a new furnace that will add 10 million lb/yr to its current capacity of 2.5 million lb/yr. Basalt is 20% to 30% stronger than E glass and only 5% heavier, so using it can save weight and cost. Basalt producers also claim that glass fibers in composites, unlike basalt, necessitate more frequent maintenance of waste incinerators.
Kamenny Vek came out with a new 600 tex basalt-fiber tape and is working with Ahlstrom Glassfibre Oy in Finland to develop a multifunctional (multi-resin) sizing for basalt fibers. The target is lighter weight reinforcement for very large parts like windmill blades. Ahlstrom says the new sizing will be available on basalt fabrics this year in all standard commercial weaves, for the same price as previous basalt fabrics sized for single resins such as epoxy, vinyl ester, and polyester."	<urn:uuid:0a2aa358-5ba2-4314-928e-394181ccf62e>	0.0

Embalmed Animals: An attempt to link the work of the artists Damien Hirst and Giorgos Tsakiris
Is it possible to associate the work of the Greek artist Yiorgos Tsakiris with the much-discussed “shark” of the well-known British artist Damien Hirst? The latter particularly emphasizes the immortality of the natural beings he uses (both through the title and through formaldehyde, which may be as important as the shark itself). Tsakiris, on the other hand, is interested in the whole life cycle – birth, life, death or sowing, growth, rearing in agriculture.
If you look at the works of George Tsakiris in a place that is not defined as “artistic”, especially if he is, on the contrary, defined as “scientific as in an exhibition he has set up at the laboratories of the biology department of the Aristotle University, then it will be in a relentless confusion. And what are the boundaries between Tsakiris’ works and the “real” exhibits of the workshop?
This “non-expert” viewer (as if the “specialists” have many more tools to find their way…) will probably feel bewildered or even irritated by his inability to distinguish works of art from scientific material. Undoubtedly the labels next to Tsakiris’ works (but probably not the labels next to the permanent scientific exhibits) will help the situation. But the confusion will stay."	<urn:uuid:5eaf795e-58b3-401c-b753-112fcd5374d7>	0.0
countries sharing land border eritrea location	"From the July-August 2015 issue of News & Letters
by Ron Kelch
“Where are human rights? Where is humanity?” exclaimed Naser Alden Abdulaziz, as French border police stopped him from crossing the border from Italy. Abdulaziz is fleeing the hell of a decade of ethnic violence and genocide in Darfur, Sudan, and, along with others from Libya and Eritrea, demonstrated and started a hunger strike at the border, declaring they will never return. Millions of human beings on the move all over the world are putting the global political and economic system on trial, exposing its rhetoric about human rights for what it really is: a callous disregard for the mass of humanity suffering economic destitution, ethnic violence, climate disaster, perpetual war and terror under the regime of global capitalism.
ROHINGYA FLEE IMPENDING GENOCIDE
More than a million Rohingya, who have lived for generations in Burma’s Rakhine province, have been declared a non-people in their own country since 1982. Subjected to perpetual ethnic violence and concentrated into squalid camps by Buddhist security forces, thousands have packed into tiny boats dubbed “floating coffins” provided by profiteering smugglers. They are taken out to sea, along with starving Bangladeshis and other South Asians escaping poverty—all trying to find a place to live. When navy vessels of neighboring countries—Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia—encounter them, a few provisions are handed out if they’re lucky, but then the vessels sail away.
Australia’s anti-immigrant Prime Minister Tony Abbott not only adamantly shut down any suggestion the Rohingya could go there, but, in violation of international law, has his forces stop boats and reward each member of smuggling crews $5,000 to take refugees to Indonesian waters. Bodies keep washing up on shores. Many of those who manage to land alive are discovered later in mass graves in Thailand and Malaysia.
Israeli writer Ben Samuels aptly compared the Rohingya flotilla to the SS St. Louis, which in 1939 was packed with Jews escaping the Holocaust, many of whom were killed upon returning to Europe after they were denied entry everywhere including Miami, where the State Department declared they’d have to “await their turns.” (See “Jews in 1939, Rohingya in 2015: Will the world act to prevent a 21st century SS St."	<urn:uuid:d969b176-9d7e-4073-a7b2-a3e4f0b60055>	0.0

When did spiders first appear in the fossil record?	"Evolution breaks Darwin’s own slow, gradual process maxim
This next item is included not because it is science, but because it demonstrates that not only does evolution not follow the laws of science it doesn’t even follow its own laws. Punctuated Equilibrium is an update to evolutionary theory proposed in 1972 by noted paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould. It was proposed because evolutionists realized the fossil record does not conform to Darwin’s theory of slow, gradual change of species. As Wikipedia explains it, the fossil record of an evolutionary progression:
“…typically consists of species that suddenly appear, and ultimately disappear, in many cases close to a million years later, without any change in external appearance.”
Eldredge and Gould were among the evolutionists who realized the evidence simply doesn’t fit Darwin’s theory, and instead of discarding the theory, changed it to allow what Darwin said was forbidden: saltations – or jumps in the fossil record. But as evolution evangelist Richard Dawkins acknowledges:
“Without Gradualness.. we are back to a miracle.”
Evolutionists like to pretend they believe in Darwin’s theory of slow and gradual change, but the fact that punctuated equilibrium was even proposed shows that 1.) The fossil record doesn’t support Darwin’s theory, and 2.) Evolutionists have conceded that slow gradual processes simply cannot do what they claim they can, and that in fact the only solution is something that can produce saltations – jumps. But jumps require the intervention of an agent outside of the material world; something that can intelligently manipulate natural processes to do what slow and steady processes can’t – to do what Dawkins correctly characterized as “a miracle.”
This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all the laws of science broken by evolutionary theory, but merely one sufficient to show that that Darwinian evolution does in fact break many laws of science and in fact breaks its own scientific requirements and therefore is rightfully characterized as a pseudoscience. Marine biologist Robert Carter summarizes it succinctly:
“Everything we know about the laws of chemistry, genetics, statistics and information theory argues against any life from non-life idea. But an evolutionist must believe that scientific laws are violated for life to arise from none living chemicals. That sounds like faith to me.”
So you can legitimately call evolution pseudoscience, or you could call it religion."	<urn:uuid:817c1741-736c-4b4e-b3d6-9dfb423d9740>	0.0
military expert wondering what role battlefield smoke from musket gunpowder influenced development standardized army uniforms	"The military has been quick to defend its decision to punish the men, stating that its policies regarding acceptable forms of protest are quite clear. Military guidelines state that troops may attend demonstrations only in the United States, only when they are off base and off duty, and, most critically, only when they are out of uniform.
""We don't restrict free speech,"" Maj. Anne Edgecomb, an Army spokeswoman, said. ""It's the uniform that gets people in trouble. When you wear the uniform, you are representing the armed service behind that uniform, and it is against the military code of justice to protest in uniform.""
Madden and the two other Marines were clearly documented wearing at least part of their uniforms at public protests. (Though all three had completed their active duty service, they remained reservists; the military argued that the Pentagon's conduct codes still applied to them, an assertion that seems likely to make its way to federal court.)
The military, with its hierarchal rank structure and absolute adherence to following orders, has never been an institution that takes kindly to debate from within. But today, as an increasingly unpopular war drags on and troops are being sent on second, third or fourth combat tours, the volume of criticism from veterans and even those on active duty is reaching a fevered pitch.
Perhaps the most telling part of such criticism is how open disgruntled troops are becoming despite the risk to their careers - signing their names to furious letters printed in military-owned newspapers; speaking on the record to reporters in Iraq about how badly the mission is going; writing members of Congress. And then there are the protests in uniform, a throwback to the Vietnam War era, when veterans such as Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., denounced the war in weathered fatigues, throwing away their medals.
Many of the protests involving vets in uniform are all-out street theater, such as one in Washington last spring where protesters staged a mock patrol, manhandling people at simulated gunpoint in order to illustrate how they say Iraqis are treated by American troops. Just last week in Chicago, a similar protest took place. The intended subtext of the uniformed protests is apparent: that protesters have additional credibility because they are denouncing a war they have witnessed firsthand, that the very uniforms now being used in protest have walked the real-life battlefield."	<urn:uuid:032d5506-2af1-4fcd-9e81-3b6eee85cb8e>	0.0
bpmn epc rules events notation difference	"Londerzeel and Meise conclude an EPC to make their buildings more energy efficient
As of this year, the municipalities of Meise and Londerzeel will, with the support of ENGIE Cofely and Ingenium as facilitator, render no fewer than 18 buildings more energy efficient thanks to an energy performance contract (EPC).
Thanks to EPC projects, municipalities have cut the energy consumption of their buildings by 20 to 25% as well as reducing their CO2 emissions. In Meise and Londerzeel, the EPC came into force on January 1, 2018. This is the first time that two Flemish municipalities have teamed up to submit a joint application.
Both municipalities own many buildings, most of which are old and therefore not up to current or future energy standards. In other words, they consume too much energy. In addition, most municipalities do not have the financial resources needed to invest in reducing energy consumption. Renovation work is often postponed.
The province of Flemish Brabant has also created an innovative coaching programme to help municipalities to take steps to save energy in their buildings. With this in mind, the province has opted for the EPC model. Thanks to this coaching programme, Flemish Brabant is encouraging the development of EPC projects for municipal buildings.
An EPC project
For an energy service company (ESCO), an EPC project involves implementing energy efficiency and renewable energy measures, with a contractual guarantee that the expected energy savings will be made and will continue throughout the term of the contract. The revenue generated by these savings is used to repay the cost of the investments made. This limits the financial risk for the owner of the building, in this case the municipality.
In the case at hand, the municipalities of Londerzeel and Meise decided to finance the investments themselves. If the energy savings exceed the guaranteed threshold, ENGIE Cofely and the municipalities will share the excess profits. If the savings are lower than expected, ENGIE Cofely will refund the difference. Once the financing has been repaid, all energy savings made go to the municipalities, which, after 15 years, will have more modern, energy efficient and comfortable buildings.
Londerzeel and Meise
EPCs are generally used for large buildings or groups of several buildings that consume sufficiently considerable amounts of energy."	<urn:uuid:03178b57-6d24-4369-bdab-24ac86e3619c>	0.0

recipes raw cooked kale differences	"Most cases of salmonellosis are not treated with antibiotics. In fact, antibiotics may prolong the period during which the person can infect others. Antibiotics sometimes are prescribed for infants, the chronically ill and the elderly to treat or prevent complications in those at increased risk for invasive disease.
Can salmonellosis be prevented?
People are far more likely to contract salmonellosis at home than in a restaurant, so be sure to wash hands with soap and water after toileting and before handling foods.
Salmonella bacteria are killed when food is thoroughly cooked. This means cooking ground beef to at least 155 degrees and making sure all food is cooked properly. Once cooked, any food held in a buffet should be kept hotter than 140 degrees. Cross-contamination –where food is contaminated in the kitchen after it has been cooked – may be avoided by using different utensils, plates, cutting boards and counter tops before and after cooking. Cooked food that stands at room temperature for a long time, especially poultry, is at risk.
Defrost frozen food in the refrigerator or microwave. Refrigerator temperatures should be kept colder than 40 degrees. Rinse poultry in cold water before cooking. Avoid raw milk, raw hamburger meat and raw eggs (many recipes, such as those for homemade ice cream, call for eggs with no subsequent cooking; substitute pasteurized eggs in these recipes). Food contaminated with salmonella may look, smell and taste normal.
Because fruits and vegetables have now been identified as a source of salmonella, it is important that these food items be thoroughly washed in running water before they are eaten.
Wash utensils and wooden cutting boards thoroughly with hot, soapy water. Salmonella may lie dormant for a year or more and then ""wake up"" when food is present. They also may live in the cut marks on a wooden cutting board. Use an acrylic board that can go in the dishwasher. If using a wooden board, rub down or spray the board with a solution of one ounce bleach to one gallon water and allow to air dry. Cutting boards for raw meat and poultry should not be used for cheese, raw vegetables and other foods that will not be cooked before being served.
To prevent the spread of salmonella, wash hands thoroughly after using the bathroom and before handling food. Do not allow an infected person to handle food or work in the kitchen."	<urn:uuid:83bef628-5ce6-4cc8-89d4-50d0aa2715e6>	0.0
I'm replicating old paint colors. Why do standards shift?	"About Annie Sloan
Annie already in the 90's created this unique CHALK PAINT paint. The market lacked a product that would meet her artistic needs and therefore created her own recipe. Purpose: Very good grip and ease of use. So chalk paint was created with an extraordinary palette of colors. By creating it, Annie was inspired by the various historical epochs and places she was in. Annie products are now known around the world. With the recession in Europe, there was a tendency to paint furniture, not buying new ones as it was popular in the 1990s. Also dear customer, if you dream of transforming your kitchen, chest of drawers or another piece of furniture, it is Annie Sloan's paint that is what you need to do without the big money to give the furniture a new style, color, just change it or refresh it.
The palette currently has 36 colors, which can be mixed with each other and create new colors
We encourage you to paint yourself or take part in our paintings and interior design training courses. - Click here
About Chalk Paint
Annie Sloan's paint is a very easy to use chalk paint. We can use it without any prior preparation of the furniture without so-called priming or grinding. All you have to do is to degrease your furniture with water with dishwashing liquid or extraction gas. The paint can be used on almost any surface such as wood, veneer, glass, metal, plastic, wall, floor or upholstery. You can even use it as a dye for soft fabrics and rub old curtains. We can easily paint it with furniture made of raw wood as well as varnished, covered with paint lacquer, oil paint, etc.
The advantage of the paint is also their performance because 1 liter of can can paint about 13 m2 of surface. Depending on the finishing technique, one layer is firmly covered and gives, for example, a brush structure, or the dye can be diluted and in this way the texture of the texture can be controlled using various brushes.

As someone studying feminist methodologies and bioethics, I'm curious about how empirical bioethics and feminist approaches to social sciences have evolved - can you explain their relationship?	"I don't like being introduced to other people with adjectives, unless the description is something relevant to the person I'm being introduced to, which would then help to provide a topic for small talk. For example,
'This is Sya, she's from RJ.'Fine if I'm meeting someone who's an alumni. Not fine if not.
'She's a feminist.'Awesome if I'm meeting a feminist academic or who does women-related work. Not awesome if male, misogynist, or feminist-hating.
'She's a dancer.'Great if I'm meeting someone who does something related to performing arts. Not great if clueless about dance or has a fetish for flexible people.
Why does this make me uncomfortable? It took me a long time to figure it out, but it's because I realise that my identity, activities or experience have been appropriated against my will to act as a boost for the image of the person introducing me.
A guy I was dating spoke often about a good friend who lived in a neighbouring country, and she was someone he used to date. Since I had a genuine interest in his life and that blossoming relationship (and I was visiting a friend in the same town), I contacted her and made plans to meet up (bringing along two friends for backup, haha.).
It was a party of six, and I was introduced to her two friends like thus:
""This is the current girlfriend of my ex-boyfriend, who's now one of my best friends.""I was amazed - why did she say that? It became clearer when her two friends responded with:
""Oh, you know so many people - you're so cool!""Don't get me wrong, it would have been okay to have simply been introduced as a new friend (or friend of a best friend, that could have worked too!), because I had never met her before. But the only thing she knew about me (my relationship status) had been used against my will as a theatrical prop to demonstrate uncommon open-mindedness and fun-loving personality.
""Only you can make a party like this work!"""	<urn:uuid:98baf1b1-8d2b-49e4-b185-fc65f5e00177>	0.0
log burner or heat pump which more efficient	"The heated water is stored at the top of the tank and is kept warm through the unit’s refrigeration cycle.
Like traditional water heaters, heat pump water heaters come in various capacities. Certain factors, like the number of fixtures that use hot water and daily hot water usage, can help determine which size conventional or heat pump water heater is perfect for a home.
By reviewing how conventional water heaters and heat pump water heaters heat water, you’ll be able to understand better how they compare in terms of energy efficiency.
Heat pump water heaters are up to five times more energy efficient than conventional water heaters. All water heaters use the Uniform Energy Factor (UEF). Traditional gas or electric water heaters have a .60 to .93 UEF rating, significantly lower than the 4.0 rating for heat pump water heaters.
The main reason why conventional water heaters have a lower rating than heat pump water heater is because of the energy it needs to power themselves. Traditional water heaters consume energy, not just to heat water but to keep it heated for storage.
Heat pumps rely mainly on their heat pump technology, which doesn’t require a lot of power to operate. By reducing energy consumption, heat pump water heaters can obtain a higher UEF rating. This also translates into more energy savings for the homeowner.
Even though conventional water heaters have a lower UEF rating, they can still provide homeowners with energy cost savings. Whether it’s a heat pump water heater or a traditional one, all water heaters have energy guide labels that show an estimated yearly cost with the maximum gallons of hot water the unit can produce in an hour.
Conventional and heat pump water heaters can provide yearly savings, but homeowners will have first to pay the upfront costs to have one of these water heaters installed. We’ll take a deeper look at how these water heaters compare in terms of pricing.
Conventional water heaters, on average, are priced at $3,200 to $5,900 with installation. Whereas heat pump water heaters are higher in price, costing between $9,500 to $13,000. When shopping for any water heater in general, the following factors play a huge role in determining the final price.
- Additional parts
- Plumbing modifications
- Water filtration (optional)
Heat pump water heaters are new to the water heating industry, so there are fewer options for heat pump water heater models. This allows manufacturers to set their pricing for water heaters."	<urn:uuid:696774b9-3181-487c-a6dd-c94c1384e377>	0.0

As a breast cancer researcher studying viral links, how does MMTV transmission and treatment differ from BRCA-related cancers?	"In findings that are fundamentally reshaping the scientific understanding of breast cancer, researchers have identified four genetically distinct types of the cancer. And within those types, they found hallmark genetic changes that are driving many cancers.
These discoveries, published online on Sunday in the journal Nature, are expected to lead to new treatments with drugs already approved for cancers in other parts of the body and new ideas for more precise treatments aimed at genetic aberrations that now have no known treatment.
The study is the first comprehensive genetic analysis of breast cancer, which kills more than 35,000 women a year in the United States. The new paper, and several smaller recent studies, are electrifying the field.
“This is the road map for how we might cure breast cancer in the future,” said Dr. Matthew Ellis of Washington University, a researcher for the study.
Researchers and patient advocates caution that it will still take years to translate the new insights into transformative new treatments. Even within the four major types of breast cancer, individual tumors appear to be driven by their own sets of genetic changes. A wide variety of drugs will most likely need to be developed to tailor medicines to individual tumors.Continue reading the main story
“There are a lot of steps that turn basic science into clinically meaningful results,” said Karuna Jaggar, executive director of Breast Cancer Action, an advocacy group. “It is the ‘stay tuned’ story.”
The study is part of a large federal project, the Cancer Genome Atlas, to build maps of genetic changes in common cancers. Reports on similar studies of lung and colon cancer have been published recently. The breast cancer study was based on an analysis of tumors from 825 patients.
“There has never been a breast cancer genomics project on this scale,” said the atlas’s program director, Brad Ozenberger of the National Institutes of Health.
The investigators identified at least 40 genetic alterations that might be attacked by drugs. Many of them are already being developed for other types of cancer that have the same mutations. “We now have a good view of what goes wrong in breast cancer,” said Joe Gray, a genetic expert at Oregon Health & Science University, who was not involved in the study. “We haven’t had that before.”
The study focused on the most common types of breast cancer that are thought to arise in the milk duct. It concentrated on early breast cancers that had not yet spread to other parts of the body in order to find genetic changes that could be attacked, stopping a cancer before it metastasized."	<urn:uuid:d8c8d2ca-007c-477e-9ed2-9372e897a526>	0.0
How much higher is the cancer risk with Lynch syndrome?	"Cancer Gene Study Offers to Detect Disposition, Half Ignore ResultsBy Terence Monmaney
Los Angeles Times
Given a chance to learn if they carried a gene that raised their risk of developing breast, ovarian, or prostate cancer, surprisingly few of the 279 women and men in a new study -- only 43 percent -- chose to take such a look at the future.
That was a central finding of the largest study yet of how people react when offered a blood test for the so-called breast cancer gene, BRCA1, which boosts the likelihood of developing the disease to 87 percent, about eight times higher than that of women generally. The gene also confers a 40 percent to 60 percent lifetime risk of ovarian cancer and about a 10 percent risk of prostate cancer in men.
Among the study subjects, who belonged to families with pronounced histories of breast and ovarian cancer, a major reason for declining the BRCA1 test was fear that a positive result would jeopardize health or life insurance. Another prominent fear was that a faulty test would mistakenly label, and perhaps stigmatize, a noncarrier as positive, prompting much needless anxiety and perhaps even surgery.
The issues raised by the study spotlight an emerging dilemma that pits a newly acquired power of science, which literally means ""to know,"" against the foremost of medical ethics, which is to do no harm.
The study ""is a very important contribution to understanding ... what possible choices people will make when they face the actual experience,"" said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Center for Human Genome Research at the National Institutes of Health.
""Being concerned about insurability and discrimination is very unsettling to people and may dissuade them from seeking testing,"" said Dr. Henry Lynch, a cancer specialist at Creighton University in Omaha and co-author of the study. It appears Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Testing negative for the gene also has the potential to spare women unnecessary surgery, the study showed. Before the test was available, women whose family history placed them at high risk of cancer sometimes had their breasts or ovaries surgically removed, the only known way to help prevent the diseases from developing."	<urn:uuid:ff102b76-f712-4ce7-a181-d2a727c8a30f>	0.0
What are some of the common wrong beliefs that custody evaluators might have about what's best for children?	"Child custody is an issue with divorcing parents. Custody may also be an issue for unmarried parents.
Custody Labels: Physical and Legal
Minnesota law uses two child custody labels: Physical Custody and Legal Custody.
- Physical Custody: The right to determine where a child lives and daily, routine care. Physical custody includes sheltering, feeding, and clothing the children. This is what many people think of when they hear the word ‘custody.’
- Legal Custody: The right to make major decisions regarding a child’s religious upbringing, education, and major medical care decisions.
Child Custody Designations: Sole and Joint Custody
In Minnesota, a parent may have both legal and physical custody of his or her child. However, sometimes a parent only has legal custody of his or her child. And in severe cases, a parent may not have physical or legal custody. Minnesota courts use the labels “sole” and “joint” to make these distinctions.
Joint Physical Child Custody
With joint physical custody, both parents live with the child and having the right to make daily, routine decisions, such as what the child will eat and wear for the day. Importantly, both parents share a structured parenting time schedule with the children to manage this routine.
Historically, there was a preference to award only one parent sole physical custody. Usually, this was the mother. However, this has changed. Parents are more frequently awarded joint physical custody of their children. However, this is still determined on a case by case basis.
In addition, there is a presumption that each parent should have at least 25% of the time with their children. This presumption applies in most situations.
Joint physical custody doesn’t necessarily mean that each parent has the child for 50% of the time. This is where it gets confusing. In Minnesota, parenting time refers to how much time a parent spends with the child.
For example, both parents could share joint physical custody, but one might only see the child every other weekend. In other words, the amount of time a parent has with a child is separate from child custody labels.
Read Parenting Time in Minnesota to learn how parenting time works in Minnesota.
Joint Legal Child Custody
This refers to both parents having the right to make major decisions regarding a child’s religious upbringing, education, and major medical care decisions. School enrollment is the most common legal custody dispute."	<urn:uuid:10468352-c8fd-4876-890d-1a8831ff4d7c>	0.0

how seasoned wood burning differs from gas fireplace safety concerns	"If you have an old or uncertified wood-burning device, you may qualify for cash rewards to recycle it or get a discount on the purchase of new heating equipment.
Through the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency’s Wood Stove Program, Snohomish County residents can receive $350 for recycling their old, polluting wood stove. Eligible devices include wood stoves and fireplace inserts (which are basically wood stoves made to be installed inside a fireplace) that are not U.S. EPA certified or were manufactured before 2000. Also eligible are free-standing manufactured fireplaces (but not built-in, zero-clearance fireplaces), wood-burning furnaces, or residential coal-burning devices.
Your old device must be in working order but can be installed or uninstalled for the recycling reward. Indoor barrel stoves and trash burners are not eligible for the reward. The homeowner is responsible for removal and taking the old stove or insert to a recycling facility.
Residents of Snohomish County wanting to upgrade to new, cleaner heat can instead opt to have their old wood stove or fireplace insert scrapped in exchange for a $1,500 discount to go toward the purchase and professional installation of new heating equipment.
Replacement options include electric heat pump; natural gas, propane or oil furnace; or natural gas, propane or pellet stove or insert. Replacement equipment must meet certain efficiency and/or emissions requirements. Work must be done by a program-approved heating contractor. No new wood stoves or inserts are allowed with the discount.
To be eligible for the $1,500 replacement discount, you must have an uncertified or pre-2000 wood stove or fireplace insert, free-standing manufactured fireplace, wood-burning furnace, or residential coal-burning device. Old device must be installed and operable in order to qualify.
After enrolling, applicants must submit several photos of their old wood stove or fireplace insert to be reviewed for eligibility. Funding is limited; one project per household. The program is currently limited to homeowners or, in the case of rental homes, property owners.
For wood stove recycling, qualified applicants will receive an agency-issued coupon and instructions for recycling their stove and receiving the $350 reward. Recycling participants have 45 days to recycle their stoves at any of the agency’s four designated recycling facilities."	<urn:uuid:3e96075c-15b8-4efe-ae68-857d3bd87811>	0.0
What should business managers look at when deciding between different security investments, and how can they handle the uncertainty about how often cyber attacks might happen?	"Discussing cybersecurity at East Sweden Innovation Week
East Sweden Innovation week is arranged by Region Östergötland and Linköping Science Park on the 7th-13th of November. The week is centered around industries where the region has a strong presence and is a mix of lectures, workshops and panel debates. This is how the organizer describe the Week:
“East Sweden Innovation Week is a week full of inspiration, professional development and networking. Meet some of the leading innovation companies in Östergötland. Get inspiration from leading entrepreneurs. East Sweden Innovation Weeks aim is to strengthen the innovation climate in Östergötland.”
Cybersecurity is one of the head subjects of the week and link22 is a major player within the field, not only regionally but nationally. A cybersecurity panel debate will take place during Innovation Day on the 10th of November. We will discuss the current cybersecurity situation as a whole and what companies in general can, and maybe should, do in relation to that. This is how the organizer describe the debate:
“In times of trade war between the US and China, the war on Ukraine and an increasing polarization over the globe, the number of cyber attacks have risen and more and more companies and operations – even countries, are being attacked. The focus on cyber security is rising all across Europe and a number of initiatives are being launched in different countries and by different actors.
To see what is happening outside of Sweden, we have put together a panel on Cyber Security to bench-mark initiatives taking place in Europe to raise awareness and knowledge about how to avoid hacker attacks and cyber threats among SME:s and the public sector.”

What's the role of context in space design and DC's guidelines?	"At Nintendo® Space World 2001, IGNcube had a chance to sit down with Greg Buchner from ATI to talk about the design and evolution of GameCube's graphics chip, code-named Flipper. In the lengthy, technical interview Greg reveals much about the decisions that were made and what we can expect from the console in terms of visuals in the future. Get a closer look at the formation of Flipper in this in-depth interview.
IGNcube: Can you discuss your position at ATI and how you became involved with Nintendo® and the design of the Flipper graphics chip? Greg Buchner:
Greg Buchner:So, going back in history, in 1997 a lot of people left SGI (Silicon Graphics Inc.), which wasn't doing well, so a bunch of us started ArtX and we aimed at doing graphics in the PC space. In early '98 we started talking to Nintendo® about being their provider for the graphics and system logic for what has become GameCube. At ArtX I was vice president of engineering and part of the founding team of ArtX.
In April of last year we joined ATI through an acquisition, which ATI aquired as a way to get into the [home console] space and as a way to get another graphics development team working in the integrated graphics PC space. So, through the acquisition I've maintained a similar role for the team at Santa Clara. ATI already had a team at Santa Clara plus the addition of the ArtX team. More recently I'm operating in a more technical role, I'm giving advice on how we build chips.
IGNcube: What is your official title now? Greg Buchner:
Greg Buchner:I'm vice president of engineering, ATI.
IGNcube: You say you began talking to Nintendo® in 1998. So from white paper designs and initial design to final mass production silicon how long was the development process? Greg Buchner:
Greg Buchner:Well, there was a period of time where we were in the brainstorm period, figuring out what to build, what's the right thing to create. We spent a reasonable amount of time on that, a really big chunk of 1998 was spend doing that, figuring out just what [Flipper] was going to be. In 1999 we pretty much cranked out the gates, cranked out the silicon and produced the first part."	<urn:uuid:6d279629-ee36-4fe8-8d85-f7186ca25d5d>	0.0

I want to learn about hawksbill turtles in Thailand and India - what threats do they face and how are people trying to protect them?	"It was such a relief to be surrounded by sympathetic people in Ayr – I felt I could relax without being seen through the eyes of ‘normal’ people. PTSD is often seen ‘just’ as a curable disorder but how can you close Pandora’s Box once it has been opened? Survivors have seen what horrors humans can bring to bear on other humans; whether it is during war or in hospitals or at crime scenes. We have seen how so called normal rules of society are just arbitrary in some situations, and, when national security is threatened, anything can be justified.
- Iraqi soldiers gave themselves up in hundreds because their leaders starved them and held their families to ransom.
How can we be expected to worry about forms in triplicate; overtaking to gain a minute in our journey to a nine-to-five job? How can we not be vigilant when we perceive that we are surrounded by threats? We are surrounded by threats: adverts trying to convince us we’re the wrong shape; that we should buy a sofa to have a happy family; people feeling sorry for us or trying to ‘cure’ us. We don’t need a cure, we just need to learn to reassess the level and types of threat that is around us; and we need to learn to communicate with people who are ignorant of the real world outside their comfortable lives – without fearing them. I am slowly learning a kind of indignant dignity and a new self-respect; and a new peace. In reassessing the threats around me I realise that a bullet is just as dangerous as a politician; a bomb just as dangerous as a council bureaucrat; and chemical warfare just as dangerous as a marketing campaign. But I can dodge a politician or a bureaucrat more easily; and I can see through an advert or a spam email. However, the problem now is that I don’t really feel motivated to be a part of this world of politics and consumerism – I want something real. That is my next task: to find something to fan my burning heart. Maybe it is getting involved in canoeing in Canada, or creating an organisation to encourage youth exchange (both?). I’ve yet to catch the bug though… as long as I keep trying things I’ll find something to fire me up.

What role does education play in soil conservation efforts?	"Display to header level
Initiatives in Pennsylvania and on a national level promote the study of bird populations and the protection of their habitat.
Organizations and governments involved in conservation efforts can make important contributions to protecting birds, especially threatened and endangered species. The development of farmland and open space often destroys critical habitat for bird migration, breeding, and wintering. Preserving these natural areas ensures healthy bird populations and intact ecosystems.
Land trusts, in particular, can be key partners in bird conservation. The 2013 State of the Birds report, submitted to the U.S Department of Interior by 15 bird conservation groups and government agencies, found that more than 100 bird species have at least half of their populations on private land. Many of those species are in decline and in desperate need of habitat conservation. Considering that a majority of land in the United States is privately owned, the ability of land trusts to work directly with landowners means that they can play a major role in the effort to secure, restore, and protect habitat for birds.
The National Audubon Society is a prominent bird-focused conservation organization. It coordinates a number of bird conservation programs, many of which are implemented by local chapters and state offices, including Audubon Pennsylvania.
The Important Bird Area (IBA) program is an initiative by BirdLife International designed to help organizations and governments prioritize conservation efforts in the most important places for birds. In the United States, the National Audubon Society and local partners administer the IBA program. To date, Audubon has identified nearly 3,000 IBAs covering over 400 million acres.
IBAs are areas that provide essential habitat for birds, including sites for breeding, wintering, and migration. An IBA can consist of a few acres, or thousands of acres. Land in an IBA can be public or private, protected or unprotected. To be designated an IBA, an area must meet at least one of several objective criteria.
After designating land as an IBA, the Audubon Society works with partner organizations and local chapters to develop and implement an IBA conservation plan. Plan activities vary from IBA to IBA and can include bird monitoring, habitat restoration, land protection, and proposing changes to municipal land use policies.
IBA designation does not offer legal protection to the identified area; it simply recognizes the area as having outstanding value to bird conservation."	<urn:uuid:36a08d11-6981-44f8-903c-ef7bfe428813>	0.0
I'm worried about my premature baby in the NICU - what kind of tests and nursing care will they need to check their brain development?	"Two days after the arrival of their son, new parents Anna Faris and Chris Pratt were seen in Reseda, Calif. on Monday (August 27). The couple were all smiles as they dropped their dogs off at a kennel and headed over to Cedars-Sinai to visit their newborn baby boy, Jack.
“It’s a boy! Thanks for all your kind words,” the proud papa wrote on Twitter. “In lieu of gifts we ask that you mouth kiss a stranger,” he joked.
The funny couple welcomed their first child on Saturday (August 25). Due to his premature delivery, baby Jack is staying at the NICU.
Their rep said in a statement, “Anna Faris and Chris Pratt are happy to announce the birth of their beautiful baby boy Jack. He arrived earlier than expected and will be spending some time in the NICU. The happy parents thank you for your warm wishes and ask that you honor their privacy during this time.”View Slideshow »»"	<urn:uuid:a23c51f8-397f-4665-b1a7-9626191e01c8>	0.0
Do modern baby showers still exclude men from attending?	"For my sister’s baby shower this weekend, I have a few projects up my sleeve. The shower is going to be at our parents’ house, already making it rather intimate. The house is not a big one, so the 25 people attending will totally fill it up- meaning that not a lot of decoration is required to make it feel personal. Good. After B’s bridal shower, I didn’t have the energy for another big set of projects.
The main projects are garlands to decorate the fire place mantle and above the food table. Naturally I decided to revisit the circle garland that I blogged about here. I tried a different approach and managed to make an easy project even easier!!
Thank you, Bernette!
Bernette is my trusty sewing machine. All I had to do was to feed my punched circles into the machine one after another and in 15 minutes flat, I had all the circle garland that I needed! It had a slightly different look (with the spacing) than my first go at the garland, but I really like both, and they’re amazingly simple.
The next garland challenge was to try and create some ruffle streamers following this tutorial. Check!
Menu Board (made with roadside found frame): in progress
Picture holders: in progress (we asked all the guest’s to bring a baby picture so we can have fun guessing)
I know it looks a bit random right now, but just you wait. I totally see it in my head, and its fabulous!
I do have fun doing stuff for showers, but boy will I be glad when it’s over and I can relax for an evening. Maybe I’ll even work out a bit. Maybe."	<urn:uuid:c26d7d60-1c43-4229-9e9a-aa6031321bb2>	0.0

What type of equations model the flow of funds?	"We discuss mesoscopic models, which reflect the transport and reaction of the gaseous species through a homogeneous media in the chamber. The models include the conservation of mass and the porous media are in accordance with Darcy's law. The transport through the stationary and nonionised plasma field is treated as a diffusion-dominated flow, , where the metallic deposit and the gas chamber look like porous media. Based on these assumptions, we taken into account our expertise of modelling transport-reaction problems in groundwater. While solving such problems, so-called multi-scale processes and multi-physical processes arise. Conventional treatment of black-box discretisation and solver methods are impossible or complicated. We contribute physically motivated methods, with respect to decomposing processes for simpler-coupled ones. The idea of integrating one-dimensional analytical solutions of simpler equation systems and additionally iterative solver methods to couple the simpler equations leads to so-called iterative operator-splitting methods.
We present so-called decomposition methods, which decouple the different scales and solve the equations based on scales with each other. Therefore, the previous coupling errors between the terms of the equations can be controlled and minimised with our iterative methods. Furthermore, additional domain decomposition are used to decouple the complicate domains, and non-linear problems are linearised with relaxation schemes. Our flexible iterative operator-splitting method is analysed for time, space, and non-linear model equations. Because of reducing the tremendous splitting error with more iteration steps, the method is competitive for multi-scale and multi-physical problems."	<urn:uuid:9dea9751-b92c-4583-96f9-657408b54cc9>	0.0

The human loricrin gene.
Journal of Biological Chemistry
Loricrin is the major protein component of the cornified cell envelope of terminally differentiated mammalian epidermal (stratum corneum) cells. Using a specific human cDNA clone, we have isolated and characterized the human loricrin gene. We show that it has a very simple structure of a single intron of 1188 base pairs (bp) in the 5'-untranslated region; there are no introns in coding sequences. By use of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, followed by in situ hybridization with a biotin-labeled genomic DNA clone, the single-copy gene maps to chromosome location 1q21. Polymerase chain reaction analyses of genomic DNAs from different individuals show that human loricrin consists of two allelic size variants, due to sequence variations in its second glycine loop domain, and these variants segregate in the human population by normal Mendelian mechanisms. Furthermore, there are multiple sequence variants within these two size class alleles due to various deletions of 12 bp (4 amino acids) in the major loop of this glycine loop domain. By use of a specific loricrin antibody, we show by immunogold electron microscopy that loricrin initially appears in the granular layer of human epidermis and forms composite keratohyalin granules with profilaggrin, but localizes to the cell periphery (cell envelope) of fully differentiated stratum corneum cells.

I live in London and heard that air pollution used to be really bad here in the past. How does historical London smog compare to the air pollution problems in modern American cities?	"People in China cannot breathe, and they are getting tired of trying to mask it. One newlywed couple, in an act of protest, took their wedding portraits outdoors.
Donning a face mask with a now-gray stained wedding dress, the bride holds her husband, breathing through a gas mask, in a morbidly polluted embrace.
When the air is so thick that children are told to stay indoors, city dwellers can no longer see skyscrapers and face masks are out of stock. Taking wedding photos outside is a beautiful and desperate attempt to get the world's attention.
Beijing's insanely high rate of pollution is billowing at over nine times the safe breathing level. The World Health Organization has recently declared it a health crisis.
This couple's wedding album reveals just how bad China's air pollution is:
1. An act of protest
Bride Zhang Xinyu and groom Bai Beibei decided to take their wedding portraits outside, facing the hazardous smog to protest the abysmal air quality.
2. The dangers of breathing
The level of toxic particles is so bad that simply taking in a deep breath can send the particles into a person's blood stream.
3. Nuclear winter
China's toxic air pollution resembles a nuclear winter, scientists say. A nuclear winter describes the environmental impacts of detonating — yes, you thought right — a nuclear bomb.
4. Smog clinics
China's choking smog is causing asthma and other chronic conditions. One hospital in Southwest China opened a ""smog clinic"" in 2013.
5. Photosynthesis is slowing.
6. One man is suing the government.
One man recently sued the Chinese government, demanding the environmental protection agency ""perform its duty to control air pollution according to the law.""
7. City dwellers can barely see the sun.
Residents of Beijing have been posting images on social media of a muted sun behind grey skies. Some of the city's largest skyscrapers aren't fully visible.
8. Smog lab
The Chinese government may be investing $81 million(500 million yuan) to study smog pollution, its effects and enacting measures to reduce it. The plan includes the constructing a large ""smog lab."""	<urn:uuid:07d9bcbc-4fd3-4d10-b9df-b322d3da11ed>	0.0

What's better for cutting energy costs: solar passive design or efficient appliances?	"Solar energy has abundant applications. Tapping solar power requires the appropriate technology to reach the grassroots of India if we aim to move towards sustainable development for all. With this goal, TERI undertook the task of providing solar energy technology to a small district in Assam.
What is a Solar Multi utility (SMU)?
Solar Multi utility (SMU) is a platform that utilizes locally available solar energy to generate electricity through solar photovoltaic technology. The generated electricity is then used for a variety of applications such as charging lanterns, powering appliances such as computer, mobile phones, water purifier etc. An SMU is located near energy utilization points in a village to provide electricity services as per the need of the community.
This project dealt with designing and implementing such a platform for the Dakshin Dimoria village under the Dimoria Development Block of Kamrup district, Assam, located 40 km from Guwahati.
The SMU was designed based on the energy need assessment carried out at the project site for high-income generating and high valued service livelihood-generation activities. The design was a result of a market survey conducted by the project team for available appliances. Based on this assessment, the SMU was designed for powering appliances that included batteries for solar applications (specially for solar lanterns), water purifier, honey skimmer for honey extraction, chilli/turmeric grinder, bamboo cross-cutting and splitting machines, bamboo slivering, and bamboo stick-making machines. These appliances are involved in livelihood generation activities, and therefore of critical importance to the people.
The entire process was broadly divided into six phases that included selection of site and appropriate solar photovoltaic (SPV) technology, designing of SMU, setting up local institutions, installation and commissioning of SMU, training and capacity building of local institutions, and monitoring the performance of SMU.
As a result of this project, a fully operational SMU was developed at the Dakshin Dimoria village and thereby helped in livelihood generation. In addition to this, an established institutional framework and effective service delivery mechanism was developed for ensuring long-term sustainability of the project. An installation, operation, and maintenance manual was also developed to facilitate smooth function of the SMUs.
The concept and purpose of SMU was well accepted among the communities. TERI also demonstrated strategies for carrying out similar projects in other regions."	<urn:uuid:87836bc3-e442-41c3-a057-30fed1e30848>	0.0
hip nerve compression symptoms vs replacement complications	"An inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) may help prevent PE in patients with DVT in the leg, but IVCF placement may risk long-term complications. Benefits outweigh risk if a second PE is predicted to be life-threatening; however, few clinical trial data are available. A filter is most clearly indicated in patients who have:
Because venous collaterals can develop, providing a pathway for emboli to circumvent the IVCF, and because filters occasionally thrombose, patients with recurrent DVT or nonmodifiable risk factors for DVT may still require anticoagulation. An IVCF is placed in the inferior vena cava just below the renal veins via catheterization of an internal jugular or femoral vein. Most IVCFs are removable. Occasionally, a filter dislodges and may migrate up the venous bed, even to the heart, and needs to be removed or replaced. A filter can also become thrombosed, causing bilateral venous congestion (including acute phlegmasia cerulea dolens) in the leg, lower body ischemia, and acute kidney injury.
Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) with SCDs provides rhythmic external compression to the legs or to the legs and thighs. It is more effective for preventing calf than proximal DVT. It is insufficient as sole prophylaxis after hip or knee replacement but is often used in low-risk patients after other types of surgery or in medical patients who have a low-risk of DVT or who are at high risk of bleeding. IPC can theoretically trigger PE in immobilized patients who have developed occult DVT while not receiving DVT prophylaxis.
Graded elastic compression stockings are likely less effective than external pneumatic leg compression, but one systematic meta-analysis suggested that they reduced the incidence of DVT in postoperative patients from 26% in the control group to 13% in the compression stockings group.
After surgical procedures with a high incidence of DVT/PE, low dose unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or adjusted-dose warfarin is recommended.
After orthopedic surgery of the hip or knee, additional options include the newer oral anticoagulants, rivaroxaban and apixaban. These drugs are safe and effective and do not require laboratory tests to monitor the level of anticoagulation as is needed for warfarin."	<urn:uuid:bc7d2103-6479-42c3-95b6-2946b557b3dd>	0.0

What's the connection between childhood trauma and urinary problems?	"Causes of abnormal vaginal bleeding include:
- vaginal infection
- vaginal trauma
- thyroid problems
- oral contraceptives
- vaginal dryness
conditions such as endometriosis and fibroids
Any unexplained vaginal bleeding should be evaluated by an OBGYN.
If you have vaginal itch along with urinary symptoms such as burning with urination, urinary frequency, and urinary urgency, you may have both a urinary tract infection (UTI) and a vaginal infection. Vaginal itch isn’t a common UTI symptom, but it’s possible to have two infections at once. For example, you may have a UTI and a yeast infection or a UTI and BV.
You’ll need to see an OBGYN to determine what’s going on and make sure you get the right treatment. Left untreated, a UTI may cause a kidney infection, kidney damage, and sepsis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition.
White patches of skin on your vulva
Intense vaginal itching and white patches of skin on your vulva are symptoms of lichen sclerosus. Pain, bleeding, and blisters are other symptoms. Lichen sclerosus is a serious skin condition that may be caused by an overactive immune system. Over time, it may cause scarring and painful sex. Treatment options include corticosteroid cream and retinoids. An OBGYN can help diagnose the condition, but they may refer you to a dermatologist for treatment.
As you age, your body makes less estrogen. Low estrogen may also occur after a hysterectomy or cancer treatment. Low estrogen may cause vaginal atrophy. This condition causes the walls of the vagina to become thin, dry, and inflamed. It’s also called vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) and genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM).
Symptoms of vaginal atrophy may include:
- vaginal itch
- vaginal burning
- vaginal discharge
- burning with
- urinary urgency
- frequent UTIs
- painful sex
Since vaginal atrophy symptoms can mimic a UTI or vaginal infection, you’ll need to see an OBGYN for an accurate diagnosis. Vaginal atrophy is treated with vaginal lubricants, vaginal moisturizers, and oral or topical estrogen.
Another common cause of vaginal itch is contact dermatitis."	<urn:uuid:b06eadb0-fd6e-44f1-bc51-c5a1e0570c8d>	0.0
What should clients verify about contractors' qualifications and insurance?	"One event that can seriously harm, and even put a company out of business, is the unexpected death of a key employee, salesperson, partner, or executive.
That is why many companies formulate contingency plans for such deaths, and even design thorough succession plans for owners and key executives, managers, or board members.
A term life insurance policy purchased on one or more of these key individuals helps to solve the difficult problem about how business will go on without this important individual.
How Business Life Insurance Works
The corporation, LLC or partnership should be the applicant, own and pay for the policy premiums, and name itself as the beneficiary.
The key individual must agree to the insurance policy be taken out on his or her life. This individual would need to, at the very least, help complete the application with answers about health history, and depending on the policy, may also need to take a medical exam.
Please note if you are purchasing life insurance on a key employee or individual, this is commonly referred to as “key man life insurance” or “key person life insurance”.
How Much Life Insurance Should a Business Apply For?
It’s difficult to measure the exact value an individual brings a business, but some questions you’ll want to consider in helping you quantify the value of your employee are:
1. Potential Lost Clients: In the case of the loss of a founder or great salesperson, consider the relationships that individual has fostered with your clients. You might even write down a list of key clients that may be doing business with you due to a great relationship they have with your key employee.
2. Cost of Replacing an Individual: Key employees or owners are not easily replaced. Finding and attracting a candidate with the necessary experience and qualifications may cost the companies thousands upon thousands of dollars.
Depending on what level of candidate you’re trying to hire, these costs may include job listings, hiring agency cost, wining and dining, as well as other accommodations. If a member of your own staff does the searching, you have that employee’s time as an expense as well.
I think I can come off this point… every business understands the high cost of replacing an employee, and dreads having to replace a KEY member of the team.
3. Intangible Losses: Your key man or woman may be an idea trailblazer. Some people’s ingenuity simply cannot be replaced. Be sure to insure this person accordingly.

What's taught about German culture and Aquinas's influence on European thinking?	"""This is a fully wrong policy and will certainly have a reverse outcome and we have clearly said this to Europe too,"" deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi was quoted by Iranian media as saying on Monday.
The German government appealed to Tehran to join European powers and the United States in discussions, citing concerns about its missile programme and regional activities.
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Adebahr said German, France and EU officials would launch high-level talks about their concerns. ""There's a lot to discuss, and we are now tackling that,"" she said.
Adebahr declined comment on a report in Der Spiegel magazine which said Germany, France and Britain were lobbying European allies to agree to fresh sanctions against Iran, to show Trump that were taking his concerns seriously.
Juergen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives in parliament, dismissed the report as ""speculation"" and said new sanctions could prompt Tehran to stop implementing the nuclear deal.
""We will see in the next weeks if we find ways and means to move toward the American perspectives. It is also in our interest to counter the negative influence of Iran in the region,"" he said. ""But there is no European consensus yet."""	<urn:uuid:45f16d67-aa92-4a35-b3c0-df1866941e8a>	0.0
Which material requires more maintenance, metal or wood siding?	"Depending on how old your home is, this may mean that you need to paint t old drywalls. Luckily, painting old drywall isn't all that difficult a task.
Painting over Wallpaper
Are you looking for a way to change the look of a room that has wallpaper, but you don't really feel like pulling the wallpaper down? One option that you could employ is to paint it over. Painting over wallpaper will require a little more preparation than regular painting, but isn't all that difficult to do.
Painting Tool Necessities
Just as with any task, when painting a room you will need to make sure that you have the correct tools. Surprisingly these painting tool necessities are more than just a brush and a can of paint. Make sure that you are correctly outfitted for your next painting job by using this list of painting tools.
Painting Treated Wood
Treated wood is a common choice among many homeowners as the material of choice when building things like decks. However, this wonderful material can present unique challenges when trying to paint. If you are interested in painting treated wood, all you need to do is follow these instructions.
Painting Vinyl Siding
Vinyl siding is a popular choice among many home owners due to the durability, and ease of maintenance that it shows. However, just because it is durable and fairly easy to maintain doesn't mean that you won't have to repaint it periodically. Painting vinyl siding is a task that you can easily complete in a weekend as long as you follow these instructions.
Perhaps one of the trickiest aspects of painting your home is painting windows. The reason for this is that it often requires some rather delicate painting. Delicate does not mean impossible though. Here's how you can begin painting windows yourself.
Painting Your Floors
One way to give old wooden floors a new look is by painting them. However, painting your floors is more than simply slapping a bit of paint around and allowing it to dry. Follow these directions to ensure that you get the job done right.
Preparing Your Home for Painting
Oftentimes preparing your home for painting is one of the most time-consuming and frustrating of the painting process. However, while it may be labor intensive and time-consuming it doesn't mean it is impossible. Here's how you can make sure you are preparing your home for painting properly."	<urn:uuid:c5104893-2a0f-4c14-9f72-3626c2e192c4>	0.0

what are the similarities between blue concert posters database searching and analogous color schemes in art both require analyzing relationships between colors	"Having survived the first encounter against Kajima, Schterzen steals the Blue Destiny Unit 2 and Kajima pursued him using Unit 3.
The Unit 1 and Unit 3 are two variations of the same model in two different color schemes with alternative parts to distinguish each type. Unit 1 has a GM (Gundam Mass-production) type head and is outfitted for ground combat, whereas Unit 3 has the traditional Gundam type head and is refitted for space combat, with additional components added onto the existing body from Unit 1. With exception to their heads and the components for Unit 3, the only substantial differences between Unit 1 and Unit 3 are the thrusters on the outsides of the legs and the colors.
Out of the boxes, both Units are molded in their final colors and are supplemented with polycaps to provide articulation. Unit 1 comes in its true blue and dark blue plastic, with gray parts for its joints and weapons. There is one red piece for its chin, and a clear visor for its eyes. Unit 3 comes in the traditional Gundam colors of off-white gray, yellow, red, and dark blue, with the same color gray parts for its joints and weapons as Unit 1. As standard for designs with beam sabers are a set of clear pink tubes that form the beams included on their own parts tree.
Between both units, there is some minor paint work to improve the looks, such as the tube protrusions from the chest, the triangle indentations on the knees and front of the chest. Additional paint work includes the targeting eyes on the top of the forehead and back of the head. For those looking at the decals, both units come with two different color sets for eyes: one red and one green. The reason for this depends on the builder’s choice of whether to display the Blue Destiny in EXAM’s activated mode (red) or normal mode (green). Because I use paint, I opted for Unit 1’s visor in red and paint Unit 3’s eyes green.
For the sake of variety I employed a number of aesthetics: detailing in two gray tones; gunship gray to match the plastic for joint regions and engine gray for the weapons and auxiliary parts. While it is extra work, it adds to the overall finish of the model, and makes it look like a more complex construct than it really is."	<urn:uuid:8dc5c0f2-91fe-4de0-963d-0dbd7f4194ea>	0.0

im curious what makes farmers change pest control methods explain system factors	"Pest control is one of those tasks that you might think is easy enough to take on yourself – but it’s important to understand the risks before you decide to DIY. In this article, we’ll explore why it’s best to leave pest control to professionals and examine the dangers of DIY pest control. Read on for more information!
Introduction to DIY Pest Control
When it comes to pest control, most people think that they can handle it themselves. After all, how hard could it be? Just buy some poison and set it out, right? Wrong. Pest control is a lot more complicated than that, and if you don’t know what you’re doing, you could end up doing more harm than good.
Here are a few reasons why you should leave pest control to the professionals:
- Pest Control Products Are Dangerous
The pesticides and other products used for pest control are designed to be poisonous. That’s why they’re effective at killing pests. But if you’re not careful, they can also be dangerous to humans and animals. If you use them incorrectly, you could end up making your home uninhabitable – or worse.
- You Might Not Be Using the Right Products
There are a lot of different pest control products on the market, and each one is designed to kill specific types of pests. If you don’t know what kind of pests you have, you could end up using the wrong product – which means it won’t work and the pests will just keep coming back.
- Pests Can Become Immune to DIY Methods Just like bacteria can become immune to antibiotics, pests can become immune to DIY pest control methods. So even if you think you’ve got them under control, they could come back.
The Risks of DIY Pest Control
There are a number of risks associated with do-it-yourself pest control methods. First and foremost, if you misidentify the type of pest you’re dealing with, you could end up using the wrong type of pesticide or another treatment method, which could make the problem worse.
In addition, many DIY pest control products are not as effective as professional-grade products, and may not be able to completely eliminate the problem. This can leave you with a false sense of security, thinking the problem is gone when it’s really not.
Another risk is that if you don’t apply the product correctly, you could end up harming yourself or your family members."	<urn:uuid:5bb18573-355c-42c6-ba1a-a822fa2cc52c>	0.0
I'm comparing different tools for building apps and I'd like to know what are the key differences between Web AppBuilder widgets and software frameworks in terms of how they help developers create applications?	"From speech-to-text services to computer vision capabilities, these technologies contribute to creating a more inclusive digital experience for users across various domains.
e.Web Accessibility with Edge:
Microsoft Edge, the company’s web browser, incorporates features to enhance web accessibility. Immersive Reader, for instance, optimizes web content for readability, benefiting users with dyslexia or other reading difficulties.
By consistently embedding accessibility features within their products, Microsoft not only meets the needs of users with disabilities but also fosters a culture of inclusivity in the broader tech community. As technology continues to evolve, Microsoft remains at the forefront, demonstrating that innovation and inclusivity can go hand in hand.
2. Developer-Friendly Accessibility APIs and Tools
Microsoft understands the significance of making accessibility an integral part of the development process, and they’ve equipped developers with user-friendly tools to do just that. Here’s a look at Microsoft’s accessible tools for developers in simple terms.
a. UI Automation API:
Think of the UI Automation API as the backbone of Microsoft’s accessibility toolkit for developers. It’s like a set of tools that developers use to make sure their apps work well for everyone. This framework allows developers to create apps that not only work smoothly but also cater to users with different needs, especially those using assistive technologies like screen readers.
b. Accessibility Insights:
Accessibility Insights is a set of tools that helps developers find and fix issues that might make their apps tricky to use for some people. Whether you’re building websites, Windows apps, or Android apps, Accessibility Insights has got your back with checks and tests to ensure your digital creations are inclusive.
c. Visual Studio Accessibility Checker:
For developers using Visual Studio, think of the Accessibility Checker as your spell-check for accessibility. It’s a tool integrated into your workspace that looks out for things that might make your apps harder to use for people with disabilities. It gives you tips and suggestions right where you’re building your app.
d. Microsoft Fluent UI:
Microsoft Fluent UI is like a toolkit for developers who want their apps to look good and work well for everyone. It’s not just about pretty designs; it’s about making sure buttons, menus, and everything else in your app are easy to use for people of all abilities. Fluent UI helps developers create apps with accessible building blocks.
e. GitHub Accessibility Lab:
Imagine the GitHub Accessibility Lab as your go-to place for making your code and projects welcoming to everyone."	<urn:uuid:6b3a863d-e0a1-4d1e-bf5c-044f3d1a4d21>	0.0
I've been reading about living longer and healthier, and I'm curious about how our bodies age. What makes us get old and sick, and is there any hope for medicines that could help us stay healthy longer?	"It's FALL y'all!!!! I know it started a couple weeks ago, but it's finally October and it just feels more Fall-y...ya know? The beginning of a new month is always a time of excitement for the fresh month ahead, as well as a reflective time on the month that just ended. I love looking back and seeing if I achieved what I set out to do, and how to make my life more purposeful, organized, and productive. I've always been into setting goals, making lists, and accomplishing what I've set out to do. I am a huge overachiever and love to aim high with my dreams.
As it is the beginning of October, the first Monday of the month, my heart and mind are craving some goal setting! But, this month, my goals are going to be more mindful and focused on what is more important to me. There are so many studies out nowadays, in the nutrition world and psychology in general, about how important mindfulness is in your daily life, healthy habits, and personal goals.
Mindfulness is being aware of your current state or situation and accepting it. Being mindful means you are aware of your values, how you feel about a certain situation, and what makes YOU feel good health-wise. This can apply SO much to our healthy eating behaviors and goals, and can actually increase our chances to sticking to our new habits for the long-haul.
Listen, getting healthy is hard. Losing weight is hard. Being more active is hard. Choosing the apple over the brownie...is HARD! Mindfulness helps us accept the fact that this journey is a tricky one, full of 3 steps forward and 2 steps back. But, it helps us be more forgiving with ourselves, accepting of our tendencies, and helps us gain a better grasp of what we want, why we want it, and how to get there. And in turn, mindfulness techniques actually improve our outcomes with our healthy living journeys and help us reach our goals in a healthier and more motivated way. I plan on starting to use mindfulness techniques with my clients, especially in this busy season of the year, to help them gain a fresh perspective of what they are desiring while trying to ""lose X amount of lbs"" or ""eat X amount of calories."" For example, some of my mindful October goals include:

poor countries climate threats funding hurdles	"While several winter storms came through the region, total rainfall accumulation was still below average during the 2011 monitoring period. Many of the plants that could not be located in 2011 were assumed dead because their vigor during previous surveys was rated as “poor” in 2009 (NNHP 2011b, p. 3). Some of these plants may have been retracted at the time. However, many plants observed between 2008 and 2011 failed to produce fruit or flower, and fruit buds were observed to be aborted. This suggests low seed production, which would cause a decline in overall abundance over time.
In summary, the climate on the Colorado Plateau and Navajo Nation is predicted to become warmer with reduced precipitation in the future. We have strong evidence to suggest that the Fickeisen plains cactus is being impacted by drought coupled with increased annual temperatures. We believe that the high number of dead and missing or retracted plants in all plots monitored is influenced by below-average winter or spring precipitation at the time when plants need soil moisture to flower. Poor reproduction in the Fickeisen plains cactus is likely to worsen in the future if climatic patterns shift toward becoming more arid with increased winter nighttime temperatures. With climatic models predicting future regional droughts, it is likely that all populations of the Fickeisen plains cactus will continue to be affected by drought and climate change. However, it is not clear if drought or climate change, of themselves, present population-level threats of extinction. It appears that drought and climate change in combination with rodent predation (see Factor C. Disease or Predation, below), as a combined effect, is the more likely scenario for population-level impacts to the plant. Additionally, the small and declining populations of the Fickeisen plains cactus make the species susceptible to natural environmental variability, including climate conditions. Therefore, based on our review of the best scientific and commercial data available, we conclude that the effects of climate change and drought are threats that have significant impacts to the Fickeisen plains cactus and its habitat.
Summary of Factor A
Based on our review of the best scientific and commercial data available, we conclude that fire associated with nonnative, invasive plant species; uranium mining; road construction and road maintenance; ORV use; and commercial development are not threats to the Fickeisen plains cactus and its habitat."	<urn:uuid:841e8afe-0979-4424-a8f3-c09234400c65>	0.0

What are better ways to study how people really behave?	"I also enjoy of looking my kids playing around – to see how they learn things, and to hear their funny thoughts and especially see how they draw so naturally.
6. What role does art play in your life? How does it change the way you view the world?
My father is a sculptor so art have always played important role in my life. It’s really hard to think the life without art.
Art gives me new ideas, perspective to the whole world, learn how to behave and how to face different kind of people and things you haven’t thought yourself before.
7. Where did you study?
I graduated from Lahti Institute of Design back in 2003. Since then I have been working in a shared studio space with other designers and illustrators – many of them are my classmates from Lahti.
To share a studio with friends must have been the best school for me. I can share my ideas and problems with my colleagues and learn new things everyday just watching how they work and solve their design problems.
8. Where do you see yourself in five years? Working in an agency?
I hope I have done a few more children’s books and some of them are translated to other languages. My agents work really hard for me so I might have a bunch of really nice clients around the world. But I guess I still work in the same studio with my friends.
9. What about in ten?
Nothing have really changed exept that the number of my picture books and translations of them have increased enourmously. And exept that my kids are teenagers and I have really hard as well as really nice time with them.
10. What do you hope to achieve with your art?
I hope my illustrations give good feelings and help people to stand their everyday life a little bit better. I dream that my picturebooks bring joy and hope to the kids and their parents who read them.
11. Now, tell us a little more about you as a person: what is your favourite food?
I really enjoy of eating my every day lunch with my friends and colleagues. Good company is for me even more important than the exact food. Though I must say that we have really good vegetarian lunch places next to our studio. At home I eat quite often Finnish rye bread with butter, tahini and slices of apple and that’s something quite unique.

describe typical duration frequency treatment schedule electroconvulsive therapy ect	"Nicol claimed it was “the first adverse event the firm has received,” in spite of other MDRs forwarded them by the FDA and outstanding lawsuits against the company.
ECT devices have never gone through standard clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy, though the FDA gave device manufacturers a 30-month time frame to do so in April of 1982. Thirty-four years later, this has never been done. Nevertheless, in December 2015, the FDA issued a proposed order to down-classify the device used to deliver electroshock therapy, a move followed by a wave of public outcry. Constitutional attorney Jonathan Emord recently filed a Citizen Petition with the FDA to prevent this reclassification on behalf of five individuals who were damaged by electroshock.
A feature-length exposé on electroconvulsive therapy, ECT device manufacturers and FDA corruption was published this month by award-winning journalist Ajay Singh in the latest edition of Freedom Magazine.
The Citizens Commission on Human Rights is dedicated to eradicating abuses committed under the guise of mental health and enacting patient and consumer protections.

workplace safety measures coal mines 1902 compared current nuclear waste facility rules protect workers public	"However, it does not include workers who get exposure to very small amounts of beryllium in raw materials, such as workers at coal-burning power plants. The worker safety rule can’t be formally adopted until the period for public comments ends on November 19, 2015.
If passed, the new beryllium exposure standard is a boost to worker safety. But it won’t help the thousands of people who face grave health issues due to previous exposure to the known workplace danger.
Like victims of mesothelioma, those who suffer from chronic beryllium disease or any catastrophic workplace danger may want to consult with an attorney experienced in catastrophic injury and wrongful death lawsuits to review their legal rights to fair and just compensation.

- Severe pain in the hip or lower groin region, sometimes radiating to the knee. Attempting to move the hip usually results in a significant increase in pain. In some cases, there may be only thigh or knee pain. Lower back pain may also occur.
- Stiffness, bruising, swelling, tenderness or deformity in and around the hip area.
- A shorter leg on the side of the injured hip.
- The leg on the side of the injured hip turns outward and is shortened.
- Difficulty walking. (Walking may still be possible with partial fractures)
- Inability to put weight on your leg.
What causes hip fracture?In elderly people, the direct cause of a hip fracture is usually a fall or accident, which may sometimes be relatively minor. The underlying cause is likely to be osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become brittle and more prone to fracture as a result of mineral loss).
In younger people, however, hip fractures are usually caused by a more severe injury, such as a motor vehicle accident, sports injury or high-impact fall.
In some people with certain medical conditions, such as severe osteoporosis, cancer, paralysis or kidney disease, the bones can become so weak and brittle that a hip fracture can occur during regular daily activities, simply from bearing the body's weight.
Who gets hip fracture and who is at risk?Those who suffer from osteoporosis are at risk and the risk factors are those for osteoporosis.
- Ageing. With age, the bones gradually lose calcium and other minerals and become less dense. Loss of density weakens bones and makes them more susceptible to fracture. Ninety percent of hip fractures occur in people over age 65.
- Female gender. Women lose bone density at a greater rate than men do, and as a result are two to three times more likely to experience a hip fracture: about one out of every seven women will have a hip fracture in her lifetime. Hip fractures are a particularly important concern for menopausal and post-menopausal women."	<urn:uuid:d9c1b798-0543-4466-9c1d-d247dde0a540>	0.0

How do geologists use satellite data in their work?	"Satellite Internet: Developing a Faster Connection Around the World
Satellite communications, currently used in some sectors, could be the next big thing in the telecommunications industry. What is the “space internet”? Why will it become important in the near future?
Technology has brought us fantastic tools like smartphones and computers, and has allowed us to accomplish incredible feats, like taking our first steps on the moon. But what do the internet and space have in common, you may ask?
In this article, our offshore esn examines the basics of the space internet, the different stakes, actors and benefits related to this innovation.
What is Satellite Internet?
The high seas, mountain peaks, and the heart of the desert are the goals of the space Internet, which must be able to serve regions without fiber optics or terrestrial infrastructure to carry signals.
To make it work, thousands of low-cost satellites are deployed in orbit around the earth. However, they differ from geostationary satellites, which are more commonly used in satellite internet.
By deploying 5G connectivity via satellites in low earth orbit, extreme geographic regions or remote areas will benefit from high-speed network coverage.
How does it work?
Space-based internet is actually not that different from satellite-based internet. Every time you surf the Internet, your satellite dish sends request data to satellites located 36,000 km above sea level.
The satellite transmits to a transmitting/receiving station belonging to the internet operator you have chosen. Once the page is retrieved, the station sends the data back to the satellite so that it can display the desired page. This is a journey of about 140,000 kilometers!
Such a distance causes latency between the request and the response, which providers are working hard to reduce. This is where the innovation of the space internet comes in.
Instead of sending satellites 36,000 km away, we are talking about sending them into low orbit. Smaller devices, and therefore more numerous, allowing to reduce the time of result, but also to cover the whole globe.
The satellites in low orbit make it possible to broadcast the Internet much more quickly. These small stellar armies are called constellations (in relation to their resemblance with the formation of real constellations seen from the Earth)."	<urn:uuid:52bf1318-e119-46b5-8abe-0dd0669c75f0>	0.0
How does climate change affect women's income and communities?	"With tutelage from climate change leader and former Vice President Al Gore, Loorz became a bit of a national celebrity as a youth willing to speak out about climate change.
He gave several keynote speeches and as a 14-year-old developed a sea-level awareness project in his hometown of Ventura, California. He and a group of middle schoolers installed 9-foot poles to showcase just how high the sea might be in the future.
The city council there agreed to include the possibility of rising sea levels in its long-range planning.
In 2011, after organizing a campaign to raise awareness about climate change that occurred in more than 200 cities, Loorz had the seeds of an idea that became iMatter.
While the effort attracted media attention and involvement, he saw it as largely symbolic gesture that did not force political change. He felt the next step would have to be engaging students in encouraging their communities to take concrete strategies on curbing climate change.
He and his supporters developed a website that offers standard climate report cards, tips on grassroots organizing, developing petitions, team building, dealing with media and other issues.
The movement will have authenticity because of who is leading the charge, Loorz said.
“It won’t stop the crisis, but it will change the narrative — talking about climate change in terms of generations to come,” he said. “Young people are the only constituency that can pull this off by saying, ‘This is going to affect our future and we think we should be taken seriously.’”"	<urn:uuid:0b859bd3-6401-419f-8c1a-8ac419a5768b>	0.0
I develop medical equipment for hospitals and I'd like to understand both the innovative aspects of quantum-based diagnostic tools and the occupational safety protocols needed when implementing new medical technologies - can you explain how the caesium atom detection system works and what safety measures need to be considered during its installation?	"You’ll first learn about a list of tools that you will likely need for the restoration process.
You can make a checklist of what you already have and what you may need to borrow or purchase before you get started.
Next, you’ll learn how to determine which batteries can still be restored.
Not all batteries are considered viable candidates for restoring, and this complete guide will help you determine the difference.
Once you’ve learned all the basics and everything you need to prepare before you get started, then comes the actual restoration process.
You will first learn about the proper disconnection and handling of dead or damaged batteries.
In EZ Battery Reconditioning program, emphasis is placed on this step because the mishandling of batteries is a common cause of potentially serious injuries.
You will also learn how to counter sulfuric acid, one of the processes that lead to the dysfunction and eventual death of most batteries.
They have different methods available for different kinds of batteries.
You will also learn about basic safety protocols on handling batteries, as well as the equipment you will need to make all of this work.
With accidents involving used batteries causing significant morbidities, this section is something we consider very relevant.
Now, that’s a lot of learning!
But again, all these will be very handy and advantageous for you both in the short and long term.
So be patient and relax, before you know it, you’ll be a master of reconditioned batteries.
The Pros and Cons
Each product has its own list of advantages and disadvantages so is this Program.
This will be complete injustice without listing all the positive aspects as well as negative aspects in this Ez Battery Reconditioning Review.
From our testing, we saw some of the things that allow EZ Battery Reconditioning system to stand out, as well as some factors that we think, are lacking.
I like how they created this book systematically.
Each step is properly detailed and is designed to help you restore your batteries in the proper sequence.
It includes information that applies to different types of batteries.
It includes simple-to-understand diagrams that are properly labeled so you can easily understand and follow what goes where.
Easy to Understand and Follow
I also like how they designed EZ Battery Reconditioning program using simple terms that even newbies can follow.
This book is simple to understand and will help you get the methods correct right off the bat. This will save you a lot of money and time, not just when you learn the techniques, but for the rest of your life."	<urn:uuid:de6076ff-8272-4317-9845-985d8367da74>	0.0
How do farming and fishing practices create ocean dead zones?	"Expo and Seafood Cocktail in Strasbourg – Sustainable Fishing: From the Sea to Your Plate
On Wednesday 3 February, Blue Fish Europe organised its second yearly event in the European parliament in Strasbourg, after the “Coast to Coast” exhibition in October 2014. The event was hosted by Renata Briano (S&D, Italy), Vice-Chair of the PECH Committee, and entitled “Sustainable fishing: from the sea to your plate”.
MEP Renata Briano, host of the event, with the producers present in Strasbourg
This event featured six sustainable seafood products from France and Portugal: oysters, langoustines, seaweed tartare, lobster soup and trout mousse and sardines. The highlight of the event was the presence of the producers, who travelled from Brittany and Northern Portugal to showcase their activities, and engage with participants on sustainable fishing in Europe.
From left to right:
Jean-Baptiste Goulard and his langoustines; Anne Menguy and her trout mousse with Scarlette Le Corre, fisherwoman; Joseph Thaeron and his oysters
Their presence was highly appreciated by the Members of the European Parliament who attended, giving them the opportunity to discover first-hand some of the best practices of sustainable fishing in Europe. Indeed, all the seafood products served on Wednesday are examples of what the entire European fishing sector can offer today, and illustrate the three pillars of sustainable development (environmental, social and economic).
From selective fishing of langoustines, to sustainable oyster farming, from the valorisation of “ugly” bits of smoked trout, to a seaweed farming activity that ensures a year-long livelihood, all the products showcased are illustrations of what the men and women working in the European fishing sector do best.
Blue Fish Europe and Renata Briano are proud of the outcome of the event, which gathered more than 150 attendees, and to have brought the reality of sustainable fishing in Europe to Parliament decision-makers. Blue Fish Europe will remain committed to being a catalyst for constructive change and positive engagement between the fishing sector and governments and hopes to make this event an annual gathering in the European Parliament."	<urn:uuid:bc62d8e5-ee2b-4c93-827f-db7f9ac9b2bc>	0.0
how do cats show dreaming behavior REM sleep	"Others find that aerophagia is reduced by using CPAP rather than APAP, or by using BiPAP.
12. Some of the Respironics CPAP and APAP machines have exhalation relief, called C-Flex, for patient comfort; if more comfortable, it may result in better compliance. (The current ResMed machine does not have EPR exhalation relief in the APAP mode.) C-Flex provides some degree of exhalation relief at a much lower cost than a BiPAP machine, although a BiPAP provides a greater degree of relief for those who require it.
APAP versus CPAP Research
Google APAP vs. CPAP studies. A few research articles:
Reasons why your titrated pressure may be wrong
The CPAP pressure setting determined in the sleep study may be too high once you settle into therapy.
1. In the sleep lab, you may have experienced more REM sleep (dreaming) for the first time in years, a REM rebound effect requiring a higher pressure. On xPAP therapy after your sleep patterns return to a normal amount of dreaming, your pressure may be too high.
2. Untreated sleep apnea may cause swelling in the mouth and throat, requiring a higher pressure setting in the lab. After xPAP treatment, the swelling may go down, requiring a lower setting.
3. If you had nasal congestion the night of your study due to allergies, a cold, chemical sensitivity, cool air, or air flow from the CPAP machine, a higher pressure setting would be required in the lab than your usual requirements.
Source: TS Johnson MD et al, Sleep Apnea – The Phantom of the Night, pages 168 – 169
REM (dream) sleep and sleeping on your back require higher pressure settings because of more apneic events. If you slept poorly and didn’t experience REM or sleep on your back, the technician had to guess what settings you might need. The technician may estimate a pressure that is actually too high or too low.
It’s true that your current titrated setting, if accurate, may not require an APAP. But what about next month or next year? If your weight goes up, you may require a higher setting; if it goes down, a lower one. If you start feeling tired again, you may need a different pressure setting."	<urn:uuid:15ad3f40-c26d-4669-9a02-0b2854efff5a>	0.0

What natural processes and resources are commonly used in sustainable wastewater treatment systems to make them more cost-effective than conventional methods?	"June 25, 2015
by Canadian Architect
Taking place at the University of Manitoba‘s Engineering and Information Technology Complex in Winnipeg from August 10-13, 2015, the 16th International Conference on Non-Conventional Materials and Technologies (NOCMAT) is a leading forum where scholars, governmental and non-governmental agencies, practitioners exchange innovations of low-energy cement technologies, new materials and systems, and innovative material/structural technologies such as bamboo, natural fibres, etc. towards cost-effective, durable, environmentally friendly, energy-efficient and sustainable construction. The development of innovative, non-conventional materials and technologies will also provide a significant role in eradication of poverty, creation of jobs, formation of global partnership for economic progress and social stability.
Non-conventional materials and technologies encapsulate innovation and sustainable use of novel technologies and innovative uses of more established materials. Many non-conventional materials in the 21st century have their roots in traditional vernacular construction, including earth (unfired clay), lime and natural plant based materials, such as bamboo, straw and reeds. For traditional materials and techniques to meet modern demands of construction, cost and performance requires further development, innovative solutions and systematic scientific research. Meanwhile materials of the industrial age, including steel and concrete, must also deliver more sustainable solutions. Innovations include manufacturing processes, lower-carbon materials, greater reuse of components on end use, greater recycling of materials, reduced waste, multi-span life-cycle design, and more prefabrication of components and buildings.
Keynote lectures, technical sessions, workshops, and tours of such groundbreaking projects as the Manitoba Hydro building and the Centre for Architectural Structures and Technology are on offer, along with a variety of social and networking events.

How do fine motor development skills compare to handwriting skills in terms of their impact on a child's daily activities and academic performance?	"Contact our Nanny Agency today and we will guide you through the whole process and discuss your childcare options with you!
In Denmark day-cares accept children ranging from 6 months old to 3 years old. 91.2% of 1-2 year old children are enrolled in different types of day-care institutions. Most of these are managed by a municipality and mostly government funded. The different types of institutions ranges from separate day-care institutions (Vuggestue), kindergartens with a day-care department (Integrerede institutioner) and in-home day-care (Dagpleje).
Where Is Child Care Worker
The quality of the center based child care can be very influential on the child and on their overall development. Recent study showed that children in low end classrooms saw the activities as forced while the children in high end classrooms had more memorable experiences. Even though this being the case between high and low end classrooms, other aspects such as the child's background and living situation can play an important role in their development. Active children may thrive in the educational activities provided by a quality commercial care center, but according to the National Center for Early Development and Learning, children from low quality centers may be significantly less advanced in terms of vocabulary and reading skills. Classes are usually largest in this type of care, ratios of children to adult caregivers will vary according to state licensing requirements. Some positive aspects of commercial care are that children may gain a sense of independence, academic achievement, and socialization. Not only is this age crucial for the improvement of their social skills, but also it begins the stages of understanding a classroom setting. Childcare is seen as a reasonable option because it is different than parenting, since it can be seen as more of a routine for the child. This in turn will only have a negative impact on the child if the parent is not their for the emotional needs of the child. Children are placed into centers of socialization and learn many similarities and differences from one another from a very young age. Children are also placed into settings to develop their linguistics and cognitive abilities, which can be measured through observations. Not only is this age crucial for the improvement of their social skills, but also it begins the stages of understanding a classroom setting. These early ages of the child's life are crucial or it would otherwise have a negative impact on their future paths.

What do Lusitania's exploration difficulties and organic farming's yield issues share?	"Many gardeners want to use biological remedies in the fight against pests, as well as fertilizers. But what should we use as natural fertilizer and insecticide?
We can use many natural things such as banana peels, coffee grounds, seaweed, tobacco dust, and many more. But you must know how and what amount you should use for your garden safety.
Here we will discuss the benefit of tobacco dust for the garden and lawn. Everyone knows about tobacco. It’s harmful to health. But the fewer people know that tobacco is good for plants and it has vast use in agriculture and livestock as insecticide, fungicide, and fertilizer.
So, let’s know How and why you should use tobacco dust in your garden or lawn?
Benefits of Tobacco Dust
What is tobacco dust?
Tobacco dust is the brown color waste that produces in the tobacco industry. It is mainly a by-product of the cigarette company. The tobacco dust can be found in the horticulture center in different packages for use as organic insecticide or fertilizer in domestic gardening. It can apply to crops in liquid and powder form.
Let’s have a look; why tobacco dust use in organic gardening?
- Tobacco dust contains a high amount of Nitrogen, Potassium, Phosphorous, and Iron.
- It is a great source of Nitrogen for newly grown houseplants.
- It has a high organic matter that makes it a good fertilizer.
- The tobacco dust promotes the active growth of the plants and also improves the yield and quality of the fruit. Moreover, it improves soil health by increasing the availability of trace elements and useful minerals.
- Tobacco dust also acts as a natural insecticide because of the nicotine that remains in it.
- It improves the electrical conductivity, water intake capacity, and water holding capacity of the soil.
Do you know? The use of tobacco dust as fertilizer can increase 40 % of the yield.
Composition of Tobacco Dust
The chemical composition of tobacco leaves is complex and rich, it includes not only nicotine (from 0.7 to 5%) and other alkaloids, but also organic proteins, carbohydrates, aromatic oils, etc. and minerals (calcium, potassium, magnesium, sulfur). This means tobacco dust are not only able to destroy harmful insects, but also to enrich the soil."	<urn:uuid:670564f3-2fce-4eaa-ad06-b2c57723663d>	0.0

what temperature needed for seeds to start growing	"This means that plants need long nights to produce flowers and set seed. In northern growing areas, the short days needed to trigger flowering don’t occur until too late in the season. As a result, frost often arrives before plants can flower.
Flowers on Salvia hispanica open along a spike, like other salvias. The petals have blue-purple tones. To harvest seeds, gather spikes when most of the petals have fallen. Don’t wait for spikes to turn brown, or you’ll lose a lot of your seeds. Place spikes in open paper bags to dry. Don’t bundle and hang spikes upside down because seeds will ripen and fall onto surfaces below.

In my animal behavior class, we're comparing social structures - how different are honeybee colonies from early human hunter-gatherer groups when it comes to making group decisions?	"Dear Secretary Vilsack:
As the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) develops its fiscal year (FY) 2015 budget request, we urge you to request significant additional resources to address the bee health decline challenges facing American beekeepers, including those experiencing Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Thank you in advance for your consideration of our views.
Agriculture as we know it today in the United States may not exist without honeybee pollination. In order for the country to have a healthy and plentiful food supply, honeybee pollination is necessary. USDA has estimated that honeybees pollinate about one-third of the human diet. In addition, pollination is responsible for up to $20 billion in added crop value, particularly for specialty crops such as nuts, berries, fruits, and vegetables.
The nation's beekeepers are facing numerous challenges that pose a threat to our food supply. The most significant challenge that USDA has the ability to address is bee health. We are losing honeybees at an alarming rate. In 1947, the United States had 6 million honeybee colonies. Today, there are only about 2.5 million. Since 2006 alone, 10 million beehives with a value of roughly $2 billion have been lost, most of which has been attributed to CCD alone.
More recently, preliminary results for the national survey of honeybee colony losses show that the disturbing trend continues. The survey shows a decline of 31.1 percent of honeybee colonies during the 2012/2013 winter, which is an increase of 42 percent over the previous winter. On average, beekeepers lost 45.1 percent of their colonies during the winter. That is an increase of 78.2 percent from the previous winter. It is our understanding that a normal loss rate is only around 15 percent.
While we appreciate the work of USDA's CCD Steering Committee, we believe that more needs to be done before it is too late. From our perspective, we should be making significant investments in research activities in the laboratory and in the field. It is our hope that the FY 15 budget request includes increased honeybee research funding at the Agricultural Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, including funds specifically dedicated to researching the role pesticides may play in overall bee health decline."	<urn:uuid:95bef9f4-4d23-41d2-89dc-1f160ee41b18>	0.0
what makes humor difficult translate between languages context importance	"Roll 300997: Books 18-20 (1872-1917) are rolls for the Frederiksted church. These books look very much like the Christiansted books, neat columns, although all are handwritten.
The biggest difficulty in using these rolls is the fact that they are written in Danish. As registers of names, though, it isn’t an insurmountable problem. This is actually most difficult in the earliest books where they record information in sentence form. For the tabular data the only difficulties relate to understanding occupations of fathers (for baptisms) or comments written in the fields. The combination of old Danish handwriting and archaic Danish spellings makes it quite difficult to translate since there is no context available to guess. Find a good translator because I found using web translation virtually impossible.
For my family, this is a key collection, as the van Beverhoudts appear to have been in the Dutch church to about 1788 and left the Lutheran church in the late 1800s. I found over 150 references to my family in this collection."	<urn:uuid:5f60e272-8741-4504-8dea-47738dc72dcf>	0.0
As a manufacturing consultant, I'm interested in understanding what makes China a good option for manufacturing, and how indoor vertical farming technologies might address some of the production challenges there. Can you explain both aspects?	"NIST program for Advanced Manufacturing awards grant to Center for Emerging and Innovative Sciences
The National Institute of Standards and Technology through its Advanced Manufacturing Technology Consortia Program (AMTech) has awarded $500,000 to the University of Rochester’s Center for Emerging and Innovative Sciences (CEIS) to lead the development of a national roadmap for photonics.
CEIS will work with its partners and with the National Photonics Initiative (NPI) to forecast the introduction of new technologies and identify manufacturing challenges that, if solved, can strengthen the competitiveness of domestic photonics companies and expand photonics manufacturing to the United States.
The U.S. has been the world leader in developing photonics technologies, which include fiber optics, lasers, digital imaging and flat panel displays. However, the U.S.’s share of photonics manufacturing has dropped to less than 10% of photonics components sold worldwide. The roadmap to be developed under this program will identify key priorities and lay out a plan for addressing this.
According to the National Research Council, optics and photonics technologies are essential for our nation: they are used to fabricate integrated circuits that power all electronic devices, are central to modern defense systems and medical imaging technologies, and they enable a host of modern day products used in everyday life including the internet, flat panel displays, and smart phones.
“The roadmap will address critical gaps to increase our nation’s competitiveness in photonics manufacturing,” said Robert L. Clark, senior vice president for research at the University of Rochester and dean of the Hajim School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. “Our Congressional delegation fully understands the importance of bringing photonics manufacturing back to the U.S., and I want to thank them for their leadership and persistent efforts in support of this initiative. We are excited to be able to lead this effort in partnership with industry and other key stakeholders.”
Photonics is one area of advanced manufacturing the AMTech program will be supporting. AMTech was designed to address the gap between research & development activities and the deployment of technological innovations in the domestic production of goods. This gap is economically damaging and it has been highlighted by the National Science and Technology Council, the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, and other bodies.
“The National Academies’ report, ‘Optics and Photonics, Essential Technologies for our Nation,’ shouted about the abysmal state of data on optics and photonics jobs and investment in the US."	<urn:uuid:629885b7-a3d8-45b4-8ae3-9027bc033d16>	0.0

neural development toddler brain adolescent brain compare	"Indeed, according to this measure, humans have the largest coefficient of taste (7.5), which is much larger than that of the dolphin (5.3) and the mouse (0.5).
But does having a bigger brain mean your intelligence level is higher?
Some studies will answer yes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has enabled scientists to compare the size of the brain to some human beings and sought to link these measurements to the intelligence of those humans.
Statistical meta-analyzes of 26 different studies showed that the level of association between brain size and intelligence ranged from 0.3-0.4. More recently, genome-wide association studies on more than 20,000 human samples have revealed the discovery of a gene associated with the determination of an individual’s intelligence level.
According to the results of the study, the difference in the gene (HMGA2), which is responsible for the composition of the protein that regulates DNA copies and cell growth, is associated with increased internal volume of the skull and IQ as well.
To be honest, I find this correlation somewhat confusing. It is clear that there is a Mai that affects the level of intelligence more than the size of the brain otherwise Albert Einstein was the world’s feat and the average brain size is unlucky. It is important to think about how to define intelligence and to keep in mind that the studies mentioned above show a correlation between brain volume as a result of an individual in the IQ test.
Although this test is the most widely used in history, it can not in any case measure all aspects of human intelligence nor be a constant display of all cognitive abilities of individuals.
Fortunately, more information can be detected when we look at the brain in more detail. Many scientists now believe that the complication of the cellular and molecular structure of neural connections or synapses is the true determinant of the computational power of the brain.
This view is also supported by the findings that IQ is more closely related to frontal and gray matter volumes, which contain more dense numbers of neurons and synapses, than to the total size of the brain. Another research comparing the proteins at the ends of neural engagement in different organisms suggests that the components of synapses at the molecular level have a huge impact on IQ during the evolutionary history of organisms.
So even though having a large brain is a predictor of greater intelligence, IQ probably depends more on the extent that different parts of the human brain communicate effectively with one another."	<urn:uuid:fe6d43c8-6970-475c-9ef4-8b9f82ac9a2d>	0.0
What are the unique characteristics and structural differences between cow's and sheep's milk cheeses, and how do safety considerations vary between artisanal and industrial production?	"specific for house dust mites, for cow's milk proteins or those substances that we think the child may be allergic to, and analyzed.
Is a child with allergic parents more predisposed to allergies?
Really if. When we have two parents who are allergic the possibility that their son is also allergic is between 50 and 80%. If only one of the parents is allergic, the predisposition drops to between 20 and 40%. But keep in mind that up to 15% of children suffer from allergies without their parents being allergic.
Is there a specific treatment to combat them?
Yes, we do have treatment and the children are cured. The treatment will be different depending on what the child has. For example, if it is a child who has an allergy to cow's milk, we make an exclusion diet and use a Nutramigen LGG type hydrolyzate, which is a highly hydrolyzed milk , and the child's problem usually disappears in a year. If the allergy is due to house dust mites or some pollen or mold, then the treatment is different. You can use, for example, immunotherapy , what people commonly call allergy shots, which consists of a puncture in the arm or droplets under the tongue that are put on every day. Lately for allergies to pollens have come some pills that make the patient's allergy disappear. Thank God with any treatment of these the allergy is permanently cured ."	<urn:uuid:045cb81e-4a3b-401e-85ac-cee6b63a24c4>	0.0
I'm researching genetic therapies - what are the main differences between somatic and germline gene therapy, and what are the key ethical concerns associated with each type?	Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous cluster of clonal hematopoietic neoplasms manifested by peripheral cytopenias, lineage dysplasia, and a predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia. The pathophysiology of MDS has not been well illustrated. Nevertheless, studies have implicated the MDS phenotype in a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities. In addition to the known numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities, with novel genomic sequencing technologies, approximately 80% of MDS patients have been shown to harbor somatic or acquired gene mutations. The mutations have been found to be related to RNA slicing, transcription regulation, DNA methylation, histone modification, DNA repair/tumor suppressor, signal transduction, and the cohesion complex. The clinical significance of the majority of genetic events has been validated based on a large cohort study that identified mutations as predictors for risk stratification in MDS patients and biomarkers for potential targeted therapies. In this review, we describe all novel key mutations in MDS and their significance in pathophysiology and clinical practice.	<urn:uuid:638a2478-0790-4685-8c76-6589d19fcc41>	0.0

Naming things is hard.
""There are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors."" – Leon Bambrick
- Avoid ambiguity
- Search for similar keywords in existing features, extensions, products, and projects, to avoid confusion and a profusion of hatnotes and seealsos. (e.g., Collection vs Collections, Labs vs labs vs labs, Page Previews vs page previews)
- Make it easy to pronounce, to type, and to remember
- Avoid l33t5p34k, avoid difficult capitalizations (e.g., SyntaxHighlight GeSHi), and don't use dashes if CamelCase is the local convention.
- Consider the translations
- If it is a user-facing feature, this is extra important. Is the word almost-untranslatable or extra-long, in any discoverable language? (e.g., help, randompage, [better examples needed...] )
- Check it isn't a reserved keyword in the usual programming languages
- This can lead to additional complexity in the code (e.g., Echo). For example: Puppet reserved words.
- For long names, specify the short form. People tend to shorten anything they can, especially if they write it regularly, as help-desk people and developers tend to do. Contractions/Initialisms/Acronyms will be invented, if you don't plan for it. (e.g., visual editor is ""VE"" to many people, see also m:Glossary and Manual:Glossary)
- Stick with a single name
- Try to pick just one name, for both the code & the user-facing product name. Otherwise you'll have to regularly explain the past/alternative names, and deal with persistent confusion. (e.g., Page-triage/Page-curation/Newpagepatrol/Newpagesfeed, or Echo/Notifications, or Popups/Hovercards/PagePreviews).

What makes wine from Pomerol so special?	"Masters of Riesling - Jim Barry Wines
We caught up with second generation winemaker Peter Barry, whose stunning Jim Barry The Lodge Riesling 2015 from the Clare Valley is the Wine of the Month for August.
What makes the Clare Valley such a special grape growing wine region?
The Clare Valley is such a special grape growing region due to the warm days and cool nights which allow grapes to ripen fully but retain natural acidity and hence freshness. The undulating hills provide many aspects so we can grow Riesling, Shiraz and Cabernet on different slopes of the same vineyard.
What are some of the winemaking challenges it presents?
The major winemaking challenge in Riesling is sunburn, which can be mitigated by canopy management to ensure no fruit is exposed to direct sunlight. For red wine, it is about picking at the right time to achieve a balance between ripeness and acid without the grapes becoming over ripe.
What have been some of Jim Barry Wines’ greatest achievements in recent years?
We’ve had great success, but some of the standouts include:
Mathew Jukes Australian Winery of the year for 2016.
Trophy for 2016 Lodge Hill Riesling at the 2016 Royal Sydney Wine Show
Trophy for Barry Brothers Shiraz Cabernet for 2013 as the Brisbane and Melbourne Wine Shows, as well as Trophy in Brisbane for the 2014 vintage.
Trophy for best producer at the Clare Valley Wine Show for five of the past six vintages.
Also we’re very proud to have introduced the Greek variety of Assyrtiko to Australia.
Can you sum up your experience of the 2016 vintage in a few words?
Good rains in January hydrated very thirsty vines, leading to an exceptional vintage.
When Jim Barry purchased the Lodge Hill vineyard in 1977 he was confident it would “produce some of the best Riesling in Clare”. What did he see that was so special about this vineyard?
Three things. Elevation which leads to cooler night and better acid retention in Riesling, rocky/slatey soil meaning the vines have to send their roots deep into the ground in search of moisture and many aspects to suit Riesling, Shiraz and Cabernet.
The Jim Barry The Lodge Hill Riesling 2015 is the Wine Selectors Wine of the Month for August. What makes this a standout expression of the variety?"	<urn:uuid:ca990033-e652-45b2-842c-fe136bf4a206>	0.0

How We Got Started
During the 1880s, the transition from outhouses to indoor plumbing was moving at a rapid pace, starting with better homes and commercial buildings. The burgeoning market for indoor plumbing spurred some gasfitters and other metal workers to specialize in this work.
The true craftsmen sought ways to distinguish those who knew what they were doing from those who didn’t. In 1882, a group of these new tradesmen in New York City banded together to form the Master Plumbers Association of New York Shortly afterward, a like-minded group joined forces in Brooklyn.
In 1883, the 125 members of the New York group formed the National Association of Master Plumbers (NAMP) to provide the public with a complete, safe and sanitary plumbing system."	<urn:uuid:28a5a89e-afab-40b1-8621-ae6ff8a95df0>	0.0
What's the best type of mortar mix for strong brick walls?	“Data is the new oil”, we all say. Brick-and-mortar retailers are heavily relying on data points, such as their updated market share, best selling products and brands, demographics, pricing and discount strategy, breakdown of the product and category mix etc. to stay competitive in the market. Traditional measurement and data analytics companies such as Nielsen, Kantar and Ipsos provide data and marketing studies from offline transactions, but they are unable to measure online KPIs. As a consequence, e-merchants run their businesses without almost any transaction based market data. But is this data available? Yes. Foxintelligence found a very witty way to offer this type of data, not only in real time, but also at an item level, by scanning e-receipts in mailboxes. Clearly, this is a game changer, even if we accepted the risk of an email provider dependency and efforts related to regulatory compliance. Foxintelligence offers gold for any merchant and other businesses as no one can ignore online developments and the rapidly growing e-commerce space.	<urn:uuid:cec4e615-5661-4285-bae7-fac636d7d9da>	0.0

I'm researching global environmental threats - what's the connection between carbon dioxide absorption and chemical contamination in terms of their effects on water systems?	"What are some good questions to ask about photosynthesis?
Photosynthesis test questions
- What are the products of photosynthesis?
- What colour is chlorophyll?
- Where does photosynthesis take place?
- What are the reactants of photosynthesis?
- When do plants respire?
- When do plants photosynthesise?
- What are the cells near the top of leaves called?
- What does xylem carry?
What happens at noontime in the leaf of a plant?
Photosynthesis occurs only in the mesophyll layers of plant leaves and, in some instances, in mesophyll cells in the stem. Mesophyll cells are sandwiched between the leaf’s upper and lower epidermis and contain numerous chloroplasts, where photosynthesis takes place. Chloroplasts are incredibly small.
Why is the root of a plant unable to absorb mineral salts from the soil if it is given a poison that prevents respiration?
Since the poison prevents respiration from occurring in the root, the energy needed to move mineral salts from the soil through the membranes of the root cells into the root cannot be made.
What is photosynthesis question answer?
Answer: Photosynthesis is the process in which green plants use sunlight to make their own food. Photosynthesis requires sunlight, chlorophyll, water, and carbon dioxide gas as raw materials.
Does the size of a leaf affect photosynthesis?
Yes, larger the leaf size, higher is the rate of photosynthesis. Larger leaf size has a broader surface area with more chloroplasts, absorbs more light from the sun and more number of stomata present on the surface of the leaves, which play a crucial role in gaseous exchange during the process of photosynthesis.
How are minerals transported into the roots of a plant?
Root hair cells Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis. They absorb mineral ions by active transport, against the concentration gradient. Root hair cells are adapted for taking up water and mineral ions by having a large surface area to increase the rate of absorption.
What is photosynthesis for 8th class?
Photosynthesis is the physico-chemical process by which plants can convert light energy into chemical energy, in the form of carbohydrate from simple inorganic substances like atmospheric carbon dioxide and water. Photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide, sunlight, water and chlorophyll as its basic raw materials."	<urn:uuid:7d7a3444-7670-4e05-a9cc-b78a22b5c4c6>	0.0

nose blockage and yellow mucus not going away with cold medicine what could this mean	"Mucus-ridden stools and other symptoms such as stomachache, fever, poor appetite, and general lethargy.
Take your baby to a doctor if you see these signs or if you suddenly notice mucus in stools. There are various reasons why a baby could have more mucus in the stools.
What Could Cause Excess Mucus In The Baby’s Poop?
Some conditions cause excessive production of mucus by the mucous membranes:
- Irritable bowel syndrome: A genetic ailment that causes several symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and the presence of excessive white-colored mucus. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) consistently produce excess mucus (3) (4). At least 25% (1 out of 4) of the time, the stool will contain surplus mucus (5).
- Intussusception: A condition where a section of the intestine collapses and folds on itself to create a ring-like blockage. It is most common among babies between the ages of five to nine months (6). Intussusception can cause the baby to excrete jelly-like, mucus-ridden stools (7).
- Ulcerative colitis: It is chronic inflammation of the large intestine. Irritation of the bowel, pain, and stool with mucus are among the symptoms (8). Ulcerative colitis is one of the many inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (9).
- Cystic fibrosis: A genetic disorder that leads to excess production of mucus. It leads to the accumulation of excessive mucus in the lungs and digestive system (10). Infants with the condition may excrete more mucus than usual.
- Intestinal infection: Several intestinal pathogens can lead to the passage of more mucus in stools. Examples of some infections are E. coli bacteria infection (11), and infections due to intestinal parasites (12).
- Bowel polyps: These are small growths emerging from the inner lining of the gastrointestinal tract. They often lead to rectal bleeding and mucus in stools (13). Polyps in infants and toddlers are called juvenile polyps (14).
- Allergies: An infant with allergies and food intolerance can excrete excessive mucus in their stool. This happens because of the inflammation of the intestine due to ingestion of an allergic food (15)."	<urn:uuid:a9b603de-f2c8-458a-a7ed-c4f976dddabb>	0.0
What factors are important for successful cabbage cultivation in terms of soil and water, and how do these compare to the conditions needed for proper fermentation of cabbage?	It is applied to a variety of crops in the study area including citrus crops, tobacco, grapes and some vegetables. Under this specific scenario and application regime, a PEC value of 3.7 µg/ℓ was predicted to occur in the study area. Dichlovos is an insecticide and acaricide used in the study area on spinach, cabbage, other vegetable crops and on grapes. The Environmental Health Criteria (EHC) review concluded that, with the exception of gross spillage, recommended use does not constitute a hazard for aquatic and terrestrial organisms (Tomlin, 2000). It is non-persistent in the environment with rapid decomposition in the atmosphere (Tomlin, 2000). Parathion is classified as a compound with low mobility based on Koc values and leaching studies. Parathion is rapidly degraded under laboratory and field conditions (Tomlin, 2000). It is an organophosphate insecticide and acaricide which has a moderate toxicity to aquatic invertebrates and fish (Mulla and Mian, 1981). Parathion was applied to vegetables (cabbage, cucumber and lettuce), grapes, tobacco, maize, and cotton within the study area. Cypermethrin is a pyrethroid insecticide used on cabbage, lettuce and onions as well as tobacco and maize in the study area. The EHC concluded that biological degradation is rapid, with the subsequential levels of cypermethrin and its degradation products in soil and surface waters being very low (Tomlin, 2000). Thus, under field conditions, fish are not expected to be at risk from normal agricultural usage of cypermethrin even though it is classified as being highly toxic to invertebrates and vertebrates. Bollmohr et al. (2007) indicated an acute exposure toxicity ratio of 0.01 based on calculated concentrations found in water of 0.001 µg/ℓ. The PEC value given by PRIMET was higher than these estimates (0.2 µg/ℓ) thus resulting in a higher ETR of 55. This value translates into higher potential risk. Deltamethrin is also a pyrethroid insecticide that is highly toxic to fish under laboratory conditions using a continuous exposure but is not toxic to fish under natural conditions using a natural exposure regime.	<urn:uuid:238d1f38-7b62-40fc-87d5-f7ba78eaa05d>	0.0
My doctor mentioned that both TMJ and sleep apnea can affect children - what are the main symptoms and health risks for kids with these conditions?	"Cancer: Long term use of testosterone may cause an increased risk for developing prostate or breast cancer. If this is a concern, discuss the risks and benefits of using this medication with your doctor.
Diabetes: Testosterone may cause an increase in blood sugar levels and glucose tolerance may change. People with diabetes may find it necessary to monitor their blood sugar more frequently while using this medication.
If you have diabetes or are at risk for developing diabetes, discuss with your doctor how this medication may affect your medical condition, how your medical condition may affect the dosing and effectiveness of this medication, and whether any special monitoring is needed.
Heart disease and stroke: This medication may increase blood pressure and worsen symptoms of heart disease. It may also increase the risk of blood clots or stroke. If you have heart disease such as high blood pressure, angina, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmia, or a history of heart attack, blood clots, or stroke, discuss with your doctor how this medication may affect your medical condition, how your medical condition may affect the dosing and effectiveness of this medication, and whether any special monitoring is needed.
Liver function: Liver disease or reduced liver function may cause this medication to build up in the body, causing side effects. If you have liver problems, discuss with your doctor how this medication may affect your medical condition, how your medical condition may affect the dosing and effectiveness of this medication, and whether any special monitoring is needed. Additionally, testosterone may reduce liver function and can cause liver failure. Your doctor may want to test your liver function regularly with blood tests while you are taking this medication.
If you experience symptoms of liver problems such as fatigue, feeling unwell, loss of appetite, nausea, yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, dark urine, pale stools, abdominal pain or swelling, and itchy skin, contact your doctor immediately.
Prostate problems: Men with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), an enlarged prostate gland, may experience an increase in the symptoms. If you have BPH, discuss with your doctor how this medication may affect your medical condition, how your medical condition may affect the dosing and effectiveness of this medication, and whether any special monitoring is needed.

What are the key variables in convertible debt and bee population health?	"Case example 3: Iterative rim weightingTo determine the appropriate weighting for a simplified 2-variable case, we first find the sum of the sample size across each dimension (numbers for illustration purposes only):
|State||ATSIH worker||Audiologist||Chiropractor||Dentist||Dietitian||Sum of sample size|
|Sum of sample size||450||2280||150||60||60||3000|
We then compare the sample size with the known distribution in the population. To develop weights for each of the categories required (e.g. Audiologists in Victoria), we alternately rake by each dimension, until sample weights converge to the actual population size.
For example, commencing with the population by state:
|State||Sum of sample size||Known population||Rake factor|
Multiplying each row by its rake factor gives the correct distribution by state, but fails to account for known population by profession:
|State||ATSIH worker||Audiologist||Chiropractor||Dentist||Dietitian||Sum of weights|
|Sum of weights||441.59||2284.61||153.10||60.35||60.35||3000|
Alternately raking by profession, we determine rake factors across columns using the same method:
|Sum of weights||441.59||2284.61||153.10||60.35||60.35|
Now, multiplying each column by its rake factor gives the correct distribution by profession, but unbalances the distribution by state:
|State||ATSIH worker||Audiologist||Chiropractor||Dentist||Dietitian||Sum of weights|
|Sum of weights||600||2120||150||100||30||3000|
Iterating the raking process until convergence gives a series of weights to be allocated to each population category (e.g. Audiologists in Victoria), such that their emphasis within the survey analysis matches their representation in the population as a whole.
Weighting variables usedAs described, the allied health sample was iteratively weighted across four variables:
1. Practitioner type
|Practitioner type||Sample distribution||Population distribution|
|Aboriginal Health Worker||7%||3%|
|State||Sample distribution||Population distribution|
|Region||Sample distribution||Population distribution|
|Gender||Sample distribution||Population distribution|
PurposeWe used cluster analysis to group practitioners with similar needs and attitudes."	<urn:uuid:bb779a91-d483-4e60-91c5-215df3813c8d>	0.0

marine animal food chain pollution effects	"Read through just about any pet food ingredient list—whether wet or dry—and you’ll find corn. When corn is improperly dried or stored the mold species Aspergillus can grow and develop into the toxin Aflatoxin. Elevated levels of Aflatoxin-contaminated pet food can be deadly if consumed. Although there are ways for farmers and manufacturers to test corn for toxins, too much of it has been able to slip through the cracks, be used as ingredients in pet food distributed by major brands, and find its way into households worldwide. Iams, Marksman, River Run, and Arrow are just a few of the brands recalled because of illness or death as a result of consumed contaminated pet food products in the last decade.
Pet food contamination can also occur after the food leaves the farm. Nearly three years ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the Final Rule on the Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food. It was April of 2016 when the FDA published this new rule—which was one of seven comprising the overarching Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). In response to the flurry of animal food product recalls in recent years, the FDA established this rule to curtail dangerous practices, which put the safety of animal food chain transportation at risk. These risks included improper food protection procedures, substandard vehicle cleanings between stops, and the inability to properly refrigerate food. This rule focused on overall food safety procedures instead of just emphasizing general food quality. Failure to adhere to any of these standards can also lead to illness or death of animals and costly, but preventable product recalls.
Potential contaminants at the farm and in transit are just two of the reasons animal food chain tracing measures are critical to the safety of pets and animals everywhere. For serious animal lovers and animal food chain managers, it’s not good enough to know the brand of pet foods. It’s imperative to have the ability to trace an animal’s lifecycle from the farm until it reaches your pet or animal’s mouth. This requires a concentrated effort to gather and protect data throughout the global animal food chain to alert the appropriate parties to issues before they escalate to recall situations.
Animal Food Chain Traceability
Complete animal food chain traceability is no small feat, and it’s literally a life or death matter."	<urn:uuid:3d365475-c6da-4d64-a1c3-88db11b72e33>	0.0

What are its outdoor durability properties, and which adhesive solutions work best for it?	"What is more comforting than enjoy your day relaxing on the sun bed or lounger while having conversation or other relaxing activities? Patio set will accommodate your needs of doing outdoor activities or just relaxing. Wide ranges of garden furniture are offered in many furniture stores and supplier. The furniture offered also varied in style, designs and material, which is adjusted to the customers’ needs and preferences. In fact, determining furniture material is even more important than its style or design.
Garden and patio set is purposed for outdoor use, so the material used should be able to resist the outdoor weather, even to extreme weather. Excessive heat, hard rain and snow enable to accelerate weathering of the furniture. Therefore, checking the quality and durability of the furniture before purchase will be very important for you. Wide range of outdoors materials is able to be your preferences, from natural to synthetic materials. Each of materials brings different advantages and disadvantages also.
Natural material like wood, bamboo and rattan are very popular as furniture material. It is common to find houses decorated with wood furniture or rattan patio set on their outdoor. However, not all kinds of wood can be used as outdoors, because outdoor furniture requires durability more than indoors. Teak is the most popular material for outdoors. It is even called as a king of outdoor. Teak wood has remarkable durability and density, either for its natural beauty.
Other materials used for garden furniture is metal and synthetic materials. Metal is the most durable and strongest material than others, because it will not decay. Metal is perfect for outdoor spaces with no roof to provide shade. The disadvantages is that metal is heavier than other and it need regular treatment to avoid it from rust and corrosion. Synthetic material perhaps is more affordable than other previous materials. Patio sets made from synthetic material is available in various bright colors selection. It will not available in any materials. It creates distinctive and modern looks on your outdoor spaces.

body composition testing methods hydrostatic weighing dexa scan radiation exposure safety concerns	"Maintaining the monocytes in such close proximity to the irradiation sources has proven particularly effective in ensuring adequate exposure of the monocyte/lymphocyte fraction to the activating radiation. In the case where a psoralen such as 8-MOP is used as the photoactivatable agent, the irradiation sources emit ultraviolet A radiation (UVA) as the activating radiation. To activate the psoralen, the monocytes are typically exposed to about 1-2 joules/cm2 of UVA for a period of from about 15 to about 150 minutes.
As noted above, other methods of initiating the differentiation of monocytes to functional dendritic cells may be employed. It has been found that differentiation can be initiated simply by exposing the monocytes to physical perturbation. Thus, for example, centrifuging the monocytes during leukapheresis, and/or passing the monocytes through the narrow channel in the exposure device, thereby applying gentle shearing forces to them, or subjecting the monocytes to hydrostatic pressure will initiate differentiation of the monocytes into functional dendritic cells. This differentiation into dendritic antigen presenting cells is maximized after about 6 to about 48 hours incubation, under conditions described in this application. Differentiation can also be initiated by administering a DNA binding agent, such as mitomycin C or a cis-platinum compound, to the subject. While these agents may be effective in initiating differentiation, they remain in an active state when returned to the subject and thus are not as desirable as the psoralens for treating the monocytes.
It should also be understood that it is not absolutely necessary to separate the monocytes from the extracorporeal quantity of the patient's blood prior to treatment. Subjecting the extracorporeal quantity of the patient's blood to physical forces, or administering the photoactivatable agent to the subject prior to photopheresis and/or adding the agent to the quantity of blood, and then exposing the quantity of blood including the monocytes to the activating radiation are also effective in initiating differentiation of the monocytes into functional dendritic cells. As long as the monocytes are sufficiently exposed to physical forces, and/or pharmacologic agents, such as photo-activated 8-MOP, to initiate differentiation into dendritic cells followed by subsequent incubation, separation of the monocyte population is not required.
Following treatment to initiate differentiation, the treated monocytes are sequestered for incubation."	<urn:uuid:b3ba3862-ef86-417f-8883-fc90f426a78c>	0.0
planning to go camping range creek bears food safety precautions need to know	"Have you ever experienced the golden view of the sunrise?
Yes, we are talking about beach camping. When you step ahead of your tent and stretch your arms by welcoming the awesome view of nature, it is indecipherable.
Although there are many beautiful places for camping starting from forests, mountains to the riverside. However, sometimes we need to change the taste when it comes to travel.
By saying this we mean to say the change in scenery by setting up a tent beside the soothing view of ocean horizons. Just imagine you are sitting and enjoying the relaxing sound of the waves that are touching the golden shoreline.
Camping on the beach is quite different from camping in the forest, valleys or mountains. But you can only enjoy the beach camping only when the weather is good and with proper beach camping hacks.
So in this article, we have listed some useful beach camping tips and tricks that will guarantee you to enjoy the camping to its fullest.
Useful Beach Camping Tips and Tricks that you need to follow
Camping is always a great and fun-filled experience where you can spend time with nature but beach camping is next to awesome.
However, if you are one who has never gone for beach camping then there is something that you need to follow which will help in giving you a better camping experience.
Let’s have a look at the beach camping hacks now:
Research where you are going
The first and foremost beach camping hack is to know the details of the place where you are going. You can take the help of the internet or the local websites and gather as much information as possible for the better camping experience.
Also Read: Best Beaches In The World
Study whether they have good drinking water sources or if you can get ready-made cooked food.
Not only this but you also have to ask whether there is any flushing toilets or showers available.
And the last thing to ask is whether you can lite bonfires which can be the great companion of beachside camping.
Know-how is the weather
As we have mentioned above, good weather always plays a significant role in the beachside camping. And most of the campers miss this step, thus end up making their camp trip into an unpleasant experience.
Once you decide the location of the beach camping, go through the weather reports of those particular days and then plan accordingly.
Track the tides digitally
The third and one of the best beach camping tips and tricks in our list is to track the tides. This point has been specifically been listed for safety purpose."	<urn:uuid:9328a4d0-f097-4ca1-b2e3-8e4db5c3b23a>	0.0
What healing roles do masters serve in martial arts versus veterinary settings?	"Even Jennifer Lopez, popular in romantic comedy roles, achieved two of her biggest disasters with films in which she impersonated brutal killers: an avenging, battered wife, who masters martial arts in Enough, and a ruthless, amoral hit woman in the reviled Gigli.
Public rejection of such fare reflects the deep-seated refusal to accept trendy notions that women match men in brute and violent tendencies. Despite political correctness, most of us continue to harbor a visceral preference for brawny male cops or firefighters to come to our rescue in emergencies.
In the past, Hollywood’s hyperfeminine sex symbols never tried to match men in terms of physical strength, but their classic roles still showed them holding their own in the battle of the sexes by deploying traditional female advantages of smarts, sex appeal, emotional resilience and intuitive understanding.
One of today’s rising young stars is Reese Witherspoon, who played the ultimate girlie-girl in the popular Legally Blonde movies - a sorority sister with hot pink accessories who confounds skeptics as the sharpest mind at Harvard.
If aspiring actresses hope to pry their way into the exclusive Boy’s Club of top moneymakers, they should heed Witherspoon’s example. The public doesn’t yearn for stylish chicks to replicate the sweaty brutality of male action stars, but prefers watching characters who display the distinctively feminine strengths associated with the natural superiority of women."	<urn:uuid:6d339d1b-7867-4e58-afe6-1d54ec45c95e>	0.0
trying to save my houseplants need help what color light wavelengths do plants use	"I hear about it time and again. Someone wins a quad copter or purchased one after being convinced at a farm show, to get it home and use it for pretty pictures of their field once or twice. Don’t get me wrong, there are advantages to finally having an aerial view of your crop in-season. But, true agricultural aerial imagery is so much more than a pretty picture.
We specialize in three types of imagery at Hewitt Precision Insights – NDVI, RGB, and thermal imagery. Each type of imagery serves a specific purpose and fulfills a need depending on what an individual grower is searching for.
NDVI is best suited for in-season imagery of your growing crop. NDVI stands for Normalized Difference Vegetative Index. It’s basically a mathematical formula that measures the reflected light at different wavelengths. The healthier the plants are, the more light they reflect allowing us to differentiate between less healthy and healthier plants. These images are visualized as a color spectrum much like a yield map. Just like a yield map, I use red colors for the less healthy plants, moving up the spectrum towards orange, yellow, green, and finally blue as the healthiest areas in your field. With this information, we can go out and scout the less healthy areas to find the reason they are not performing as well. This can be from bugs, disease, fungus, or terrain. After we find the issue, steps can be taken to improve the health before yield damage occurs. Data shows that NDVI imagery can detect crop threats 10 days before the naked eye. Once an issue is seen in a field, the damage is already done. This imagery allows us to save yield.
RGB is best suited for an introductory to aerial imagery. Seeing your field from a bird’s eye view gives you the ability to see the variation in canopy color across the whole field. Using this imagery, we can go find out why the lighter green, or yellow spots in the canopy are less healthy. This allows us to make a change before any damage gets worse through the growing season. I say this imagery is a good introduction, because after you see it, I think you’ll be excited about the possibility of getting more resolution and contrast in your fields.
Thermal is best suited for bare ground mapping. Thermal imagery is a recording of temperature. This is useful for soil type mapping, planting time decisions, and tile mapping."	<urn:uuid:5a2b2653-ac5f-457b-bbbb-bcbfccd2c28c>	0.0
how modify trust agreement when laws family circumstances change	"Modifying Parenting Plans in Florida
May 25, 2015
A parenting plan is an essential tool for co-parenting. The creation of a parenting plan is required in all cases where parents have time-sharing with minor children. The plan outlines each parent’s responsibilities to the child and specifies a time-sharing schedule. Courts approve parenting plans based on the child’s best interests, but sometimes it may be appropriate to change the terms of a parenting plan.
A parenting plan is a court order, so modification requires the court’s approval. To modify a parenting plan or time-sharing schedule in Florida, there must be a “substantial, material, and unanticipated change of circumstances” since the custody determination was made. The parent seeking the change must show that:
- The circumstances have substantially changed.
- It is in the child’s best interest to have the parenting plan modified.
Determining what constitutes a change in circumstances differs in each case, and the statute does not list circumstances that qualify as a substantial change. Instead, courts look at the individual facts of each case to decide whether a modification is warranted. Additionally, the child’s input may also be taken into consideration if appropriate. Past case law can give examples of circumstances that have justified a change, which have included:
- Evidence of one parent causing parental alienation.
- One parent’s failure to comply with the parenting plan.
- One parent unilaterally changing the child’s school.
- A parent interfering with the other parent’s visitation.
- Not allowing the child to call the other parent.
- Refusing to return the child after time sharing period.
- Willfully raising false allegations of abuse against the other parent, causing trauma to the child.
- Making obscene and derogatory comments about the other parent.
- Serious concerns regarding the moral fitness of one parent.
- Misleading the court in an effort to gain custody of the child.
- Causing trouble in front of the children when the children have time-sharing with the other parent.
- Making co-parenting as difficult as possible.
An acrimonious relationship and lack of communication between the parents, without further changed circumstances, is insufficient to warrant a modification of a parenting plan.
If possible, parents should come to an agreement about changes to a parenting plan. They then need to have their modification approved by a judge before it becomes legally effective."	<urn:uuid:5207a87f-2b1f-433e-aecb-38147777205a>	0.0

marine scientist here terrapin keystone species significance	"According to the National Academy of Sciences, fishing boats that trawl on the bottom destroy important seafloor habitat, decimating corals, sponges and other sensitive areas. Many of these seafloor animals and habitat areas can take centuries to recover, if they recover at all.
""Bottom trawling has devastating impacts on important seafloor habitats and compromises the resilience of an ecosystem,"" said Jon Warrenchuk, Ocean Scientist with Oceana. ""Today's decision protects the wildlife and important seafloor habitats of the northern Bering Sea from future damage from trawling.""
The Council also had the opportunity protect undersea canyons and skate nurseries, many of which have never been explored or documented, through their Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPC) process, but pushed that back to a later date.
The Bering Sea is home to 26 species of marine mammals, including the critically endangered northern right whale; millions of seabirds hailing from all seven continents; more than 450 species of fish; and some of the world's largest submarine canyons. It also provides more than half of the seafood harvested in United States waters. Much is still not know about the effects of bottom trawling on this incredibly vibrant area of the world, and the fishing industry is aggressively expanding each year.
The Council's decision today comes almost two years after they voted to protect the exquisite coral gardens of the Aleutian Islands. Protection for the Bering Sea was identified at that time as the next step for protecting essential habitat, and today's decision spreads that blanket of protection for marine life over more of this vibrant and productive part of the world."	<urn:uuid:de0d9727-faa6-48f1-87b2-c6abf040e06b>	0.0
cancer research data storage safety issues	"Joyce A. O’Shaughnessy, cochair of breast cancer research and chair of breast cancer prevention research at Baylor-Sammons Cancer Center of Texas Oncology in Dallas, said during a presentation of the data. “These results confirm that (Trodelvy) should be considered as a new standard of care in this patient population.”
For patients with previously treated TNBC, standard treatment has comprised single-agent chemotherapy; however, this approach has been linked with responses rates of under 20% and a short progression-free survival ranging from just 2 to 3 months.
In April 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Trodelvy a full approval to treat patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who have received two or more prior systemic therapies, at least one of which was for metastatic disease. The regulatory decision was based on earlier data from the ASCENT trial, which showed that the agent significantly improved survival over physician’s choice of single-agent chemotherapy in patients with metastatic TNBC who were receiving treatment in the second- or later-line setting.
In the analysis of the data, which was presented during the ASCO Annual Meeting, investigators evaluated the safety and efficacy of Trodelvy versus each chemotherapy agent to determine how each drug performed individually.
Of the 529 patients enrolled to the phase 3 study, 235 patients in the study drug group were negative from brain metastases, as were 233 patients in the chemotherapy group. In those who did not receive study drug, eribulin was noted to be the most frequently selected agent (126 patients), followed by vinorelbine (47 patients), capecitabine (31 patients), and gemcitabine (29 patients).
At the time of data cutoff, 15 patients remained on treatment with Trodelvy compared to 0 in the chemotherapy group. The most frequently reported reasons for study discontinuation included disease progression and withdrawn consent.
Additional data showed that of those who responded to treatment with study drug, the complete response rate was 4% and the partial response rate was 31%.
Regarding safety, pivotal treatment-related side effects that were serious or severe experienced with the Trodelvy compared to eribulin included neutropenia (51% vs. 31%), leukopenia (10% vs. 5%), diarrhea (10% vs. 0%), anemia (8% vs. 2%), febrile neutropenia (6% vs."	<urn:uuid:d7da1925-085a-471f-9444-574d0986b1f4>	0.0
experiential learning versus behavioral theory learning how they teach students	"How old should my child be to begin piano lessons?
Children as young as five can begin learning the piano and basic music theory.
Our Lilyvale piano tutors are experienced in teaching young children who are complete beginners, and have all the patience and personality needed to engage your child and give them best start in their piano journey.
What styles of piano music do you teach?
Our Lilyvale piano teachers are qualified to teach all styles of music, whether you’re interested in popular, contemporary, classical, jazz, musical theatre or even Nintendocore (yes, this is an actual genre). However, we encourage our students to explore all genres to show them just how interesting the piano can be.
Why enrol my child in 1 on 1? Why not Lilyvale group piano lessons?
Group piano tutoring are a great way for your child to socialise, but that’s about where the perks end. 1 on 1 piano classes ensure that your child won’t get left behind, and can learn at their own pace.
In personal experience, piano students learning in 1 on 1 lessons progress a lot faster than students learning in group lessons.
Am I too old to start learning to play piano?
NO! There is no set age to begin learning a musical instrument, and the best time to start is right this moment – ie Now!
Learn to play your favourite songs, learn how to read music, learn theory, or just about anything you’d like to know about the piano.
Playing the piano is a fun and great way to exercise your creative abilities so don’t just dream about it, start learning.
What are your Lilyvale piano teachers qualifications?
Only the best Lilyvale piano teachers work with our students.
Our piano teachers:
- highly experienced in teaching all ages and skill levels
- are experienced in playing the piano themselves
- have undergone a NSW Government certified “Working with children” police check
- are very friendly and patient to make students comfortable with learning at their own pace.
Typically students take piano courses once a week.
But if you just give me a minute of your time, I’ll tell you why that’s often not the best way to go.
I personally consider the best way to response to this enquiry is to look at the best of the best and see how often THEY took classes.
Some of the best pianists in the olden times likely had lessons on a daily basis."	<urn:uuid:d1747842-39c1-4ef9-ae9c-fa396da7d317>	0.0

violin bow string maintenance cleaning	"Taylor uses the traditional all-wood construction and the necks of these guitars have a reputation for superb action and playability.
The twelve-string is usually an acoustic though twelve-string electric guitars are available. Twelve-string guitars are not the same as double-neck guitars. Double-neck guitars are essentially two guitar necks bolted onto one body. Twelve-string guitars have the regular six strings and a second set of thinner strings with each string of the second set corresponding to the note of its regular string counterpart. The second set of strings are tuned an octave higher. The strings form pairs; so you still play the guitar in the same manner as a standard six-string.
Twelve-string guitars produce a brighter and more prominent tone and are harder to play than a standard six-string guitar. They are usually confined to niche roles, such as rhythm guitar. The additional strings require more pressure to press down and bending notes also requires an extra muscular effort. Twelve-string guitars are more expensive to buy than the standard acoustic or electric and may need more maintenance because of the strain the additional strings place on the neck.
An archtop is a hollow or semi-hollow acoustic or electric guitar which uses steel strings. The arched top creates a unique timbre and other elements taken from the design of the mandolin or violin also add to the distinctive tone of the archtop guitar. The body of the archtop guitar, whether hollow or semi-hollow, has a sound block in the middle and they also have violin f-holes cut into the table.
Archtop guitars may be acoustic or electric and can look very similar with the only distinguishing feature being an electromagnetic pickup. One problem with archtop hollow-bodied guitars is that when played through an amplifier they tend to generate feedback. The semi-hollow archtop was developed to make feedback less of an issue. Archtop guitars have been particularly popular in jazz music because their thicker strings add tone.
Some solid-body electric guitars have an arched top body shape but the name archtop is usually reserved for the hollow and semi-hollow guitar.
The steel guitar is unusual in that it is played horizontally, either across the players knees or on its own stand. There are two main varieties of the instrument, which are played using the metal slide, or 'steel' from which the guitar takes its name. The steel is held in the left hand, when used by a right-handed player."	<urn:uuid:32b3ab61-5f12-4a85-8272-8831f748ea67>	0.0
How did generational knowledge transfer work in religious versus secular institutions?	"Equal Protection Project Files Opposition to Biden Education Dept. Rule Rescinding Trump-Pence Campus Religious Protections
Proposal would remove Trump-Pence era regulation mandating that higher education treat campus religious groups and secular groups equally
As we have previously reported, in September 2020 the Trump-Pence administration implemented the “Free Inquiry Rule” for higher education: DeVos Makes Federal Grant Money Contingent Upon Compliance With First Amendment
This rule, which is still in effect, is designed to “ensure that public institutions of higher education uphold fundamental rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and that private institutions of higher education adhere to their own policies regarding freedom of speech, including academic freedom:”
“This administration is committed to protecting the First Amendment rights of students, teachers, and faith-based institutions. Students should not be forced to choose between their faith and their education, and an institution controlled by a religious organization should not have to sacrifice its religious beliefs to participate in Department grants and programs,” said Secretary DeVos. “These regulations hold public institutions accountable for protecting the First Amendment rights of students and student organizations, and they require private colleges and universities that promise their students and faculty free expression, free inquiry, and diversity of thought to live up to those ideals.”
Higher Ed Dive describes the gist of the Free Inquiry Rule:
Former President Donald Trump took an interest in protecting free speech and religious freedoms on college campuses.
In 2019, Trump signed an executive order that tied federal research dollars to colleges protecting First Amendment rights or their own free inquiry policies, depending on whether they were public or private institutions, respectively.
The free inquiry rule the administration issued in 2020 is a follow-up to that executive order.
The regulation forbids public colleges from denying religious student groups the same rights — such as funding — as other clubs because of beliefs, practices or policies informed by their faith."	<urn:uuid:d803ae85-f629-4d7c-b793-72947fedf540>	0.0

What tricks do attackers use and how can networks defend against them?	"|App Name||Last Shelter: Survival|
|Required Device||Android 4.1 and up|
|Available On||Play Store|
|Last Updated||September 3, 2021|
Last Shelter: Survival is a strategy game offered by Long Tech Network Limited. It has more than ten million downloads on the play store. It’s a good choice if you are looking for a post-apocalyptic world game in which strategy is everything to survive.
Overview of Last Shelter: Survival
A deadly virus has spread throughout the world and the people who come in its contact are turning into zombies. It’s not a world where you can live peacefully. In order to survive, you have to make a powerful team and fully defend the base. You play as a commander who is attacked by zombies and reaches a base. Rick, your partner, opens the base and a survivor offers you to stay in that base if you defend the base. From here on out, your journey begins.
In this game, you have to defend your base from the zombies no matter what. Build a fence around the base and set up barracks, hospitals, oil well, power plants, farms, and everything to keep everyone alive. Upgrade the base to unlock new buildings and defense. You can build a shooting range, fighter camp to train shooters and fighters. Upgrading these buildings will unlock new troops. Each troop has different stats and ways of attacking the zombies. Kill the zombies, extend your territory and build more buildings to run your shelter well and safely.
To fight against the zombies, you need all kinds of troops from melee attackers to ranged shooters. You also need vehicles like trucks with weapons, tanks, etc. Build the shooting range where you can train many types of shooters, each with different stats. You can train fighters in the fight camp. Fighters attack the zombies from close range.
Buildings are an important factor. To survive in this world full of zombies, building defense is necessary to stop the zombies from attacking your base. You also need food to live, power plants for electricity, oil well for fuel, and water filters. These are just basic needs. No one knows how many zombies can attack your base. So advanced defense, troops to fight them, heroes, headquarters are required. There are all kinds of builds that you need to build in order to survive and defend yourself.
There are 63 heroes you can use."	<urn:uuid:de4f0fe4-97ff-4f8d-95d2-152e221e062c>	0.0
behavioral manifestations neurological basis anxiety disorders	"A behavioral and neurological evaluation of dry cleaners exposed to perchloroethylene.
Tuttle-TC; Wood-GD; Grether-CB; Johnson-BL; Xintaras-C
Cincinnati, OH: U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, DHEW (NIOSH) Publication No. 77-214, 1977 Jun; :1-88
The possible adverse effects of perchloroethylene (127184) on workers' neurologic status and behavioral performance were examined in 27 volunteers who worked in various dry cleaning jobs. Of this number, 18 were exposed daily by nature of their job to various levels of the compound and had a mean 8 hour time weighted average (TWA) exposure of 18ppm over the 5 days of testing. The 9 males within the exposed group, however, had a mean TWA exposure of 32ppm. Neurological examinations showed a significant difference between neurological ratings for exposed workers versus controls. However, multiple regression analyses suggest the neurological deficits to be related to workers' prior exposure to Stoddard's-Solvent (8052413), not perchloroethylene. The effects of acute perchloroethylene exposure were examined by giving workers behavioral performance tests both prior to work and following work over a 5 day period. Although significant differences in performance of some perception and psychomotor tests were found, multiple regression analysis showed the post shift performance decrements to be significantly correlated with a measure of fatigue, not with perchloroethylene exposure that occurred during the workshift. In summary, no evidence was found of deleterious effects of perchloroethylene on workers' neurologic health or behavioral performance. However, findings strongly suggest the involvement of Stoddard's Solvent as a factor accounting for an increased incidence of abnormally large neurologic scores. (Contract No. 099-73-0035)

genetic treatment success rate retinal cells vs amoeba reproduction	"Cancer is a disease that is spreading worldwide and causing deaths. It is the second major cause of deaths in the world including the developed countries like USA and UK. The mortality rate is increasing because we are increasing its risk factors in our environment.
There are many types of treatments. It depends upon the type of cancer, the age of the patient, weight, health status and causative agent of cancer. Some patients require an only single type of treatment and it is good for them. However, there is a requirement of a combination of treatments for. It seems difficult to decide about the type of treatment and patients get confused. You should discuss with your doctor for your help. Early diagnoses of cancer can save a life at an early stage with simple treatment. The rate of spreading of the malignant tumor may also decide the type of cancer.
Some important and famous treatments are:
- Hormonal therapy
Surgery is an operation in which a surgeon removes the tumor from the body. It is applicable at an early stage of cancer when the tumor is not spreading to other organs and confined to one region. Surgery may remove only the effected part or the whole organ. For example in breast cancer treatment, there is the removal or whole breast or half breast with the affected area.
Radiations are highly energetic beams that release from radioactive material. They have the ability to destroy the defective cells. High dose of rays can kill the cancerous cells. Ionizing radiations are used to shrink cancerous cells. Rays only affect the damaged area. They target the genetic material of these cells and destroy it making these cells difficult to divide or survive. It can also affect the normal cells of the body. However, normal cells can recover soon and start their normal function. The purpose of radiation therapy is to destroy as many cancerous cells as possible.it is the good treatment for adults, but can cause long-term side effects in children. It causes blindness and hearing loss in children. Radiotherapy can be used for many types of cancer like brain cancer, breast, larynx, lung, liver, stomach, pancreas, skin, prostate, and uterus.
This type of treatment uses chemical drugs for the recovery of a patient from cancer. It uses cytotoxic drugs to destroy damaged cells. It targets the DNA of cancer cells and destroys their chromosomes. These drugs target all cancer cells and effect some normal cells."	<urn:uuid:89cb5ec6-a1be-41d1-a767-ed3fb315dc68>	0.0

A hydrogen bond is the electromagnetic attraction created between a partially positively charged hydrogen atom attached to a highly electronegative atom and another nearby electronegative atom. A hydrogen bond is a type of dipole-dipole interaction; it is not a true chemical bond. These attractions can occur between molecules (intermolecularly) or within different parts of a single molecule (intramolecularly).
A hydrogen atom attached to a relatively electronegative atom is a hydrogen bond donor. This electronegative atom is usually fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen. The electronegative atom attracts the electron cloud from around the hydrogen nucleus and, by decentralizing the cloud, leaves the hydrogen atom with a positive partial charge. Because of the small size of hydrogen relative to other atoms and molecules, the resulting charge, though only partial, is stronger. In the molecule ethanol, there is one hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen atom, which is very electronegative. This hydrogen atom is a hydrogen bond donor.
Hydrogen Bond Acceptor
A hydrogen bond results when this strong partial positive charge attracts a lone pair of electrons on another atom, which becomes the hydrogen bond acceptor. An electronegative atom such as fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen is a hydrogen bond acceptor, regardless of whether it is bonded to a hydrogen atom or not. Greater electronegativity of the hydrogen bond acceptor will create a stronger hydrogen bond. The diethyl ether molecule contains an oxygen atom that is not bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a hydrogen bond acceptor.
A hydrogen attached to carbon can also participate in hydrogen bonding when the carbon atom is bound to electronegative atoms, as is the case in chloroform (CHCl3). As in a molecule where a hydrogen is attached to nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine, the electronegative atom attracts the electron cloud from around the hydrogen nucleus and, by decentralizing the cloud, leaves the hydrogen atom with a positive partial charge."	<urn:uuid:53ae4434-3270-4012-afa4-5437fc19b788>	0.0
rainwater tank install location considerations water harvest	"Klik hier om dit artikel in het Nederlands te lezen.
During my most recent trip to Uganda I have spent more than three wonderful, but also very impressive weeks at the location of HWMCO-Uganda; I was part of the daily activities organized for the children, that way continuously interacting with them and learning more and more about them and their world. Usually, the children come to take part in activities on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, when they are free from school, but during the period I spent with them they were having a school holiday of several weeks; always during school holidays they come to the location both on weekdays and during the weekends.
Every day, the children would show up in the morning, first of all officially greeting everyone of the team with a humble, “good morning”. The day would then start with the children contributing their part in maintaining the location; some were assisting in cleaning the room where many activities take place, others started watering plants and trees, sweeping the location, or weeding the garden. Whenever they noticed me around while they were carrying out their tasks, a proud smile would appear on their faces.
After the children had then washed their hands and feet with fresh water taken from the rainwater tank, they would be divided into several groups for activities to get started. A group of children would collect their brass band instruments, for them to exercise notes and melodies; another group, all of them girls, started exercising juggling; some of the older girls took part in knitting and crochet activities; others enjoyed themselves with activities such as jumping rope or playing soccer. Throughout the day the groups would change and also small groups of children would be taken apart for educational purposes. Whenever they got thirsty they could go into the activity room where boiled water from the rainwater tank was available for them to drink.
For myself, I would be found playing educational games with groups of children, puzzling with them or teaching them in counting. Also, I was involved with the knitting and crochet activities. Knitting is hardly known in Uganda, it had shortly been introduced to the girls a few months earlier, but they had not been able to do it on themselves. Crochet is much better known, there I could only add to their skills. I also introduced French knitting to them.
Being very aware of the importance of it for just every child, I made sure to give them some personal attention in everything I did. On some Sundays I surprised the children with pancakes."	<urn:uuid:4641f37a-9e36-4df6-8423-ee218b895043>	0.0
chemical enzyme requirements digestion process linked unlinked sugar molecules	"Plants have two main immune responses—the hypersensitive response, in which infected cells seal themselves off and undergo programmed cell death, and systemic acquired resistance, where infected cells release signals warning the rest of the plant of a pathogen's presence. Chloroplasts stimulate both responses by purposely damaging their photosynthetic system, producing reactive oxygen species. High levels of reactive oxygen species will cause the hypersensitive response. The reactive oxygen species also directly kill any pathogens within the cell. Lower levels of reactive oxygen species initiate systemic acquired resistance, triggering defense-molecule production in the rest of the plant.
In some plants, chloroplasts are known to move closer to the infection site and the nucleus during an infection.
Chloroplasts can serve as cellular sensors. After detecting stress in a cell, which might be due to a pathogen, chloroplasts begin producing molecules like salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which can serve as defense-signals. As cellular signals, reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules, so they probably don't leave the chloroplast, but instead pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule. All these molecules initiate retrograde signaling—signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus.
In addition to defense signaling, chloroplasts, with the help of the peroxisomes, help synthesize an important defense molecule, jasmonate. Chloroplasts synthesize all the fatty acids in a plant cell—linoleic acid, a fatty acid, is a precursor to jasmonate.
One of the main functions of the chloroplast is its role in photosynthesis, the process by which light is transformed into chemical energy, to subsequently produce food in the form of sugars. Water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are used in photosynthesis, and sugar and oxygen (O2) is made, using light energy. Photosynthesis is divided into two stages—the light reactions, where water is split to produce oxygen, and the dark reactions, or Calvin cycle, which builds sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. The two phases are linked by the energy carriers adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+).
ATP is the phosphorylated version of adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which stores energy in a cell and powers most cellular activities."	<urn:uuid:087d4933-d060-406b-ac12-4e497768606f>	0.0
comparison permanent temporary facial injectables	"Liposuction Price Comparison
In this article you will read about:
- What is Liposuction?
- Who can Have Liposuction?
- What are the Risks of Liposuction?
- How Much Liposuction Costs?
Liposuction isn't a solution for weight-loss or a weight-loss alternative. If you are overweight, it is more probable to lose weight with a balanced diet and exercise or through bariatric procedures than you would with liposuction.
You can be suitable for liposuction if you have extra body fat in particular spots but otherwise, your body weight is stable. Liposuction can also be used in some cases for breast reduction or gynecomastia treatment.
Liposuction doesn't help with cellulite dimpling or other skin texture irregularities and it will not remove stretch marks.
Am I a Good Candidate for Liposuction?
To be suitable for liposuction, you have to be healthy, without conditions that could be risky for the surgery — such as coronary artery disease, restricted blood flow, diabetes, or a weak immune system. Also, you must at least:
- Be within 30% of your goal weight
- Have elastic and firm skin
- Not smoke
What are the Risks of Liposuction?
As with any plastic surgery, liposuction has major risks, such as bleeding and a bad reaction to anesthesia.
Possible complications of liposuction can be:
- Uneven Contour. Your skin may end up bumpy or wavy because of irregular fat removal, bad skin elasticity, and unusual healing. These changes may be permanent.
- Damage under the skin from the thin tube (cannula) that's used during liposuction may leave permanent spots on the skin.
- Accumulation of fluids. Temporary ""bags"" of fluid (seromas) may appear under the skin. This fluid can be drained with a needle.
- Numbness. You may be left with a temporary or permanent feeling of numbness in the affected area. Temporary nerve irritation can also be a complication.
- Infection. Skin infections are not as common but still possible. Aggravated skin infection can be life-threatening.
- Internal puncture. This happens when the tube/cannula penetrates too deeply and may puncture an internal organ. You may need emergency surgical intervention.
- Fat embolism."	<urn:uuid:ea93931b-ad22-4386-aa5c-23af82ec32b8>	0.0

what number of people around world require special accommodations for disabilities	"ADA Compliance – Are You at risk?
Are you aware of the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)? Signed into law on July 26 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act is a wide-ranging legislation intended to make American Society more accessible to people with disabilities.
What does ADA mean to you? As the operator of a business, you need to know that ADA regulations stipulate any place of business, regardless of size or number of employees, both public and private, must provide equal access and “reasonable accommodations” for both the general and disabled public. Basically if the potential exists for a customer to ever visit your facility, you need to be in compliance.
The act has no grandfather clauses, it stipulates, that in existing structures, barriers to entry or services must be removed if “technically feasible.” Cost is not a factor in determining whether an action would be technically feasible.
ADA is civil rights law, and provides for fines and/or private lawsuit or by the Department of Justice. If any private party or group feels you have discriminated against them by denying access, the government will help them sue you.
Security and door hardware manufacturers provide a variety of products designed to help you comply. The advent of the lever lockset is almost totally due to ADA, other products include, power assisted or automatic door operators, keyless entry systems, and egress systems that require no physical action to exit. These products and systems make it possible to bring almost any entry into compliance Our security professionals are experienced in the selection and installation of this specialized hardware. We understand the complexities of the ADA regulations, as they relate to hardware. Call us for for a no-obligation audit of your facility to determine your needs for ADA compliance.

Are solar pumps good for small farms?	"The city has been a leader in sustainable practices, including powering many council facilities with solar, building the 5 MW Summerhill Solar Farm for its own supply and, in January 2020, it became the first NSW council to be powered by 100% renewable-sourced electricity.
Construction of the new BESS is expected to take between six and nine months and will create around 20 jobs during that period, as well as opportunities for local subcontractors in civil works, electrical installation, landscaping and so on.
Tesla provided the battery technology at Gannawarra and Cole says that for Steel River, Edify and Precinct Capital are in discussion with “a number of equipment providers.” The decision has not yet been made whether to go with a turnkey solution from one provider or to take on development themselves, combining technologies from different OEMs.
Energy storage is not a stationary proposition
Edify Energy operates one of the largest portfolios of solar farms in Australia, including Darlington Point, Whitsunday, Hamilton, Gannawarra, Daydream and Hayman solar farms, and Cole says the company has learned that what it originally viewed as passive assets must be viewed as dynamic participants in the NEM.
“They don’t operate like a conventional machine or a large spinning mass. We’re bidding those power plants into the market every five minutes.”
Batteries, he says, will also be operated dynamically, according to market needs and opportunities.
He likens the “generational” change of the Hunter region to that of Collinsville in Queensland, where Edify Energy operates four solar farms – those with “island” names in the list above. “That was a big coal mining town and the solar farms have been very well received up there – we’ve had every school student – primary and secondary – visit those solar farms. It’s all part of the transition,” he says.

how many minutes minimum per day breathing exercises combined with relaxation observation	"Your no-fail beginning video is awesome. When I do the accompany roll along w/ the 2 and 3 chord medleys my right hand tends to cramp or become tired. Is this normal? What warm up exercises can you recommend and for how long should I do them for? I currently practice for a half an hour a day and would like to work up to at least two half hour practices per day.
I’m very glad to hear the video is helping. The cramping and tiring is pretty normal at first, but you should check whether your hand is positioned uncomfortably, or is tense in any way. That could be affecting it. Experiment a little to see if it works better with a bit of relaxation, or slightly different hand position. Otherwise, it’s just a matter of the muscles that control the fingers getting stronger, which comes naturally with time. I don’t know what to suggest as warmup exercises, as the rolls you’re doing are what some people do as a warmup. Try doing them a little more slowly at first, without the video running. I’d say just a few minutes of that, and then try playing with the tape. It should get easier in time.

president lincoln stance on black soldiers emancipation proclamation effects missouri kentucky status	"Confederate Speaker Portraits To Be Removed From The U.S. Capitol On Juneteenth
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says the portraits of four former House speakers who served in the Confederacy will be removed from display in the Capitol this Friday in observance of Juneteenth.
Pelosi directed the clerk of the House of Representatives to remove the portraits on June 19 to mark the day in 1865 when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news that President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation. That day came more than two years after Lincoln signed the order freeing enslaved people — a day now observed as Juneteenth.
""As I have said before, the halls of Congress are the very heart of our democracy,"" Pelosi wrote in the letter requesting the removal. ""There is no room in the hallowed halls of Congress or in any place of honor for memorializing men who embody the violent bigotry and grotesque racism of the Confederacy.""
The four House speakers whose portraits will be removed are Robert Hunter of Virginia, who was the speaker of the House from 1839 to 1841; Howell Cobb of Georgia, who served as speaker from 1849 to 1851; James Orr of South Carolina, who served as speaker from 1857 to 1859; and Charles Crisp of Georgia, who served as speaker from 1891 to 1895.
Shortly after Pelosi announced the removal of the portraits, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., attempted to pass a resolution removing Confederate statues from the Capitol. He asked for unanimous consent to approve the measure and was blocked by Senate Rules Committee Chairman Roy Blunt, R-Mo.
Booker noted that 12 Confederate statues were placed in the National Statuary Hall between 1901 and 1931. Booker noted it was a period of violence, suppression and terror for black Americans. He added that the Civil War represents four years in the country's history and that putting statues of Confederates in the Capitol was part of an effort to further intimidate and suppress black Americans.
""We cannot separate the Confederate statues from this history and legacy of white supremacy,"" Booker said. ""They are painful, insulting, difficult injury being compounded to so many American citizens."""	<urn:uuid:a9c0dca8-18fc-486a-afc4-3a1865749b6b>	0.0

custom drug manufacturing future outlook advantages	"consumers have recently downshifted to an all-time low (orange line). The price for cutting rates late in the cycle is usually that it could risk an overshoot of inflation. However, right now a bit more inflation would actually be a welcome development. In our view, that makes the Fed’s calculus skew in favour of a cut should risks to the outlook re-intensify.
Source: Thomson Reuters Datastream, Russell Investments data as of October 29th, 2019.
- Second, the balance of risks to the global business cycle still skew modestly to the downside in our view. Manufacturing activity has downshifted to recessionary levels in the United States and across most of the developed markets. And while some high frequency manufacturing data for September and October points to a tentative stabilisation at weak levels, the weakness itself will be a concern for policymakers. Additionally, the services sector and U.S. labour market (which typically lags manufacturing by a month or more) still show signs of potentially slowing further. Healthy employment growth and robust wage gains have supported the U.S. consumer. If the labour market slows and endangers the expansion, further rate cuts could be warranted.
Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Russell Investments data as of October 30th, 2019. The business survey employment tracker is a custom composite indicator based on underlying data from Markit, the Institute for Supply Management, and the Federal Reserve System. Preliminary data for October is shown.
The bottom line
Considering these risks to the outlook, current market pricing on the near-term path for interest rates (i.e., one more rate cut through the end of 2020) looks broadly appropriate to us, even though our baseline is for the Fed to remain on hold. With the expansion entering its eleventh year, we still think government bonds have an important diversifying role to play in multi-asset portfolios.
On the upside, further evidence of progress toward a phase 1 deal between the U.S. and China, and importantly, an eventual removal of the tariffs that have been put in place, would be key to lifting the cloud of uncertainty hanging over the corporate sector and re-accelerating global fundamentals and risk markets in the year ahead."	<urn:uuid:62774e80-6fdc-4db4-b417-a2bf229cadb9>	0.0

I'm fascinated by exotic fish breeding behaviors. What are the typical spawning patterns and egg development processes across different tropical fish species?	The lake chub inhabits waterways throughout Canada and northern areas of the United States. Learn about biodiversity theory, natural history, and conservation issues. The marked colour variations of rainbow trout or northern pike have erroneously convinced some anglers that there are different species of these fishes in different localities. The native species confined to fresh water (about 180) occur in drainages of the Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic oceans, Hudson Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Canada is a huge country absolutely filled with beautiful and flowing rivers and streams and crisp lakes, perfect for fishing for many species of fish. There tends to be more variation in colour among populations of the same species of northern freshwater fishes than among tropical fishes. (36.5 in.) Differences in species numbers across Canada can be explained by glacial events.

I work with youth programs and want to understand the connection between organized group activities and professional counseling - how does the structure of the Bonkers game with its medics and stations relate to the various settings where school psychologists work?	"When a foreign worker is sent to work in Canada in exchange for a Canadian who goes to work abroad for the foreign worker’s employer, the foreign worker will be exempt from the LMIA requirement. This exchange can takes place as part of an organized program. Examples of these organized programs include:
- Full time or part-time professional or semi-professional sports leagues: In these leagues, athletes, coaches and trainers from Canada will work for US-based teams and US athletes, coaches and trainers will work for Canadian-based teams.
- The Canada World Youth Program: In this program, young people from foreign countries briefly live and work in Canada as volunteers.
- Canadian Federal Government Cultural Exchange Accords: Canada has cultural accords that allow for the exchange of workers with: Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico France and China.
- Commercial Airline Reciprocal Accords: In these accords, a Canadian airline sends one or more Canadian employees to work for a foreign airline in exchange for one or more of the foreign airline’s workers coming to work for the Canadian airline.
- The International Experience Canada Program: Under this program, foreign individuals aged 18 to 35 work in Canada for a short period in exchange for young Canadians of the same age being given the chance to travel and work in various foreign countries.
- Academic Exchange Programs: In these programs, Canadian guest lecturers, professors and pre-school, elementary school and high school teachers work in foreign countries in exchange for similar educators coming to work in Canada.
- It important to note that reciprocal employment does not have to occur in the context of an official program. Canadian employers may make their own exchange accords with foreign employers as they so choose. However, in order for a worker to be exempt from the LMIA requirement in these cases, it must be possible to prove the existence of a reciprocal accord. Reciprocal accords can be proven by the existence of:
- An exchange accord between the Canadian and foreign employers
- A letter from the receiving Canadian employer
- A contract, if it provides proof of the exchange program
- Validproof of a reciprocal program will allow CIC officers to issue a work permit without an LMIA. The levels of reciprocity with regards to number of exchanged workers, job length or job levels do not need to be exactly equal. The numbers, however, should be somewhat the same.
Certain workers are exempt from the LMIA requirement under the discretion of the Canadian Minister of Citizenship and Immigration."	<urn:uuid:0a59784f-61de-487a-aafd-0ba606e8e746>	0.0
What groups support women at universities?	"WASHINGTON (AP) — Millions of Americans have been drinking tap water contaminated with chemical byproducts from chlorine that are far more than what studies suggest may be safe for pregnant women, two environmental groups say in a new study.Chlorine is commonly used to disinfect drinking water. When it is added to water that contains organic matter such as runoff from farms or lawns, however, it can form compounds such as chloroform that can cause illness.
The study released Tuesday by the Environmental Working Group and Public Interest Research Groups identified areas that may have increased health risks including miscarriage, neural tube defects and reduced fetal growth from women drinking chlorination byproducts.
“By failing to clean up rivers and reservoirs that provide drinking water for hundreds of millions of Americans, EPA and the Congress have forced water utilities to chlorinate water that is contaminated with animal waste, sewage, fertilizer, algae and sediment”
the report says.
Jane Houlihan, EWG’s research director, said the report also shows how that cleanup failure has “a direct impact on human health.” Pregnant women need to drink plenty of water, she said, but they can reduce their exposure to potential risks through simple measures such as home filters and purchasing bottled water.
One expert on environmental health cautioned that the link between the byproducts and pregnancy risks is suggestive, not conclusive.
Still, if the pregnancy studies are proved, millions could be at risk, said Dr. Robert Morris, an environmental epidemiologist at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.
“That body of literature isn’t necessarily conclusive but people ought to be aware of it,”
“It’s pretty clear that some of these compounds can be pretty bad actors. The fact that these levels are as high as they are is certainly something to be concerned about.”
The environmental groups combed water quality records in 29 states and the District of Columbia and matched them with various research into birth defects and miscarriages conducted by state and federal agencies and universities.
The groups said the places statistically most at risk due to chlorination byproducts were those that are populous, lacked buffers from urban sprawl and were downstream from agricultural sites. But women in small towns generally face twice the risk from drinking high levels of the byproducts, Houlihan said.
Matching high rates doesn’t prove the environmental risk caused the health problems, however. Also, the results are limited because, among other reasons, such health records do not exist in some states."	<urn:uuid:d06063ba-1ba6-456e-a039-83ba3d893ee0>	0.0

Wild Primate Populations in Emerging Infectious Disease Research: The Missing Link?
Wild primate populations, an unexplored source of information regarding emerging infectious disease, may hold valuable clues to the origins and evolution of some important pathogens. Primates can act as reservoirs for human pathogens. As members of biologically diverse habitats, they serve as sentinels for surveillance of emerging pathogens and provide models for basic research on natural transmission dynamics. Since emerging infectious diseases also pose serious threats to endangered and threatened primate species, studies of these diseases in primate populations can benefit conservation efforts and may provide the missing link between laboratory studies and the well-recognized needs of early disease detection, identification, and surveillance.
Infectious diseases respect no species or geographic boundaries. For a parasite, closely related hosts offer new environments in which infection, maintenance, replication, and transmission remain possible. The anthropoid primates (which include humans) and to a lesser degree simian primates share broadly similar physiologic and genetic characteristics and thus susceptibility to many viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths, and ectoparasites (1) that have the potential to cross primate-species boundaries (2).
Similarities in pathogen susceptibility have made nonhuman primates ideal laboratory models. During the 20th century, laboratory research on captive primates has elucidated the life cycle and pathogenesis of many infectious agents and facilitated drug and vaccine development. Nevertheless, the ecology of infectious agents found in wild populations of primates has only recently been addressed. Just as captive primates have proved invaluable for research at the level of the organism, wild populations can provide the opportunity to study infectious disease phenomena at the population and ecosystem levels. Research at these levels addresses such pressing questions as the origin(s) of pathogens, determinants of pathogen emergence, and factors influencing maintenance of pathogens in animal reservoirs.
During the past two decades unknown human diseases, including AIDS, Ebola fever, hantavirus infection, and dengue hemorrhagic fever, have emerged from enzootic foci. The emergence of these and other diseases has been linked to the interface of tropical forest communities with high levels of biodiversity and agricultural communities with relative genetic homogeneity and high population densities of humans, domestic animals, and crops. This interface poses a high risk for the emergence of novel disease (3-5)."	<urn:uuid:73efbcd8-2283-4282-bbad-f090042d1d4c>	0.0
four ways answering questions buddhism what are they	"It all starts with reviewing what you are currently doing (with the goal of having more space for proactive support).
The name of the game is prevention and early detection.
Ideally you want to look for ways to take preventive measures to eliminate problems or, at worst, detect problems before they get too big. This is how you greatly reduce firefighting support.
This can be done in multiple ways…
Always track and review support tasks that are arising!
With both repetitive and time consuming tasks, take the extra time to root out the cause.
Then ask how you can systemise or automate your process so that they don’t even occur. Often it’s when small, easy tasks are neglected that problems surface.
Each time a technical error arises, is it because you failed to do routine maintenance or take preventive measures?
Is it possible to catch problems in their earliest stages?
In handling a reactive tech task, do you simply fix it and move on, or do take the extra step of creating alerts and notifications within your monitoring tools?
Monitoring and analysis tools are your best friend when it comes to reducing reactive support and optimising maintenance. Automating tasks and using external services can also really help her as well (which we’ll cover below).
As far as systems, sometimes you absolutely need a senior developer to tackle a problem. But if the same problem repeatedly occurs, it makes sense to spend extra time documenting how to solve it. Eventually that document can be handed off to a junior developer, freeing up time for more important projects for your senior dev team.
You should also track and document your client questions, problems and inquiries. If you find that you are constantly answering the same questions, then create ways for the client to get the answer without your additional input.
This could be done by adding a frequently asked questions section on your site. Instead of answering the same thing over and over, you simply point clients directly to the answer.
Even better, if you are using support software such as SupportBee, Zendesk or Freshdesk, you may be able to create a knowledge base where questions can be asked and related answers are automatically fed to the client. This removes extra communication steps.
You can also use the information you collect to feed into design and development project cycles. For example, if you find that editing content causes a lot of problems for clients, you can change the way something is implemented in the CMS to make editing easier, thus requiring less support."	<urn:uuid:8246d8d3-1184-4b06-a768-91cf6493b4d9>	0.0
I research historical artifacts and space technology preservation. I'm wondering about the relationship between underwater preservation of 16th-century Spanish artifacts and the preservation of orbital space for future use. What preservation challenges exist in both contexts?	"Reference Guide for Native American Family Preservation Programs.
Since 2003, the Administration for Native Americans (ANA), within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), has been providing funds for projects aimed at improving child well-being by promoting healthy relationships and families in Native American communities. The goals of ANA's Family Preservation Initiative are: to increase the percentage of Native American children raised in healthy family environments; to increase public awareness among Native Americans about the value of healthy relationships, marriages, and responsible fatherhood; to ensure that family preservation services are culturally appropriate; to encourage absentee parents to be more involved in their children's lives; and to increase the percentage of Native American homes that are free from domestic violence and child abuse.
Family Preservation program providers know that the families they serve face significant challenges that stem from a unique set of circumstances. Over the past hundreds of years, disease, warfare, broken land treaties, and forced relocation have left many Native American communities impoverished and dependent on government programs for survival. Government assimilation policies that restricted religious and cultural practices, the speaking of Native languages, and removed Native American children from their families to attend boarding schools have had a devastating impact on Native Americans sense of self-efficacy-- the effects of which are still apparent today. This ""historical trauma"" is evidenced by low self-esteem, cultural shame, domestic violence, alcoholism, drug addiction and internalized oppression. These factors have an inescapable impact on family and marital functioning.
This Reference Guide is designed to assist Family Preservation program providers. It offers resources, strategies, and lessons learned on the predominant topics on which Family Preservation programs focus: 1) implementing family strengthening/relationship education programs; 2) delivering relationship education programming to married and unmarried adults as well as youth; 3) providing financial education to couples; 4) addressing challenges to family stability such as substance abuse, domestic violence, and gambling; and 5) offering parenting education, including guidance for fathers and grandparents.
In creating this document, the National Healthy Marriage Resource Center (NHMRC) gathered information from several Native American cultural experts as well as Family Preservation program providers. The Reference Guide includes resources in categories specific to serving Native American populations, as well as more generalized resources that a relationship skills instructor serving any population could find useful. It was created to serve as a repository of ideas, strategies, and techniques that Family Preservation program providers can adapt to fit their own community's needs.

What solutions exist for controlling excessive input signals?	"The output of the XOR gate 400 feeds an input of the XOR gate 402. The other input of the XOR gate 402 is coupled to a logic high signal. The output of the XOR gate 402 will be a negative going pulse each time the sync signal is activated no matter what the normal state of the sync signal is.
The outputs of the sync polarizer 362 are coupled to a horizontal and vertical sync input of an onscreen processor 364. The onscreen processor produces red, green and blue video signals that display one or more alphanumeric characters that are programmed in its internal video ROM memory. To dictate which characters are placed on the video screen, the CPU 80 generates serial I2 C interface signals on a pair of leads 363 and 365. These signals are applied to the onscreen processor 364 which causes the processor to retrieve from an internal video RAM characters that are to be displayed on the video screen. The onscreen processor 364 provides two signals HBFK and HTONE that are supplied to an overlay control logic circuit 366. Also supplied to the overlay control logic circuit are four signals from the CPU 80 of the user pod. These four signals are H Tone Enable, OSD Enable, System Video Enable and Transparent. The overlay control logic circuit 366 reads the value of these logic signals and either enables or disables a set of tri-state buffers 368, 370 and 372 on the tri-state buffers 352, 354 and 356. These tri-state buffers 368, 370 and 372 couple the outputs of the onscreen processor 364 to the leads that connect to the monitor's color inputs.
When the tri-state buffers 352, 354 and 356 are in their high impedance state, and the tri-state buffers 368, 370 and 372 are active, then the video screen will only display those signals produced by the onscreen processor. Conversely, if the tri-state buffers 368, 370 and 372 are in their high impedance state and the tri-state buffers 352, 354 and 356 are active then the monitor displays the video signals produced by the remote computer system. If both sets of tri-state buffers 368, 370, 372 and 352, 354 and 356 are both active, then the monitor will display the video signals produced by both the onscreen processor and the remote computer system."	<urn:uuid:1d36f6a4-a1c8-4859-94ef-c172338812c9>	0.0

what does number protons neutrons add up to give in an element	"KLOE-2 at Uppsala University
The KLOE-2 experiment studies the strong interaction at low energies. The strong interaction is what binds the protons and neutrons in a nucleus, but also what binds the protons and neutrons themselves, from quarks. It is the strong interaction which gives rise to most of the proton and neutron mass, and thus the mass of the visible universe. In fact, the mass of the quarks in the proton only accounts for ca 2% of the proton's mass! We want to better understand this interaction.
Protons and neutrons are hadrons (colorless particles made up of quarks). There are two well known types of hadrons: baryons, which are made up of three quarks (like the proton and neutron); and mesons, which are made up of quarks and anti-quarks. In KLOE-2, we focus on mesons, actually light mesons (with masses up to ca 1 GeV).
The KLOE-2 experiment, an upgrade of the KLOE experiment, is currently running at the DAFNE accelerator. In DAFNE, electrons and positrons accelerated to ca 510 MeV each collide. From the energy of the collision, for example φ mesons are produced. The φ mesons can then decay to other mesons, and the decay products are measured in the KLOE-2 detector. The KLOE-2 detector is actually a collection of detectors, ordered here by their proximity to the interaction region: an inner tracker (to detect charged particle tracks close to the interaction region), a crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (to detect photons at small angles), a scintillating tile calorimeter covering the interaction region quadrupoles (to improve detection of KL decay photons), a tagger for low energy electrons and positrons (for two photons physics), a drift chamber (to detect tracks of charged particles), surrounded by a lead/scintillating fiber electromagnetic calorimeter (to detect photons but also charged particles) and a tagger for high energy electrons and positrons, located after the first bending dipole (also for two photon physics). The drift chamber and surrounding electromagnetic calorimeter were already a part of KLOE, the other detectors are the upgrade."	<urn:uuid:c1222ee9-81cf-4740-bad3-52618aa666ea>	0.0

Blu-ray Image Quality – 20th Century Fox presents this Blu-ray disc in a stunning 1080p image presentation that looks totally top notch and is totally enhanced with the 2.40:1 aspect ratio and it is Dariusz Wolski, who previously shot ‘Prometheus,’ returned as the cinematographer on ‘ALIEN: COVENANT’ to give it that extra dimension of the awesome atmospheric dramatic effects. The black levels are natural throughout and very deep at times. The scenes that transpire at night in the wheat field look totally amazing. Since it’s a dark space opera so to speak I would go as far as to say the colour palette is pretty well spot on for how you would want it to look. There’s nothing exaggerated or overblown and when those explosions go off it blinds you like any good explosion in the dark of night should. As to the skin tones, they are all very pasty white and natural throughout because of being stuck in outer space for the very long period in travelling outer space and I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary and every one had a healthy glow to them unless they were ill, you know sick from the alien bug in them. But there is one very negative aspect of viewing this film, is that it should have been shot in 3D, especially being a follow up to the previous film."	<urn:uuid:a50d9725-8dff-4762-8e64-7ad4efb3b1d9>	0.0
Hi! I'm managing an old building that needs renovation. What are the best ways to preserve its historical features while making it more energy efficient?	"With so many options available, it can be overwhelming to know what features to look for. Fear not, as we’ve compiled a list of important factors to consider before making your purchase. It’s important to invest in a vacuum that not only suits your cleaning needs but also supports your efforts in managing asthma and COPD. Let’s explore some key features you should keep in mind.
When considering a smart vacuum cleaner for managing asthma and COPD, one important feature to look for is the presence of HEPA filters. HEPA, which stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air, filters are designed to capture even the smallest particles of dust, pet dander, pollen, and other allergens that can trigger asthma and COPD symptoms.
Here are some key benefits of HEPA filters:
|Benefits of HEPA Filters|
|Traps Small Particles: HEPA filters are designed to capture particles as small as 0.3 microns, which is smaller than many allergens and other irritants.|
|Improves Air Quality: By removing allergens and other irritants from the air, HEPA filters can improve overall air quality in your home.|
|Reduces Symptoms: By removing triggers for asthma and COPD symptoms, HEPA filters can help reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms.|
|Long-Lasting: HEPA filters are designed to last for a long time, often several years, before needing to be replaced.|
|Energy Efficient: Despite their high level of filtration, HEPA filters are energy efficient and don’t consume a lot of power.|
|Cost-Effective: While HEPA filters may cost a bit more than standard vacuum filters, they are highly effective and can save money on medical expenses by reducing asthma and COPD symptoms.|
There are many different types of HEPA filters, and some smart vacuum cleaners even have multiple filters to provide even greater filtration capabilities. When looking for a vacuum cleaner with HEPA filters, make sure to check the specifications to see what kind of filter is included and how often it needs to be replaced. It’s also important to note that while HEPA filters can be highly effective, they are not a cure-all solution and should be used in conjunction with other asthma and COPD management strategies.
Size and Weight
When it comes to selecting a smart vacuum cleaner for asthma and COPD care, one important consideration is size and weight."	<urn:uuid:fa83f89e-4638-4cac-a30a-a4ed933ef018>	0.0

As a reproductive biologist, what mechanisms does the Animal Reproductive Biology Group study?	"When someone says “pollinators,” the first thing that likely comes to mind is a bee, maybe a honey bee or a bumble bee, but typically not bats, birds, beetles or a plethora of other insects that are pollinators.
“Bees are a gateway bug. Once you realize that these honeybees are important that you realize there are over 20,000 species of other types of bees. And you realize that other kinds of bugs are important, and you realize that all these plants are blooming, all these trees are blooming, that you never realized before. It changes your relationship with the world.”
-Sam Comfort (“Queen Rearing Anarchy Style with Sam Comfort – 2019 Alternative Beekeepers Conference – YouTube,” 2019)
First off, pollinators are any animal that transports the grains of pollen (male reproductive part of a flower) to a female reproductive part allowing the formation of viable offspring otherwise known as seeds. Water, wind, and even humans are wonderful at doing this without actively being part of moving pollen too.Some plants do not need animal transport of pollen, like hemp Cannabis sativa, which is adapted for wind pollen dispersal.
Flowers attract animal pollinators by color and smell to encourage the pollinator to participate in moving pollen grains. There is an idea that certain colors and smells attract a certain group of pollinators. This idea is called pollinator syndrome. While not entirely scientific, they are a simplified rule of thumb for a researcher to work from.
One of the reasons understanding pollinators is so difficult is that they span many taxonomies (and of course taxonomies themselves can change). Dr. Jeff Ollerton (Ollerton, 2017) of the University of Northampton, United Kingdom does a wonderful job presenting a picture of what taxa are pollinators and gives an idea of the number of species in each group as well. This big-picture view gives us a good idea of which animals are pollinator, where to find them, and what plants they need for food and nesting sites.

Do light rays and sound waves follow similar refraction principles?	"(European House of Photography, 2006)
The technique of timing and anticipation is the most important technique for Jodice with this picture because of his desire to keep the focus on one fixed point. He had to wait for the right time to capture the subjects as well as figure out ahead of time which ons to wait for. Perhaps in his thinking he sought to search for people with similar colored tops. The extended version of the ""crossing"" pictures shows a woman with a dark blue tank top similar to the ""25"" man. And the man in white is far off to the end distanced from everyone else.

This image is of the galactic center, which is the center of the Milky Way. The photograph is taken using infrared light, which changes the appearance of dust particles so that they do not obscure the image. As Wright (2003) points out, the universe is filled with dust, which tends to block the light being emitted from light-giving objects like stars. The composition of most galactic dust includes carbon, silicon, and oxygen (Wright, 2003). The dust can grow in molecular clouds, and are created in the atmosphere of red-giant stars that are cooling off (Nemiroff & Bonnell, 2006).
Infrared allows the exposure of rays that are beyond what the naked eye can see. These rays are beyond or below the red part of the color spectrum, which is why the technology is called ""infrared."" Below infrared rays are microwave and radio waves. Although not visible to the human…… [Read More]
Applying Goffman to Modern Advertisements
Goffman and Gender Commercials
Goffman contends that the selection of commercial pictures in advertisements is intentional and serves a specific agenda that is not in service to consumers' well-being or natural interests. He argues this facet of culture is ripe for analysis with respect to topics such as sexuality, gender, power, the means of production, and social reality, among others. His strongest assertions concerns how analysis of the selection of commercial pictures reveals keen insights when comparing them to behavioral practices as experience in everyday interactions. Goffman grounds his hypotheses in concrete methodological practices, with primary aims to locate and define discovery, proof, and presentation."	<urn:uuid:e6efe5cd-944e-453d-9158-526b13835fac>	0.0

Understanding children's health after a sibling's death and what factors may affect it is important for treatment and clinical care. This study compared children's and their parents' perceptions of children's health and identified relationships of children's age, gender, race/ethnicity, anxiety, and depression and sibling's cause of death to these perceptions at 2 and 4 months after sibling death. 64 children and 48 parents rated the child's health ""now"" and ""now vs before"" the sibling's death in an ICU or ER or at home shortly after withdrawal of life-prolonging technology. Children completed the Child Depression Inventory and Spence Children's Anxiety Scale. Sibling cause of death was collected from hospital records. At 2 and 4 months, 45% to 54% of mothers' and 53% to 84% of fathers' ratings of their child's health ""now"" were higher than their children's ratings. Child health ratings were lower for: children with greater depression; fathers whose children reported greater anxiety; mothers whose child died of a chronic condition. Children's ratings of their health ""now vs before"" their sibling's death did not differ significantly from mothers' or fathers' ratings at 2 or 4 months. Black fathers were more likely to rate the child's health better ""now vs before"" the death; there were no significant differences by child gender and cause of death in child's health ""now vs before"" the death."	<urn:uuid:cdc652b7-6d2f-4af0-bb34-71ad93ccb477>	0.0

What can be done to modify mRNA?	"Moreover, immune responses mediated by SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected on the basis of intracellular IFNγ production by splenocytes of mRNA-RBD-immunized mice as evidenced in ICS assays (Fig. 2g, h). Therefore, mRNA-RBD can induce a substantial T cell response against SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigens aside from humoral immune responses.
It has been reported that the virus-binding but non-neutralizing antibodies induced by infection or vaccination may possibly elicit the ADE effect46,47,48,49,50. Thus, we also compared the differences in the proportions of neutralizing antibodies to binding antibodies between prime and boost immunization procedures. BALB/c mice (n = 5) were immunized with one (prime group) or two (boost group, 4-week internal) injections of mRNA-RBD at 15 μg or placebo via the i.m. route, and sera were collected at 8 weeks post initial injection for detection of RBD-specific and NAb titers. The results showed that in contrast to prime vaccination, boost injection improved binding antibody and NAb titers by 66- and 45-fold, respectively, and the ratios of NAb to binding antibody in the boost group were slightly lower (not significantly) than those in the prime group (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Protection efficacy of mRNA-RBD in hACE2 transgenic mice against SARS-CoV-2
To further explore the in vivo protection efficacy of mRNA-RBD against wild SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge, hACE2 transgenic mice (n = 6) received one (prime group) or two (boost group) immunizations of 15 μg mRNA-RBD or placebo via the i.m. route, and pre-challenge sera were collected for detection of specific and NAb titers (Fig. 3a). The results showed that a single immunization of mRNA-RBD induced robust production of RBD-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies with a pseudovirus-neutralizing NT90 titer of approximate 170 (Fig. 3b, c)."	<urn:uuid:68374bc6-b9fb-475b-9750-ab16a6c2a81a>	0.0

As a plant physiologist studying nitrogen metabolism, I'm curious about how silicon-containing mixes affect plant nutrient uptake during stress, and what role does ammonium toxicity play in this nutrient balance?	"An EPA spokesperson said there were no out of the ordinary discharges at the time and the plant had been operating without any “exceedences of licence conditions”.
Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins also washed up dead throughout the Gulf of St Vincent and surrounding waters from 1 March until 7 May.
University of Adelaide veterinary diagnostic laboratory operational manager Dr Stephen Pyecroft said the dolphins were likely to have been killed by the morbillivirus, a virus transmitted by close contact between dolphins.
Affected dolphins were mostly juvenile and likely to have been immuno-suppressed for a variety of reasons, including heat stress, although pathological results remained pending.
“I just think that the water temperatures and the oceanographic conditions that have been shown in the last three to four months is pretty telling,” Pyecroft said.
“And if the prediction is that changing climate patterns are going to leave warm waters and algae blooms sitting there for months, then it’s going to affect the natural aquatic environment that these animals live in.”
Kaempf said the mortality events required a more rigorous scientific approach to include all possibilities, including pollution.
“Some scientists say climate change is going to bring more extreme weather events, and that means algal blooms are going to happen more and more often.
“This is about finding the nutrient sources that cause algae blooms in warm water.”
According to the EPA, Adelaide coastal waters’ nutrient load decreased from 2,891 tonnes of nitrogen a year in 2003 to 1,594 tonnes a year in 2008, while sediment loads decreased from 10,999 tonnes a year to 7,525 tonnes a year.
Nitrogen discharges from wastewater treatment plants and industry increased by 35 tonnes in 2012, probably as a result of slight reductions in reuse due to higher rainfall.
“With the aimed reduction in nutrient loads entering the marine environment over the next few decades, it is hoped this will reduce the likelihood of major algal blooms due to nutrient enrichment and temperature increases,” the EPA spokesperson said.
“However, upwelling events are unpredictable and their role in algal blooms in the gulf is not well understood.”
Acting SA food and fisheries minister, Grace Portolesi, said the algal bloom was an isolated event caused by the “rare warming” of coastal waters and could not yet be attributed to climate change.
“While these types of events are rare and unfortunate, understanding their cause and how best to respond to them is something that requires further research and investigation,” she said."	<urn:uuid:c53d2b7d-45dc-4554-889e-0b84c619358d>	0.0
which body parts does osteoarthritis affect most	"In the first year or so of latent syphilis you can still pass the infection on. After this time, you are no longer infectious to others but you still have syphilis infection. If left untreated, the germs can slowly damage various parts of your body and symptoms of the final (tertiary) stage may eventually appear.
Tertiary syphilis can develop many years after the initial syphilis infection. Some manifestations of the disease can occur up to 50 years later. Many of these complications are potentially very serious and can make you extremely unwell. Some problems are life-threatening and can lead to death if untreated.
Syphilis is not considered to be infectious in its tertiary stage. Tertiary complications are slowly progressive and can affect any organ of your body.
Tertiary syphilis may cause several types of complications:
- Brain (neurological) complications. This is also called neurosyphilis (see next section).
- Cardiovascular complications. These are problems affecting your heart and blood vessels (the cardiovascular system). Most commonly, syphilis affects the main blood vessel leading out of your heart (the aorta). Inflammation here can cause weakening of your aorta, which can stretch, forming an aneurysm. Aneurysms have thin weak walls and can burst (rupture), potentially leading to death. Even if an aneurysm does not rupture, it can seriously affect one of your heart valves (the aortic valve), leading to a heart murmur. In turn, the heart does not pump very well and becomes swollen (distended) with blood. This condition is known as heart failure. See separate leaflets called Heart Failure and The Heart and Blood Vessels for more details.
- Gummatous disease. Gummas are soft growths (tumours) caused by inflammation. They are not cancerous (malignant) tumours but are long-term (chronic) and can affect any part of the body. They can grow on your skeleton and affect your joints; they can also cause large lumps in or under the skin. Gummas can grow on your internal organs (such as your liver) and affect organ function. Quite commonly they appear on your leg, below your knee. Gummas may be single or multiple and can vary in size between one and several centimetres."	<urn:uuid:afe5fd42-5ef5-40f8-97b8-3d9235236dfd>	0.0

clean glass railing vs paint porch railing steps	"New Orleans Airlift: Porchlife (in Coney Island on Aug 4th)
STOMP meets electronic dance music.. TurningJewelsIntoWater got to play the porch set up by New Orleans Airlift on Saturday, Aug. 4th. While we didn’t get to play all the structures, this is what was available for us:
“Strings are set along the first set of the railing. One side are bass strings, the other guitar strings. These are all tunable. The house is tuned to D Major, so these are tuned to harmonize with the rest of the house. There are loop pedals on each side (one for bass and one for guitar). You can create a bass loop, and then add to it by using the pedals located at the other instruments.
On the first landing there are a set of large chimes. To the left is a device designed by Quintron that “plays” the weather via sensors and synthesizers. It emits a drone that can be manipulated via the dials on the panel. To the right, there is a porch swing that acts as a “metronome”. As it moves back and forth it activates a striker positioned inside of a wood block.
The steps to the second level have MIDI triggers that play percussion samples. Two panels in the wall also have triggers. Drums, cymbals, and 808s. These can be played using feet and hands, or they can be played with mallets to give you a little more control.
The second level has a marimba railing (n.b. this instrument sounds best when you strike the edge of the bar, unlike the traditional instrument that sounds best when played in the center of the bar). D maj. The marimba has a loop pedal and a delay pedal rigged to it. To the left of that is a PVC tube xylophone.
There is a door at the highest level with handbells, again it has the notes of a D major scale, though they aren’t arranged in scale order. There are also jingle bells attached to the lower half of the door.”"	<urn:uuid:4b1f526d-b1fd-497a-84aa-ca88adc299bc>	0.0

Did social media help people during Covid in Japan?	"Coronavirus used in malware attacks
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is being used as bait in email spam attacks on targets around the globe by using the promise of information or a cure to fool people.
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is being used as bait in email spam attacks on targets around the globe. As the number of those afflicted continue to surge by thousands, campaigns using the dreaded and feared virus as a lure also increase, said researchers at Trend Micro.
The mention of current events for email spam attacks is nothing new for attackers, who time and again use the timeliness of hot topics, occasions, and popular personalities in their social engineering strategies.
A rise in the use of the words “coronavirus” and “corona” in malware names and malicious domains have also been witnessed.
Trend Micro researchers acquired email samples sent to and received from all over the globe, including the U.S., Japan, Russia, and China. These emails, purportedly from official organizations, contain updates and recommendations connected to the disease. Like most email spam attacks, they also include malicious attachments.
Tactics used by hackers
One of the samples used the email subject “Corona Virus Latest Updates” and claimed to come from the Ministry of Health. It contained recommendations on how to prevent infection, and came with an attachment that supposedly contains the latest updates on COVID-19 but actually carried malware.
Quite a few of the email spam related to shipping transactions, either postponement due to the spread of the disease or one that provides a shipping update. One email informed about a shipping postponement. The attachment, supposedly containing the details of the new shipping schedule, bears malware. The email is assumed to come from Japan, and included details written in Japanese.
There were also other samples detected in foreign languages such as Italian and Portuguese. The email in Italian was about important information about the virus, while the email in Portuguese discussed a supposed vaccine for COVID-19.
As the virus spreads, it can be expected there will be more of these. People and companies following their cybersecurity best practices can help mitigate these attacks from spreading and harming their companies."	<urn:uuid:fe81e85d-13fe-4478-b88e-314fd35b3050>	0.0

Which natural materials produce specific color dyes?	"Push a cart down a supermarket aisle, and you’ll pass a kaleidoscope of color. The use of artificial dyes by foodmakers is up by half since 1990, and it’s not limited to candy. The list of foods made pretty by chemicals now includes pickles, bagels and port wine cheese balls.
“Americans are really turned on by a bright-red strawberry juice, and they think it’s natural,” said Kantha Shelke, co-president of the food research firm Corvus Blue. “Or cheese — cheese is naturally a pale color, but most young kids will not eat cheese unless it’s a bright, almost fluorescent orange.”
Foodmakers have used dyes since ancient times to make food more appealing to the eye. But the practice has so invaded the modern psyche that artificial dyes are being used even on some pet foods. Dogs see limited color, but apparently their owners don’t like buying dull, gray chow.
Now, federal regulators are reexamining artificial ingredients they have long deemed to be safe, prompted by scientific studies suggesting that color additives might be linked to hyperactivity in children and other health effects. On Wednesday, an advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration will begin a two-day meeting to discuss the science behind artificial dyes and whether the government ought to restrict their use.
“There are sometimes nine different dyes in a food product,” said Laura Anderko of Georgetown University Medical Center, who serves on the Children’s Health Protection Advisory Committee for the Environmental Protection Agency. “Moms and dads will say, ‘Here’s a fruit roll-up — that must be healthy.’ But it’s filled with dyes. And emerging science suggests it’s a harm to children.”
Two recent studies sponsored by the British government found that children given foods made with some artificial dyes and a food preservative, sodium benzoate, showed an increase in hyperactivity. The study sampled children in the general population, not just those known to show hyperactive behavior.
The studies remain controversial, with some scientists skeptical about the links that can be drawn."	<urn:uuid:57efbb39-bf54-4800-ad45-4e7bf5f7ea9e>	0.0

As a production engineer monitoring oil pressure in a manufacturing facility, I'm interested in understanding how KPIs can help track the optimum pressure value of 80 in a production line. What are the main benefits of using KPIs for this kind of monitoring?	"When the saturation pressure of the reservoir is unknown, as is mostly the case, the monitoring of fluid composition and fluorescence will indicate if the sampling pressure has fallen below the saturation pressure of the fluid. The sample will then be collected or not according to criteria based on the stability of the composition, and the minimization of filtrate contamination.
To identify a retrograde condensate, one can steadily drop the sampling pressure below the saturation pressure of the fluid to observe the change in the fluorescence signal that will occurs with dew formation at the dew point pressure. This is a useful test for reservoir development since it identifies the existence of retrograde condensate, provides a real-time estimate of the fluid dew pressure, and gives information about the effects of two-phase flow on production performance. We can also monitor the estimated dew point against oil based mud (OBM) contamination."	<urn:uuid:24469821-de60-419a-8247-cc920214280d>	0.0

As a chemist, I'm curious: how is propylene glycol used in vaping, and what are the safety concerns?	"Complete Corrosion Protection
Exceptional Anti Scale & Anti Foam properties for longer life of engine parts and seals
It’s getting hot in here. Check your coolant system to prevent overheating in hot driving conditions and ensure peak engine performance while you’re out on the road. Remember, coolant should be changed annually in your vehicle. Consider checking all hoses, clamps and the radiator as well for any leaks, bulges, or loose fittings.
Engine coolant is a chemical solution that keeps your car away from overheating.
It helps the radiator and cooling system keep the engine at correct temperature. Good coolant prevents corrosion & pitting on aluminium, cast iron, steel, brass, solder, copper parts.
Coolant is a Mixture of :
- Mono Ethylene Glycol
- Corrosion inhibitor’s(additives)
An easy way to think of engine coolant is consider what it’s made of specifically three main items namely glycol, de-ionized water and corrosion inhibitors as shown below:
Ethylene Glycol or Propylene glycol + Deionized Water + Corrosion Inhibitors = Engine Coolant
An ideal coolant has high thermal capacity, low viscosity, non-toxic, chemically inert, and neither causes nor promotes corrosion of the cooling system. Some applications also require the coolant to be an electrical insulator. The most common coolant is water. Its high heat capacity and low cost makes it a suitable heat-transfer medium. It is usually used with additives, like corrosion inhibitors and antifreeze. Antifreeze, a solution of a suitable organic chemical (most often ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or propylene glycol) in water, is used when the water-based coolant has to withstand temperatures below 0 °C, or when its boiling point has to be raised.
Key features of an effective radiator coolant are:
- Effective heat transfer
- Prevention of cooling system corrosion
- Effective boiling point
- Chemical stability
- Safe for use as directed by manufacturer"	<urn:uuid:ea05abfa-7205-4692-a8da-226efd7ed875>	0.0

eprocurement system categories benefits sustainability	"UK supermarket Tesco has become the first retailer in the country to set an ambitious plant-based food sales target. Today they’ve revealed that they’re committing to boosting sales of meat alternatives by 300% within five years.
Over the past year, demand for chilled plant-based meat alternatives at Tesco has increased by almost 50%. As a result of this rising demand the retailer will be expanding into more categories as well as creating options for people to buy dishes for two or family-sized meals within their plant-based range.
The new target is part of a package of sustainability measures that have been developed in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) which intends to halve the impact on the environment of the average UK shopping basket.
To achieve these goals, Tesco has set out a range of measures to help it reach its ambitious sales target:
- Availability: Introduce and grow plant-based meat alternatives across all its stores, with products across 20 different categories including ready meals, breaded meat alternatives, plant-based sausages, burgers, quiches, pies, party food.
- Affordability: continue to invest in value so that affordability is not a barrier to buying plant-based meat alternatives.
- Innovation: work with suppliers to bring new innovations to customers.
- Visibility: provide a meat alternative where a meat version is featured, for example Richmond sausages and Richmond plant-based sausages to feature together.
In another industry first, Tesco has committed to publishing plant-based food sales as a percentage of overall protein sales every year to track its progress. Tesco became the first UK retailer to publish its food waste data in 2013, and it hopes this new level of transparency on protein sales will help encourage the rest of the food industry to make similar commitments.
Tesco CEO, Dave Lewis said:
“We know from our experience in tackling food waste that transparency and setting ambitious targets are the first steps towards becoming a more sustainable business. Our transparency on protein sales and our new sales target for meat alternatives gives us the platform to becoming more sustainable and will provide customers with even more choice.
“These measures are just part of the work we’re doing with WWF, bringing together for the first time a host of sustainability metrics to help us halve the environmental impact of food production.
“We can’t accomplish the transformational change needed for a truly sustainable food system on our own, so we’re calling on the whole industry to play its role, starting with increased transparency on its sustainability impacts."	<urn:uuid:e8b394ba-3072-4c69-a39e-a8c032de5067>	0.0
How does crop insurance protect farmers financially and what research exists on its market effects?	"GM papaya wins approval in U.S., Japan
HFP Editor's Note: Safety and health approvals have now been granted by the Japan Health Regulatory Organization, eliminating any scientific or health-related objection to the GM Papaya. The next step is the Agricultural marketing process which needs to have procedures in place to bring the fruit into Japan. After that, importation can begin.
By Harry Cline, Farm Press Editorial Staff, Apr 21, 2010 >>> Link to original
Genetically modified papaya will soon be on the supermarket shelves in Japan just like it now is in the U.S.
This first-ever fresh market GMO food product is not from an American corporate giant. It is the result of tenacious research from a host of scientists and the cooperation of Hawaiian farmers. This rare feat in today’s contentious debate over GMO crops was not accomplished to make a statement. It was to save an important crop for farmers in the impoverished state of Hawaii.
Dennis Gonsalves, director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center in Hilo, Hawaii, and professor emeritus of plant pathology at Cornell, detailed to the 63rd annual meeting of the Western Society of Weed Science in Hawaii how Hawaiian agriculture has done what no other ag sector has; win approval to market a genetically modified food crop in the U.S. and Japan.
Gonsalves was the project leader on the successful effort to save Hawaii’s $47 million papaya industry. He is a native Hawaiian raised on a sugar plantation on Hawaii’s Big Island. He received bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the University of Hawaii and a doctorate at the University of California at Davis. He went to Cornell University as an associate professor in 1977. He spent 25 years at Cornell, yet his biggest professional achievement there saved an industry 4,700 miles away in his native island homeland.
Gonsalves left Cornell eight years ago to become director of the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center in Hilo, Hawaii.
Papaya is the second largest fruit crop in Hawaii. It is grown commercially for export to the U.S. mainland and Japan. Hawaii exports 25 percent to 30 percent of its papaya to Japan.
Papaya trees can be severely damaged by the papaya ringspot virus (PRSV), which is rapidly transmitted by aphids."	<urn:uuid:366e8633-be34-45d0-9b89-1635a5489c22>	0.0
why are gamma waves dangerous	"It will not have been mentioned before in this blog, but I like certain aspects of pure mathematics as much as I like deep-sky imaging. I think most people will have heard of the Golden-Section, or the Golden-Ratio, and how it can be obtained by dividing a straight line up into two sections one of length unity, and the other of length tau or 1.61803398… What is less well-known is that if you wrap the line round into a circle, so the cir cle perimeter is divided into lengths of unity and 1.618, then then angle subtended by the unity length of the perimeter at the centre of the circle is 137.507 degrees – or the Golden Angle.
That’s where the story seems to have been left, for a very long time, but I have to wonder, why? We started with a line (one-dimension), then moved to a circle (two-dimensions), where’s the spherical case (3-dimensions)? I did a long search a couple of years back and couldn’t find anything on this. So I wrote a paper on “The Golden Solid Angle” for the Mathematical Gazette, which was in fact turned down as “although the result was new, just having a new result is not necessarily having something worthy of publication” – well that’s a new one for me! So wishing to stake my claim as the discoverer of the Golden Solid Angle (sent to the Mathematical Gazette on Thursday 14th June 2007) here’s the thing explained for the first time below.
Divide the surface of a sphere into two regions, one of surface area unity, and the other of surface area 1.618… The surface area of unity will subtend a solid angle gamma at the centre of the sphere. By noting the total solid angle about a point is 4Pi Steradians, we can derive the following equation for gamma:
(4Pi – gamma)/gamma = 4Pi/(4Pi – gamma)
Giving a quadratic in gamma which can be solved in the usual way to give:
gamma = 1.52786Pi Steradians or 15757.2 square degrees.
Question is, does anyone out there know where the Golden Solid Angle, gamma, makes an appearance in the Natural world (or basically, anywhere)?"	<urn:uuid:6527858c-e9de-44a4-8f5d-cd3987a9ad84>	0.0

Notwithstanding the type of policy procured, the limit of liability under PI policies is always an aggregate limit; meaning that the maximum amount the insurer will pay will be capped for both each claim and for all claims during period of insurance. The aggregate limit will either be specifically described on the policy schedule or as “reinstatement(s)” within the policy wording.
When determining the adequacy of the aggregate limit under a D&C PI policy, the contractor should consider the following:
• number of current and historical projects for which professional services were performed by or on your behalf;
• contract value of each of project;
• technical complexities and/or risks associated with each project; and
• (for project specific policies) the period of the policy.
The drafting of D&C Pl policy wordings can vary dramatically between insurers. Whilst all offer various automatic and optional coverage extensions; the inclusion of a specific policy extension in one policy wording does not necessarily mean that broader coverage is being afforded by that insurer. Most policy extensions are simply 'writebacks' in cover specifically excluded elsewhere in the policy; accordingly, the absence of the same exclusion (and policy extension) in another policy wording is likely to actually offer broader overall coverage.
Some of the standard extensions offered under most D&C PI policies include:
• Advancement of Defence Costs
• Inquiry Costs
• Vicarious Liability (Consultants, Subcontractors and Agents)
• Joint Venture Liability
• Loss of Documents
The following policy extensions are often optional under D&C PI policies, some of which can be subject to an additional premium; however, these extensions can provide real value to contractors depending on the nature of their projects and business activities.
All construction contracts include indemnity and hold harmless provisions that extend the liabilities of the contractor beyond what would normally attach under common law."	<urn:uuid:bf5a950a-c0ad-44ab-9cb4-95e17f5a4536>	0.0

I'm curious about what futuristic writers anticipated about modern technology. Have any notable sci-fi authors been particularly prescient about tech's impact on society while being low-tech themselves?	"However, Tommasini returns for another swipe in print at Achim Freyer’s staging of Wagner’s Ring now being rolled out at Los Angeles Opera. On a positive note, he does cite Freyer’s work for LA Opera as an example of a company’s complete commitment to an idea that is “unabashedly avant-garde.”
Of course, he can’t let it go at that without taking further jabs at a production he apparently hasn’t quite wrapped his brain around yet. He refers to it as a “sci-fi Ring” noting that the characters wield “neon spears that look like Jedi light sabers.” Nothing could be further removed from the truth in a production that has more of a rough-hewn primitive look than anything futuristic or high-tech. Freyer maintains a cheap and intentionally artificial visual sense throughout often in the service of laughs. This is Tommasini's third mention of the presumed likeness between neon lights and light sabers in the NY Times, but it tells us more about Tommasini’s own misconceptions about Los Angeles and it’s No. 1 industry than it does about Freyer’s Ring production. I suppose that all neon lights do look like light sabers except for the fact that Freyer’s lights have no hilts, are frequently handled in the center as opposed to their ends, and are used for many other elements in the staging besides just spears and swords. It is also true that L.A. Opera originally approached George Lucas’ Industrial Light and Magic during initial plans to produce a Ring cycle years ago. But none of this has anything to do with Freyer’s Ring. Yes, movies are made in Los Angeles. But, believe it or not, that does not mean that everything associated with Los Angeles intentionally references film. It's not that the similarity doesn't exist. But calling Freyer's production a ""sci-fi Ring"" is perhaps the least informative and insightful observation one could make about it.
But that's not all. Tommasini then continues to rehash his main criticism of LA Opera's Die Walküre from earlier this year in that it doesn’t deal with the “human dimensions of the characters.” Considering that Act III of Freyer’s Ring packs more emotional impact with its bizarre stage-length outstretched arms and primitive costume changes than anything that’s appeared in the same opera on a New York stage for decades seems to be lost on him."	<urn:uuid:4c40c85c-8d68-46ae-9611-81d471fbdfb5>	0.0

The balance sheet of 50 years of development aid
Over the past 50 years the West has invested over 3000 billion euro in development aid and already tackled many problems. Now more and more countries and organisations present themselves on the development aid scene, including China, India, and foundations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Companies, trade unions, co-operatives, schools and towns set up their own projects in remote African regions.
But can each and everybody become a development worker? Who decides what is acceptable and what is not? What is the role of the developing countries themselves? Who can tell what is good aid and what is bad aid? Is it a free market allowing everybody to do what he wants? A market without rules, with a lot of competition and little cooperation?
This book draws up the balance sheet of 50 years of development aid and provides an overview of all relevant players, of opportunities and obstacles, of successes and failure. It details numerous examples and information on development projects from all over the world. Readers may be tempted to get involved in development aid, but they will also be more cautious than before."	<urn:uuid:e2097631-249b-43f3-99df-283dafef4c72>	0.0
What hardware components are essential to assemble a CNC machine?	"Mach3 R3.043.066 Crack With Serial Key 2022
Allows you to control an industrial or home CNC machine.
Download Mach3 + Crack / Serial Keys
Mach3 addresses a strict crowd of engineers working with a special equipment called CNC (computer numerical control) machines that operate more or less like plotters do.
If you never have heard about a plotter or you just can’t picture one although you have heard of this term, a plotter is actually a high-precision printer that is used in various engineering domains such as CAD (computer-aided design).
CNC machines are widely used in more fields that you can think of and to give you just a few examples, these comprise drills, EDMs (electrical discharge machine), embroidery machines, milling machines, wood routers, plasma / hot-wire / laser / water-jet cutters, surface / cylindrical grinders, 3D printers or knife / glass cutters.
You can now try to acknowledge the importance of such machinery alongside the software used to program it. Mach3 finds itself in this particular category and what it does is turn your schematics that you import in various formats such as BMP, JPEG, DXF or G-code into real-life components of all shapes and sizes.
Being a program especially designed for a bunch of people, Mach3 is all about functionality and little if anything at all towards looks and other non important aspects in this domain of activity. Do not hope for any eye-candy upon starting it as its over-crowded sections simply makes anyone that does not have a clue about what it is supposed to do immediately close it.
To sum it all up, Mach3 is a professional application for professionals working with CNC machinery. The plethora of options, functions and settings can really be overwhelming if you have no idea about this type of software. For the ones that do posses the required knowledge, Mach3 can prove to be quite helpful."	<urn:uuid:4d057ab3-8542-4c11-8b70-5bcc0e214d55>	0.0
is nonviolence good for defending property	"When the state declared it would incorporate open standards and open source in all future technology acquisitions, critics charged the commonwealth with ""socializing the software industry, destroying intellectual property in its wake and undermining the pillars of our capitalistic economy.""
In fact, intellectual property was fiercely defended and promoted, new private-sector players came to the table and newly developed applications are in production at costs one-third below market value. The code is available through the Government Open Code Collaborative Repository, a clearing-house others have talked about for a decade or more, but that Massachusetts actually built.
Quinn's deeper concern is that the road ahead for public-sector IT is a cul-de-sac without reform on four fronts: open funding that aligns the budget cycle with technology life cycles; open infrastructure that focuses on building it once and building it right; open design in government focused on the citizen; and an open civil service that makes public service an attractive career choice, addresses the retirement wave that already has come ashore and confronts what he calls the union practice of ""defending the indefensible ... insistence on archaic work practices and ... continued stifling of job choice.""

prototype vs agile testing changes feedback	"After making its global media debut in Shanghai last October, this is the first opportunity for the Chinese public to see the Electric Performance Hybrid.
Its appearance in Beijing is boosted by overwhelmingly positive feedback from test drivers and engineers, who recently spent two weeks north of the Article Circle for a rigorous shakedown with the first running Polestar 1 prototype – in temperatures as low as -28 degrees Celsius (-18 °F).
The intense winter test drive is designed to examine and fine-tune traditional automotive aspects like suspension and driving dynamics, but in the case of the Polestar 1, the drivetrain and batteries were also under scrutiny – in one of the coldest places on the planet.
Test drivers specifically focused on the Polestar 1 torque vectoring system, which is enabled by two rear electric motors with individual planetary gear sets. Chassis balance was further optimized thanks to the advantages of testing on ice, allowing the test drivers to better analyse and react to the car’s behavior while driving.
“Our test drivers have given us some enthusiastic feedback on the handling and dynamics especially,” says Thomas Ingenlath, Chief Executive Officer at Polestar.
“Besides being very happy with the balance of the chassis, they are particularly excited about the torque vectoring. We are now very confident about how this enhances the Polestar 1’s cornering responsiveness and accuracy. This is a driver’s car. We have now passed a major milestone in the development of the Polestar 1, and prototype testing continues throughout 2018.
“Now we look forward to introducing the car to the Chinese public for the first time, a key market for Polestar,” concludes Thomas Ingenlath."	<urn:uuid:f8b2d303-c418-4380-97bf-fe34b8093f91>	0.0

How do heat pumps contribute to decarbonization and what installation considerations exist?	"Our paper mills are complex production facilities and include a large number of pumps and machines to prepare the fibres for our paper and packaging. Frequency control drives are now used to precisely control the speed of the motors so that only the required energy is consumed.
The majority of our paper mills operate large scale Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants which generate electrical power for our operations and the electrical grid. In the process heat is generated which is wasted in traditional power stations but we use it in our paper making process to dry the paper. The reuse of heat is in line with our circular economy strategy of reuse, recycle and reduce reliance on additional fuel, reducing our total carbon output.
The use of battery and electricity powered technology improves the efficiency of our transport. It is a greener form of energy than burning fossil fuels and by using electric powered vehicles in just one of our sites in Italy we have already reduced our C02 output by 150 tons a year.
Our Packaging sites typically have large roof areas which can be ideal for the installation of Solar Power panels. Once installed the panels can deliver zero carbon electrical power for at least 25 years. This can be used to power our sites and other battery technology, such as electric vehicles.
In some countries readily available biomass, plant or animal material, can be used as fuel to produce electricity or heat. This allows for the installation of biomass boilers which burn this material, providing steam to power our manufacturing processes. An example of one of our biomass boilers is at the Varnamo Packaging plant in Sweden, which has significantly reduced the use of the fossil fuel LPG saving us 2,000 tons of CO2e per annum.
Our commitment to cutting carbon
Our carbon target allows all our initiatives to align behind a common goal to reduce our carbon consumption. This means every DS Smith site and employee can contribute to our target reduction and together we are creating a positive impact for people and the planet."	<urn:uuid:cfe15183-0ec6-4f10-945c-7a0346cbab08>	0.0

When do Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas according to their calendar?	"When taking his leave of the country, he thus expressed himself: ‘Wherever I happen to live, if someone from Bulgaria comes to my house, during the night, amidst life’s problems, he will always find a lit lamp. Knock, knock. He will not be asked if he is Catholic or Orthodox, he is a brother from Bulgaria! Enter with both arms, open fraternally, a warm friendly heart, will welcome him with joy’ (Christmas Homily, 25 December 1934).”
Patriarch Neophyte is the current head of the Bulgarian “Orthodox” Church. His “reign” (as leader of the schismatic “Orthodox” church of Bulgaria) began on February 24, 2013. Antipope Francis sends a greeting in order to “celebrate” the election of the schismatic to a position of leadership in the schismatic sect. Francis declares the “election” to be a “canonical election”. This proves that Francis considers the elections of schismatic leaders, to positions of leadership in schismatic non-Catholic sects, to be elections occurring inside the one true Church. That, of course, is completely heretical.
Francis’ March 5, 2014 Interview granted to Ferruccio De Bortoli,
Editor-in-Chief of the Italian daily newspaper ‘Corriere della Sera’:
Ferruccio De Bortoli: “Were you displeased by the accusations of being a Marxist, especially in America, after the promulgation of ‘Evangelii gaudium’?”
Francis: “Not at all. I have never shared the Marxist ideology because it is not true; but I have known many great people who professed Marxism.”
Ferruccio De Bortoli: “Why did Cardinal Walter Kasper’s report in the last Consistory (on the abyss between the doctrine on marriage and the family and the real life of many Christians) generate so much division among the cardinals?…”
Francis: “Cardinal Kasper offered a beautiful and profound presentation, which will soon be published in German. He addressed five points, the fifth of which is that of second marriages.”
Ferruccio De Bortoli: “A half-century after Paul VI’s ‘Humanae vitae’ can the Church take up again the issue of birth control?"	<urn:uuid:995b5954-cbea-48e1-a73b-6867e636887d>	0.0

"However, the investigating officer’s report noted she went to a branch bank at the intersection and asked to view what the bank’s video surveillance cameras may have captured of the accident scene.
It was obvious to the officer – after viewing the video – that one of the driver’s versions was less than accurate. That information was included in The Progress story.
Computers don’t pick up on certain things, including weather conditions and alert police officers.
Computers also don’t catch lies told by some individuals as a matter of habit. Experienced human reporters learned that some people can’t be trusted and what they say must be verified. There are no exceptions to the latter rule.
That’s not data-driven, but applied common sense.
Algorithms only work if the data is structured. Humans are not that structured. There’s no way to automate everything.

You may not notice it but you are already spending more because of petty and little expenses that accumulate. Than how much moving cost you ask ? You need to think wisely and make budget allocations. List down all the major expenditures that you will incur such as the cost of your plane tickets, the charges of the moving company and of all the packing materials you will need for your things..
How Much Moving Cost
Are you moving to a different city or to a new place within the same state? If you are renting this new place, you will have to spend more. Renting a new space would usually entail making advance payments as well as deposits. The cost of moving may overwhelm your budget so carefully plan this major decision you are going to make. Compute how much moving costs and compare it with your income. Will you have enough money afterwards to spend for all your other needs? Weigh it out and consider all possibilities, you cannot let this change affect your finances adversely. still asking how much moving cost ? call us at 800 770 4200 we can help.
If you want to move to a new place but would not want to spend tremendously, follow these helpful tips to make moving a breeze:
1Careful and Wise Planning.
Just like any decision you make, moving to a new place requires a lot of careful planning. Plan ahead and plan well. In planning to move, include the following:
• When to move; • When to start packing and preparing all the stuff to bring; • How to move and what means of transportation is needed; • How to set up your new place; • What to do with all the stuff you left; • What other things to settle before leaving your old home.
2Prepare a Budget Plan
In your budget, include the following:
• Transportation expenses (by land, air or sea); • Packing materials; • Packing services, in case you need the assistance of one; • Cost of setting up your new home; • New appliances or fixtures you may need in your home; • Advance rental payment and deposits.
In the planning stage, you should already decide whether you would sell or donate the stuff you will be leaving behind. In case you decide to sell them, you can make use of the proceeds of the sale."	<urn:uuid:0478563b-d496-4631-b048-3db5ba947c19>	0.0
What makes belt conveyors versatile while also being dangerous?	"Rain, fog, and other such issues may affect your safety when driving, so keep this in mind.
6. Follow The Speed Limit
Always follow the speed limit in NSW or VIC. Speeding is dangerous, against the law, and makes it harder to respond to on-road situations.
Remember that learner drivers in NSW must stay below 90 km/h, even if the posted speed limit on the highway is higher. This does not apply in Victoria, however.
7. Always Wear Your Seat Belt
Last, but certainly not least, wear your seat belt. It’s the law – and when driving at higher speeds, such as on the highway, the risk of dying due to not being restrained by a seat belt while in a motor vehicle is much higher.

drug delivery nano systems cardiovascular disease treatment	Anaphylaxis is a serious clinical condition that can affect all ages and many systems (skin, gastrointestinal system, respiratory and cardiovascular systems). There are a few case reports of cardiac and cerebrovascular complications due to the anaphylaxis and/or the treatment with epinephrine. A 69-year-old female patient with known coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and diabetes mellitus (DM) was admitted to the emergency department. She was brought to the emergency service with the complaints of shortness of breath, swelling of the tongue and lip, widespread itching and nausea after the use of amoxicillin-clavulonic acid due to soft tissue infection. The patient was considered as having anaphylaxis. 0.5 mg intramuscular (IM) epinephrine was administered. Following the emergency electrocardiography (ECG), the rate was 140/min and the rhythm was evaluated as atrial fibrillation. We present a case of cardiovascular complications and acute ischemia stroke following intramuscular epinephrine administration with anaphylactic diagnosis in this study. As a result, anaphylaxis management is extremely important in elderly patients with preexisting cardiovascular conditions.	<urn:uuid:0dbbeac3-4724-4f19-be0c-5b9f142e9728>	0.0

Elevations in the canyon range from 1,219 meters at the valley floor to nearly 2,743 meters at the highest point. A favorite of rock climbers and hiking enthusiasts, the vertical climbs and zigzagging trails will take you to pinnacles, domes, arches and spires. Hanging gardens, canyon waterfalls and natural stain-lined canyon walls create a tropical paradise in the middle of an arid desert climate. Zion Canyon offers something for everyone, including trails ranging from short “leg stretcher” walks to strenuous adventures. Emerald Pools, Weeping Rock and the Riverside Walk are short family hikes on paved trails.
The more advanced terrain of Angels Landing, Observation Point and Hidden Canyon beckons to visitors who will trade strenuous climbs for stunning panoramas on higher ground.

website mistakes that drive away customers	"Runnings is just one of many retailers that have recently turned to ShopVisible to create an integrated omnichannel experience tying online and offline together for their customers.
Marshall, MN (PRWEB) March 10, 2014
Today, Runnings, a leading general merchandise retailer with more than 34 brick and mortar stores across the upper Midwest, announces its partnership with ShopVisible for the launch of its first ever eCommerce site, runnings.com.

Additionally, ShopVisible’s platform will allow seamless integration with the company’s current system of more than 500 suppliers.
“We are thrilled to partner with ShopVisible as we enter into eCommerce for the first time to grow and better serve a national online customer base,” said Dennis Jensen, director of marketing at Runnings. “After meeting with multiple eCommerce platform vendors, we came away from our meetings with ShopVisible feeling that their platform would provide the best solution to serve a broader audience while bringing more traffic into our 30-plus retail stores with online ordering and in-store pick up options.”
“We’re delighted that Runnings selected ShopVisible to power its new eCommerce site and to meet its unique business objective of using its online presence to drive more traffic to its brick and mortar stores,” said Sean Cook, CEO of ShopVisible. “It’s clear that Runnings understands its customers’ needs and is sure to see positive growth in sales, both in-store and online with a new eCommerce offering."	<urn:uuid:65515855-a045-4368-af96-20699897c5ff>	0.0

my mother has trouble breathing need to know if breathing problems due to infection or muscle weakness similarities differences	"Few things in life are as emotional as the birth of a baby. It’s usually a joyful occasion that is celebrated. In some cases, however, the birth can have complications. According to the American Heart Association, about ten percent of babies require resuscitation efforts at birth. Which is why medical health professionals must be prepared to handle resuscitation appropriately — because if it is not, the consequences to the baby can be catastrophic.
Why is Resuscitation Needed?
In many cases, after delivery, a baby exhibits normal functioning including a good respiratory effort, strong heartbeat, and good muscle tone. But in other instances, a newborn needs some level of resuscitation.
Various factors can play a role in a baby needing resuscitation after birth. For example, some babies may have problems breathing due to immature lung development. Babies who aspirate meconium may also have respiratory distress. Meconium is a baby’s first stool, and it sometimes occurs in utero shortly before birth. If a baby inhales the meconium, it can lead to breathing problems.
During delivery, the umbilical cord can become compressed, which can lead to decreased oxygen to the baby. If the cord compression is not recognized, it can be life-threatening to the baby.
What is Involved in Infant Resuscitation?
The goal of infant resuscitation after delivery is to provide adequate perfusion and oxygenation to the baby’s brain as quickly as possible. When an infant is not breathing sufficiently to maintain circulation to the heart and brain, death can occur. Medical staff needs to act swiftly and efficiently to recognize the need for resuscitation. Infant resuscitation procedures may include:
- Warm, dry and stimulate: The first steps in neonatal resuscitation involve stimulating, warming and drying the baby. Stimulating involves rubbing the babies back and flicking the feet.
- Provide oxygen: In instances where a baby has spontaneous breathing but is not maintaining adequate oxygen levels, administration of supplemental oxygen is required.
- Suction the airway: Amniotic fluid can block the airway. Suctioning the baby’s mouth and nose may be helpful to improve breathing.
- Manual Ventilation: If a baby is not breathing spontaneously of if respirations are weak, manual ventilation with a bag-mask device is needed.
- CPR: In neonates, CPR is initiated if the heart rate drops below 60 beats per minute."	<urn:uuid:d29c55c9-bfd5-47c1-95c9-2b67d4ba9533>	0.0
What are the main advantages of using mediation to resolve disputes about horses instead of going to court?	"The decision of the 9th Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court, numbered 2022/4 E. and 2022/1034 K., was published in the Official Gazette dated 14 April 2022 and numbered 31809. With the decision, within the scope of mandatory mediation regarding labor law disputes, it has been decided that the party that causes the end of the mediation process due to failure to attend the first meeting without giving an excuse will be liable for the entire cost of the trial, not just the acceptance or rejection rate, and an attorney’s fee will be charged against this party.
What does the decision say?
In the decision, the plaintiff stated that the defendant did not participate in the mediation negotiations without giving any excuse and demanded the collection of overtime receivables from the defendant.
According to the decision:
- It has been determined that the parties are engaged in mediation within the scope of mandatory mediation, the defendant did not attend the mediation meeting without giving an excuse, and the process ended for this reason.
- Pursuant to the decision rendered by the Antalya 6th Labor Court (“Court of First Instance”), it has been decided that the defendant be held responsible for the litigation costs according to the acceptance and rejection rate of the claim, as well as the attorney’s fee over the amount of the rejected claim in favor of the defendant.
- Law on Mediation in Civil Disputes No. 6325 (“Law”) stipulates that the party that causes the end of the mediation process due to failure to attend the first meeting without giving an excuse will be liable for the entire cost of the trial, regardless of whether the party is partially or fully justified in the case, and an attorney’s fee will be charged against this party.
- As a result, the 9th Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court also gave a decision supporting the Law.
The effects of this decision given by the 9th Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court should be followed and taken into account by employers in the case of legal disputes."	<urn:uuid:64a247a6-e059-4a44-99f3-9b68c5417d5c>	0.0

why did beowulf ancient hero die fighting dragon purpose	"About the Show
Former Olympic athlete Jonathan Edwards takes a voyage back in time, following Jason (played by Adam Rhys Dee) as he leads his Argonauts on a fabulous, perilous quest for the Golden Fleece. Through dramatic reconstructions, the programme explores the meaning of the myth and what it reveals about Ancient Greek society and the religious experience. For many, Jason was the original action hero, facing fierce Amazons, deadly clashing rocks, treacherous Sirens and a mighty dragon. Tales of his heroic feats have survived for over 2,500 years because his story is, at heart, the story of every boy's journey into manhood. It taught the ancient Greeks fundamental truths about men, and their relationship with women, and it still has much to teach people today.

How did early fossil discoveries in the 1800s change our understanding of prehistoric life and what role did fossils from the Jurassic period play in developing new theories about Earth's history?	"In the mid- to Late Carboniferous, as Australia drifted from equatorial latitudes to polar latitudes, the lycopods waned and were replaced by seed-ferns, and the Nothorhacopteris-Fedekurtzia-Botrychiopis complex.
Most of the modern Australian fauna had its origin in the Cretaceous. From pollen records from the Late Cretaceous it is proposed that the flora of the Cretaceous either evolved within the Austro-Antarctic region or entered Australia from Antarctica. Angiosperms evolved in the northern Gondwana/southern Laurasia during the Early Creteaceous and radiated worldwide, prominent members of this early angiosperm flora were the Nothofagus.
Fossils found at Lightning Ridge, New South Wales suggest that 110 million years ago Australia supported a number of different monotremes, but did not support any marsupials. Marsupials appear to have evolved during the Cretaceous in the contemporary northern hemisphere, to judge from a 100 million-year-old marsupial fossil, Kokopellia, found in the badlands of Utah. Marsupials would have then have spread to South America and Gondwana. The first evidence of marsupials in Australia comes from the Tertiary, and was found at a 55 million-year-old fossil site at Murgon, near Kingaroy in southern Queensland. The Murgon fossil site has yielded a range of marsupial fossils, many with strong South American connections — unsurprising since the two continents were both a part of Gondwana. At Murgon evidence of a placental mammal, a Condylarth (Tingamarra porterorum), was discovered. Placental mammals were also found in North America and South America at this time. This find suggests that placental mammals did coexist with marsupials lived in Australia in the early Tertiary, although only marsupials persisted.
Australia separated from Gondwana 99 Ma, and initially remained warm and humid with rainforest vegetation. Inland Australia had systems of rivers and lakes with abundant wildlife. Fossil birds, platypus, frogs and snakes are present from this period. From 30 Ma there was a period of global cooling and from 15 Ma the Antarctic ice sheet formed."	<urn:uuid:0dbe6b2e-400f-46bb-b93f-049c909bf258>	0.0
what qualities important when hiring business consultant attorney first meeting	"While buying ads will definitely make the business appear closer to the top says Edmonton Business Consultant, since most consumers check out Google reviews before they make their purchasing decision, once they click on a businesses ads, and see thereís not enough Google reviews, they will not make the decision to purchase from tha business. Therefore, a business will have paid for that click, and not and the sale. Itís a pretty efficient way of wasting money.
Business owners can keep several things in mind when they open the doors to their businesses Edmonton Businesses Consultant, that while an online presence is important, it doesnít need to be a website in the beginning, at least until they have generated a minimum of 40 Google reviews on their Google my business page.
Entrepreneurs used to hear that in order for their business to be taken seriously, they needed to have a website says Edmontons Business Consultant. While it is extremely important that businesses have a website, itís even more important that a business has an online presence.
Thatís online presence can come in the form of a Google my business page. The reason why that should be one of the first things that a business gets even over a website, says Edmonton Business Consultant, is because I Google my business page will allow business to start getting Google reviews. Itís extremely important that businesses get Google reviews especially if they are planning on creating a website later on. The reason for this is because 88% of potential customers will make their purchasing decision based on Google reviews they see when they search a business. Businesses that have no Google reviews or very few Google reviews often are passed over for businesses that have more. One of the reasons why businesses should have many Google reviews, is because those consumers that look at the Google reviews will see a business that has only a few reviews as not being serious at what they do or even not being good at what they do. The number of reviews that is seen as being serious to a consumer is 40. Business owners should make reaching 40 Google reviews on their page their top online priority.
Often entrepreneurs claimed that they donít need to have that online presence because they do most of their business through word-of-mouth referrals. While word-of-mouth referrals are very effective and powerful says Edmonton Business Consultant, those word-of-mouth referrals also likely googled the business and looked at their Google reviews."	<urn:uuid:4f55183b-3d67-4133-a477-eb0b10130ec5>	0.0

scared hospital surgery sleep what does going unconscious feel like during operation and can patients remember anything happening	"Never felt so depressed and hopeless in my life. I know this isn't how I usually post, but the last 24 hours have been horrible. Pain, arguing with my husband (which we never do), taking too many pills last night - I just wanted to sleep, sleeping all day and continuing to argue with my husband when I woke up this afternoon. I'm very scared and don't know what is happening. My husband wanted to call 911 last night but said he wouldn't if I told him what pills I had taken. I really had only taken a couple of pain pills and a couple of sleeping pills. I do not want to die - I just want this crap to be over. I started crying this afternoon after my husband made us some pancakes and we didn't have any milk to drink because we have no money. Every time I think about my kids (27 and 30) I start crying. My husband left a little while ago to go to work. He'll be there until 11 pm. I asked him to take all of the pills out of the house and he freaked. At least I recognized the potential - although I really don't think I would do anything because I have felt so cruddy all day (when I was awake). I feel like I need help but I'm afraid to go to the hospital or something. I just don't know what would happen. I'm afraid they would make me stay and I don't think I could handle that. At this point, I'm not sure what I CAN handle. My back hurts today and my kidneys hurt. I have read enough other posts to know I'm not the first to feel this way and I've probably left encouraging posts for those people. But now it's me, and I'm scared. I'm scared to tell my husband how I realy feel. I didn't want him to go to work this evening but I didn't want to tell him because I was afraid he's get all porky about it and say something like, ""OK, fine...I'll call in."" THEN, on top of being in pain, and depressed, I'd feel guilty. My head really hurts. Can someone, anyone, please help me?"	<urn:uuid:73ad79f4-0f36-4a3a-9c7e-408f189aa231>	0.0
I've heard that dogs evolved from wolves, but I'm curious about how such aggressive animals became so friendly towards humans. Do scientists know how this transformation happened?	"I once worked for a company that instituted “pet-friendly Fridays,” when employees were allowed to bring their pets (well behaved only, of course) to the office for the day. Friday quickly became my favorite day of the week –for more reasons than casual attire and free donuts. While my cats had no interest in accompanying me to the workplace (they don’t “do” work, after all), my coworkers’ dogs loved hanging out at the office –and I loved hanging out with them.
Dog friendly offices are becoming almost commonplace these days, as more employers realize that friendly canines create a healthy diversion from workplace stress. In fact, scientists have found that our bodies even experience a hormonal reaction when we interact with a dog, causing us to feel more positive, as well as more relaxed.
Rules, of course, are necessary. Noisy or overly rambunctious dogs may not mix well with the office environment. An aggressive dog should also be left at home, unless he will be the only dog in the office that day. Dogs should be kept on a leash unless they are in your office or cubicle. Do not allow them to roam. If a coworker wants to interact with your dog, she’ll stop by to do so.
A baby gate can prevent your dog from leaving your area unsupervised. Bathrooms and lunchrooms should be designated as dog free. You should, of course, pick up after your pet on outdoor potty breaks.
Now a full-time freelance writer, I no longer work at for that company, but I fondly remember the pet-friendly Fridays.

I'm worried about oil spills. Can nature recover from them?	"""Jamie. Jamie! Please, Please look at me!"" I yell. He doesn't and just carries on moving. Then I see someone else I know. ""Mary!""
She doesn't turn and look. Its like she doesn't even hear me. I stumble back and have to take hold the statue behind me. No one can hear me.... No one cares. I have reality but.... no one can hear me, touch me or even notice me.
""I notice you"" Kieran says as the first tear spills down my cheek. I spin round to face him and watch his face turn worried. ""Thats why you're different Evee. You even care about those even when they don't notice you. When they don't realise that your broken and need someone to help you for a change""
""I'm not broken"" I whisper shaking my head letting more tears spill down my cheeks. Kieran steps up and wipes a tear that has just reached my chin.
""I can be with you Evee. I'd never leave your side so long as you never left mine. We could spend eternity together how ever you wished"" Kieran whispers begining to kiss away each tear that spills.
""I can't. My family... My friends. The people who do care"" I say shaking my head trying to pull away but failing.
""They are all here... moving past you. No one's looking Evee. I can't manipulate people to not feel for you I can only use things that are there"" Kieran says grasping my shoulders tightly. It's like he's pleading with me now.
""But how can you care? You've put me through my 4 worst nightmares and stolen my mortality? How does that show you care?"" I cry pulling away from him.
""I admit taking your mortality was selfish but its only cause I don't want to ever lose you Evee. I don't want to watch you grow old and die"" Kieran whispers pulling me into his arms pressing me to his chest.

I'm planning to make Halloween decorations with my kids - what are some craft ideas for spooky creatures, and what precautions should we take when making costumes with these themes?	"Give employees a heads up that your CEO or other executive will be coming in costume to work, and you may be surprised to see just how many people will show up in a range of creative costumes.”
Inappropriate Costume? Employees Encourage HR To Ask Them To Change Attire
While 46% of employees are unaware if their company has a policy around what is or is not appropriate to where to work, especially when it comes to Halloween costumes, half of employees (51%) feel that if someone wears an inappropriate costume, HR should ask that person to change to something more fitting for the workplace. Interestingly, more than one in ten (14%) think HR should send someone home if they are wearing an inappropriate costume at work, and another 29% feel like HR should be focused on more important issues beyond how to handle an inappropriate Halloween costume.
“Over-communicate to employees if your company has a dress code policy around Halloween costumes, and tell them early, before they plan their costume. You don’t want to be tasked with asking someone to change, or worse, asking them to go home,” said Lachapelle.
Employees agree as one employee notes, “HR should set boundaries before the event” and another employee adds “they should set clear expectations on the dress code.”
Most Employees See Seasonal Festivities as Good for Morale & Company Culture
According to the Glassdoor survey, some of the greatest benefits of employer-hosted events like a Halloween party are the opportunities they provide to boost morale (59%), support team building (50%) and build company culture (40%). In addition, 49% of employees also see work events as a chance to connect with employees in different departments and 43% say it helps connect people across various levels. And of course, most employees (61%) say that it gives them a chance to take a break from work.
Bring on the candy! Pass on the Bobbing for Apples
If you are planning to celebrate Halloween at your company, most employees say bring on the decorations (42%) and the free candy (40%). Some other popular Halloween-related activities employees enjoy at work include: Halloween breakfast or lunch (31%), during-business hours party at the office (29%), a costume contest (27%), an afterhours party at the office(18%), and inviting employees’ kids to work to show off their costumes (18%)."	<urn:uuid:ca5e74ef-51b2-4c5a-9818-5c368cfe4b82>	0.0
What funding options exist for agricultural water improvements?	"1 - Watch the two videos on the right of this text on water consumption. Script of the Video 1: ""How much water do we use every day?""
2 - Have a look at https://www.watercalculator.org and calculate your water footprint in liters per day (1 US gallon ~ 3.785 litres )
3 - Read the introduction sheet on water quality
4 - What initiatives could you carry on in your school or workplace to reduce our water footprint? (Make a list of at least 10) What would be the most effective ones?
Part 2: How do we pollute water?
There are many causes for water pollution but two general categories exist: direct and indirect contaminant sources.
Direct sources include effluent outfalls from factories, refineries, waste treatment plants etc... that emit fluids directly into urban water supplies.
Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils/groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rain water. Soils and groundwater contain the residue of human agricultural practices (fertilizers, pesticides, etc..) and improperly disposed of industrial wastes. Atmospheric contaminants are also derived from human practices (such as gaseous emissions from automobiles, factories and even bakeries).
3 - Have a look at these slides about examples of water pollution. We have outlined here different problems associated with a geographical area, put a screenshot on the geographical area, and included some news
4 - Now that you know the different sources of water pollution and some examples, make the examples of your area. This will be very useful to show your students and colleagues how important is water quality. First, look in the news on your area or ask around what ecological problems are important where you live and work. Pick up 3 to 6 problems and make slides following the example (introduction slide with pictures of the area, second slide with map with tags, third slide with news coverage and links).

Part 3: What is eutrophication?
We will now have a look at a more specific problem which is very common. Eutrophication is mainly caused by two nutrients, phosphorus and nitrogen. These are normally brought to aquatic ecosystems as runoff from fertilized agricultural areas, erosion from river banks, river beds, clearing of land (deforestation), or sewage that ends up in aquatic environments."	<urn:uuid:2de571cb-130d-4954-a260-571113129ba3>	0.0
memory security differences dram mram	"BTW, I wouldn't use such a configuration with 1 TB SATA drives: you have a 25% chance of losing data during a rebuild.
Much more reliable is a mirrored configuration. With a 4 drive array mirroring would give you 2 TB of protected capacity - only 50% or your raw capacity. But your data is much safer mirrored.
Array capacity arguments are common among enterprise array vendors - and if you were paying $5/GB raw you might be more interested in the usable capacity too. With 100's of TB in a single array, even small percentage differences start looking big.
The Storage Bits take There's only 1 good strategy for dealing with storage capacity: have more storage than you need. Most enterprises run with 2-3x the capacity they need - mostly for performance reasons - but the extra comes in handy for end-of-quarter capacity spikes or slower than expected capital approval cycles.
Home users should keep 10-20% of their disk unfilled. Windows and Mac OS X are virtual memory operating systems, which means they use disk space to substitute for DRAM when main memory fills up. Without enough spare capacity the virtual memory system can't do its job efficiently and your system slows down.
The good news: disk capacity is cheap and rapidly getting cheaper. 25 years ago disk cost $25,000 per gigabyte. Today it is less than $0.25 per gig. Fill 'er up!

how property improvements affect tax assessment and utility easement rights	"The UK’s self assessment tax regime requires taxpayers to calculate and pay their own tax liability within set deadlines. It can apply to company directors, business partners and the self-employed, but also to anyone in employment who receives untaxed income from other sources - property or the sale of assets, for example.
Given the complexity of calculations, and background of fines and penalties for non-compliance, the support of a qualified professional is invaluable. Handpicked Accountants can quickly recommend fully-qualified accountants with proven track records of reliability and technical know-how.
We have longstanding professional relationships with accountants around the country, so what can our handpicked accountants help you with? Here are some of the self assessment areas they will cover:
A qualified accountant understands the reasons behind the imposition of penalties and fines, and how you should respond. When you need to appeal a tax decision or late filing/payment penalty, having professional support increases your chances of a favourable outcome, and provides insight into how HMRC works.
Missing an important tax deadline can lead to penalties and fines, so it is crucial to stay ahead of your self assessment obligations. With the demands of a busy life, however, these administrative responsibilities can feel particularly burdensome.
Finding a good accountant to help with your self assessment tax return can be difficult without a reliable recommendation. Accountancy costs and services vary greatly, and it is easy to assume the person you hire is competent. When mistakes are made, however, it is you who is held responsible by HMRC, not your accountant, so you need to find someone you can trust.
Fines and late payment penalties are very common, and can trigger unwanted attention from HMRC. Being able to choose a dependable, qualified accountant in your area will help you avoid HMRC sanctions now, and in the future.
When you sell an asset, you may incur a capital gains tax charge on any profit made. Calculating whether you are liable for capital gains tax is complex, however, but doing so accurately is vital to ensure you meet your full tax liability.
Income from property
The different tax rules for property income mean that extra care is needed when completing your tax return if you are a landlord, or own property abroad. A qualified accountant will be aware of any legislative changes in this respect that could affect the figures included in your tax return, or the methods of calculation."	<urn:uuid:dcf3016e-aca3-404f-ad43-c81905eb4964>	0.0
What kind of animals can I use manure from?	"Public Relations & Conflict Management
Farming has changed drastically over the past few decades. The nostalgic idea of small farms dotting the landscape does not represent how many modern farms operate. Today, agriculture is more efficient and productive from the days of old. Farmers can grow more food on fewer acres of land, have increased herd size, and use larger equipment.
More and more suburban neighborhoods are expanding into areas that once were farmland. Sometimes neighborhoods are closely located or adjacent to large farming operations. Many of the “new” suburban residents have little previous exposure to agriculture or farming and they may have misconceptions about what activities occur on farms and in rural areas. Neighbors with no connection or understanding of agricultural practices may have little tolerance for the inconvenience of odors from animal housing facilities or manure applications, slow-moving and over-sized equipment on highways, pesticide applications, flies, noise, and dust.
A good way to help reduce neighbor conflict and improve community relationships is to get to know your neighbor. Establishing a good relationship helps make it easier to discuss a problem if it arises.
For more information about the neighbor conflict and community relations, go to PA Agricultural Ombudsman Website.
There are many agricultural laws in place in Pennsylvania to help regulate and protect farming activities. One of the laws is PA Act 38 or better known as ACRE. This law deals with two issues: (1) conflict management between agricultural operations and local ordinances and (2) Manure and Odor Management.
Odor is the number one complaint against farms. However, the Odor Management regulation only affects farms classified as CAO and CAFO.
CAFO = Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations have more than 1,000 animal equivalent units (AEUs); or are a concentrated animal operation (CAO) with 301 to 1,000 AEUs
CAO = Concentrated Animal Operation has more than 2 AEUs per acre.
AEU – Animal Equivalent Units = 1000 lbs. of live weight of livestock or poultry animals, on an annualized basis.
Many farms do not fall under the new odor management regulations because they are not a CAFO or a CAO, but there are a few things farmers can do to help keep neighbors happy.
- Get to know your neighbors – farmers can tell their neighbors when they plan to spread manure, AND not spread when they know the neighbors have outdoor plans.
- Don’t haul when there are strong winds blowing toward neighbors’ homes."	<urn:uuid:2887e846-06a1-4b59-b72b-5e0ebb392cd7>	0.0
music theory minor m7b5 chords role	"The minor consists of 16 course credits, usually distributed across four classes of four credits each.
· One course in Music Theory
· One course in Music, History, and Cultures
· One course in Music, History, and Cultures OR Sonic Art
· The fourth course may be chosen from any area of study. Alternatively, up to four ensemble or performance credits may be applied toward the minor as your fourth course.
*Note: If you can already read music, know the basic rudiments such as scales, key signatures, intervals, chord construction principles, meter signatures, and basic rhythmic notation, you can take Music Theory I, a more advanced class than Elements of Music. This class is offered every semester.
Frequently asked questions:
Q: When do I declare a music major/minor?
Ideally, a major/minor is declared between the end of your sophomore year and beginning of your junior year. For the major, this means you should be making contact with the department and the DUS during your sophomore year to look at requirements and how the courses would fit into your schedule over your remaining years. Many students choose to take at least one music course during their freshman or sophomore year to get a feel for the department and its curriculum.
Q: Can I have two or more majors/minors?
Yes, you can.
If you intend to have two majors, you must decide on your ""primary major"" and let the department know so it can be entered into Albert correctly.
Q: How do I declare a music major/minor?
· Majors are declared through the Department of Music, by meeting with the DUS to discuss your proposed course plan, and by then informing the department administrator who will enter your major into our system.
· Minors should inform the department administrator, who will officially register you. Minors may register by email. Our department administrator is Natasha Martinez (212-998-8302) email: Natasha.Martinez@nyu.edu
Q: Can I place out of Theory I?
In order to place out of Theory I, you must take a diagnostic exam. This exam can be scheduled by contacting the department Administrator, Natasha Martinez (212-998-8302 or email@example.com). Placing out of Theory I allows you to begin theory with a higher level course, but does not reduce the overall numbers of points required for the major.

What is PPTP protocol and why should I avoid it?	Children with painful torticollis should be subjected to the three-position computed tomographic diagnostic protocol, not only to secure the diagnosis of AARF but also to grade the severity of the condition by virtue of the dynamic motion curve. Closed reduction with traction should be instituted immediately to avoid the serious consequences of chronic AARF. Proper typing and reckoning of the pretreatment delay are requisites for selecting treatment modalities. Recurrent dislocation and incomplete reduction should be treated with posterior C1C2 fusion in the best achievable alignment. Open reduction and halo immobilization to avoid permanent fixation can be tried with select cases.	<urn:uuid:a5c25a25-aabf-4054-8729-7951df3c8566>	0.0

birth problems early pregnancy brain spinal cord chiari malformation spina bifida risk factors differ	"Cerebrovascular neurosurgery: priority of development
Over the past year the MC Erebouni performs an intensive work on the development of a specialized center for the treatment of strokes. This work is conducted with the direct participation and support of specialists in this area, mainly from Canada and the United States. Currently, both worldwide and in the MC Erebouni is running a program of intensive development of endovascular neurosurgery and increase of its role in the prevention and treatment of strokes.
More than a year the endovascular neurosurgery intervention is successfully performed at the MC Erebouni. It should be noted that this area of medicine is a relatively young and started to develop during last 10-15 years. In early June 2015 the Service of Cerebrovascular Neurosurgery was established at the MC Erebouni. The head of the Service was appointed neurosurgeon David Sahakyan.
In early July 2015 Head of the Service of cerebrovascular neurosurgery D. Sahakian and a leading specialist of Atlanta Medical Center and Grady Memorial Hospital (Atlanta, USA), Dr. Mikael Grigorian had jointly perform 6 cases of intervention two of which were unique and had been performed the first time in Armenia at MC Erebouni. The one intervention was case of spinal angiography that is an invasive high-precision diagnostic procedure and another is carotid artery stenting which is the endovascular surgery case.
One of the intervention was carried out in the patient G.A. 1958 y/b, with a suspected spinal arteriovenous malformation or fistula of lumbar spinal cord. In this study, MRI of the spine had show abnormal blood vessels and in conjunction with clinical data was suspected vascular malformation. Diagnostic spinal angiography allowed to examine in detail the vessels feeding the spinal cord with the accuracy and eliminate the presence of any of vascular lesions. This couldn't be achieved by other diagnostic methods.
The second case is stenting of carotid artery in patient G. 1957 y/b. He admitted to the hospital with acute ischemic stroke in the right hemisphere of the brain. According to MR and CT angiography patient has a critical stenosis (99%) at the bifurcation of the internal carotid artery."	<urn:uuid:00e1166b-dc2c-497e-88cc-90830530f60e>	0.0

behavior specialist need know principle making rewards effective change behavior	"Thousands of fishermen on the coast of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida are no longer making money now that the federal government has shut down commercial fishing in a big chunk of Gulf waters.
It's been a little more difficult to explain to the American public how the spill is affecting the environment — or why people should change their habits to help the situation. Only a few birds have been brought in to cleaning centers, and while several dozen turtles and a few dolphins have washed up — none with visible oil — scientists aren't so sure that has anything to do with the spill.
Photos and videos of brown, pudding-like oil in the water near the well far out to sea don't have the same impact that it would if and when such sludge makes it to beaches in big quantities.
It was images of another oil spill — a massive gusher off the coast of Santa Barbara in California in 1969 — that galvanized people to create the first Earth Day in 1970.
Yet after the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989, environmentalists were hoping it would change both public policy, opinion and behavior.
""But it didn't,"" said Rick Steiner, a former University of Alaska marine conservation specialist who has been doing volunteer work in Louisiana for Greenpeace. ""Exxon Valdez did make tanker transport safer. I was hoping it would result in a sustainable energy push in the U.S. but it didn't.""
Steiner thinks this Gulf spill could ""become like Chernobyl or Three Mile Island or Bhopal"" — a moment where people, and politics transform.
""Maybe this is the straw,"" he said. ""Maybe this is the incident that will catalyze both the individual consumer's behavior and the political policy change.""
It could change if more photos and pictures of oiled animals emerge.
""People have a deep connection to the wildlife and the beauty of the wildlife, and when they see those pictures of the birds, the turtles, the things that are harmed, there's a gut emotional reaction,"" said Marylee Orr, executive director of Lower Mississippi Riverkeeper, a Louisiana-based advocacy group.
Advocates acknowledge there is a disconnect between consumer behavior — and the dependence on oil — and what is happening now in the Gulf.
""I would like to see people make a connection to this incident and their everyday behavior,"" said David Ringer, a spokesman for the National Audubon Society."	<urn:uuid:0b24d15d-dddc-43e8-8746-cf6dbe2578b4>	0.0
compare financial aspects long term maintenance google ads standard delivery versus solar panel system	"Google and Amazon are manufacturing their own tablets, Google bought Motorola for smartphones and it is rumored that Amazon is on its way to smartphone production, particularly given recent rumors of acquiring Texas Instruments mobile semiconductor group. Both Google and Amazon have figured out they have to be involved in all three aspects of consumer technology: hardware, software and services. There are legitimate criticisms of Google and Amazon pursuing this strategy in the short term. First, some say (on CNBC) that the strategy is unfocused. Second, the margins are thin to negative on the hardware side. Google’s Motorola unit is losing money, the Google Nexus margin is estimated to be 20-30% and Amazon is estimated to lose money on the manufacture of its Kindle Fires. The contrast to Apple’s overall 40+% gross margins and 50+% iPad margins is stark, of course. However, the long-term justification for Google and Amazon is that this is necessary to stay in the game with Apple.
Google is in very early stages of this strategy. The Motorola acquisition was just competed in May. The short-term implications of the acquisition are negative: bloated employee numbers, cash flow drain, and delays of its new Motorola Droid RAZR phones. But the long-term assets are substantial: 17,000 patents which Google can use to defend against and negotiate with Apple, arguably some of the most popular cellphone designs and legacies in history (StarTAC), and deep-rooted cell phone institutional knowledge. The Google Nexus 7 was just released in June and Google adeptly entered the tablet market in a category that it did not have to go head-to-head against Apple straight out of the gate. Google compares favorably against others well in terms of app store, number of apps, number of app developers.
There are threats to this strategy, but these are not foregone conclusions either. What Google is doing is creating as much real estate as possible for proliferation of its search engine. Through that engine, it can sell ads. There are three threats to this business. First, if people use apps to get the information they want, they will search less. Google is protecting itself here. Google offers Android free to OEMs and to developers, and most apps built on Android are free. Thus, if people use apps rather than search on an Android device, Google can deliver ads through its own apps."	<urn:uuid:329ee88d-dcfb-466b-a3a9-af28a524262c>	0.0
what are advantages of variable speed drives for energy saving how to prevent electrical accidents when installing them	"The Boeing 737 aircraft was designed to be the most fuel-efficient and safest commercial aircraft, with the potential to carry 188 passengers simultaneously.
Like all other aircraft designed and manufactured by Boeing, the 737 also had to go through similar tests and trials to ensure its safety and reliability.
However, in the last two decades, nearly three alarming international cases of the Boeing 737 crashing and resulting in multiple casualties have occurred.
Once the investigation was done, it was revealed that the problem was not with the 737 aircraft. Instead, it was due to the pilots’ lack of knowledge about the aircraft’s newly introduced MCAS system, which compromised their control of the aircraft.
Hence, just like the Boeing 737 aircraft, riding an electric bike without being fully aware of its functions and limitations can put the rider at risk of an accident.
Continue reading to learn about the most prevalent reasons behind common electric bike accidents and crashes.
What Are the Common Factors that Cause Electric Bike Accidents?
Electric bike accidents are not uncommon – sometimes, they occur almost as frequently as accidents involving traditional bikes. Moreover, the injuries caused by an electric bike accident are often reported to be more severe than those of a traditional bike.
However, this information does not conclude that electric bikes lack sufficient safety measures or features to guarantee a safe ride.
As a matter of fact, according to electric bike industry analysts, a majority of these accidents happen due to an incompetent or an underprepared rider.
According to these electric bike analysts, some common reasons that result in electric bike crashes or accidents are as follows:
Riding Without Practice
An electric bike may look similar to a traditional bike; however, riders need to be aware that it is not the same.
While riding a traditional bike simply requires learning how to pedal while balancing the bike’s body, riding an electric bike can be much more complicated.
Unlike a traditional bike, an electric bike comes with an electric battery and a built-in electric motor, both built to offer electrical assistance to complement the rider’s pedaling motion.
Although it may seem simple, riding an electric bike can actually be extremely challenging.
Every time the rider moves up to a higher mode of electrical assistance, controlling the stability of the electric bike during the instant transition caused by the addition of extra energy and increased speed will require time and practice.
Riders who choose to ride the electric bike at high speeds without first going through a proper practice period end up underestimating the energy provided by these bikes."	<urn:uuid:6e223dfa-34bc-44b9-a564-c19accd90112>	0.0

As a food safety researcher, I'm curious about how Salmonella and L. monocytogenes appear in retail food operations and what fermented foods could help combat these pathogens?	"But what makes The Locavore’s Dilemma stand out from other myth-busting books is that it busts the myth primarily by illustrating the positive nature of the system it is advocating: global, capitalist agriculture. For instance, in combating “locavore” accusations that large firms jeopardize food safety because of the alleged potential of mass contamination, the authors make the positive point that one of the very reasons large firms exist is because they can produce much safer food:
the threat of food contamination by natural pathogens is much more serious in small than massive food production and processing operations because smaller operations can never possibly assemble the same quality of equipment and food safety know-how as much larger firms.
This method of combating the negative with the positive is not occasional or accidental–it is pervasive, and a result of the central question the book asks of the locavore movement, which is “why the globalized food supply chain had developed the way it did in the first place” given that it is supposedly so irrational?
This seemingly simple question leads the authors to focus on the fact that the modern agricultural system is the result of the intelligent choices of free individuals–and that the essence of the “locavore” movement is to deny them those choices. The “locavore” criticisms are plausible only because they hold modern agriculture to the standard of infallibility, and then assume, bizarrely, that “locavorism” could solve all of the problems while retaining all the achievements. Desrochers and Shimizu accept neither of these fallacies, admitting frequently that there are problems in modern agriculture (not least due to government interference) but always comparing the full, positive reality of modern agriculture to the full, overwhelmingly negative reality of anti-industrial “locavorism”–which, in its embrace of universal organic, local, and anti-biotechnology farming, would sentence much of the world to death.
Beginning the book with a section entitled, “A Short History of the Global Food Supply Chain,” the authors explain step-by-step, from Ancient Greece to the present, why the food supply became more and more global, more and more technological, more and more corporate. The features of capitalist agriculture that are regarded as bad–its modification of foods, its size, its “impersonal” nature, and dozens of others, are revealed to be benefits."	<urn:uuid:00fb2950-4c31-480c-8bea-5bd31910fa75>	0.0

What should someone look for when choosing between different types of bathtubs for their bathroom?	"How much could you be saving on your insurance? Most lawn care businesses aren’t comparing their insurance policies as often as they should be. Lawn care business insurance has very specific coverage needs, and without the right types of insurance, you could easily be paying too much or not getting the types of coverage that you need. Here are some things you should consider when choosing an insurance agency.
Does the Agency Have Other Lawn Care Companies?
Do they offer custom tailored packages for others in the lawn care business? Or are they simply going to give you generic business insurance? The more specialized an agency is in providing insurance for a lawn care company, the more likely you are to get better service and better coverage.
Different industries require different levels of insurance. As a lawn care company, you have different coverage needs and policy details that impact your business. Insurance companies that do specialize in lawn care may even have specific plans that have been created for your needs and the ability to further fine tune them to match your insurance needs.
When making claims, a company that already deals with lawn care companies will understand your claims better and get you the help that you need. Companies that do not understand the lawn care business may have more questions about the equipment you use, your employees, and your general work operations.
What Additional Services Do They Offer?
Lawn care business insurance isn’t just about the insurance package. After all, auto insurance comes with roadside assistance, and many homeowner’s insurance policies cover emergency hotel stays. Ask your insurance company what added value they offer. These additional services are what may help you decide between similar insurance agencies.
Are There Flexible Billing Options?
As a lawn care business, you’re likely not doing business throughout the year. Instead, you’re probably doing a great deal of seasonal work. You may not want to be paying high premiums during your off time. Seasonal billing options, payment plans, and other flexible billing can help you maintain positive cash flow throughout the year, rather than having to plan for extra expenditures during off seasons.
How Many Agents Will I Work With?
Ideally, you want to have a major point-of-contact with your agency; someone who deeply understands your company and your needs. But you also want to know that there’s someone else to handle your work if that agent becomes ill, takes a vacation, or is simply burdened with other work. Look at how many agents the agency has and ask questions about who you’ll be working directly with."	<urn:uuid:e43491bd-d1b2-4eeb-8ac6-44af9e67efa9>	0.0
zebrafish genetic studies disease applications methods	"There are three main types of tumor:
Benign: These are not cancerous. They either cannot spread or grow, or they do so very slowly. If a doctor removes them, they do not generally return.
Premalignant: In these tumors, the cells are not yet cancerous, but they have the potential to become malignant.
Malignant: Malignant tumors are cancerous. The cells can grow and spread to other parts of the body.
It is not always clear how a tumor will act in the future. Some benign tumors can become premalignant and then malignant. For this reason, it is best to monitor any growth.
Hydatid disease is a parasitic infestation by a tapeworm of the genus Echinococcus. It is not endemic in the United States, but the change in the immigration patterns and the marked increase in transcontinental transportation over the past 4 decades have caused a rise in the profile of this previously unusual disease throughout North America. This has led to the necessity for physicians to be more aware of its clinical features, diagnosis, and management.
Patient education is aimed at teaching the population at risk about the disease, its methods of transmission, its hosts, and the methods of prevention.
Hydatid cyst caused by Echinococcus granulosus, is an important zoonotic infection causing high morbidity and mortality in human. A great many intraspecific variants or strains of Echinococcus granulosus have been described from different intermediate host species or geographical areas. Echiococcus granulosus is known to exist as a biologically distinct sub specific variants or strains which may vary in their infectivity to man. There is clear evidence that within Echiococcus species, genetic heterogeneity is commonly found, and that these intraspecific variations perhaps have important roles in regard epidemiology. A strain of Echinococcus is a group of individuals which differs statistically from other groups of the same species in gene frequencies. Although morphological and biological studies have provided extremely useful information for strain identification, it has to be considered that Despite biological and morphological studies presented very important information on strain detection we have to observe the variability of these features. They might be affected by environmental and host factors and might not show distinct genetic feature."	<urn:uuid:7bfeaf5e-d4e7-41f7-adbf-19baa9dad3d7>	0.0
I'm comparing water conservation methods: bucket car washing versus greywater system costs?	"Not sure whether you can wash cycling gloves or not? This is exactly what I was wondering when mine started smelling odd. After searching around for a bit I’ve found the answer to the question: Can you wash cyclin gloves or not?
Can you wash cycling gloves?
Yes, you can wash cycling gloves! However, cycling gloves are made from a very delicate synthetic fabric. Therefore, you have to be careful, and not just throw them in the washing machine.
Things you will need:
Tide Mild washing detergent
- A washing machine
- A mild detergent or green soap
- (optional) A laundry bag
How to wash your cycling gloves
Here is a quick guide on how to wash cycling gloves, either by hand or in the machine. Follow these steps and you will have clean cycling gloves without damaging them!
Washing time: 15 minutes
Fill a bucket with warm water
Fill a large 10-liter bucket with warm water. The water should be warm, and not too hot. If the water is too hot to leave your hands in, it is probably too hot for your cycling gloves too.
Add detergent and soak your gloves for 10 minutes
Add a generous amount of washing detergent to the bucket with water. Next, soak the gloves in the bucket and leave them in for about 10 minutes. If your cycling gloves are really dirty, you can leave them in a bit longer.
Tip: Did you ever hear of Doctor Bronner’s pure castile soap? In my opinion, it is the best soap to use for cleaning just about anything.
Gently rub the gloves over each other to remove dirt and stains
The best way to remove dirt from your cycling gloves is by rubbing them together. Do not use a brush or anything else, as this might damage the material of your gloves.
Rinse the soap out and repeat if necessary
Rinse all the soap out of your gloves. If there is still dirt or stains on the gloves repeat the above steps until they look clean, and smell nice. When you are satisfied with the result rinse out all the access soap.
Let your cycling gloves hang dry
Finally, when your gloves are clean and smell like roses, it is time to let them dry. The best way to dry your cycling gloves is by hanging them on the clothesline. Make sure you don’t leave them in the sun for too long as this might damage the pigment in the fabric."	<urn:uuid:9d4038f4-3bed-4e04-8e19-c125e51187e5>	0.0

michelangelo sistine chapel painting technique details	"Someone has to get two-thirds of the votes to be elected pope. After we vote, the ballots are burned. If we haven't elected a new pope, they add chemicals as they burn the ballots and the smoke that comes out of the Sistine Chapel is black. When the smoke comes out white, everyone will know there's a new pope. The new pope will then appear on the Vatican balcony. Since nobody knows if the new pope will be a small man, medium or tall man, there's a little room off the Sistine Chapel that has three white cassocks (robes), one in each size. He'll pick the one that fits best, the tailor will make some adjustments and then he'll appear in that window.
Q. Is it possible you could be elected pope?
A. I wouldn't put any money on that. (McCarrick thinks it's unlikely that any American will be elected pope because the cardinals would not want the most powerful country in the world to have one of its citizens as pope.)
Q. What's the biggest challenge facing the new pope?
A. To help bring peace to the world."	<urn:uuid:286c28b6-ad70-4834-a8f9-8ac984d34199>	0.0
solvent vapors vs asbestos exposure health surveillance requirement workplace	"It is supplied through pipe 25 with weak miscella from the left end tray 20 of the lower series of trays. Miscella from sparger 24 is weaker than the miscella from sparger 22. This provides counterflow of solvent and the coarse sand in the first four buckets following the loading station. There are also spargers over the last three buckets of the upper run, these being designated 26, and they are supplied with hot solvent from the evaporator, and makeup solvent, through supply pipes 27 and 27a and pipe 28. Pipe 28 also supplies solvent to all of the spargers, designated as 29, over the buckets in the lower run. The last few buckets, here indicated as three, immediately in advance of the dumping station do not have any spargers above them or receive any solvent from any source so that the liquid contained in their respective charges of sand will have an opportunity to drain completely. It is to be understood that naming groups of buckets and spargers as ""first two"" and ""next two,"" etc. is merely illustrative and that an actual percolator will doubtless have many more buckets and spargers.
The hydrocarbon solvent may be any of those heretofore known for this purpose. Generally, it will be effectively comprised, in part, of an aromatic or cyclic compound. Where cooling water is available for condensing solvent vapors, one suitable solvent comprises a mixture of hexanes with about 20% benzene or cyclohexane. If air cooling is used to condense vapors, a mixture of heptane with about 20% toluene is preferred. A suitable hydrocarbon solvent can also be derived by recycling, from the cracking process to which the product bitumen is conventionally subjected, a distilled fraction boiling in the range of 160°-210° F. Since water is often present, even being native to the sand, in the miscella the maximum extraction temperature is near the boiling point of the azeotropic mixture of hydrocarbons and water.
It is to be understood that the foregoing disclosure is essentially schematic, as there may be more or fewer buckets and more spargers, depending on the plant and the sand and the capacity and speed of travel of the buckets."	<urn:uuid:4e2b45d0-c85f-4910-a6f5-d15633caf13f>	0.0

How do processed foods impact sodium consumption and hearing health?	"Gluten intolerance is also higher with bread made of refined grains. All the white bread is made of highly processed gluten-rich grains.
It is always better to avoid using bread made of highly processed/refined grain as it does not have much nutritional value and at the same time bad for your health.
4. Bread Spikes The Blood Sugar Levels Because Of High Carbs Present In It
The bread that is usually made of highly processed grain flour contains a lot of starch that is easily digestible and enters the bloodstream very quickly.
The sugar and insulin level quickly rises in the blood after consuming the bread.
In most people when the blood sugar level rises rapidly, it will also quickly go down to low sugar levels within an hour or so.
The sudden decrease in the sugar level will result in feelings of hunger and the need to eat too soon again. This happens with all high-carb foods like bread and grains.
Regular elevation of blood sugar levels leads to the development of Type-2 diabetes. This can also cause glycation at the cellular level because of the reaction between sugar and protein.
It is important to avoid high-carb grain-based foods like bread by those affected by diabetes. It is also bad for those concerned about weight loss.
5. Bread Has Only Very Little Amount of Essential Nutrients
The bread made from grain flour mostly contains only carbs and very little amount of nutrients.
Even whole wheat bread does not have enough nutrients as it is generally thought to be.
The worst part of bread is the lack of nutrients and the phytic acid present in it. The phytic acid blocks the absorption of minerals from other foods.
The gluten present in the bread also can damage the intestinal lining that will further decrease the absorption of the nutrients.
The bread-eaters need to depend on other foods like vegetables and fruits to meet the nutrients required by the body.
The protein got from the grains is very insignificant, and the bread-eaters need to look for essential amino acids in other food sources like meat and fish.
Some of the studies say that the fiber found in whole grain bread can lead to faster exhaustion or burning of Vitamin D stores in the body which will result in Vitamin D deficiency.
Another serious drawback of whole wheat bread is its impact on increasing the LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) in the blood.
How To Choose The Good Bread?
The white bread made of refined grain is most harmful to health.
However, whole grain bread is comparatively healthy and good for consumption."	<urn:uuid:608ba097-0e52-45be-9f5c-fd01ca4688e3>	0.0

who pays arbitrator fees dispute settlement	"Interest on Security Deposit
Interest on a security deposit is calculated from the date the tenant pays the deposit to the day before the security deposit is paid back to the tenant. If the deposit is disputed at dispute resolution, the interest is calculated from the date the tenant paid the deposit up until the date the Arbitrator orders its return (usually the date of the hearing).
Interest on a security deposit is calculated as follows. For each one-year period beginning on January 1, the rate will be 4.5% below the prime lending rate of the principal banker to the province on January 1st of that year, compounded annually. There is an online deposit interest calculator at http://www.housing.gov.bc.ca/rtb/WebTools/InterestOnDepositCalculator.html
- NOTE: A tenant has only one year from the time the tenancy ends to supply the landlord with their forwarding address. If the tenant fails to forward the address within the one year limit the landlord may retain the security or pet damage deposit or both.
- NOTE: A landlord does not have to return a deposit within 15 days if the tenant’s right to the return of the deposit (pet or security) has been extinguished for failing to participate in the condition inspection procedures.
- NOTE: A pet damage deposit may be used only for damage caused by a pet to the residential property unless the tenant agrees otherwise.
2. Change of Landlord
Where a security deposit is paid to a landlord, and the property is then subsequently sold, the security deposit can constitute a covenant that runs with the land. After the building is sold to the second landlord, the security deposit obligations carry over to that second person. So, a tenant who had lived in the building all along would be able to claim the return of their security deposit from a new landlord, even though the tenant had originally paid the security deposit to a different person. See s 93 of the RTA regarding covenants that run with the land.
D. Extra Deposits and Non-Refundable Fees
The RTA allows landlords to charge a deposit for additional access devices (so long as it is not a tenant’s only means of entry to one’s building).
Administration fees for returned cheques ($25) or moving between rental units on a single property can only be charged if the tenancy agreement specifically allows for it (RTR, s 7(1)(d)).

diabetic looking for healthy food suggestions what meals good for blood sugar control	"Another type of true believer is the cult follower. Emily Harrison watched her mother, Debra Harrison, die as she and Consegrity® co-founder, Mary A. Lynch, practiced their ""healing energy"" medicine to no avail. As they tried to will away the ""bad energy"" that they believed was causing Debra's illness, Lynch, an M.D. who should know a diabetic when she lives with one, spoon-fed her partner orange juice. Debra Harrison had co-invented Consegrity with Lynch and did not seek medical attention, even though at the time of her death she showed all the signs of diabetes.
Debra's son, David Harrison, writes:
As a Medical School graduate ... Mary [Lynch] should have been able to recognize that things were seriously wrong with my mother's health condition during her final days. My mother was very hungry all of the time and ate several large meals per day, but did not gain weight. Dozens of friends and family stated that she was becoming fatigued and experienced exhaustion very quickly. She had dropped weight from a healthy 150 lbs at 5'4"" to a mere 95 lbs. She was weak and began to look aged as her muscle mass dropped. All of these are the symptoms of a Type 2 diabetic.
The disease was onset and quickly depleted her fat reserves as her body could no longer absorb nutrients from the food she ate. Thus, the unexplained weight loss. As her body ran out of energy sources to burn she began to lose muscle mass and became weak. Because her body was no longer producing insulin, her blood sugar levels were at a dangerous vulnerability as the sugars could no longer be used as energy. For a diabetic of this type, without an insulin shot to utilize it, sugar becomes a deadly poison. Normal blood sugar levels are below 110mg/dl. My mother's blood sugar levels at the time of autopsy were recorded at 945 mg/dl—600 mg/dl over the fatal limit.
How did this happen? Upon entering my mother's empty bedroom 24 hours after her death, my siblings and I noticed 8 empty gallon-sized orange juice containers sitting on the dresser....Upon relating the final moments of my mother's life to my siblings and I, she stated that she had been spoon feeding orange juice to my mother on her death bed.

why is aging process hard to understand for scientists	"For example, the Society of Actuaries’ (SOA’s) STAM exam tests candidates’ knowledge of the Schwartz Information Criterion, which is universally called BIC (for Bayesian Information Criterion) by data scientists; actuaries use sensitivity analysis to build informal confidence intervals around their estimates, while data scientists use bootstrap sampling and cross-validation; actuaries display data in Excel tables, and data scientists rely on visualizations from R, Python or Tableau.
These are “po-tay-to”/“po-tah-to” differences at the end of the day—that is to say, they are insignificant. It is not hard for either profession to flex their vocabulary toward the other profession—the more significant struggle of being familiar with the concepts the vocabulary describes is already accomplished. Yet, finding a common vocabulary is half the challenge of working together. Similarly, it is incumbent upon a technical professional (actuary or data scientist) to learn to communicate with nontechnical stakeholders, and each should work to remove any vocabulary-based barriers to communication—even among fellow data experts.
Each profession also should seek to understand each other’s work more deeply than at the cursory level. Actuaries should recall how refreshing it is to work with a finance partner who understands the complexities of a reserving process, or a sales partner who seeks to better understand the components of a pricing strategy (beyond “how can we get it lower?”).
For example, actuaries can dabble in using the tools used by their data science partners—they don’t need to be an expert, but something as simple as a weekend spent on Kaggle can be a great immersion experience that yields lasting benefits. Dig deeper than the headlines that read “AI Will Replace All Human Cognition By 2025” (OK, that’s just a touch of an exaggeration). Build your own AI model, play with the parameters and study where it is strong and weak (hint: there are multiple Kaggle tutorials that will lead you through just that).
In the same vein, each profession can empathize with the more difficult aspects of their peers’ daily jobs—this type of support can be uniquely helpful in forming strong professional bonds. Both actuaries and data scientists know the feeling of being asked for a complex data analysis on a tight turnaround only to see it go unused."	<urn:uuid:a4e36ff2-bed1-4f00-94cd-d9e88b3bbfd5>	0.0

House Democrats are voting on Wednesday to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, which will hold the president’s trial.
Democrats said they would also send over the new evidence unveiled on Tuesday.
House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, who will lead the prosecution of Mr Trump, said the documents “demonstrate that there is more evidence relevant to the president’s scheme, but they have been concealed”.
What is the new evidence?
The letters, phone records, notes and flash drives were obtained from the Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas, a close associate of Mr Giuliani, who is the US president’s personal lawyer.
They were made available to investigators earlier this week and then sent to the House Judiciary Committee.
The documents show that Ukraine-born Mr Parnas was in regular contact with Mr Giuliani as well as Ukrainian officials, and suggest that Mr Parnas was directly involved in trying to have Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky look into Mr Biden.
One handwritten note from Mr Parnas, who was indicted last year on conspiracy charges, states: “Get Zalensky [sic] to Annouce [sic] that the Biden case will be investigated.”
Also among the new materials is a screenshot of a previously undisclosed letter from Mr Giuliani to Mr Zelensky, in which he asks to arrange a meeting.
The letter from Mr Giuliani describes himself as “personal counsel to President Trump” and states that Mr Trump had “knowledge and consent” of Mr Giuliani’s actions.
The meeting never took place as Mr Giuliani eventually cancelled his May trip to Ukraine.
Was the envoy under surveillance?
Some of the materials also show Mr Parnas and Mr Giuliani discussing the removal of Ms Yovanovitch, the then US ambassador to Ukraine.
Several of the text messages appear to suggest the former US envoy was placed under surveillance."	<urn:uuid:ecca937d-61e3-4c8d-be47-86208350f0a5>	0.0

Hey, I'm learning about farming and wondering which wastes more water - the traditional gravity-flow system used in farming or the aquaponics setup where fish help grow plants?	"Figuring out how to stop nutrients from fertiliser and animal wastes flowing from land into waterways is difficult, as it isn’t a question only of farming intensity, but also soil type, topography, groundcover, and a host of other variables.
Now, a new software tool called LUCI—it’s short for Land Utilisation and Capability Indicator—can help predict run-off and offer solutions.
Developed by Victoria University of Wellington researcher Bethanna Jackson (pictured), LUCI uses a farm’s geographic information system (GIS) data to estimate how much nutrient is entering nearby waterways. It does this by measuring ground cover, animal numbers, fertiliser amounts, slope, and soil types, in resolution up to five metres. Then it calculates the flow of water across and under farmland, and how much rain each part of the land can absorb.
With this data, LUCI can predict how many animals each part of a farm can hold, and how much fertiliser can be applied, before run-off occurs. It also highlights areas where water could be slowed by features such as sediment traps, planting, or changes to tillage. If adopted widely, LUCI could later be used to predict the health of rivers and streams."	<urn:uuid:70a6b1a5-741b-48b5-bd74-db53adcf2c39>	0.0
ancient modern ocean pH changes coral impacts	"In 1898 the capital was moved to present-day Maputo (due to waning trade from the opening of the Suez Canal), and by the 1970’s, a larger port to the north grabbed the remaining trade. It’s now a UNESCO world heritage site occupied by about 14,000 folks.
The Island is also absolutely gorgeous, packed with narrow winding alleys, large ancient decaying buildings with collapsed roofs and walls still being inhabited, and even the occasional Art Deco monster from the final chapters of the island’s prominence. Near the main drag and off on a narrow dirt road we found our hostel — the analogue of the Ruby Backpacker’s we’d stayed in in Nampula. It was a beautiful old building that had been largely restored to decent condition, with a large roof deck with newborn puppies stashed in the corner, a small kitchen and courtyard, and our beds stuffed into a small attic only reachable by rickety wooden ladders. A Honda XR250 with a South African license plate stood in the courtyard which the owner informed us belonged to a woman traveling solo. Once checked in, we hit the beach and took a ride around the island. The water was the familiar bathtub embrace of the Indian Ocean.
On the northern end of the island is the imposing Fortaleza de Sao Sebastao, a Portuguese fort built on the island in 1558. Next to it on an outcropping of rocks is a mosque converted into the Capela de Nossa Senhora Baluarte in 1522, the oldest European building in the Southern Hemisphere. A pair of small thoroughfares loops around the edge of the island, passing narrow ancient streets and alleys and ancient buildings large and small, ranging from total ruin to ostentatiously restored, with the majority falling somewhere in the middle. A small “modern” settlement of tin shacks lies in the south, housing the majority of the residents who don’t live in the old ruined buildings. Large vine-covered trees dot the landscape, frequently growing out of the crumbling coral blocks and foundations of the decaying construction. We took it in from our bikes in awe, drawing plenty of stares from passer-bys.
We relaxed the evening away at the hostel with beer and some serviceable G&T’s mixed with my good friend Lord Gin.
The next day, we set our sights on the sights."	<urn:uuid:0ace28c7-c6cb-4f53-bf68-28453107c063>	0.0

I could go further, and suggest that in the well-known passage: But we must all be able to see that this pedagogical effort presupposes another purely theoretical effort. Let us return to Lenin and thence to Marx. Leaving contradiftion the theoretical solution Engels proposes for the problem of the relation between determination in the last instance — the economic — and those determinations imposed by the superstructures — national traditions and qnd events — it is sufficient to retain from him what should be called the accumulation of effective determinations deriving from the superstructures and from special national and international circumstances on the determination in the last instance by the economic.
This is especially true of the period between and when the majority of his published and unpublished work concerned itself ahd how to read Marx, the definition of Marxist philosophy, and how to understand and apply Marxian concepts.

smart city art citizen engagement examples	"Our Designated fine art collections have principle strengths in the areas of 18th and early 19th century English watercolours, 20th century British Art, particularly the period 1910 to 1950, and a modern sculpture collection more extensive than any other regional gallery in the UK. There are also significant holdings of late 19th century pictures, particularly strong in the area of Victorian narrative painting, and some high quality French paintings, as well as notable examples of contemporary artists’ moving image works from the last decade of the 20th century.
The collections are kept and primarily displayed across three sites, with overall approximately 1300 oil paintings, about 3,000 English watercolours, 2,000 prints and about 1000 sculptures. The primary elements mentioned above at the city-centre located Leeds Art Gallery, as well as notable collections of ‘Old Master’ and British painting dating from before 1840 at Temple Newsam House, while the Gascoigne family paintings and some British Impressionists are shown in the settings of the Edwardian house, Lotherton Hall. In both these latter venues the fine art collections are integral to historic country house displays, and, taken overall, with the Art Gallery which is best described as a gallery of modern and contemporary art, the collections offer visitors and researchers a wide range of engagement through different display styles and strategies.
We have collected Victorian pictures since the Art Gallery opened in 1888. Whilst not comprehensive, our collection holds some remarkable works.
Of particular note are the landscapes, characterised by Sogne Fjord by Adelsteen Normann, Pre-Raphaelite romantic pictures like Waterhouse’s The Lady of Shalott, ‘modern moral subjects’ of everyday life like Holl's The Village Funeral and Tissot’s The Bridesmaid), as well as paintings depicting contemporary events like the war in Afghanistan represented by The Drums of the Fore and Aft by Edward Hale.
We are probably most associated with the Leeds artist John Atkinson Grimshaw, the holdings of whose works has grown to encompass the largest of any public collection.
British and French Painting 1850-1900
We hold a major collection of French art of the Barbizon school, including important works by Courbet and Corot. We are able to demonstrate the changes since the Renaissance, in particular with the development of realism and impressionism."	<urn:uuid:e9da6899-56ee-4f65-9930-bef527fdd061>	0.0
west nile fever ebola symptoms comparison	"Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia experienced the widespread Ebola virus outbreaks last year and a new report has shown that as many as 10,900 extra malaria deaths may have occurred last year due to the disruption of healthcare services in the three countries in west Africa. The interruption of insecticide treated net (ITN) delivery resulted in an additional 3,900 deaths.
These new estimates of malaria deaths that would have been prevented by health systems when functioning normally, suggest that the west African Ebola outbreak could have resulted in comparable number of malaria deaths as those due to Ebola itself (8981 by Feb 1, 2015). However, the findings also indicate that implementing mass drug administration (MDA) and ITN campaigns to coincide with the 2015 malaria transmission season in May/June could largely mitigate the impact of Ebola on malaria.
Lead author Dr Patrick Walker explained that the ongoing Ebola epidemic in parts of west Africa largely overwhelmed already fragile healthcare systems in 2014 making adequate care for malaria impossible and threatening to jeopardise progress made in malaria control and elimination over the past decade.
The worst case scenario, assuming that the Ebola epidemic led to a complete end to malaria care, shows that the number of untreated malaria cases could have increased by 45% (1.6 million) in Guinea, 88% (1.3 million) in Sierra Leone, and 140% (0.52 million) in Liberia in 2014. Around half of these cases are expected to occur in children under the age of 5. What is more, lapses in ITN delivery could have led to another 0.84 million malaria cases in 2014.
The new estimates also suggest that an absence of clinic and hospital care would have increased malaria deaths by 35% (5600 deaths) in Guinea, 50% (3900) in Sierra Leone, and 62% (1500) in Liberia in 2014. Moreover, the authors estimate that in 2015, pre-Ebola levels of healthcare provision would be responsible for preventing 15600 malaria deaths highlighting the urgent need to support health system recovery.
Their projections suggest that emergency MDA campaigns can be a highly effective method to reduce further malaria mortality and the burden of non-Ebola fever cases upon still fragile health systems in 2015."	<urn:uuid:d82b8c34-9c1c-41de-b616-5e5901800e93>	0.0

sensory processing disorder misophonia differences triggers	"These studies indicate that depersonalization is a symptom that involves differences in sensory perception and subjective experiences.
HISTORICAL. Depersonalization disorder may be a reflection of changes in people's sense of self or personal identity within Western cultures since the eighteenth century. Historians of psychiatry have noted that whereas some mental disorders, such as depression, have been reported since the beginnings of Western medicine, no instances of the dissociative disorders were recorded before the 1780s. It seems that changes in social institutions and the structure of the family since the mid-eighteenth century may have produced a psychological structure in Westerners that makes individuals increasingly vulnerable to self disorders—as they are now called. Experiences of the unreality of one's body or one's self, such as those that characterize depersonalization disorder, presuppose a certain notion of how the self is presumed to feel. The emphasis on individualism and detachment from one's family is a mark of adult maturity in contemporary Western societies that appears to be a contributing factor to the frequency of dissociative symptoms and disorders.
The symptoms of depersonalization disorder have been described earlier. Although DSM-IV-TR does not specify a list of primary symptoms of depersonalization, British clinicians generally consider the triad of emotional numbing, changes in visual perception, and altered experience of one's body to be important core symptoms of depersonalization disorder.
DSM-IV-TR notes that patients with depersonalization disorder frequently score high on measurements of hypnotizability.
The lifetime prevalence of depersonalization disorder in the general population is unknown, possibly because many people are made anxious by episodes of depersonalization and afraid to discuss them with a primary care physician. One survey done by the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) indicates that about half of the adults in the U.S. have had one or two brief episodes of depersonalization in their lifetimes, usually resulting from severe stress. About a third of people exposed to life-threatening dangers develop brief periods of depersonalization, as do 40% of psychiatric inpatients.
Depersonalization disorder is diagnosed about twice as often in women as in men. It is not known, however, whether this sex ratio indicates that women are at greater risk for the disorder or if they are more likely to seek help for its symptoms, or both."	<urn:uuid:9b50a990-3039-47d0-beac-9ad7519d6a8c>	0.0

insurance health protection rules business owners different workplace settings	"Nevada residents would be wise to educate themselves on the life insurance situation in their state. When making a big purchase like a life insurance policy, it’s smart to take your time and do a little research. Like the rest of the country, Nevada’s life insurance industry is regulated on the state level, which means that it’s insurance laws will be different than anywhere else in the country.
Nevada Life Insurance Rules And Regulations
Life insurance in the state of Nevada is regulated by the Nevada Revised Statutes (Title 57). This code of law was devised with the protection of the consumer in mind, so it would be in your best interest to familiarize yourself with the contents of this piece of legislation. We know that most of our visitors do not want to study legal documents for hours, so we’ve gone ahead and highlighted the key points of the law code below:
Free Look Period In Nevada
Nevada life insurers give new policyholders a 10 day “free look” period. This 10 day time frame essentially allows for an insurance policy “trial run” in which the policyholder can back-out for a full refund if they are not satisfied. Life insurance policies can be lengthy pieces of text. During these 10 days, the consumer is allowed to further review the document to see if there is anything they do not like about it.
Protection Of Personal Information In Nevada
There are laws in Nevada that require life insurance companies to take measures in protecting your privacy. In Nevada, your insurer is required to release all personal information they have about you at any time, per your request. They are also not allowed to share your personal information (such as medical records) with other agencies.
No Timely Payment Of Claims Laws
Most states have laws that require insurance companies to make timely payment of claims once proof of death is received. Nevada, however, does not. The state allows for each insurer to set forth its own policy in regards to claim payments. Check with your insurance provider to learn more about their company policy.
For more information on your life insurance rights as a consumer in the state of Nevada, please contact:

In the unfortunate event that your life insurance company goes out of business, your benefits will still be covered by the Nevada Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association."	<urn:uuid:33ef3d52-d78f-43b5-973c-5cde88d3b72a>	0.0

What are the benefits of vitamin D fortification in foods, and how does its absorption differ for bariatric surgery patients?	"In 1994 Congress passed the DSHEA which allowed manufacturers more leeway on advertising without running afoul of the FDA. Starting in 1998 the FDA began REQUIRING fortification of products with folic acid.
In the case of aspirin, despite clinical studies showing aspirin effect in preventing deaths if given during and after heart attacks, the FDA prevented manufactures from advertising this claim. Later the FDA relented allowing the claim for heart attack patients however it is not an allowable advertising claim to use aspirin as a preventative measure for those at high risk for a first heart attack.
Vitamin C is a dietary supplement and as such it does not go through FDA approvals. The studies on Vitamin C are extensive and the diseases it may have an impact on are many. While Vitamin C is undergoing clinical trials in relation to its treatment use in cancer patients not all of the benefits, or off-label usage if you’ll allow the term, will undergo clinical trials. Since Vitamin C falls under dietary supplementation unless a pharmaceutical company were able to isolate and synthesize the compound in Vitamn C that helps lessen cold duration, for example, then the pharmaceutical company would be unable to patent the drug. No patent = no money as any company would then be able to make the same claim with their Vitamin C.
While the FDA certainly has its place it is not an infallible agency. By tying essential oils up in FDA approvals many would lose out on the benefits of said oils. There is also the matter of choosing what ‘claim’ to apply for FDA approval on. Looking at Lavendula angustifolia and the many studies on its myriad of uses: which would YOU pick for the FDA approval process and which uses would you relegate to ‘off-label’ usage?
What is Off-label Usage?
Amoxicillin is a drug and its on-label usage is the treatment of respiratory tract infections yet it is commonly used in the treatment of stomach ulcers and mentioned in medical guides for use in such a manner. Since it is no longer under patent it will most likely never gain on-label usage for stomach ulcers. From this example by narrowing Lavendula angustifolia approval to one usage for the ease of passing through the approval process you would effectively limit its use and prescription in medical settings. By turning a natural product, that has been used safely for thousands of years, into one that requires a prescription you would limit who might have access to said product."	<urn:uuid:4b81ab9a-d4ed-49b2-9d07-83fff5a0a33b>	0.0

services available schizophrenia treatment social support medication therapy residential care	"Despite clear and convincing evidence that treatment with medication is an efficacious treatment for OUD, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s estimates demonstrate that less than 12% of people with this disease receive care. Stigma plays a large role in this. Stigma in our community, unfortunately, leads to delays in seeking treatment; decreased referrals to treatment; and reduces the likelihood of receiving adequate care.
Stigma also causes great social and economic burdens. Stigma has contributed to the scarcity of adequate treatment centers that provide short- and long-term care; lack of insurance coverage and reimbursement; lack of trained providers; macro- and micro-aggression towards those with OUD, their families and even their treatment providers.
I believe some ways we as a community can help increase the ratio of recovery from OUD are by: understanding and accepting that those with OUD are not the blame for their illness and neither are they in control of it; using non-stigmatizing language; recognizing that OUD is a lifelong illness that needs the chronic disease model of management; and encouraging, supporting and lobbying for the use of treatment with medication for this devastating disease.
Here in West Virginia, treatment with medication is available. Treatment with medication works.
Retired; Chairperson, Pocahontas County Prevention Coalition
I, unfortunately, came to know all about stigma when my two daughters developed opiate use disorder (OUD) and both died of an overdose.
Stigma keeps problems and awareness in the shadows. People don’t want to talk about substance use disorder (SUD) thinking they are the only ones who have been affected by this affliction. Without knowledge and discussion, stigma delays diagnosis and treatment.
Stigma can prevent people from welcoming harm reduction programs, treatment facilities, and sober living houses into their communities. Stigma can even affect the method of treatment of the disease and undermine the data supporting treatment with medication, which has proven to be the standard of care.
According to the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration, medication with treatment reduces heroin use and overdose deaths. It increases social functioning and retention in treatment while decreasing crime, and infectious diseases. And yet many in the public, rehabilitation facilities, and medical professionals believe treatment with medication is just exchanging one addiction for another. Those with knowledge about treatment with medication must speak up and educate everyone about its benefits.
The stigma surrounding treatment with medication stems from the belief that addiction is a moral failing, and it can be overcome with will power."	<urn:uuid:5754e6ea-76eb-49f0-9fc1-c5bc124ca718>	0.0

What are the essential tools needed for basic electronic construction, and how should you properly maintain the soldering iron tip during use?	"We are living in the 21st century, when we were supposed to live in skyscrapers and have spaceships instead of regular cars, flying being the norm, yet here we are, stuck in paperwork and bureaucracy. Today, even more than ever, we can see this due to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic upon the entire world. The construction industry is now forced to shut down instead of working remotely by having the tools and solutions that could save their companies. A construction ERP solution can help you battle against Coronavirus. We are here to help you out and give you some tips and tricks on the construction ERP implementation Process: Dos and Don’ts.
- Devotion and Dedication from the Project Sponsor – Any software you choose will fail unless the Project Sponsor takes the ownership of the process and makes sure that the company and each team will commit all resources necessary to make the solution work!
- Selecting “The Champion” & “The Admin” – You need to make sure you select the right people to be involved in the process. People that care about the company, the process, and the way that your business is run. They need to understand thoroughly what is needed from the solution. They need to be able to dedicate their time and energy in working with the Implementation Team during the Implementation Process – they will make sure the construction management software UK based is fitted to your company’s needs and wants! Their involvement is key in getting the construction ERP solution properly implemented!
- Properly Document ALL your processes! – Many construction management software UK based focus on the Implementation Process as much time as possible. Setting up things from scratch, making sure they are fitted correctly to the client’s needs is crucial. Archdesk, a good fit for General Contractor management needs, likes to focus on the processes inside your company. There is no “one size fits all” solution, and during the Implementation Process, their team looks at the types of projects and what processes attach themselves to these projects. The software of your choice should allow you to model the solution after you, not force itself and how it works over your processes (over your way of working).
- Communicate, Communicate, COMMUNICATE! It is crucial that during the ERP Implementation Process the flow of information should be constantly monitored. The Implementation Team and the Change Champion need to stay close and constantly keep the information flowing."	<urn:uuid:4ce70494-f9d4-4de7-a70f-8cf7e1499be3>	0.0

100% surveillance coverage for the home of the Bahrain Grand Prix
As the Home of Motor sports in the Middle East, the Bahrain International Circuit hosts drag racing, V8 supercar racing, the GP2 series and the annual Grand Prix. At a build cost of $150 million the facility has set new standards in motor sport and the Grand Prix is one of only a handful around the world to be played out to a capacity crowd. To monitor crowd safety at the race track Bahrain International Circuit selected an advanced CCTV solution based on Controlware technology that would be scalable to support future expansion and deliver tangible benefits.
Working with LSS Technologies, a leading integration partner, Controlware provided a comprehensive IP CCTV surveillance solution based around the Cware management platform to monitor spectators, traffic and car parks at the track. The 20-channel IP CCTV solution was installed in time for the Grand Prix and is set to expand as security requirements evolve.
“Having worked together on similar projects we have a great working relationship with Controlware and knew that they had a strong technical solution that would deliver the high quality video transmission and flexible management platform that our customer insisted upon,” said Abdul Rahim Shaikh from LSS Technologies.
The race track benefits from a state-of-the-art IP CCTV solution that provides 100% coverage. At the heart of the solution is Cware, which provides operational benefits and helps improve surveillance. As an open platform, support for multi-vendor hardware provides increased flexibility to integrate leading products from different manufacturers. The track operators also benefit from high-quality video and killer applications that make surveillance easier. ICN (Image Content Navigation) enables operators to navigate between cameras in the video, taking video interaction to the next level while 2.5D mapping technology, provides advanced site orientation and improves navigation. This enables the operators at the track to benefit from a reliable, easy to use solution that is able to integrate with existing systems and is scalable to support long-term growth of cameras and storage requirements.

An assessment of the construct validity of the ASCOT measure of social care-related quality of life with older people
Health and Quality of Life Outcomes volume 10, Article number: 21 (2012)
The adult social care outcomes toolkit (ASCOT) includes a preference-weighted measure of social care-related quality of life for use in economic evaluations. ASCOT has eight attributes: personal cleanliness and comfort, food and drink, control over daily life, personal safety, accommodation cleanliness and comfort, social participation and involvement, occupation and dignity. This paper aims to demonstrate the construct validity of the ASCOT attributes.
A survey of older people receiving publicly-funded home care services was conducted by face-to-face interview in several sites across England. Additional data on variables hypothesised to be related and unrelated to each of the attributes were also collected. Relationships between these variables and the attributes were analysed through chi-squared tests and analysis of variance, as appropriate, to test the construct validity of each attribute.
301 people were interviewed and approximately 10% of responses were given by a proxy respondent. Results suggest that each attribute captured the extent to which respondents exercised choice in how their outcomes were met. There was also evidence for the validity of the control over daily life, occupation, personal cleanliness and comfort, personal safety, accommodation cleanliness and comfort, and social participation and involvement attributes. There was less evidence regarding the validity of the food and drink and dignity attributes, but this may be a consequence of problems finding good data against which to validate these attributes, as well as problems with the distribution of the food and drink item.
This study provides some evidence for the construct validity of the ASCOT attributes and therefore support for ASCOT's use in economic evaluation. It also demonstrated the feasibility of its use among older people, although the need for proxy respondents in some situations suggests that developing a version that is suitable for proxies would be a useful future direction for this work. Validation of the instrument on a sample of younger social care users would also be useful.
The term social care is used frequently in the UK to describe a range of long-term care activities, including providing help with personal hygiene, dressing and feeding, as well as help with shopping, keeping active and socialising. Social care services include personal assistance, nursing and residential care homes, and day centres and are usually provided in response to needs arising from physical or sensory impairments, learning difficulties and mental health problems including dementia ."	<urn:uuid:a49fdad7-a54c-4ffc-90b2-12f74f155835>	0.0
geothermal energy benefits environment effects mining	"Project Case Study
Developing a mining tax regulatory framework for South Sudan’s Ministry of Energy and Mining
Effects of civil war on the mining community
The effects of civil war and political uncertainty in South Sudan had been causing difficulty in the country’s mining sector.
Government institutions at various levels had been issuing mining titles to private companies regardless of whether they had the legal authority to do so, which eventually led to the announcement of a moratorium on mining licenses in 2010.
To help regulate the industry, in 2011 we were asked to work with the Ministry of Energy and Mining in South Sudan to draft a Mining Act and make recommendations for the mining tax framework and related regulations. The project aimed to foster economic and social development by facilitating private sector investment and development of the mining industry, in order to generate jobs and revenue and also offer marketable skills to local people.
The project also focused on building institutional capacity to enable transparent and effective sector governance in the Ministry.
We successfully drafted the 2012 Mining Act, which would end the moratorium and allow licenses to be granted to foreign firms to explore South Sudan’s mineral deposits and will the way for foreign investment.
To protect the interests of the citizens of South Sudan, we proposed a fiscal framework for the minerals sector, and the Mining Act allows the government an optional equity stake of up to 15% in large scale mining operations. It also officially establishes the Ministry of Petroleum and Mining as the regulator for the sector and establishes a mining cadastre to issue and manage mining licenses. These measures will provide the government a managed revenue stream, contributing significantly to GDP and help the country move away from its over-dependence on oil revenue which before the blocking of the pipeline provided 98% of GDP."	<urn:uuid:c169a77f-3d9d-4d48-ac48-da0892a5046b>	0.0
human role ai military decision making systems	"recommendations without being able to assess them. This challenge can be mitigated by reverse engineering the recommendations made by AI.
2. You Use Vendor-provided AI Without Understanding Their Models
Some companies decide to buy or license AI from others rather than building the technology in house. As with any strategic decision, there’s a downside to this approach. You can’t trust the vendor’s suggestions that AI will be beneficial blindly. You need to ask tough questions about how the systems protect your data and what systems AI tools can access. Overcome this challenge by asking your vendors to explain their assumptions about data and machine learning.
3. You Don’t Test AI Security Independently
When you use an AI or machine learning tool, you need to entrust a significant amount of data to it. To trust the system, it must be tested from a cybersecurity perspective. For example, consider whether the system can be compromised by SQL injection or other hacking techniques. If a hacker can compromise the algorithm or data in an AI system, the quality of your company’s decision making will suffer.
4. Your Organization Lacks AI Cybersecurity Skills
To carry out AI cybersecurity tests and evaluations, you need skilled staff. Unfortunately, there are relatively few cyber professionals who are competent in security and AI. Fortunately, this mistake can be overcome with a talent development program. Offer your cybersecurity professionals the opportunity to earn certificates, attend conferences, and use other resources to increase their AI knowledge.
5. You Avoid Using AI Completely for Security Reasons
Based on the previous mistakes, you might assume that avoiding AI and machine learning completely is a smart move. That might’ve been an option a decade ago, but AI and machine learning are now part of every tool you use at work. Attempting to minimize AI risk by ignoring this technology trend will only expose your organization to greater risk. It’s better to seek proactive solutions that leverage AI. For instance, you can use security chatbots such as Apollo to make security more convenient for your staff.
6. You Expect too Much Transformation from AI
Going into an AI implementation with unreasonable expectations will cause security and productivity problems. Resist the urge to apply AI to every business problem in the organization. Such a broad implementation would be very difficult to monitor from a security point of view. Instead, take the low-risk approach: apply AI for one area at a time, such as automating routine security administration tasks, and then build from there."	<urn:uuid:75c20593-63bc-45e3-ac40-3a0820eb44e8>	0.0

substitute replace 1 tablespoon lemon zest	"Our #30daysofhoney roundup continues. Today, it’s all about Chef Blake Malatesta and his Roasted Chicken With Lemon Honey and Thyme. While many of you know Blake from his time spent at 50 Ocean in Delray Beach, he has recently been MIA – or, rather, at M.I.A.
M.I.A., which stands for Modern. American. Authentic., is the name of Malatesta’s new restaurant. Scheduled to open in November, this west Delray Beach spot will feature local food with a global flair. Think housemade pastas, Firestone pizzas, small and large plates, local beer, and over 30 wines, available by the glass.
While the chef is “missing in action,” you can still enjoy his cuisine in the comfort of your own kitchen. Here is Chef Blake Malatesta’s recipe for Roasted Chicken With Lemon Honey and Thyme.
Roasted Chicken With Lemon Honey and Thyme
4 tablespoons unsalted butter (divided; 2 softened, 2 chilled)
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh thyme
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 3.5-lb. chicken, rinsed and patted dry
1 head garlic, left unpeeled and halved horizontally
1/4 cup orange blossom honey
1 tablespoon olive oil
Special equipment: kitchen string and an instant-read thermometer
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat to 425° F.
Finely grate enough zest from 1 lemon to measure 1 tablespoon, then squeeze enough juice from same lemon to measure 2 tablespoons.
Stir together the butter, thyme, zest, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the pepper.
Put chicken, breast side up, in a small roasting pan. Starting from neck cavity, work your fingers gently between skin and flesh of breast to loosen skin all the way to thighs, without tearing. Put one-fourth of tarragon butter under skin of each breast, then rub skin from outside to spread evenly.
Starting from large cavity, loosen skin on both sides of cavity with a paring knife (to provide access to thighs), then work your fingers gently between skin and flesh of thighs and drumsticks.
Divide remaining tarragon butter among thighs and drumsticks, rubbing skin from outside to spread evenly."	<urn:uuid:144590bc-bef0-4b1d-b9db-b2f303864560>	0.0
reef tourism business environmental effects	"It might include things like the climate, local attractions, and common customs.
What are the 3 classification of tourism organization?
The types of travel and tourism organisations can be broadly separated into one of three categories: private, public and voluntary.
What is an example of international tourism?
International tourism is tourism that crosses national borders. … The World Tourism Organization defines tourists as people “traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes”.
What is tourism and regional development?
Tourism is a sector with positive effects on regional development. It is an important development tool that provides economic, social and political development in the region. … Thus, development in a region of tourism in rural or underdeveloped areas, can help eliminate economic imbalances.
What do u mean by regional development?
Regional development. Regional development is the provision of aid and other assistance to regions which are less economically developed. Regional development may be domestic or international in nature.
What are the various factors influencing the growth of tourism in a region?
The growth of tourism
- leisure time – there has been an increase in the amount of paid leave days.
- greater awareness – television travel programems have raised people’s expectations.
- increased life expectancy – there are a greater number of older people travelling.
- greater affluence – people have more spending money."	<urn:uuid:d7559860-951e-45d9-baa0-be75d9111ae8>	0.0
Why is early treatment important for autism?	"California Confirms Rise in Autism Cases
I know the rising rates of autism has been denied by many in the medical profession, explaining that increased diagnosis is what has accounted for the rise. A 273% increase. Want my opinion? We’re doing something to our kids that are predisposing them to this condition. Multiple vaccinations, food allergies, poor prenatal/pregnancy care? I personally believe that not every child will get autism from the MMR vaccine (which is the vaccine most blamed for the onset), but that a certain percentage of children have the genes that make them susceptible probably when combined with other factors such as a poor diet. This is NOT from the genes…it is from the way we are treating the genes. It takes hundreds of thousands of years for true genetic variation to occur, and this is occurring in decades.
California researchers say that the state is seeing a sharp rise in the number of autistic children–but said they were mystified about what caused the unprecedented spread of the developmental disorder.The report by researchers at the University of California-Davis’ M.I.N.D. Institute released on Thursday showed a 273% increase in the number of autistic children entering various state treatment centers between 1987 and 1998.The findings also indicate that the increase could not be accounted for by other factors such as the misclassification of cases or changing diagnostic criteria.”Speculation about the increase in autism in California has led some to try to explain it away as a statistical issue or with other factors that artificially inflated the numbers,” lead investigator Dr. Robert Byrd said.”Instead, we found that autism is on the rise in the state and we still do not know why. The results of this study are, without a doubt, sobering,” he added.Medical experts say it is difficult to compare California’s autism numbers with other states’ because tracking systems are different. But they say anecdotal evidence indicates rates may also be rising elsewhere in the country.The California study, which was launched this year in an effort to determine why observed cases were increasing, looked at a statewide sample of 684 children from both English- and Spanish-speaking families.But the research did little to solve the mystery.Dr."	<urn:uuid:1dd57434-5bf8-4b8a-a7e7-0d4fc4f9445b>	0.0
What kinds of hearing problems can affect the inner ear, and how much more likely are people to develop memory issues because of them?	"Feel Good Story of the Day: Marvel Creates a Superhero For Hearing Disabled Boy
Introducing 'Blue Ear'
Marvel Comics has a lifelong fan in one young boy. The comic book maker received a letter from the distressed mother of a hearing impaired boy, and they responded with a brand new superhero just for him.
Anthony Smith has been a comic book fan for most of the four years he's been on this planet, and, against all odds, the hearing impaired child recently got to have a superhero of his very own. Here's how it happened ...
Anthony, who is deaf in one ear and suffers hearing loss in the other, woke up one morning and refused to wear his hearing aid because there are no superheroes who wear them.
Distraught, Anthony's mother wrote a letter to Marvel asking about characters who have hearing problems, Marvel responded with a picture of Hawkeye (played by Jeremy Renner in the recent Avengers movie).
But Marvel went even further. They sent Anthony a drawing of a brand new superhero named Blue Ear -- named after what Anthony and his mother called his hearing aid -- who wears the same device Anthony does.
Anthony has since embraced his difference and is beginning to see that real heroes can be powerful and unique, all at the same time.
Needless to say, Marvel earns serious brownie points from us for this (much like Mattel did with its bald Barbie campaign earlier this year). Hope Blue Ear can continue making a difference with children everywhere.
Check out the video below of to see Anthony and his mother tell the heartwarming story themselves."	<urn:uuid:48c0625f-fa88-4b85-b143-b08186983085>	0.0
I'm trying to start my first garden and want to be eco-friendly. What are the most important things to know about making a natural garden, and what problems should I watch out for to keep my plants healthy?	"It is visited by many schools and tourists. Outside the garden are also many interesting plants naturally growing there.
 Passo dello Stelvio natural area, 2760m
This is a protected area, where a large amount of plants grow wildly.
On this high pass there are not many plants, but on the lower parts, also in the forest, many common plants easily grow.
These plants also grow on the other mountains, but what is interesting here is that on that mountain a lot of yellow Aconitum grow. This was the first time I saw this plant in the west. There are also a lot of Black aconitum, which is more widely spread in Europe and is poisonous. The place is very touristy and beautiful, but for the study of Tibetan medicine plants, it is not so useful.
 Dolomites mountains
The area is incredibly beautiful. Lots of common plants grow there, but not many medicinal plants. On the other hand, I saw two very important ingredients used in Tibetan medicine: Conodopsis and Calcite stones. Codonopsis is especially used for rheumatism, arthritis and also nerves problems.
It was the first time I saw the Calcite stone in the West. So the place doesn’t have many Tibetan medicinal plants, but some of them are very important.
Of course we couldn’t cover all the Italian Alps, but these are probably the main places.
 Innsbruck University botanical garden, 574m
This university botanical garden has a large collection of plants, more than 900 species, from different countries and continents. It is a very good place for the people interested in the study of the Tibetan medicinal plants, and who want to learn easily how to identify them.
 Alpin flower garden, Kitzbuehl, 1880m
This garden is about one hour driving distance from Innsbruck city. It is located on the top of the mountain, and can be reached by cable car. It is a tourist place. The scenery is very beautiful. There is an herbs garden, but there is no special collection but we saw some species that we hadn’t see elsewhere.
 Patscherkofel, 2248m
After taking a very long cable car from the city, it is possible to climb up the mountain, but there is nothing special there."	<urn:uuid:b2077434-d062-4fed-b827-6b36a553a07c>	0.0
setting up first fish tank how many times day feed fish remove uneaten food after feeding	"The problem often experienced with koi is that it is only on the gills and so is not observed except for symptoms of flashing like so many other parasite infestations. Salt at .6% along with an increase in temperatures usually is enough to eradicate them. Either FMG or FMC are effective treatments made even more effective with an increase in temperature. Ich also is known to become quite active during barometric swings. The Florida fish farmers nearly always treat their fish for Ich following a strong thunderstorm.
Salt may be used with ProformC, FMG or FMC with absolutely no adverse reaction. If you don't believe that, talk to a fish pathologist.
Hexamita Specific Treatment
Make your own Hexamita specific medicated food using Metronidazole:
Using a medium size bowl, mix 1/2 teaspoon of knox Gelatin in 1/2 cup of warm water. Then add 1/2 teaspoon of Metronidazole powder. Mix thoroughly. Then add one pound koi food pellets into the mixing bowl. Mix this concoction thoroughly. Pour this mixture onto waxpaper and let completely air dry. Overnight drying should be sufficient. Store your new medicated food in air tight bags and refrigerate.
Feed this medicated food ONLY(no other foods) for 10 days. Feed generously, but make sure the food is gone in about five minutes or less.
Note: If you wish you can make a fecal squash for microscopy both before and after the feeding protocol to insure success. Otherwise, regard this as a shotgun type treatment and observe the fecal waste of the fish for brown (normal) segments.
Metronidazole powder is available at FTFFA.
Dactylogyrus - gill flukes---------------100X:
This parasite as well as skin flukes rarely kills koi, but don't be fooled. Infestations of the gills by either gill or skin flukes can cause irrepairable damage. It is a known carrier of aeomonas and pseudmonas bacteria which it injects while feeding on the gills and body of the fish, and if left untreated that WILL kill koi.
It is easily seen at minimum magnification and is distinctive due to it's eye spots and it's stretching and contracting of the body while feeding. Gill flukes are egglayers. Colder water means a longer gestation period."	<urn:uuid:d0b9840a-912c-4793-90bb-d9d93730fb3a>	0.0
I'm trying to understand how research is done in libraries. What methods do researchers use to study library topics, and how do they ensure they don't expose private user data?	"I wrote a tutorial on free monads (Titled: ""Why free monads matter"") because back when I was trying to understand free monads I could not find any beginner-friendly explanation. Everything on this subject was written for a target audience of mathematicians and would motivate their use cases using mathematical examples.
I wanted to explain the motivation behind free monads in terms that a programmer would understand and my post explains the topic in terms of creating a syntax tree and interpreting that syntax tree. Understanding free monads will greatly improve your understanding for how to build monadic domain-specific languages within Haskell. Also, many people comment that understanding free monads greatly improves their mental model for Haskell
IO as well.
Haskell coroutine libraries (like
machines) have what appear to be impenetrable implementations ... until you read Mario Blazevic's article on coroutines in issue 19 of The Monad Reader (Titled: Coroutine Pipelines"").
In that article he introduces the
Coroutine type (which is now more commonly known as the free monad transformer) which unifies every coroutine implementation into a single pattern. Once you understand his article, you will understand the internals of coroutine libraries and you will be able to easily write a streaming library of your own.
Lens tutorials are the new monad tutorials, and the one mistake that all lens tutorials make is that none of them clearly explain how lenses work. The only post that ever got this right was the original post by Twan van Laarhoven that first introduced the modern formulation of lenses (Titled: ""CPS Functional references""). The problem is that post is incredibly hard to find even through a dedicated Google search for lens tutorials because the title is obscure and the post only has a single mention of the word ""lens"". I actually had trouble finding this post even by browsing his blog archive because I didn't recognize the title.
Honorable mention: The
lens-family-core library is the only lens library that actually hews closely to Twan's original presentation, so I highly recommend that you study its source code to further improve your understanding.
I still can't find a good blog post on Church encoding, so I will not link to anything. However, once you learn how to Church encode a data type you will suddenly see this pattern everywhere.
Equally important, many high-performance Haskell libraries (like
attoparsec) use Church encoding for efficiency reasons and understanding Church encoding will allow you to understand their internal implementations."	<urn:uuid:260f1034-ccf9-4945-9166-cc56f1f2a7c1>	0.0
I work with digital archives and I'd like to understand the relationship between public domain status and digital copies - how does copyright expiration affect works entering the public domain, and what special considerations apply to digital reproductions of these works?	"The issue: identity. This is quickly explained with an Internet search and a bit of copy and paste. Finished! And again: digital. Finished!
What I find a lot more interesting is to ask what can I do with an identity! If you have an identity, you can authenticate yourself for a communication partner: the receiving partner trusts this authentication and is also willing to give information if a fundamental premise is fulfilled: namely that he/she, i.e. the giver, authorises this as well.
What I find to be the most interesting thing is that this triad of “identity, authentication und authorisation” is to be heard everywhere. However, it suddenly becomes silent as soon as a cross-domain solution is wanted.
Does a sensor in “Company A’s” domain eagerly provide information to the monitoring software in “Company B’s” domain? Is the monitoring software allowed to do that, and if so, on what conditions? How did the software find the sensor anyway? Simple questions that arise with every diagram and chart the willing reader attempts to fully understand.
In the “Annual 2013/2014, digital infrastructures, working group 2 of the national IT summit (AG2)” on page 295, I discovered that: “… for efficient operations a suitable device identity management component is required, …” and that there is obviously need for action.
At this year’s (2017) IoT World in Barcelona I gazed in awe at numerous interesting and propitious solutions! In the discussions however I always got the same answer: i.e. that the question of cross-domain “digital identity” has still not got anywhere near to getting a reliable answer.
And visiting the working group 3 “Security of networked systems“ at Platform Industry 4.0 (Berlin, October 2017) demonstrated that the “digital identity” in a sub-working group i4.0/IDS will definitely initiate some discussions.
If you replace the “device” quote in the annual with “connector”, then we are getting as close as possible to Industrial Data Space and “digital identity” becomes tangible (and the triad becomes audible again): which IDS Consumer Connector is allowed to elicit data from this IDS Provider Connector? And if the Provider Connector imparts data – which data and on which basis does it formulate the usage control which obliges the Consumer Connector to proceed with the data in an authorised way?"	<urn:uuid:edc94110-6268-495e-a01f-b914a0c0026b>	0.0
mosquito virus symptoms effects	"The symptoms include bloody vomit and diarrhoea, shock, collapse and, in up to 90% of cases, death; unfortunately, the virus can survive for many months in the environment and can be carried into the house on clothing, shoes etc., so even a house cat isn’t safe. Vaccination is highly effective, and has been proven to last a minimum of 3 years in the vast majority of cats. You can learn more about this disease here. Vaccine protection lasts for at least 3 years once the primary course is complete.
? Feline Herpesvirus, FHV; one of the causes of Cat Flu, which although only very rarely fatal, is persistent – once infected, a cat with herpesvirus is likely to remain infected for life, with symptoms recurring and the virus being spread at times of stress. Fortunately, the virus only survives a few days in the environment, so passive spreading of infection is less common. Read more here.
? Feline Calicivirus, FCV, the other major cause of Cat Flu, this virus generally causes slightly less severe symptoms than herpes, but can also lead to stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth), arthritis (joint inflammation), and can occasionally mutate to cause life-threatening disease (Virulent Systemic FCV). Infected cats may shed the virus for weeks or even months before clearing it, but do not usually become persistently infected as with FHV. Like the FHV vaccine, full protection from the vaccine lasts a year, and there is some protection for another 2 years after that.
? Feline Leukaemia Virus, FeLV; this virus is quite closely related to FIV (“Cat AIDS”), but as well as destroying the immune system, can also trigger cancers – typically leukaemia or lymphoma. Vaccine protection only lasts for about a year to most vaccine strains.
There are also vaccines available against Rabies (only needed if you intend to take your cat abroad), and Chlamydophila (“Feline Chlamydia”, another cause of Cat Flu, only usually necessary in catteries or breeding colonies).
What are the risks?
There is no such thing as a medicine without side effects – if a drug cannot produce side effects, it probably means it isn’t actually doing anything."	<urn:uuid:c133339d-c11e-47e3-98d0-62132c8caa96>	0.0
Between prescription medications and natural remedies like omega 3's and healthy foods, which tends to work better for treating pain and inflammation in the long term?	"USING TEA BAGS FOR STYES
Tea bags are small porous bags that contain tea leaves and can be used to help heal or relieve a stye or inflamed swelling on the edge of the eyelid.
If you are one of the many sufferers of eye styes, you, like many, are searching for relief. One of the forms of relief that can be done via a home remedy is the use of tea bags. It has been argued that some home remedies don’t work, or that they are just “old wive’s tales,” and don’t have the credibility to be of any use. However, many home remedies, such as tea bag stye treatments can be effective if applied properly. They may not cure the problem completely, but they may offer a number of advantages for eye stye sufferers, such as:
- Tea is an herb that contains antibacterial elements known as tannin. Tannin is a natural anti-inflammatory agent, which reduces swelling and pain in the affected area. The reduction of inflammation is one of the primary goals of eye stye treatments, since the inflammation causes much of the pain and irritation. It’s like the old idea that if you cannot cure the problem, make the patient feel better. And it works. Also, since it harbors a strong antibacterial element, it may be able to keep the area more clean and free of irritants that can make the condition worse.
- The warmth from the heated tea bag provides temporary relief from the irritation and itchy feeling people get from styes. They may also rest their eyes more when using a tea bag stye pack and forget about their stye for awhile. It is best to rest your eyes as much as possible when suffering from an eye stye, so you will reduce the additional irritation of red, itchy eyes due to tiredness.
- Another reason tea bag stye cures are good is that they produce steam. Steam helps release the eye pus pockets that are retaining the bad bacteria and may serve to soften the skin surrounding the eye and let it drain naturally at a faster rate.
- Tea bag stye remedies are inexpensive. If you choose to use this method exclusively, you will not have to go to the doctor and pay doctor’s fees, money for antibacterial medications, and such like. Home remedies are very cheap and easy for anyone to do at home and that is one of the reasons people sometimes choose to use it."	<urn:uuid:243ddf31-7c4f-43cc-b507-fc6886e46b57>	0.0
international export procedures hazardous goods regulations workplace safety precautions	"Hong Kong’s busy international port has a zero-percent import duty rate for all trade, giving exporters an extra incentive to ship their goods to Hong Kong as opposed to mainland ports. If taken further, thanks to CEPA, a zero-percent import tariff structure exists for mainland China if goods are first imported by Hong Kong and then re-exported into the mainland. For agricultural goods, it is nearly a carte-blanche for suppliers to bypass tariffs and safeguard profit margins by using Hong Kong as a go-between. Goods such as frozen beef, which have a general import tariff rate of 25% (of the value) in mainland China, have a zero-percent rate in and out of Hong Kong. A virtual free-trade backdoor was unlocked when CEPA was adopted on top of Hong Kong’s free trade port.
For international suppliers of agricultural goods, Hong Kong and China not only have separate import tariff structures, but also separate quality control and food security administrations. In mainland China, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) is responsible for import-export food safety, while in Hong Kong its Centre of Food Safety regulates food trade for the SAR. Consequently, asymmetrical import regulations can appear, with mainland China sometimes banning certain agricultural goods while Hong Kong chooses to keep the proverbial door open for imports. In the case of frozen beef, as of mid-2015, mainland China had maintained its 2000 ban on US beef over bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or ‘mad cow’) concerns. Meanwhile, Hong Kong has continued imports of US beef unabated. It is unknown exactly how much US beef is re-exported into mainland China. In general, there is limited information on the type and amount of agricultural commodities that are shipped to Hong Kong, but ultimately destined for dinner tables in the mainland. This short brief will attempt to shed light on which agricultural good are imported by Hong Kong and re-exported to China.
In order to determine which agricultural goods are being re-exported to mainland China, ChinaAg compared the proportion of imports (from the world excluding China) to exports (only to mainland China). Hong Kongese production of agricultural goods must be taken into consideration as well since these goods would likely be exported alongside foreign-produced imports. However, with the exception of a few processed food products, Hong Kong is not a major a producer of agricultural goods and only grows small amounts of fresh commodities."	<urn:uuid:13c81dd5-9d60-41aa-8cb4-6f89d94ea4b5>	0.0

I'm interested in how wars affect the economy. Throughout history, how have expensive wars contributed to inflation compared to how modern monetary policy affects inflation rates?	"Paper identifies monetary uncertainty
The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) latest paper on term premium captures the investors’ expectations of future central bank policy, inflation and growth shocks.
The Working Paper, “Term Premium Spillover from the US to Indian Markets”, also highlights risk-neutral rate which reflects expectations of future short-term rates.
The Paper, authored by Archana Dilip, was placed on RBI website on 30 Dec 2019.
The paper estimates and analyses term premium in India and makes an assessment of interconnectedness and transmission of shocks from the US term structure of sovereign bond yields to that of India.
The term premium is estimated by decomposing the yield into two components – and term premium which captures the investors’ expectations of future central bank policy, inflation and growth shocks, explained RBI in a press release.
The paper identifies inflation volatility and monetary policy uncertainty as the two important factors influencing term premium in India.
Further, empirical findings indicate that the spillovers between the US treasury yields and government security yields in India have increased during the sample period from April 2009 to April 2019.
The paper finds stronger spillover with increased financial integration and volatile bond markets.
The paper concludes that for the long-term yields, the term premium channel is a stronger transmission channel as compared with the risk-neutral rates channel. fiinews.com"	<urn:uuid:59a5c60b-2a29-48c1-b9c1-2c3f08fc0225>	0.0
Is arts recognized as a core academic subject?	"""As a professional discipline, homeland security is complex, dynamic, and interdisciplinary and not given to facile definition. As an academic discipline, homeland security is relatively new and growing, and its workforce aging. As such, there is an acknowledged need to develop academic homeland security programs to try and meet anticipated workforce needs. However, the lack of an accreditation system or a set of available published outcomes (or standards) have complicated efforts towards homeland security program development. At present, determining which courses to teach and which outcomes in each course to pursue must be left to anecdotal conversations, reviews of the scant textbooks available, and idiosyncratic experience and judgment. Consequently, as homeland security programs have proliferated throughout the country even a cursory review of these programs on the Center for Homeland Defense and Security (CHDS) website reveals an uneven and inconsistent set of core student outcomes. Using practicing professionals in a variety of homeland security areas as subject matter experts, this study was designed to elucidate a set of core academic areas and student learning outcomes that could characterize the intellectual underpinnings of the discipline and the outcomes on which an undergraduate degree in homeland security could be based.""

elderly care options assistance types	"The program reaches out to residents with unaltered cats, educates them on the need to spay/neuter and, if necessary, assists them physically and financially whenever possible. This single program is responsible for saving the lives of thousands of felines yet to be born.
Cat Lovers Campaign: Spay/Neuter Assistance for Cat Caretakers
PACS continually builds on our “Cat Lovers Campaign” spay/neuter program which began with physical and financial assistance to the elderly population. This goal was later expanded to include residents of apartment complexes. Because of the transient nature of many of these individuals, it is imperative that they be educated in the rewards and responsibilities of pet ownership. This program now also targets multiple cat caretakers, especially those individuals residing in rural areas where large numbers of stray and feral cats reside. Many of the residents are elderly, disabled, and/or low income who wish to do the right thing by these cats, but just can’t afford to spay/neuter the three or more cats that they are feeding. Counseling and assisting these individuals will have an enormous effect on the numbers of neglected and abandoned unaltered cats. Left unchecked, these cats will produce litter after litter of unwanted pets relegated to a miserable existence in a harsh environment. This cycle of cruelty will continue until such time as they are picked up and killed in a shelter, hit and killed by a car, injured and killed by other animals or deranged human, or are killed by disease or malnutrition. Whatever the scenario, the outcome is the same for the cat; it is KILLED! The average life of a cat on the streets is two years, lived the hard way. Our “Cat Lovers Campaign: Spay/Neuter Assistance for Cat Caretakers ” seeks to interrupt this cycle of cruelty at its roots before the tragedy unfolds.
Cat Lovers Campaign: Stray and Feral Cat Assistance
Our “Stray and Feral Cat Assistance” certainly epitomizes our philosophy of prevention, not destruction. This program assists cat caretakers who have assumed responsibility for at least three feral or stray cats, either with a history of having litters or in danger of getting pregnant. Paws and Claws Society has always held the belief that individuals willing to care for these animals should receive assistance with the cost of the expensive spay/neuter surgeries."	<urn:uuid:1207dbe7-ac5c-49ce-ba05-a82a9d86b936>	0.0

How do you know if there's no correlation between variables?	"Every single election I know of in United States will off
at least the predictions have it coming. No one predicted that Trump will win white. And I think I think what's interesting is we still lean up against correlation and big data. So I fundamentally believe that it starts with the art first was this Small data, then you can use science whether science is big data, mining of data, artificial intelligence, or if it is, neuroscience and, and stuff in the science world.
Eric: And what do you think obviously, there's a big part of the industry, especially in the advertising world that is driven by and really worships creativity, coming up with something that they would probably argue that data doesn't tell you. Maybe it gives you the insight and the direction, but it doesn't give you the idea. And then of course, you can weave into here the whole conversation about AI and how it's never going to replace creative directors and all that stuff. But you know, the other thing, of course, well known quote, of if I ask people what I wanted the Henry Ford thing, it would have been a faster horse, not a car. Well, how do you think about the space for and the need for creativity? And I'd say intuition. And just the other thing, I'd say on that, and you're obviously much more educated on this than I, but I feel like that's still data. We just don't understand how it works yet.
Martin: But how do you think about the role of creativity within the science led marketing world that you kind of see and push? Well, you said it yourself, intuition. Intuition are defined as an accumulation of experiences throughout your entire life, you can call that knowledge. You can connect the dots, you don't know how you're doing it, but you know what the outcome is. So that may be art. In the end of the day. I'm a huge fan of creativity and always believed in creativity. But let's just be frank, Eric creativity is dead. And advertising agency selling creativity is dead, there's very few of them left. Because they become prostitutes, they have sold out through data would quite often do a blurry data, for the sake of pleasing a client so they could wash their hands internally and justify direction without being fired."	<urn:uuid:16332594-81dc-4b90-a978-daadbe73397d>	0.0

preferred structures habitat fish locations	"Monarch butterfly habitat focus of new environmental program
Starting in 2018, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) will target financial assistance through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) Monarch Habitat Initiative for implementing designated practices that create or improve monarch habitat. Payment is provided after the practices have been installed and determined to meet NRCS standards.
Some of these practices include conservation cover, field borders, prescribed burning and brush management. Eligible landowners may be able to receive financial assistance to offset the cost of establishing or improving pollinator and monarch habitat, according to Michigan Farm Bureau Ag Ecology Manager, Laura Campbell.
“One way landowners and farmers can help is by participating in one of the pollinator protection programs offered by FSA under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), and a new offering in Michigan from NRCS under the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP),” Campbell explained. “MFB along with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Michigan State University, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Farm Service Agency (FSA), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other partners are promoting the development of a habitat management plan for the Monarch butterfly.”
This habitat management plan, in coordination with other state plans, will be submitted to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to demonstrate that landowners, state and federal agencies, scientists and universities are committed to taking the actions needed to help the Monarch recover without the need for listing under the Endangered Species Act and all the regulation that comes with it.
Local NRCS offices will accept applications for conservation financial assistance on a continuous basis. Applications may be submitted at local field offices or online using the Conservation Client Gateway. On designated dates, applications are ranked and selected for funding."	<urn:uuid:12b54b80-b4d3-4140-aa70-bc02ebc45e7b>	0.0

I love haunted places! Which hotels are known for ghost sightings?	"Toddler died after crawling into Irish ghost estate
CHILD’S DEATH DRAWS ATTENTION TO IRELAND’S ‘GHOST’ TRACTS
The story concerns 2-year-old Liam Keogh, who crawled through a gap in a mesh fence at an unfinished ""ghost"" estate in Athlone, was found face down in a puddle near an open drain, and died, apparently of drowning. (The boy died last week; American newspapers are now reporting on reaction to the event. See some scary photos of the ghost estate in the Irish Independent.)
The ghost estates are housing developments started during Ireland's Celtic Tiger economic boom, then left unfinished when the money went away. Wikipedia, citing reports in the Guardian and in the BBC, says there are at least 600 ghost estates and 300,000 empty homes in Ireland. Here's what the Independent said about the estate where Liam was found:
I'm haunted by, er, some haunting scenes set at vacant properties, I think in Alan Glynn's Bloodland, and saddened by this latest grim crime-fiction metaphor come to life.

Citation: Jong, L. 2006. Viscoelastic properties of rubber composites reinforced by soy spent flakes and carbon black co-filler [abstract]. Proceedings of American Chemical Society National Meeting. 94:459-460. Technical Abstract: In rubber reinforcement, the filler network structure has a significant effect on rubber modulus. Different preparation methods may produce different filler network structures, and lead to different reinforcement effects. In this study, more insight on the reinforcement mechanism is obtained by comparing different preparation methods - casting versus freeze-drying. Soy spent flakes (SSF) used in this study is mostly a soy carbohydrate fraction in soybeans. Carbon black (CB) is also included as a comparison. SSF and CB are used as fillers to make reinforced rubber composites. Comparison between freeze-drying and the casting method indicates that a filler network related structure in the composites, prepared by the freeze-drying method, is more elastic than that of the casting method, and can be explained by the model of polymer mediated filler network. The shifting of G” maximum in SSF and CB composites with an increased filler concentration indicates CB has a greater extent of filler-rubber interaction. The stress softening effect of SSF and CB composites again indicates the composites prepared by the freeze-drying method have better recovery behavior than that by the casting method due to their more elastic filler network structure. This study shows that the composites prepared by the freeze-drying method have a more elastic filler network structure, which can be explained by the increasing frequency of a thin polymer layer between filler aggregates."	<urn:uuid:107b2539-caa6-4c76-a2f5-36bace52c17c>	0.0
accessing medical care via telehealth virtual consultations benefits and impact on healthcare providers during covid19 pandemic	"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Tom Carper (D-DE) recently introduced the Medical Supply Chain Resiliency Act, bipartisan legislation that would provide the United States with greater ability to engage in trade negotiations in order to ensure that critical medical goods and services are delivered safely, swiftly, and efficiently to patients in the United States and around the world.
The COVID-19 pandemic presented significant challenges for supply chains around the world, which disproportionately hampered health care providers’ access to medical devices, treatments, and equipment at a time when these products were desperately needed. By expanding U.S. engagement with our allies across the globe, this legislation would combat shortages of medical products and supplies by strengthening supply chain resiliency and safeguarding against future health crises.
“The pandemic caused major disruptions across nearly all supply chains, and these challenges disproportionately impacted our health care supply chain – from medical devices to life-saving medicines to personal protective equipment (PPE). Now is the time to address the long-standing shortcomings in our supply chains that were highlighted over the pandemic, repair the damage done, and ensure America is adequately prepared for future national security and public health threats,” said Senator Tillis. “This legislation will result in a more resilient, strategic supply chain to safeguard American’s access to critically-important medical products.”
“The pandemic wreaked havoc on our communities and caused our medical supply chains to break down during the worst possible time. We must prevent these same horrible losses from happening again by working together to fix our broken supply chains and better prepare for future public health emergencies,” said Senator Carper. “This bipartisan legislation will help mitigate trade challenges by authorizing the President to work more closely with our global partners and take action to ensure that health care providers and patients can access life-saving medical products when they need them the most.”
What health care and business industry leaders are saying about the Medical Supply Chain Resiliency Act:
Michael J. Alkire, Premier, Inc. President and CEO:
“Premier applauds Senators Tom Carper (D-DE) and Thom Tillis (R-NC) for their bipartisan leadership to heed the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and help strengthen our nation’s healthcare supply chain. A more sustainable, resilient, and secure healthcare supply chain requires greater diversification, including investment in domestic manufacturing coupled with strategic trade relationships to encourage nearshoring."	<urn:uuid:86f4b608-e16b-41f7-ae7b-d44820fe076f>	0.0

body temperature comparison hypothermia frostbite symptoms	"Fever Treatment : Fever is caused due to an increase in the body temperature above the normal range. The normal Temperature for the fever is from 99.5 and 100.9 F. The increase of the temperature causes the muscle contractions and the patient who is suffering from fever feels very cold. When the set-point or the normal range of the body temperature gest to normal a person feels relaxed and may begin to sweat.
- The person may feel weak when fever temperature increases.
- The person may get depressed
- The common problem is body pains
- He/she may suffer from a serve headache.
- The person may feel very bitter in the mouth
- The person may also get chills due to high temperature.
- Some people may even undergo symptoms like vomiting, loose motions, which causes dehydration.
- Most common symptoms are dizziness, tiredness, and weakness.
- When the person goes weaker and tried, it is time to consult the doctor.
- Due to the body pains, the person goes through insomnia.
- Infectious diseases: examples like fever cause through malaria virus, Ebola, gastroenteritis, dengue etc.
- Skin inflammations also cause fever, example: abscess, boils etc.
- Tissue destruction, fracture also causes fever.
- Reaction to any incompatible blood product also causes fever.
- Any changes in the whole body cause fever.
- Above are those common types of diagnosis that cause fever.
Management of Fever
- Most of the time without untreated only the person get cured of the fever.
- Fever rarely raises from the normal range to the dangerous level. Sometimes if lower fever untreated it may lead to dangerous which causes the damage to the brain. This damage to the brain generally does not occur until it reaches 42 C. It is very rare to reach up to 105F
Home Remedies & Medications
- Medication for lower fever is called as antipyretics.
- Antipyretics like ibuprofen effects in reducing fever in children.
- Aspirin can also be used but not recommended for children and young adults from 16-19 years people.
- Can also use PARACETAMOL and IBUPROFEN at the same to reduce fever. If it is not so clear that the combination drugs can be given to the children and younger adults

I'm managing a team and want to know - what are the benefits of having employees who fit well with the company culture, and what are some effective ways to keep them from leaving?	"Four steps to a sound electrical safety culture
Training makes a difference, and so does communication.
It’s a new engineer’s first day on the job and a piece of the electrical system is not performing the way it should be. The manager asks the engineer to troubleshoot the issue, unaware the engineer has had no safety training. Afraid to appear they don’t know what they are doing, the engineer approaches the equipment without any protective gear to see what’s happening. We all know this could result in a serious injury, maybe even death — and this is more common in electrical facilities than one may think.
Despite the common understanding of prioritizing safety, electrical safety is still a workplace issue. Hazardous energy and lockout/tagout (LOTO) is fifth among safety violations cited by OSHA in 2018. However, restrictions on time and resources may lead employees to be less diligent as they should be in mitigating safety risks throughout their work day. And when safety is put second, electrical facilities can take big hits with respect to their employees and to profitability.
To keep electrical facilities running smoothly and efficiently, it is critical that facility managers and staff create a strong culture of safety for employees at every level. Proper training, top to bottom messaging, compliance checks and more can guarantee that employees are aware of how to work safely.
Facility staff needs to establish a solid culture that will keep everyone safe. Here are four ways to accomplish this:
1. Establishing safety at EVERY level. Although engineers and electricians are the people who work most closely with electrical systems, everyone from top to bottom should be well versed in the proper safety protocols. Managers should encourage their staff to take their time when completing tasks to ensure they are adhering to the proper safety procedures.
Enforcing this and practicing it themselves will prove they are as committed to best safety practices as they want their employees to be. The single most important thing an employer can do is to empower employees to do the right thing, even if it means stopping work in an unsafe situation. Having the power to make these decisions can have positive impacts on their own and their coworkers’ safety.
