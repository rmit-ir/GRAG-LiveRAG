This program accommodates participants with or without previous experience.\nYou can learn from the beginning excavation techniques and methodology. During the excavation you will find archaeological remains from the classical period including Roman pottery, amphorae, glass, etc. that you will learn how to identify in the laboratory.\nThe comprehensive experience that you will gain in this course will help you to decide if you want to pursue archaeology in university or as a profession\nPrevious knowledge or experience in archaeology or computer systems is not required.\nField School life & language\nThe fieldwork focuses on Classical archaeology, and specifically on Roman archaeology.\nOn a normal working day at the Field School, students wake up in the morning and have breakfast at the students' residence before the staff members pick them up with the vans. Then we take a ride to the North of the island to get to the beautiful port of Sanitja, where the Roman city of Sanisera is located. Once there, students devote 4 hours to fieldwork, where they learn proper excavation techniques to improve their skills, while they dig in different buildings in an area of the city very close to the sea.\nDuring fieldwork students recover the materials located in the rooms and other contexts, including tons of Roman ceramics such as amphorae and fine wares, glass wares, faunal remains and metal pieces such as adornments, tools and coins.\nAfter fieldwork we go to the Sanisera Archaeology Institute, where students have a sandwich break to get some energy back! Our center holds the laboratories, where students work with the Roman pottery found on site. The main aim is to wash, label, classify and prepare the materials' inventories. Also students are given lectures on Roman pottery typologies (both for amphorae and fine wares), History of the site, archaeological practice and methodology and Classical History in the Western Mediterranean.\nDigging at the Roman city of Sanisera is a first-hand experience to get an insight on the Classical world in a Mediterranean island.\nIt runs 7 hours a day, and is divided between excavation, lab work, exercises and lectures. For every seven course days, there are two days off."}
{"question":"what techniques show surface chemical structure defects","doc_text":"Tooth bleaching is recommended for patients with all of their adult teeth who would like for their teeth to look whiter. Bleaching is accomplished by applying a chemical gel to the tooth surface to lighten it. This gel is held in place by a custom bleaching tray that can be worn at home. Numerous studies have shown this procedure to be safe and effective but it is not always equally effective for all teeth. Results are often individualized and some teeth show no noticeable change.\nA common side effect of bleaching is sensitivity to hot and\/or cold stimuli. If this occurs, we recommend discontinuing bleaching. The teeth should return to normal after a few days. If you are interested in bleaching, we will be happy to discuss this with you.\nMicroabrasion is a conservative treatment option for discolored tooth enamel that is not responsive to polishing or bleaching. This process involves applying a chemical agent to the tooth surface followed by polishing with a mildly abrasive paste to remove a microscopic layer of enamel. This \"in office\" procedure is often recommended for teeth with significant color defects. Many of these color defects are uneven which can make it difficult to obtain completely uniform tooth color. However, the color change is often dramatic and beneficial. When recommending microabrasion we will do our best to predict the level of success that is attainable.\nNightguards for Grinding\nOf all the conversations that take place in our office, tooth grinding is near the top of the list. It is very common in children although not necessarily desirable. It is usually harmless and in many cases will be out grown. Grinding usually occurs during sleep and can be very annoying to others. Children rarely experience pain and are not aware they are grinding. The causes can range from a growing face with jaws that are changing alignment, irregular bites, to children with higher levels of intensity, creativity or anxiety. Grinding may be very transient or may occur on a regular basis. We sometimes see a wearing down of enamel on baby teeth but this is rarely detrimental. If a child has had extensive fillings this \"wearing down\" can affect the longterm success of the filings. Night guards are not usually tolerated by young children and are often unsuccessful. We are certainly monitoring for any obvious signs of wear on the permanent teeth and will be more aggressive in our treatment recommendations."}

{"question":"How did early fossil discoveries in the 1800s change our understanding of prehistoric life and what role did fossils from the Jurassic period play in developing new theories about Earth's history?","doc_text":"In the mid- to Late Carboniferous, as Australia drifted from equatorial latitudes to polar latitudes, the lycopods waned and were replaced by seed-ferns, and the Nothorhacopteris-Fedekurtzia-Botrychiopis complex.\nMost of the modern Australian fauna had its origin in the Cretaceous. From pollen records from the Late Cretaceous it is proposed that the flora of the Cretaceous either evolved within the Austro-Antarctic region or entered Australia from Antarctica. Angiosperms evolved in the northern Gondwana\/southern Laurasia during the Early Creteaceous and radiated worldwide, prominent members of this early angiosperm flora were the Nothofagus.\nFossils found at Lightning Ridge, New South Wales suggest that 110 million years ago Australia supported a number of different monotremes, but did not support any marsupials. Marsupials appear to have evolved during the Cretaceous in the contemporary northern hemisphere, to judge from a 100 million-year-old marsupial fossil, Kokopellia, found in the badlands of Utah. Marsupials would have then have spread to South America and Gondwana. The first evidence of marsupials in Australia comes from the Tertiary, and was found at a 55 million-year-old fossil site at Murgon, near Kingaroy in southern Queensland. The Murgon fossil site has yielded a range of marsupial fossils, many with strong South American connections \u2014 unsurprising since the two continents were both a part of Gondwana. At Murgon evidence of a placental mammal, a Condylarth (Tingamarra porterorum), was discovered. Placental mammals were also found in North America and South America at this time. This find suggests that placental mammals did coexist with marsupials lived in Australia in the early Tertiary, although only marsupials persisted.\nAustralia separated from Gondwana 99 Ma, and initially remained warm and humid with rainforest vegetation. Inland Australia had systems of rivers and lakes with abundant wildlife. Fossil birds, platypus, frogs and snakes are present from this period. From 30 Ma there was a period of global cooling and from 15 Ma the Antarctic ice sheet formed."}

In his keynote at the Summit, Lee again referenced the development of the cybersecurity industry through national defense projects. However he indicated that these efforts would henceforth be led by Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), as that agency begins to take a leading role in developing Taiwan\u2019s cybersecurity industry as a whole (Liberty Times, March 14).\nThe basis for MOEA\u2019s leading role in a cyber autonomy policy stems from the National Cyber Security Program of Taiwan for 2017 to 2020, which was released in November of 2017 by the Executive Yuan\u2019s National Information and Communication Security Taskforce, or NICST (NICST, November 14, 2017).

One of its main related initiatives is the propagation of security standards for mobile applications developed in Taiwan. Though MOEA\u2019s Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) had supported these efforts since at least 2015, the standards gained traction in 2017 when IDB began promoting these standards for adoption by Taiwan\u2019s government agencies and banks (MOEA, February 22).\nIDB has similarly promulgated domestic IoT security standards for internet-connected video surveillance systems. In addition, it plans to open up the testing of domestic cybersecurity industry products on critical infrastructures and other selected industries in 2018, to allow domestic companies to \u201cgain product experience and build skills\u201d (MOEA, February 22)."}

Feline Herpesvirus, FHV; one of the causes of Cat Flu, which although only very rarely fatal, is persistent \u2013 once infected, a cat with herpesvirus is likely to remain infected for life, with symptoms recurring and the virus being spread at times of stress. Fortunately, the virus only survives a few days in the environment, so passive spreading of infection is less common. Read more here.\n? Feline Calicivirus, FCV, the other major cause of Cat Flu, this virus generally causes slightly less severe symptoms than herpes, but can also lead to stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth), arthritis (joint inflammation), and can occasionally mutate to cause life-threatening disease (Virulent Systemic FCV). Infected cats may shed the virus for weeks or even months before clearing it, but do not usually become persistently infected as with FHV.

Read on to learn about a career as a college counselor.\nIs College Counseling For Me?\nCollege counseling falls into two categories: counseling high school students who are looking to enter college, and counseling college students as they progress through college and seek to enter the working world. Both fields require you to be an excellent listener, to exhibit good interpersonal skills and to possess a broad base of knowledge concerning a variety of college and employment options.\nIn order to enter this type of work, you will most likely need to have a graduate degree in counseling. Most high school guidance counselors have an undergraduate degree related to education or educational psychology, and some states require counselors to have some teaching experience. Counselors working in higher education settings need to meet similar educational requirements. Along with a graduate degree, you may need to be licensed or certified in order to work in counseling, which will require passing exams and completing continuing education requirements. Licensing requirements may be different depending upon whether you work directly for a school or work independently or as part of a practice.\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the field of counseling in educational settings was expected to grow by 12% between 2012 and 2022. The majority of counselors work in educational or vocational practices, and the median annual salary for school and career counselors in 2012 was $53,610. According to the BLS, elementary and secondary school counselors had a median annual wage of $60,560, university, junior college and professional school counselors earned a median annual wage of $46,630. Job prospects were expected to remain positive in this field as school enrollments increase.\nHow Can I Work As A College Counselor?\nRequirements for working in this field will vary depending on where you want to work and the type of counseling you would like to do. College counselors in both high schools and colleges work with people to help them discern appropriate collegiate and employment paths. This requires meeting with students and helping them to develop approaches for college or job searches. Sometimes this may take the form of teaching students how to interview for jobs and fill out job or college applications.\nCounseling at both the high school and college levels will also involve assessing personality traits that may help or disqualify students from a field of study or job."}

Emerald Ash Borer (EAB), an invasive beetle that kills all species of ash trees, has been confirmed in Story County. With EAB confirmed in nearby communities, the future for ash trees looks uncertain. To be prepared for the arrival and to slow the spread of this destructive insect, the City of Ames is pursuing an Emerald Ash Borer Response Plan that balances public safety with a commitment to replanting trees on public land.\nThere are more than 2,300 public ash trees in City right-of-way, in maintained areas of City parks (including along paved trails), and at City-owned facilities. Ash trees represent 16 percent of all public trees in Ames, which is higher than the 10 percent recommended for optimum diversity. Map of Ash Trees on Public Property\nThe Ames City Council approved the EAB Response Plan to extend the environmental, social, and economic benefits of ash trees, and to increase the diversity of the urban forest, while being fiscally responsible to Ames citizens. The plan pursues a phased treatment and removal process for public ash trees. In the first five years, a predetermined number of ash trees would be removed based on public safety, tree defects, size, and costs. The annual removal process would spread costs over a longer time period, allow staff to reevaluate the plan regularly, and limit the visual impact on streets lined with ash trees. Some ash trees will be treated, but only to keep EAB from killing the tree before it can be removed.\nAlthough EAB will have a major detrimental impact on our community over the next several years, this challenge also presents Ames with an unexpected opportunity to bring greater diversity to the public trees in our urban forest. Through the one-to-one replacement program, a variety of saplings will be planted at a size of 1-1\/2 inch, which is optimal for establishment and survival of new trees. Since most tree removals will occur during the winter, there will be a time gap between removals and the replanting of new trees. Care and Watering Guidelines for Newly-Planted Trees\nWhat is Emerald Ash Borer? EAB is native to Asia and was likely introduced into North America via cargo ships or planes.

However, in order for a worker to be exempt from the LMIA requirement in these cases, it must be possible to prove the existence of a reciprocal accord. Reciprocal accords can be proven by the existence of:\n- An exchange accord between the Canadian and foreign employers\n- A letter from the receiving Canadian employer\n- A contract, if it provides proof of the exchange program\n- Validproof of a reciprocal program will allow CIC officers to issue a work permit without an LMIA.

As Mutt encounters Jute, the hybrid native meets the ambiguous colonizer\/Jutlander, and here Joyce plays with and inverts the roles of native and invader, moving beyond Manichaean constructions of history. In so-doing, Joyce radicalizes and repurposes the hackneyed trope of the Vikings\u2019 assimilation to native Gaelic culture, and while the latter become \u201cmore Irish than the Irish themselves\u201d, we are left with the sense that the Irish \u2018mutts\u2019 become less like themselves by virtue of the same process.\nTo further this deconstruction of historical roles, the Battle of Clontarf becomes a teachable moment in the Wake, as it works to complicate the received Manichaean narrative that the foreign invader was somehow expelled by the resilient natives in 1014. As Joyce himself remarks:\nFinally, the bloody victory of the usurper Brian Boru over the nordic hordes on the sand dunes outside the walls of Dublin put an end to the Scandinavian raids. The Scandinavians, however, did not leave the country, but were gradually assimilated into the community, a fact that we must keep in mind if we want to understand the curious character of the modern Irishman (CW 159-60).\nThis is taken from a lecture that Joyce gave in Trieste on the topic of Irish identity in 1907, ironically entitled \u201cIreland, Island of Saints and Sages\u201d. Here, the Wake\u2019s vision of \u201cmiscegenations on miscegenations\u201d (18.20) comes to the fore, as Ireland functions as what Thomas Hofheinz calls a \u201ctransparency\u201d: a historiographical overlay of a diverse array of settler cultures. Joyce\u2019s aim is to critique the homogenizing of identity that he saw at work in certain strands of Irish culture\u2014from the church\u2019s promulgation of a pan-Catholic, confessional culture, to what would seem like (from a modern vantage), rather chauvinistic references to a Gaelic \u201crace\u201d (we find this kind of language in Douglas Hyde\u2019s The Necessity for De-Anglicizing Ireland, a talk given to the Irish National Literary Society, in 1892)."}

In order to further gain insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying the germination repressive activity exerted by the endosperm, a \"seed coat bedding\" assay (SCBA) was devised. The SCBA is a dissection procedure physically separating seed coats and embryos from seeds, which allows monitoring the growth of embryos on an underlying layer of seed coats. Remarkably, the SCBA reconstitutes the germination repressive activities of the seed coat in the context of seed dormancy and FR-dependent control of seed germination. Since the SCBA allows the combinatorial use of dormant, nondormant and genetically modified seed coat and embryonic materials, the genetic pathways controlling germination and specifically operating in the endosperm and embryo can be dissected. Here we detail the procedure to assemble a SCBA.\nPlant Biology, Issue 81, Technology, Industry, and Agriculture, Life Sciences (General), Control of Seed germination, Seed Coat, Endosperm, Dormancy, Far red light, Abscisic acid, gibberellins, DELLA factors\nSeeded Synthesis of CdSe\/CdS Rod and Tetrapod Nanocrystals\nInstitutions: UC Berkeley, UC Berkeley, UC Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory.\nWe demonstrate a method for the synthesis of multicomponent nanostructures consisting of CdS and CdSe with rod and tetrapod morphologies.

{"question":"As a plant physiologist studying nitrogen metabolism, I'm curious about how silicon-containing mixes affect plant nutrient uptake during stress, and what role does ammonium toxicity play in this nutrient balance?","doc_text":"|Richards, James - UNIV. OF CALIF. DAVIS|\n|Donovan, Lisa - UNIV. OF GEORGIA|\nSubmitted to: Plant and Soil\nPublication Type: Peer Reviewed Journal\nPublication Acceptance Date: January 30, 2008\nPublication Date: February 21, 2008\nCitation: Snyder, K.A., James, J.J., Richards, J.H., Donovan, L.A. 2008. Does hydraulic lift or nighttime transpiration facilitate nitrogen acquistion?. Plant and Soil Journal. 306:159-166. Interpretive Summary: This study investigates whether hydraulic lift by plants increases a plant's ability to capture nitrogen from the soil. We used greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus) in Mono Lake, CA for this study. Hydraulic redistribution is the observed phenomenon where, at night when plant stomata are less open, plants passively redistribution water through their root system in response to differences in soil water availability near the plant's root zone, which become the driving gradient for water movement. Hydraulic lift is the specific case where water from deep wetter layers is redistributed to shallow soil layers. Since the bulk of soil nutrients are concentrated near the soil surface, it has been proposed that this behavior may facilitate nutrient uptake. We found no evidence to support this hypothesis for nitrogen uptake. The range of hydraulic lift we studied had no effect on nitrogen uptake. However, we did find that plants that transpired at night, relative to plants where we artificially suppressed nighttime transpiration had increased nitrogen uptake. Indicated that nighttime transpiration my facilitate nitrogen capture.\nTechnical Abstract: It has been proposed that plant species that hydraulically lift water to dry shallow soil layers should have improved nutrient relations. Yet, this idea has not been adequately tested. We choose ten Sarcobatus vermiculatus plants with different magnitudes of hydraulic lift to examine the hypothesis that the magnitude of lift will be positively related to the amount of nitrogen (N) uptake. A 15N tracer was injected in the 20-30 cm soil layer to determine plant 15N capture by shallow roots that exhibited hydraulic lift. Half of the plants were also placed in large humidified tents (i.e. \u201cbagged\u201d) to suppress nighttime transpiration in an effort to increase hydraulic lift."}
{"question":"what qualities important when hiring business consultant attorney first meeting","doc_text":"While buying ads will definitely make the business appear closer to the top says Edmonton Business Consultant, since most consumers check out Google reviews before they make their purchasing decision, once they click on a businesses ads, and see there\u00eds not enough Google reviews, they will not make the decision to purchase from tha business. Therefore, a business will have paid for that click, and not and the sale. It\u00eds a pretty efficient way of wasting money.\nBusiness owners can keep several things in mind when they open the doors to their businesses Edmonton Businesses Consultant, that while an online presence is important, it doesn\u00edt need to be a website in the beginning, at least until they have generated a minimum of 40 Google reviews on their Google my business page.\nEntrepreneurs used to hear that in order for their business to be taken seriously, they needed to have a website says Edmontons Business Consultant. While it is extremely important that businesses have a website, it\u00eds even more important that a business has an online presence.\nThat\u00eds online presence can come in the form of a Google my business page. The reason why that should be one of the first things that a business gets even over a website, says Edmonton Business Consultant, is because I Google my business page will allow business to start getting Google reviews. It\u00eds extremely important that businesses get Google reviews especially if they are planning on creating a website later on. The reason for this is because 88% of potential customers will make their purchasing decision based on Google reviews they see when they search a business. Businesses that have no Google reviews or very few Google reviews often are passed over for businesses that have more. One of the reasons why businesses should have many Google reviews, is because those consumers that look at the Google reviews will see a business that has only a few reviews as not being serious at what they do or even not being good at what they do. The number of reviews that is seen as being serious to a consumer is 40. Business owners should make reaching 40 Google reviews on their page their top online priority.\nOften entrepreneurs claimed that they don\u00edt need to have that online presence because they do most of their business through word-of-mouth referrals. While word-of-mouth referrals are very effective and powerful says Edmonton Business Consultant, those word-of-mouth referrals also likely googled the business and looked at their Google reviews."}

It has a uniquely warm tone and very even touch and sound. We only had to regulate the action and voice the hammers as it needed little else. The piano is built better than its newer Yamaha cousins due to a less brighter and more traditional European sound than the newer Yamaha Grands.

{"question":"who pays arbitrator fees dispute settlement","doc_text":"Interest on Security Deposit\nInterest on a security deposit is calculated from the date the tenant pays the deposit to the day before the security deposit is paid back to the tenant. If the deposit is disputed at dispute resolution, the interest is calculated from the date the tenant paid the deposit up until the date the Arbitrator orders its return (usually the date of the hearing).\nInterest on a security deposit is calculated as follows. For each one-year period beginning on January 1, the rate will be 4.5% below the prime lending rate of the principal banker to the province on January 1st of that year, compounded annually. There is an online deposit interest calculator at http:\/\/www.housing.gov.bc.ca\/rtb\/WebTools\/InterestOnDepositCalculator.html\n- NOTE: A tenant has only one year from the time the tenancy ends to supply the landlord with their forwarding address. If the tenant fails to forward the address within the one year limit the landlord may retain the security or pet damage deposit or both.\n- NOTE: A landlord does not have to return a deposit within 15 days if the tenant\u2019s right to the return of the deposit (pet or security) has been extinguished for failing to participate in the condition inspection procedures.\n- NOTE: A pet damage deposit may be used only for damage caused by a pet to the residential property unless the tenant agrees otherwise.\n2. Change of Landlord\nWhere a security deposit is paid to a landlord, and the property is then subsequently sold, the security deposit can constitute a covenant that runs with the land. After the building is sold to the second landlord, the security deposit obligations carry over to that second person. So, a tenant who had lived in the building all along would be able to claim the return of their security deposit from a new landlord, even though the tenant had originally paid the security deposit to a different person. See s 93 of the RTA regarding covenants that run with the land.\nD. Extra Deposits and Non-Refundable Fees\nThe RTA allows landlords to charge a deposit for additional access devices (so long as it is not a tenant\u2019s only means of entry to one\u2019s building).\nAdministration fees for returned cheques ($25) or moving between rental units on a single property can only be charged if the tenancy agreement specifically allows for it (RTR, s 7(1)(d)).\n1."}

{"question":"what makes humor difficult translate between languages context importance","doc_text":"Facts are Available Instantaneously, Everywhere\nPeople can already look up information on Wikipedia from their smart phones; this has already changed the way people argue. Future technology will search information automatically on a device that is already monitoring the conversation or what you are reading (think smart glasses). The implication is that the memorization of facts will be much less valuable. Knowing where to get it, and how to validate it will be more important. That means teaching history must be focused on WHY and not what events occurred. Life is turning into an open book test, or more accurately open Internet access. This transformation is similar to the advent of the written language which eliminated the need for elders to orally pass information to others.\n2. Science is Multi-Disciplinary\nI applaud the effort to teach subjects in multi-disciplinary ways. This makes the content relevant. Science is often taught in a cold, isolated manner that is difficult to connect with the real world. We need to transform teaching science from word search (looking up specific facts in book) into active synthesis and idea generation. Hopefully, they'll also include computer science as part of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) or at a minimum, allowing computer science to fulfill the language requirement, since this is relevant to all fields in the future.\n3. Babel Towers are Crashing\nThis is where I feel the proposed academy is short-sighted. Teaching \"world\" languages is a great pre-21st century skill. English is THE world language today. It\u2019s not like Thomas Jefferson needing to learn other languages because everything important was written in non-English languages. Being able to read other written languages is a challenge already solved for free by Google Translate, Microsoft Translate, and many other providers. No one can learn all the languages these online services offer instantaneously. Writing in other languages is also becoming a commodity. Speaking remains a challenge, but it is a matter of when, not if, this is solved. We can then be trained and speak in all sorts of languages one phrase at a time. There's no need to waste thousands of dollars and hours to train a child to perform worse than what a free device will provide for a dozen languages before they graduate from college.\nOn a related note, requiring all high school students to devote 3 years to learning another language is a huge waste. People say it's important to learn other cultures."}
{"question":"my mother has trouble breathing need to know if breathing problems due to infection or muscle weakness similarities differences","doc_text":"Few things in life are as emotional as the birth of a baby. It\u2019s usually a joyful occasion that is celebrated. In some cases, however, the birth can have complications. According to the American Heart Association, about ten percent of babies require resuscitation efforts at birth. Which is why medical health professionals must be prepared to handle resuscitation appropriately \u2014 because if it is not, the consequences to the baby can be catastrophic.\nWhy is Resuscitation Needed?\nIn many cases, after delivery, a baby exhibits normal functioning including a good respiratory effort, strong heartbeat, and good muscle tone. But in other instances, a newborn needs some level of resuscitation.\nVarious factors can play a role in a baby needing resuscitation after birth. For example, some babies may have problems breathing due to immature lung development. Babies who aspirate meconium may also have respiratory distress. Meconium is a baby\u2019s first stool, and it sometimes occurs in utero shortly before birth. If a baby inhales the meconium, it can lead to breathing problems.\nDuring delivery, the umbilical cord can become compressed, which can lead to decreased oxygen to the baby. If the cord compression is not recognized, it can be life-threatening to the baby.\nWhat is Involved in Infant Resuscitation?\nThe goal of infant resuscitation after delivery is to provide adequate perfusion and oxygenation to the baby\u2019s brain as quickly as possible. When an infant is not breathing sufficiently to maintain circulation to the heart and brain, death can occur. Medical staff needs to act swiftly and efficiently to recognize the need for resuscitation. Infant resuscitation procedures may include:\n- Warm, dry and stimulate: The first steps in neonatal resuscitation involve stimulating, warming and drying the baby. Stimulating involves rubbing the babies back and flicking the feet.\n- Provide oxygen: In instances where a baby has spontaneous breathing but is not maintaining adequate oxygen levels, administration of supplemental oxygen is required.\n- Suction the airway: Amniotic fluid can block the airway. Suctioning the baby\u2019s mouth and nose may be helpful to improve breathing.\n- Manual Ventilation: If a baby is not breathing spontaneously of if respirations are weak, manual ventilation with a bag-mask device is needed.\n- CPR: In neonates, CPR is initiated if the heart rate drops below 60 beats per minute."}

{"question":"what special fluid absorbs water vapor from air in drupps system","doc_text":"How Geothermal Heating and Cooling Works\nOutdoor temperatures fluctuate with the changing seasons but underground temperatures don\u2019t change as dramatically, thanks to the insulating properties of the earth. The earth absorbs and stores approximately 47% of the sun\u2019s solar energy. As a result, the temperature of the earth four to six feet below grade is fairly moderate and stable. A geothermal system, which typically consists of an indoor handling unit and a buried system of pipes, called an earth loop, and\/or a pump to reinjection well, capitalizes on these constant temperatures to provide the most energy efficient heating and cooling system available.\nThe science behind the magic\nThe heat exchanger, also known as the loop system, captures the stored solar energy in the ground and delivers it back to the geothermal system in the house. There are 4 different types of loops. Your loop system is the heart of geothermal technology. Regardless of the option you select, it will deliver over 500% efficient comfort and savings for many years into the future. We will help you select the proper loop system based on a site survey and by conducting a detailed energy analysis of your home. Installing a geothermal loop system is like getting a 70% discount on energy for the life of your home.\nThe pipes that make up an earth loop are usually made of polyethylene and can be buried under the ground horizontally or vertically, depending on the characteristics of the site. If an aquifer is available, we might design an \u201copen loop\u201d system, in which a well is drilled into the underground water. Water is pumped up, run past a heat exchanger, and then the water is returned to the same aquifer, through \u201creinjection.\u201d\nIn winter, fluid circulating through the system\u2019s earth loop or well absorbs stored heat from the ground and carries it indoors. The indoor unit compresses the heat to a higher temperature and distributes it throughout the building, as if it were an air conditioner running in reverse.\nIn summer, the geothermal HVAC system pulls heat from the building and carries it through the earth loop\/pump to reinjection well, where it deposits the heat into the cooler earth\/aquifer.\nUnlike ordinary heating and cooling systems, geothermal HVAC systems do not burn fossil fuel to generate heat; they simply transfer heat to and from the earth."}

{"question":"stop motion animation how is it made","doc_text":"Let's look at a simple scene which demonstrates the effects of motion blur settings.\nThe following images show the positions of two balls at frames 1, 2, and 3. In this example key-frames are made with linear tangents, so that as we observe shutter timing, the balls will maintain a fixed speed.\nMotion blur can be enabled in the Render Settings window under the Features tab. By default it is not enabled.\nBy default the Motion Blur Type is set to Frame, which is often sufficient for basic motion blur. The alternative, Subframe, is more accurate, but involves more sampling of geometry and transforms at different times. Shutter Timing settings other than Frame Open require Subframe blur. So let's go ahead and change the Motion Blur Type to Subframe. And then observe the effects of different Shutter Timing settings.\nThe following images show Frame Open blur for frames 1, 2, and 3. The shutter opens at the start of the frame. The default shutter angle of 180 means the shutter is open for half of a frame. Notice how the last frame has no blur. This is because there is no animation after the time that the shutter opens for that frame.\nThe following images show Frame Center blur, which means the shutter opens before the frame, and closes after, centered on the frame. The blur for the first and last frames looks shortened, because the animation does not extend beyond those frames.\nThe following images show Frame Close blur, which means the shutter closes on the frame. Again, the first frame has no blur because there is no animation before that frame.\nOur red ball looks kind of odd in the second frame with centered blur. The blur is horizontal, when the ball really should reach an apex in the middle of that streak. By default, there are only two motion samples, because they are expensive, and two is often sufficient. You can change the global number of motion samples in Motion Blur section of the Render Settings. Or if you know that only a particular piece of geometry requires extra samples, you can add them to just that geometry. Select the geometry, and in the Attribute Editor, under the transform tab for the selection, do Attributes->RenderMan->Add Motion Samples.\nAt the bottom of the Attribute Editor, with tab for the sphere's transform selected, you'll see a setting for motion samples."}
{"question":"How did early fossil discoveries in the 1800s change our understanding of prehistoric life and what role did fossils from the Jurassic period play in developing new theories about Earth's history?","doc_text":"The Nothosaurus was a dinosaur that lived in the water during the Triassic Period. Nothosaurus means \u201cfalse lizard.\u201d It was approximately 10 feet in length and on averaged weighted between 150 and 200 pounds. The Nothosaurus had a long tapered body and at the send was a narrow head that contained sharp teeth. The fossils were found all over the world. The Nothosaurus also are known to be the earliest sea-living reptilian hunters of the waters.

They were able to study this marine reptile and learn that there were over a dozen species of this dinosaur. The fossils have been discovered all over the world. They were found in Europe, Africa, and Asia.\nWhat did they eat?\nTable of Contents\nIt is said that the Nothosaurus lived in shallow warm rivers and seas, so scientist believes they would eat fish, crabs, other crustaceans, and possibly eggs.\nDid Nothosaurus live in water?\nThis dinosaur was one of the first that was able to live in the sea and still come out on land.\nPhysical Features\/Characteristics of Nothosaurus\nThey had very long necks, webbed paddle feet, long sharp teeth, and were about 10 feet in length. These were mammal-like dinosaurs. The Nothosaurus was able to breathe air; it had two nostrils that were found on the top of its face, kind of like the present-day alligator or crocodile. The body was designed for life in the water. The Nothosaurus had front and back feet as well as bendable knees.\nMarine prehistoric animals\nSome of the great forgotten in the world of prehistoric animals are marine animals.

{"question":"How did the Emancipation Proclamation impact slavery and Southern economy?","doc_text":"Say, shall for us so many victims die?\nSay not that smalls the sphere in which we move,\nAnd our attempts would vain and fruitless prove;\nNot so -- we hold a most important share,\nIn all the evils -- all the wrong they bear;\nAnd tho their woes entire we cant remove,\nWe may thincreasing misries which they prove,\npush far away the plant for which they die,\nAnd in this one small thing our taste deny. (\"A Poem on the African Slave Trade\" (2:196-217, 212-213)\nThe \"Abolition\" (volume 2) has a powerful early essay by Coleridge on the slave trade which, like Mary Birketts poem, appeals for a consumer boycott as part of a wider anti-slavery campaign and as a way of rooting the cause in everyday life. Though endorsed by hundreds of thousands the boycott did not materially diminish the sugar trade, but it did stimulate domestic debate and allow women and young people to take a lead. It is a pity that volume 3 of Slavery, Abolition and Emancipation does not give any space to the partisans of immediate emancipation. A suitable text would have been Elizabeth Heyricks Immediate, not gradual abolition, in which she observed: \"men may propose only gradually to abolish the worst of crimes, and only mitigate the most evil bondage I trust no Ladies Association will be found with such words attached to it.\" Her argument was heeded, and by 1830 the national Society changed both its name and its objectives.\nThe contribution of the cruelty of slavery to British wealth remains deeply controversial, though it is now more widely recognized that Britains historic prosperity owed much to slavery and the slave trade. We should, of course, beware the dubious notion of inherited guilt -- itself redolent of racist legends. But privilege can be, and has been, inherited and lessons can be learnt.\nThe culture of anti-slavery was instructive because it heralded the awakening of a popular understanding of the long-distance havoc that could be wreaked by the market, making it entirely appropriate that its themes should be echoed by Jubilee 2000 or the critics of the Bank of Englands decision to dump gold regardless of its impact on South Africa and Russia. Anti-slavery was about making connections and piercing the veil which hides from consumers the human costs of production."}

{"question":"music theory minor m7b5 chords role","doc_text":"And, the vii\/vi to vi cadence will sound more conclusive than a V-vi cadence, because we have the vii-i motion in the secondary key (in this case, the secondary key is built in the sixth scale degree).\nLet\u2019s look at an example of this:\nImage via Open Music Theory\nThis is an excerpt from a piece called \u201cMag da draussen senhee\u201d by Josephine Lang. In this case, we are moving from a V7 in the primary key to a viio7 in the secondary key of Bb. The chord tones for the V7 are Ab-C-Eb-Gb, which are arpeggiated in the upper voices. Next, in the viio7\/vi, the chord tones would be the chord tones of the viio7 in Bb minor, which are A natural - C-Eb-Gb. Note that even though this chord is in root position, it is usually not considered good practice to write a root position viio7 chord in 18th century voice leading. The leading tones in the viio7 chord resolve upwards (the As resolve to Bb), and the chordal seventh, in this case Gb, resolves down to the F, in the arpeggiation of the vi chord in Db Major.\n\ud83e\udd9c Polly wants a progress tracker: write a viio\/V-V chord progression in any key you choose. Then, try combining this with cadential 6\/4 chords. Write a viio\/V-V6\/4-5\/3 progression, and then practice with seventh chords, writing a viio\/V-V8\/6\/4-7\/5\/3 chord progression.\nModulation is the process of changing from one key to another in music. It is different from tonicization because you stay in the secondary key for a long time \u2013 usually a whole section of the piece. In tonicization, you are just borrowing a few chords from a secondary key. We should usually modulate to closely related keys.\nHowever, if we want to modulate to a distantly related key, we will go through some harmonic sequence to get to whichever key we want to get to. Often, we do this when we are trying to modulate between parallel keys (e.g. d minor to D Major)."}
{"question":"How did Western powers react differently to Soviet control of Poland in 1945 compared to the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968?","doc_text":"Tomorrow it will be the turn of Poland and Romania. When Germany has obtained the oil and wheat it needs, she will turn on the West. Certainly we must multiply our efforts to avoid war. But that will not be obtained unless Great Britain and France stick together, intervening in Prague for new concessions but declaring at the same time that they will safeguard the independence of Czechoslovakia. If, on the contrary, the Western Powers capitulate again they will only precipitate the war they wish to avoid.\" . Perhaps discouraged by the arguments of the military and civilian members of the French government regarding their unprepared military and weak financial situation, as well as traumatised by France's bloodbath in the First World War that he was personally a witness to, Daladier ultimately let Chamberlain have his way. On his return to Paris, Daladier, who was expecting a hostile crowd, was acclaimed. He then told his aide, Alexis L\u00e9ger: \"Ah, les cons!\" (Ah, the fools!).\nJoseph Stalin was also upset by the results of the Munich conference. The Soviets, who had a mutual military assistance treaty with Czechoslovakia, felt betrayed by France, which also had a mutual military assistance treaty with Czechoslovakia. The British and French, however, mostly used the Soviets as a threat to dangle over the Germans. Stalin concluded that the West had actively colluded with Hitler to hand over a Central European country to the Nazis, causing concern that they might do the same to the Soviet Union in the future, allowing the partition of the USSR between the western powers and the fascist Axis. This belief led the Soviet Union to reorient its foreign policy towards a rapprochement with Germany, which eventually led to the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939.\nThe Czechoslovaks were greatly dismayed with the Munich settlement. With Sudetenland gone to Germany, Czecho-Slovakia (as the state was now renamed) lost its defensible border with Germany and its fortifications. Without them its independence became more nominal than real. In fact, Edvard Bene\u0161, the President of Czechoslovakia, had the military print the march orders for his army and put the press on standby for a declaration of war."}

And we have yet to come up with an answer to the question of where to store waste.\"\nBut Keiji Miyazaki, professor emeritus at Osaka University and a specialist in the study of severe accidents, said renewables did not represent an energy panacea.\n\"Nuclear power is indispensable for Japanese industry and for solving the energy growth and environmental protection,\" he said.\nThe Japanese public is divided.

{"question":"test validity experimental studies mental powers","doc_text":"This testing is intended to document whether a known pathologic mutation is present in the family and optimize the predictive value of predisposition testing for at-risk relatives. However, coverage for testing of the affected index case is dependent on contract benefit language when there is no conclusive evidence of clinical benefit to the index case from testing.\nSpecific contract language must be reviewed and considered when determining coverage for testing. In some cases, coverage for testing the index case may be available through the contract that covers the unaffected, at-risk individual who will benefit from knowing the results of the genetic test.\nThis policy was created in December 2011 and updated periodically with literature review. The most recent update with literature review covered the period through October 29, 2014.\nThe rationale for this policy statement is based primarily on a 2010 TEC Assessment(19) that considered whether genetic testing for patients at risk for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) improves outcomes. This Assessment reviewed the evidence on the accuracy of genetic testing in identifying patients who will subsequently develop HCM. Seven studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria for review.(20-26) These peer-reviewed articles were supplemented by data on analytic validity available through the manufacturers\u2019 websites or personal communication.(12-14, 27)\nAnalytic and Clinical Validity\nFor predispositional genetic testing, the analytic validity (ability to detect or exclude a specific mutation identified in another family member) and clinical validity (ability to detect any pathologic mutation in a patient with HCM and exclude a mutation in a patient without HCM) were evaluated. The analytic validity is more relevant when there is a known mutation in the family, whereas the clinical validity is more relevant for individuals without a known mutation in the family.\nThe analytic sensitivity (ability to detect a specific mutation that is present) of sequence analysis for detecting mutations that cause HCM is likely to be very high based on what is known about the types of mutations that cause HCM and the limited empiric data provided by the manufacturer and detailed description of the testing methodology. There are scant data available on the analytic specificity of HCM testing. The available information on specificity, mainly from series of patients without a personal or family history of HCM, suggests that false-positive results for known pathologic mutations are uncommon.(22,26) However, the rate of false-positive results is likely to be higher for classification of previously unknown variants."}

{"question":"How can websites boost search rankings and help disabled users?","doc_text":"Google has released yet another update to its algorithm used to rank websites. Known as Panda 4.1, it follows in the same footsteps as previous Panda updates \u2013 with a focus on identifying and penalizing websites with thin, irrelevant, low-quality, and\/or mostly duplicate content. If a website is deemed to offer little-to-no value to the end user, Google may penalize it by reducing its rankings or even removing it from its search index. To learn more about Panda 4.1 and how to protect your website from becoming its next victim, keep reading.\nPierre Far broke the news of Panda 4.1 on his Google+ Page, saying \u201cBased on user (and webmaster!) feedback, we\u2019ve been able to discover a few more signals to help Panda identify low-quality content more precisely. This results in a greater diversity of high-quality small- and medium-sized sites ranking higher, which is nice.\u201d\nThe good news is that Panda 4.1 is a relatively small update when compared to previous algorithm updates. According to Far, it\u2019s expected to affect just 3-5% of all Google search queries. With that said, webmasters should still keep a close eye on their rankings to determine whether or not they are being hit by Panda 4.1. If you notice a decrease in one or more of your sites\u2019 rankings, you should perform a thorough audit of its on-site and off-site optimization elements.\nA Look Back at Panda 1.0\nGoogle publicly announced the original Panda 1.0 update in a 2011 post on its Webmaster Central blog, noting that it was just one of hundreds of different search improvements expected to roll out that year.\n\u201cSome publishers have fixated on our prior Panda algorithm change, but Panda was just one of roughly 500 search improvements we expect to roll out to search this year. In fact, since we launched Panda, we\u2019ve rolled out over a dozen additional tweaks to our ranking algorithms, and some sites have incorrectly assumed that changes in their rankings were related to Panda.

{"question":"I'm curious about what futuristic writers anticipated about modern technology. Have any notable sci-fi authors been particularly prescient about tech's impact on society while being low-tech themselves?","doc_text":"Matt Jefferies created a world. More specifically he created a future starship and much of its related tech. He wasn't the first to actually do this given science fiction film and television had already been around for decades. And he certainly wasn't alone during the 1960s era when there was quite a bit of sci-fi on television and film. But it could be argued that MJ stands above them because what he created resonated in a particular way. His future world, his starship, was portrayed in such a way that it all seemed so believable. And it can be argued that his creation has become the most iconic and most widely recognized piece of science fiction hardware: the starship Enterprise. Of course, MJ wasn't the only creative force in Star Trek. There were other very talented people who contributed either in ideas or in bringing ideas into physical form. But I think a lot of it took their cue from the conceptual template MJ lay down. It wasn't enough to make a new bit of sci-fi hardware look cool but also to make it seem believable. There are other popular sci-fi vehicles of that era such as the Jupiter II and the submarine Seaview, but they are largely cool unto themselves. MJ's Enterprise and other designs conveyed so much more \"beyond the hull\" so to speak. They suggested a whole world, a complete albeit yet to be revealed universe we tuned in every week to catch another glimpse of. Much of this, of course, was due to the writers and creative staff, but the Enterprise and its technology was so representative of all that. Gene Roddenberry stressed that the audience had to believe in the Enterprise to buy into the future and the stories the show presented. He charged Matt Jefferies to create such an object the audience could near immediately latch onto. And MJ delivered in spades. This isn't to say others didn't contribute significantly---they most certainly had. Much of the Enterprise's appeal, and in extent the world we saw, was enhanced by how they were presented in terms of lighting, photographing and accompanying music, and additionally by the references spoken by the characters. But I think there was still something about MJ's approach to design that telegraphed itself to others contributing to what made Star Trek work. Just my two cents."}

He refers to it as a \u201csci-fi Ring\u201d noting that the characters wield \u201cneon spears that look like Jedi light sabers.\u201d Nothing could be further removed from the truth in a production that has more of a rough-hewn primitive look than anything futuristic or high-tech. Freyer maintains a cheap and intentionally artificial visual sense throughout often in the service of laughs. This is Tommasini's third mention of the presumed likeness between neon lights and light sabers in the NY Times, but it tells us more about Tommasini\u2019s own misconceptions about Los Angeles and it\u2019s No. 1 industry than it does about Freyer\u2019s Ring production. I suppose that all neon lights do look like light sabers except for the fact that Freyer\u2019s lights have no hilts, are frequently handled in the center as opposed to their ends, and are used for many other elements in the staging besides just spears and swords. It is also true that L.A. Opera originally approached George Lucas\u2019 Industrial Light and Magic during initial plans to produce a Ring cycle years ago. But none of this has anything to do with Freyer\u2019s Ring. Yes, movies are made in Los Angeles. But, believe it or not, that does not mean that everything associated with Los Angeles intentionally references film. It's not that the similarity doesn't exist. But calling Freyer's production a \"sci-fi Ring\" is perhaps the least informative and insightful observation one could make about it.\nBut that's not all. Tommasini then continues to rehash his main criticism of LA Opera's Die Walk\u00fcre from earlier this year in that it doesn\u2019t deal with the \u201chuman dimensions of the characters.\u201d Considering that Act III of Freyer\u2019s Ring packs more emotional impact with its bizarre stage-length outstretched arms and primitive costume changes than anything that\u2019s appeared in the same opera on a New York stage for decades seems to be lost on him."}

{"question":"How are serious crimes like copyright violations handled differently from other types of crimes when it comes to police investigation and arrests?","doc_text":"My Actifit Report Card: September 27 2021\nToday's article 7 different types of crimes\nA crime is defined as any act that is against the rules or regulations. There are many different types of crime\nCrimes against people, also known as personal crimes, include murder, increasing attacks, rape and robbery. Personal crimes are unequally distributed among young, urban, poor, and ethnic minorities in the United States, and most often affected by these crimes, and whites, middle, and upper class people are arrested for them.\nProperty crimes include theft of property without bodily harm, such as burglary, auto theft and arson. Like personal crimes, young urban poor and ethnic minorities are more likely to be arrested for these crimes than others.\nHate crimes are crimes against individuals or property that are committed on the basis of race or gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation or racism. Hate crime rates in the United States have been relatively stable over the years, but there have been some incidents that have led to an increase in hate crimes. Hate crimes have increased since the 2016 election of Donald Trump.\nCrimes against morality are also called baseless crimes because no one complains or becomes a victim. Prostitution, illegal gambling, and drug abuse are all examples of homelessness\nWhite collar crimes are crimes committed by people of high social standing who commit their crimes in the context of their occupation. These include embezzlement (stealing money from one's employer), internal trade, tax evasion, and other violations of income tax laws.\nOrganized crime is committed by organized groups, which usually involve the distribution and sale of illicit goods and services. Many people think of the mafia when they think of organized crime, but the term can refer to any group that runs large illegal businesses (such as the drug trade, illegal gambling, prostitution). , Arms smuggling, or money laundering)\nArrest statistics show a clear pattern of arrests by race, sex and class. For example, as mentioned above, young, urban, poor and ethnic minorities are more likely to be arrested and convicted than others for personal and property crimes. For economists, the data raises the question of whether it reflects the real differences in crime between different groups, or whether it reflects discrimination against the criminal justice system.\nThis report was published via Actifit app (Android | iOS).

There is an assortment of recipes for acquacotta amongst the different areas of Tuscany, yet acquacotta is distinguishable from other Tuscan soups due to its use of eggs and stale bread at the end of (and not during) its preparation.\nWe found several book tracing the origins and tradition of acquacotta at the Academia Barilla\u2019s Gastronomic Library in Parma, such as \u201cCucina e vini della Toscana\u201d by Flavio Collutta (1974 Mursia Editore), \u201cIl grande libro della cucina Toscana\u201d by Paolo Petroni (1991 Ponte alle Grazie), and Sara Vignozzi and Gabriele Ganci\u2019s cookbook \u201cTuscany \u2013 Flavour of Italy\u201d (McRae Books, 1999), from which we picked the traditional recipe here below (image taken from the same book)."}
{"question":"How are Newfoundland dogs and Maremma Sheepdogs different in terms of their traditional work roles near water?","doc_text":"The Akbash dog is found today in rural Turkey, and as far as can\nbe determined, has been serving as a livestock protection dog\nin Turkey for millenia.\nThe Maremma is directly descended from the first flock guardians\nthat migrated for the Middle East, probably across the Adriatic\nfrom Greece. The Maremma has a solid, muscular build, thick white\ncoat, large head, black nose, and typically weighs between 65\nto 110 pounds.\nThe Polish Tatra Sheepdog is a breed of dog introduced into the\nTatra Mountain region of Southern Poland by Wallachian shepherds,\nprobably in the 14th Century, and used to guard and herd sheep.\nThe Tatras are large white dogs with heavy dense fur, similar\nin appearance to the Hungarian Kuvasz.\nThe Tibetan Mastiff is an ancient breed, descended from very early\nlarge Tibetan dogs from which most of today's Mastiff dogs descend.\nIt is among the largest breeds and is found in a heavier mastiff\ntype and a moderately sized mountain type. Its double coat is\nlong and found in a wide variety of colors from solid black to\ntri-color with the rarest being white.\nThe National Wildlife Research Center in Utah has imported several new breeds of livestock guardian dogs to see if they are more effective at deterring predation from \"bigger\" predators such as grizzly bears and wolves. The new breeds are larger and more aggressive, yet still people-friendly. One of these newer breeds is the Kangal from Turkey.\nRearing guardian dog pups with sheep creates an attachment or\nbond between the dog and the sheep. As the dog matures, it spends\nmuch of its time near the sheep and repels other animals that\nenter its personal space. Its aggressiveness is limited by a decrease\ntendancy to chase, a product of generations of selection for dogs\nthat do not chase. Even if the dog chases an intruding coyote\naway, it soons stops the chase and returns to the flock.\nMost livestock guardian dogs are large and imposing, weighing\n75 to over 100 pounds. They are large enough to startle or intimidate\nLivestock guardian dogs should be taught basic commands, such\nas come, sit, and stay, and should learn to walk on a leash. However,\nthe should not be allowed the privileges of a pet. Their job is\nto bond with the sheep, not the shepherd."}

Some 60 percent of Israeli Jews are Ashkenazi. About 2 percent of all Ashkenazi women and 12 percent of Ashkenazi women with breast cancer carry a mutation in one of these two genes.\nBRCA1-associated breast cancers, especially, tend to occur in younger women, are high-grade and are not estrogen-receptor positive, all factors which are associated with a poorer outcome.\nBut information on how a woman's BRCA status might affect her prognosis has been \"inconsistent,\" the authors stated.\nTo clarify the picture, the authors looked at all cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed between Jan. 1, 1987 and Dec. 31, 1988, and recorded in the Israeli National Cancer Registry. This represented the majority of all women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer in Israel during this time period.

The most recent benchmark stock assessment passed peer review nearly two years ago, and found that menhaden were neither overfished for subject to overfishing.\nHowever, those findings were based on a traditional, single-species approach to management. Now, ASMFC is seriously thinking about breaking new ground, and managing menhaden in a way that recognizes their role as a keystone species in the coastal ecosystem.\nIn possible furtherance of that goal, ASMFC has released the Public Information Document For Amendment 3 to the Interstate Fishery Management Plan For Atlantic Menhaden.\nThat document addresses a number of issues important to the future of menhaden management. However, it\u2019s easy to argue that the question of managing menhaden as an important forage species, rather than managing it merely for sustainable harvest, is the most important issue of all.\nAs noted in the Public Information Document,\n\u201cGiven the crucial ecological role that menhaden play as forage fish, the [Management] Board has expressed interest in developing ecological reference points (ERPs) to manage the menhaden stock. Menhaden serve an important role in the marine ecosystem as they convert phytoplankton into protein and in turn provide a food source to a variety of species including larger fish (e.g., weakfish, striped bass, bluefish, cod), birds (e.g., bald eagles, osprey), and marine mammals (e.g., humpback whales, bottlenose dolphin).

{"question":"I'm doing some home renovations and need to sand both my floors and countertops. Which sanding technique is recommended when working on edges - does it differ between wood floors and quartz surfaces?","doc_text":"The short answer is Yes, you can refinish engineered wood floors because the top thin layer is made of real hardwood. However, before you begin refinishing, you need to understand the engineered wood floor more deeply so that it can be confirmed whether your engineered wood floor can be refinished or not.\nThe base of an Engineered Wood Floor is made of high-quality plywood, and the top surface (also called the wear layer) is a layer of real hardwood. That\u2019s why engineered wood flooring looks almost identical to hardwood flooring.\nSo whether you can refinish your Engineered Wood Floors or not depends on the thickness of the wear layer of the Engineered Wood boards. If the wear layer is thick enough, then you can finish; otherwise, refinishing is not recommended.\nGenerally, the thickness of the board is 10-20mm, and the thickness of the wear layer is about 1-3mm. The thickness depends on the company, quality of the boards and construction type of boards.\nIf the thickness of the wear layer of your engineered wood blocks is more than two mm, then you can refinish. Because when sanding, It takes one millimeter off the surface of the boards. Thus if your wear layer is around 3 mm, you can refinish it twice.\nWhy You Shouldn\u2019t Refinish Engineered Wood Floors?\nThere are some situations and considerations where you should not refinish engineered wood floors. Here are some reasons:\nLimited Thickness of Wear Layer\nIf the wear layer on your engineered wood floor is too thin, it is not enough thickness to refinish. Or if refinishing of your same floor has already been done earlier, you should not do refinishing. By this, you can damage your floor.\nRisk of Damage\nIf the sanding process is not done by a professional or in the right manner, there is a high chance of uneven surfaces, scratches or dents on the floor, as the top layer can handle wear and tear less than solid hardwood.\nEngineered wood floors come with factory-applied finishes designed to be durable and last. Refinishing removes this and affects the durability and stability of the floor.\nMold or Rot\nIf you are refinishing your floors to remove mildew or rot, check to see how far the mildew has spread. Refinishing a floor only removes mildew from the top surface. If the core of engineered wood blocks has mold, you should replace the entire block instead of refinishing."}

The two solar systems are housed within the company\u2019s 7-acre yard that is used for scaling and storing logs.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to announce the completion of this innovative project,\u201d said Jamie Hahn, co-founder and managing director of Solis Partners. \u201cThis project allows Riephoff to lower its operating costs and acts as a hedge against the rising costs of electricity, which is especially important in a state that has some of the nation\u2019s highest electricity rates. The ability to produce clean, renewable energy is also very important to Riephoff as an organization reliant on the natural environment for raw materials.\u201d\nThe 15,000-square-foot mill, which includes a 56-inch circular saw and a 20-foot frick carriage, a device used to pass large pieces of lumber through the saw, as well as the pumps needed for aquafarming, requires a lot of electricity. The solar PV system offsets approximately 100 percent of Riephoff\u2019s electricity consumption, which equates to approximately $36,000 in annual savings.\nBuilt with 1,036 solar PV panels, the solar system will produce approximately 300,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in the first year of operation."}

Professional Indemnity policies for alliance style projects require specialised drafting to ensure that first-party costs associated with rectifying losses arising from professional acts, errors or omissions are covered.\nLimits of Liability\nNotwithstanding the type of policy procured, the limit of liability under PI policies is always an aggregate limit; meaning that the maximum amount the insurer will pay will be capped for both each claim and for all claims during period of insurance. The aggregate limit will either be specifically described on the policy schedule or as \u201creinstatement(s)\u201d within the policy wording.\nWhen determining the adequacy of the aggregate limit under a D&C PI policy, the contractor should consider the following:\n\u2022 number of current and historical projects for which professional services were performed by or on your behalf;\n\u2022 contract value of each of project;\n\u2022 technical complexities and\/or risks associated with each project; and\n\u2022 (for project specific policies) the period of the policy.\nThe drafting of D&C Pl policy wordings can vary dramatically between insurers.

Wide range of outdoors materials is able to be your preferences, from natural to synthetic materials. Each of materials brings different advantages and disadvantages also.\nNatural material like wood, bamboo and rattan are very popular as furniture material. It is common to find houses decorated with wood furniture or rattan patio set on their outdoor. However, not all kinds of wood can be used as outdoors, because outdoor furniture requires durability more than indoors. Teak is the most popular material for outdoors. It is even called as a king of outdoor. Teak wood has remarkable durability and density, either for its natural beauty.\nOther materials used for garden furniture is metal and synthetic materials. Metal is the most durable and strongest material than others, because it will not decay. Metal is perfect for outdoor spaces with no roof to provide shade. The disadvantages is that metal is heavier than other and it need regular treatment to avoid it from rust and corrosion. Synthetic material perhaps is more affordable than other previous materials.

What are its outdoor durability properties, and which adhesive solutions work best for it?","doc_text":"Ultra-violet-reactive resins also exhibited varying degrees of yellowing; additives such as activators can exacerbate this tendency. Silicon rubbers proved stable under simulated climate conditions, but their visual and physical qualities make them unsuitable as break-fixers, because they are highly viscous, soft, and cloudy; their inability to be redissolved is a further disadvantage when considering their use on historical glass. Instant glues, mostly cyanacrylates, do not yellow, but their adhesion to glass is very unsatisfactory.\nMaterials commonly used in workshops as paint-layer consolidants, included waxes, acrylic resins and some silicium-organic products, were tested. The behaviour of the waxes varied according to the temperature: at low temperatures they tended to be brittle and prone to crack, at higher temperatures they softened and were capable of expanding to fill the gaps. They are opaque and not colourless, but showed no tendency to yellow in the tests. The excellent ability of the widely used polyacrylate Paraloid B72 to withstand weathering was confirmed by the tests, though its ability to adhere to the glass surface was considerably reduced in humid weathering conditions.\nApart from the materials commonly used in workshop practice, alternative types of edge-bonding agents were also tested in the laboratory; this confirmed the general material qualities of these product groups. In a special series of tests, the viscosity of the thin-fluid epoxy glues was increased by adding highly dispersive silica gel, to see if this made them easier to apply. The durability tests showed a slight reduction in the glues' adhesive abilities with higher concentrations of additive. Some of the ultra-violet-reactive glues proved to have the best results overall. The newly developed light-reactive glues proved not to possess the necessary adhesive and cohesive qualities to fix glass breaks satisfactorily. Silicon rubbers generally proved to be durable adhesives, but were on various grounds unsuitable for break fixing.\nThe tests on alternative materials developed for paint-layer consolidation were the most comprehensive, and the following products were analyzed: stone-conservation materials based on polysiloxanes and polyurethanes; clear lacquers based on polyurethanes and alkides; and artificial resins based on acrylic and epoxy resins. In addition, aminosilane adhesion facilitators were added to improve the adhesive durability of these substances."}

The St. Croix River already hosts populations of species such as Asian carp, banded mystery snails, and curlyleaf pondweed, each of which was likely introduced by humans.\nWhen introduced to a foreign ecosystem, invasive species tend to flourish due to a lack of natural predators or disease controls, and often crowd out native species as they take over food sources and space.\nVery often, once established, there is very little to be done to eradicate them.\n\u201cThe problem is that these invasive species are so good at adapting to these environments that\u2026we often don\u2019t have the people or resources to stop them,\u201d said Trevor Cyphers, a fisheries biologist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\nEducation and prevention, therefore, are often just as important, if not more so, than restoration of already-infested ecosystems.\nOne particular invader that gets a lot of attention is the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). This small, freshwater mussel typically grows only two inches long at most, yet can become a massive problem in lakes and slow-moving rivers due to its ability to create a lot of offspring very quickly.\nByron Karns, Acting Chief of Resource Management for the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway, a unit of the National Park System, said that the ecological damage of a zebra mussel infestation fits many of the common patterns of an invasive species. Once in an area, their populations explode, and they quickly begin to overwhelm niches normally occupied by native species of mussel.\nThe zebra mussels will outcompete other mussels for food and space, and sometimes smother the natives by latching onto them and preventing them from moving, feeding or reproducing properly.\nZebra mussels can also cause economic damage.\nA good example is Bass Lake in St. Croix County, Wisconsin. Bill Holmberg is a resident living on the edge of the lake, which was diagnosed as infested with zebra mussels in 2010. Ever since the invasion, the local residents have had to deal with the economic consequences."}

Their saliva is highly toxic and does serious damage to your dog\u2019s nervous system. Without being treated in time, virtually no dogs survive a paralysis tick infection.\nThis is why regular tick treatment for dogs is an essential part of giving them the proper care they deserve.\nWhy you need flea control for dogs\nMost dogs will be affected by fleas at some point during their lives. This is an extremely uncomfortable experience for your dog, as they will become extremely itchy. However, flea bites can also cause more complicated skin conditions such as allergies and dermatitis. These are highly distressing conditions for your dog and can lead to other infections, which are very costly to treat.\nIn addition, fleas can be hosts for parasites including tapeworms, which are then transferred to your dog via flea bites.\nFleas can lay between 40 and 50 eggs every day, and once they\u2019ve infested your home it can take months to get rid of them.

{"question":"mechanical bull injury liability waiver enforceable new york law court ruling details","doc_text":"It is a busy fall for consignment law in New York. News has been making the rounds this month about a decision by the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, New York\u2019s intermediate appeals court. The Appellate Division ruled that an auctioneer must disclose the name of any owner who has consigned the work for sale, or a sale against a successful bidder cannot be enforced. The auction world is in an uproar, but the result actually derives from a version of a very old law called the Statute of Frauds about what has to be in writing for a contract to be enforceable, for reasons that have nothing to do with art or auctions.\nA few years ago, the William J. Jenack auction house in Chester, New York, auctioned for sale an object described as \u201cFine Russian Silver\/Enamel Covered Box with Gilt Interior, Signed I.P. Khlebnikov, 19th Century. Height 1\u00bd\"; Top 2\u00bd\" x 3 5\/8\",\u201d which apparently came to be seen as the work of renowned silversmith Ivan Petrovich Khlebnikov. The high bidder was a man named Albert Rabizadeh, but after the sale Rabizadeh did not pay.\nA recap of the typical auction\/payment process is informative: after a buyer goes to cash out with the auction clerk, the buyer gets an invoice. That invoice will ordinarily include details like the date, the bidder\u2019s name\/number, and the winning bid. If the work was sold on consignment, sometimes the owner\u2019s name will be included too. Rabizadeh\u2019s invoice stated only that the consignor was \u201cconsignor #428.\u201d\nJenack sued Rabizadeh, presumably on the argument that he breached the contract to buy the object. Jenack won, and after some procedural wrangling over the damages to be paid relative to the subsequent resale, the case was appealed again.\nThe Appellate Division focused on New York General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-701, the New York version of what is known as the Statute of Frauds. Dating to medieval England, the Statute of Frauds is in fact the statute actually designed to prevent fraud, codifying what kinds of agreements have to be in writing to be enforceable."}

{"question":"who pays arbitrator fees dispute settlement","doc_text":"Otherwise, the parties have latitude in choose an arbitrator. Most jurisdictions do not require that arbitrators have any special training.\n- Example: Each party may select one arbitrator and those arbitrators select the third arbitrator. The parties will seek to select experts with experience in the particular industry and with knowledge of the customs and practices.\nHow to Submit a Dispute to Arbitration?\nArbitration begins with the parties submitting their dispute to the arbitrators. Submission is simply the act of contacting the arbitrators and providing them with the dispute information and setting up a time to have an arbitration proceeding. Submitting a dispute to arbitration authorizes arbitrators to make a decision that binds the parties and resolves their dispute. In mandatory arbitrations, many jurisdictions require that the parties submit the matter to arbitration within 6 months of the dispute arising.\nSubmitting a Dispute to Arbitration Requires an Agreement with the Arbitrator(s)\nIn voluntary arbitration, the parties must enter into an agreement with the arbitrators to resolve the dispute. The terms of the arbitration agreement and the dispute are passed on to the arbitrator. The parties may propose the rules governing the arbitration. In most cases, however, the arbitrator will agree to arbitrate the matter based upon model arbitration procedural rules. Mandatory arbitration may have formalized documents or procedures for this purpose.\n- Note: Many arbitrations employee the rules provided in the Federal Arbitration Act.\nWhat are the Procedures for an Arbitration Proceeding?\nThe arbitration procedure follows a semi-formal format with the arbitrators controlling the process. Often the arbitrators will orchestrate the arbitration similarly to a trial. The judicial rules of evidence and procedure do not apply, so the arbitrators have a great deal of latitude. They look beyond strictly legal criteria to other factors that bear on the proper resolution of a dispute.

I think most people will have heard of the Golden-Section, or the Golden-Ratio, and how it can be obtained by dividing a straight line up into two sections one of length unity, and the other of length tau or 1.61803398\u2026 What is less well-known is that if you wrap the line round into a circle, so the cir cle perimeter is divided into lengths of unity and 1.618, then then angle subtended by the unity length of the perimeter at the centre of the circle is 137.507 degrees \u2013 or the Golden Angle.\nThat\u2019s where the story seems to have been left, for a very long time, but I have to wonder, why?

So wishing to stake my claim as the discoverer of the Golden Solid Angle (sent to the Mathematical Gazette on Thursday 14th June 2007) here\u2019s the thing explained for the first time below.\nDivide the surface of a sphere into two regions, one of surface area unity, and the other of surface area 1.618\u2026 The surface area of unity will subtend a solid angle gamma at the centre of the sphere. By noting the total solid angle about a point is 4Pi Steradians, we can derive the following equation for gamma:\n(4Pi \u2013 gamma)\/gamma = 4Pi\/(4Pi \u2013 gamma)\nGiving a quadratic in gamma which can be solved in the usual way to give:\ngamma = 1.52786Pi Steradians or 15757.2 square degrees.\nQuestion is, does anyone out there know where the Golden Solid Angle, gamma, makes an appearance in the Natural world (or basically, anywhere)?"}

{"question":"why are gamma waves dangerous","doc_text":"The Basics of Brain Waves\n\"...this dynamic system is the self in each of us.\"\nW.J. Freeman in How Brains Make Up Their Minds\nBrain waves are generated by the building blocks of your brain -- the individual cells called neurons. Neurons communicate with each other by electrical changes.We can actually see these electrical changes in the form of brain waves as shown in an EEG (electroencephalogram).\nBrain waves are measured in cycles per second (Hertz; Hz is the short form). We also talk about the \"frequency\" of brain wave activity.\nThe lower the number of Hz, the slower the brain activity or the slower the frequency of the activity.\nResearchers in the 1930's and 40's identified several different types of brain waves. Traditionally, these fall into 4 types:\n- Delta waves (below 4 hz) occur during sleep\n- Theta waves (4-7 hz) are associated with sleep, deep relaxation (like hypnotic relaxation), and visualization\n- Alpha waves (8-13 hz) occur when we are relaxed and calm\n- Beta waves (13-38 hz) occur when we are actively thinking, problem-solving, etc.\nSince these original studies, other types of brainwaves have been identified and the traditional 4 have been subdivided.\nSome interesting brainwave additions:\n- The Sensory motor rhythm (or SMR; around 14 hz) was originally discovered to prevent seizure activity in cats. SMR activity seems to link brain and body functions.\n- Gamma brain waves (39-100 hz) are involved in higher mental activity and consolidation of information. An interesting study has shown that advanced Tibetan meditators produce higher levels of gamma than non-meditators both before and during meditation.\nAre you wondering what kind of brain waves you produce?\nPeople tend to talk as if they were producing one type of brain wave (e.g., producing \"alpha\" for meditating).\nBut these aren't really \"separate\" brain waves - the categories are just for convenience.\nThey help describe the changes we see in brain activity during different kinds of activities.\nSo we don't ever produce only \"one\" brain wave type.\nOur overall brain activity is a mix of all the frequencies at the same time, some in greater quantities and strength than others.\nThe meaning of all this? Balance is the key. We don't want to regularly produce too much or too little of any brainwave frequency."}

How does insulation help control indoor temperature, and what health risks do construction workers face from dust exposure?","doc_text":"Construction Accident Lawyers\nThe construction industry is the most dangerous industry in the United States. Every year, there are roughly 150,000 construction accidents according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, approximately 1,000 of which result in death. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has reported that one in ten construction site workers are injured every year, with workers being at most risk between the ages of 25 and 34 years.\nSome of the most common construction accidents causing injury include:\n- Falls from scaffolds, ladders, roofs, elevator shafts, etc.\n- Nail gun, saw, or other power equipment injuries\n- Crane operation injuries\n- Toxic exposure\n- Defective Equipment\nConstruction accident injuries may be substantial, resulting in millions of dollars in damages in any one particular case. If you were injured on a construction site, an experienced lawyer can research your case to determine if the construction company was at fault, or third parties, or in some cases a mixture of both. \u201cThird parties\u201d are companies or workers other than your employer or co-workers. There are a variety of third parties who may be liable for a worker\u2019s injuries at a construction site. These third parties may include general contractors, architects, manufacturers of equipment, other trade companies on the jobsite, etc. The property owner may also be liable in some circumstances. Claims against third parties can become complex, and it is in your best interest to work with a construction accident lawyer who fully understands these claims.\nAn experienced lawyer can help you figure out whether you must submit a claim through Worker\u2019s Compensation. However, because there are limits to the amount of funds that workers may receive under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, a worker may need to pursue additional funds to cover the full extent of injuries that he or she has suffered as a result of construction site injuries. A construction accident lawyer will help a worker to analyze all of the potential claims that exist for him or her.\nSome injuries common to construction accidents include:\n- Traumatic brain injuries\n- Spinal cord injuries\n- Neck and back injuries\n- Joint injuries\n- Broken bones and amputations\n- Burns and electrical shock\nWhile many of these injuries are caused by simple accidents, others could have been prevented if not for the carelessness or negligence of someone else.

These men were given leather riding pants and heavy riding boots.\nA special black uniform for the crews of closed combat vehicles was also introduced in 1935. This uniform consisted of a black, padded beret, which also served as a protective helmet, a two-breasted jacket and long baggy trousers.\nThis uniform, which was worn at first just with the vehicle, was at the same time practical and popular. The black color, which was supplemented by a silver skull insignia on the beret, had a dramatic appearance and added a little bit to the esprit of the young arm. Thus from the beginning of 1940, this uniform was issued to the crews of the self-propelled guns in a field-gray version.\nNevertheless, there were not enough uniforms to completely equip the strong-growing German army. This led to the Germans using the captured uniforms of the Austrian, Czechoslovak, and Polish armies. These were sorted, stored, released from the respective national insignia and temporarily issued to German conscripts in order to bridge the deficiency.\nThe most important method of determining the rank of a member of the German army was through the system of the shoulder straps, which showed not only the rank of the wearer, but also the arm of service, formation, and status.\nIn addition, officers were recognized by their headgear, the peaked cap with silver chin cords, or a side cap with silver piping and the brown leather equipment."}

Then, someone may experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bloody diarrhea (red or black blood in the stool).\nGHRI: Who is most at risk?\nCB: Children under 10, adults over 50, pregnant women, and those who have other illnesses, including cancer and diabetes, are most at risk.\nGHRI: What should someone do if they feel sick?\nCB: If you're experiencing bloody diarrhea, go to the hospital. If you think you might have had a product with peanuts and you're feeling sick, see a doctor. If you're caring for someone who may be sickened by salmonella, try to ensure they are adequately hydrated.\nGHRI: How did Salmonella typhimurium reach the food supply at the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) plant?\nCB: In this case, we don't have the full picture yet, so we don't know how peanuts and peanut products in these plants became contaminated. Peanuts grow on the ground, and the earth can carry pathogens like salmonella. The environment is full of bacteria that could contaminate food. Or, food can be contaminated by other products or poor sanitation of workers. At this point, the source of the peanut outbreak hasn't been identified.\nGHRI: Why have products continually rolled out on the recall list?\nCB: Peanuts and peanut butter have a long shelf life, so things that were shipped in the past could still be in a warehouse or on shelves. Plus, salmonella itself has a long survival time. The combination of these two factors seems to be the culprit.\nGHRI: If a peanut-containing product isn't on the recall list, do you think it's safe to eat? What should consumers do?"}

But today, as an increasingly unpopular war drags on and troops are being sent on second, third or fourth combat tours, the volume of criticism from veterans and even those on active duty is reaching a fevered pitch.\nPerhaps the most telling part of such criticism is how open disgruntled troops are becoming despite the risk to their careers - signing their names to furious letters printed in military-owned newspapers; speaking on the record to reporters in Iraq about how badly the mission is going; writing members of Congress. And then there are the protests in uniform, a throwback to the Vietnam War era, when veterans such as Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., denounced the war in weathered fatigues, throwing away their medals.\nMany of the protests involving vets in uniform are all-out street theater, such as one in Washington last spring where protesters staged a mock patrol, manhandling people at simulated gunpoint in order to illustrate how they say Iraqis are treated by American troops. Just last week in Chicago, a similar protest took place. The intended subtext of the uniformed protests is apparent: that protesters have additional credibility because they are denouncing a war they have witnessed firsthand, that the very uniforms now being used in protest have walked the real-life battlefield."}

{"question":"As a food service consultant, I'm intrigued by the intersection of exotic cuisine and safety regulations. What are some unconventional food items served in restaurants worldwide, and what legal frameworks ensure their safe preparation?","doc_text":"In 1802 the term was applied to an establishment where restorative foods, such as bouillon, a meat broth, were served (\"\u00e9tablissement de restaurateur\").\nTypes [ edit ]\nRestaurants are classified or distinguished in many different ways. The primary factors are usually the food itself (e.g. vegetarian, seafood, steak); the cuisine (e.g. Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, French, Mexican, Thai) or the style of offering (e.g. tapas bar, a sushi train, a tastet restaurant, a buffet restaurant or a yum cha restaurant). Beyond this, restaurants may differentiate themselves on factors including speed (see fast food), formality, location, cost, service, or novelty themes (such as automated restaurants). Some of these include fine dining, casual dining, contemporary casual, family style, fast casual, fast food, cafes, buffet, concession stands, food trucks, pop-up restaurants, diners, and ghost restaurants.\nRestaurants range from inexpensive and informal lunching or dining places catering to people working nearby, with modest food served in simple settings at low prices, to expensive establishments serving refined food and fine wines in a formal setting. In the former case, customers usually wear casual clothing. In the latter case, depending on culture and local traditions, customers might wear semi-casual, semi-formal or formal wear. Typically, at mid- to high-priced restaurants, customers sit at tables, their orders are taken by a waiter, who brings the food when it is ready. After eating, the customers then pay the bill. In some restaurants, such as workplace cafeterias, there are no waiters; the customers use trays, on which they place cold items that they select from a refrigerated container and hot items which they request from cooks, and then they pay a cashier before they sit down. Another restaurant approach which uses few waiters is the buffet restaurant. Customers serve food onto their own plates and then pay at the end of the meal. Buffet restaurants typically still have waiters to serve drinks and alcoholic beverages. Fast food restaurants are also considered a restaurant. In addition, food trucks are another popular option for people who want quick food service.\nTourists around the world can enjoy dining services on railway cars and cruise ships dining rooms, which are essentially traveling restaurants. Many railways dining services cater to the needs of travelers by providing railway refreshment rooms at railway stations."}
{"question":"middle east religious institutions compare modern christian advocacy muslim healthcare legacy","doc_text":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - View original article\n|Part of a series on|\nChristendom has several meanings. In a cultural sense, it refers to the religion itself, or to the worldwide community of Christians, adherents of Christianity. In its historical sense, the term usually refers to the medieval and early modern period, during which the Christian world represented a geopolitical power juxtaposed with both paganism and especially the military threat of the Muslim world. In the more limited and traditional sense of the word, it refers to the sum total of nations in which the Catholic Church is the established religion of the state, or which have ecclesiastical concordats with the Holy See.\n|This section needs additional citations for verification. (February 2013)|\nThe term cristendom existed in Old English, but it had the sense now taken by Christianity (as is still the case with the cognate Dutch christendom , where it denotes mostly the religion itself, just like the German Christentum). The current sense of the word of \"lands where Christianity is the dominant religion\" emerges in Late Middle English (by c. 1400). This semantic development happened independently in the languages of late medieval Europe, which leads to the confusing semantics of English Christendom equalling German Christenheit, French chr\u00e9tient\u00e9 vs. English Christianity equalling German Christentum, French christianisme. The reason is the increasing fragmentation of Western Christianity at that time both in theological and in political respect. \"Christendom\" as a geopolitical term is thus meaningful in the context of the Middle Ages, and arguably during the European wars of religion and the Ottoman wars in Europe.\nThe Christian world is also known collectively as the Corpus Christianum, a translated as the Christian body, meaning the community of all Christians. The Christian polity, embodying a less secular meaning, can be compatible with the idea of both a religious and a temporal body: Corpus Christianum. The Corpus Christianum can be seen as a Christian equivalent of the Muslim Ummah.\nThe word \"Christendom\" is also used with its other meaning to frame-true Christianity.[clarification needed] A more secular meaning can denote that the term Christendom refers to Christians considered as a group, the \"Political Christian World\", as an informal[clarification needed] cultural hegemony that Christianity has traditionally enjoyed in the West."}

{"question":"why study space rocks importance history","doc_text":"The following is the text for an introduction I made at a public event of this year\u2019s Space and Place theme fellows at the Humanities Center at Northeastern. More thoughts on the GeoHumanities are forthcoming.\nThis year\u2019s fellows are exploring the theme of space and place in an interdisciplinary context. To me this represents an exciting opportunity to start a conversation across disciplines at an opportune moment. Across the humanities and social sciences we are experiencing a flourishing of work that takes spatiality seriously. Space and place have often been seen as either a setting for other, more important, processes in culture and society to take place or, alternatively, as the outcome of these processes \u2013 a kind of end product. A series of developments both within disciplines and across disciplines have changed this in fundamental ways.\nFirst of all we have seen what is called the spatial turn across the humanities and social scientists. This refers to a general recognition that social and cultural life do not happen on the head of a pin but are thoroughly spatial. The spatial turn made its presence felt, for instance, in the study of literature, where space and place had been too often relegated to mere setting \u2013 the least active or interesting component in the assemblage of literary texts. Pioneering work by scholars working across disciplines but rooted in literature \u2013scholars such as Raymond Williams and Edward Said \u2013 placed the geography of and in literature at the center of our understanding of the relationship between text and context in ways which enlivened our reading of the canon and started to introduce writing from the previously excluded margins. In History we saw the emergence of spatial history with the magisterial work of Richard White and, particularly, Paul Carter\u2019s Road to Botany Bay \u2013 subtitled \u201can essay in spatial history\u201d. Feminist scholars such as Elizabeth Grosz and Iris Marion Young wove space and place into their accounts of the construction of masculine worlds and their radical alternatives. The spatial turn was given a significant boost when Michel Foucault, whose work of prisons, the asylum and the clinic were all quite radically spatial in nature, became an evangelist for the importance of space in an essay published in 1984.\nThe great obsession of the nineteenth century was, as we know, history: with its themes of development and of suspension, of crisis, and cycle, themes of the ever-accumulating past, with its great preponderance of dead men and the menacing glaciation of the world."}

Antifreeze, a solution of a suitable organic chemical (most often ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or propylene glycol) in water, is used when the water-based coolant has to withstand temperatures below 0 \u00b0C, or when its boiling point has to be raised.\nKey features of an effective radiator coolant are:\n- Effective heat transfer\n- Prevention of cooling system corrosion\n- Effective boiling point\n- Chemical stability\n- Safe for use as directed by manufacturer"}

An increase in glycol concentration causes a reduction in heat transfer by several mechanisms.\nWhat are the Basic Features of a Brewery Chiller?\nThe Brewery Chiller has many basic features that make it remarkable equipment in the brewing industry. The major features that enhance its efficiency and specificity include:\n- P-trap overflow\n- Glycol economizers\n- Hermetic compressor\n- High thermal efficiency tan\n- High flow glycol connections\n- Electronic expansion valves\n- Dual refrigeration circuits\nBrewery chiller hermetic compressor\nWhat are the Main Components of a Brewery Chiller?\nBrewery Chiller has some common components as the other chillers. It comprises tanks and pumps having a range of 31 to 30,000 gallons made up of polyethylene or stainless steel. Other components include:\nA dual compressor is a major component of the Brewery Chiller that ensures the movement of the refrigerant throughout the system and compresses the pressure and volume of the gas.\nAn evaporator absorbs the heat from the worts and fermentation process and sends it to the refrigerant to cool it down. It is placed between the compressor and the expansion valve.\nA control unit is mounted that monitors the efficiency of the Brewery Chiller. Control units have certain alarms for safety reasons that can shut down the system instantly.\nWhat is the Working Process of a Brewery Chiller?\nA Brewery Chiller works by use of a multiple-section heat exchanger that uses chilled glycol and water to circulate heat away from the brew to the refrigeration system or heat exchanger.\nIn the first step, the evaporator absorbs heat from the process and sends it to the refrigerant which is moved throughout the system with the aid of a compressor. A condenser is located next which dissipate this heat.\nThe condenser forwards the refrigerant to expansion value which increases its volume. An expansion value operates by two major components such as a thermal operation valve and a pilot.\nWhich Refrigerant can be used in a Brewery Chiller?\nA refrigerant is an organic compound that is used in Brewery Chiller as a coolant. It acts as an anti-freezing agent, having a high heat absorption rating, and a non-corrosive agent.\nCommonly, a glycol-based coolant is used in a Brewery Chiller. Glycol can be ethylene glycol or propylene glycol mixed with water."}

{"question":"why is aging process hard to understand for scientists","doc_text":"4 Basic Causes Behind Skin Aging You Should Understand\nThere are different causes behind skin aging and they are the following: aging caused by hormones, aging caused by environmental factors, aging caused by lifestyle factors and aging caused by genetic factors. Getting older is a normal process that all of us will eventually experience.\nThe skin\u2019s texture and appearance changes as we age. To keep your skin look youthful, one of the things that you can do is to nurture it with nourishing products such as argan oil anti aging . Additionally, to know the proper steps to take in delaying aging, one needs to understand the different causes behind it. Aging caused by hormones Dry and thin skin, poor skin quality, less elasticity, pimple problems and wrinkles are all signs of a hormonal aging process.\nHormone level changes are linked to hormonal aging. Depending on the production and fluctuation of the hormones involved, this type of aging can happen early in a person\u2019s life or much later. Hormonal aging is commonly associated with a woman\u2019s menopausal stage or the pre-menopausal and post-menopausal stages. The environment as a contributing factor to skin aging Aging brought about by environmental factors is categorized as an extrinsic aging process. It is caused by external factors rather than by the body\u2019s internal processes. Pollution and radiation from the sun are two of the factors involved.\nThe sun\u2019s radiation can damage the DNA and destroys the skin\u2019s natural regeneration ability. Environmental aging usually occurs prematurely so it can happen to anyone regardless of age. But, with proper skincare, this type of aging can be avoided. Wrinkles, brittle and dry skin, as well as hyper-pigmentation are among the signs of this type of skin aging. Lifestyle factors can cause aging There are also certain lifestyle factors that can contribute to premature aging. The aging of the skin can either be delayed or accelerated, depending on the person\u2019s good or bad habits.\nCigarette smoking is one bad habit that have a negative effect on the skin. Research has shown that the skin becomes dry and wrinkled when a person constantly smokes because smoking diminishes vitamin C in the body. Exposing your skin to too much sun is also a bad habit that hastens skin aging. As previously mentioned, the sun is among the elements in the environment that can lead to premature skin aging. Sunscreen with a high SPF factor will protect your skin from the harmful rays of the sun."}

For Siskind, subject matter had become less important than creating photographs that were \u201cpsychological in character.\u201d\nSiskind\u2019s preoccupation with shape, line, and gesture drew comparisons with abstract expressionist painting. He knew many of the artists associated with the movement and was particularly friendly with Franz Kline who in the late 1950s paid homage to Siskind in a series of paintings named after him. Siskind returned the honor in a body of work made between 1972 and 1975. Comprised of six groups of images of walls taken in different places, including Boston, Rome, Jalapa, Mexico, and Lima, Peru, the series Homage to Franz Kline evokes the dynamic feel of Kline\u2019s paintings as exemplified by Jalapa 47 (lot 167, $1,200-1,800).\nSiskind pursued abstract imagery for the remainder of his career. His final body of work captures the dark curvilinear shapes of road tar against weathered and textured asphalt. The story goes that he drove around with a companion to search for \u201cpoetic\u201d tar to photograph. In 1989, he produced a portfolio of six photogravures from his Tar Abstracts series (lot 169, $5,000-7,000).

For instance, in combating \u201clocavore\u201d accusations that large firms jeopardize food safety because of the alleged potential of mass contamination, the authors make the positive point that one of the very reasons large firms exist is because they can produce much safer food:\nthe threat of food contamination by natural pathogens is much more serious in small than massive food production and processing operations because smaller operations can never possibly assemble the same quality of equipment and food safety know-how as much larger firms.\nThis method of combating the negative with the positive is not occasional or accidental\u2013it is pervasive, and a result of the central question the book asks of the locavore movement, which is \u201cwhy the globalized food supply chain had developed the way it did in the first place\u201d given that it is supposedly so irrational?\nThis seemingly simple question leads the authors to focus on the fact that the modern agricultural system is the result of the intelligent choices of free individuals\u2013and that the essence of the \u201clocavore\u201d movement is to deny them those choices. The \u201clocavore\u201d criticisms are plausible only because they hold modern agriculture to the standard of infallibility, and then assume, bizarrely, that \u201clocavorism\u201d could solve all of the problems while retaining all the achievements.

Although the writer denies the book is an allegory of war, people believe he was affected considerably by the very first and 2nd World Wars. My study question was \"exactly how did the Two World Wars Influence John Ronald Reuel Tolkien During the Creation of \u201c god of the Rings\u201d Trilogy ?\" . I am going to analyze the similarities amongst the activities into the novel as well as the events during two globe wars and make an effort to point out just how Tolkien had been influenced by these. The main allegory may be the struggle amongst the ultimate evil of Sauron (ie. Nazism and Fascism) and the free individuals of Middle Earth. Although evil is a lot more powerful and aggressive initially, the dedication and valor of a coalition of unlikely allies wins ultimately. Many points exist in the novel being straight pertaining to the events throughout the globe conflicts. Nazi Germany, defeated and repressed following the First World War, rises once more as an over-industrialized, dangerous nation, wanting to spread its influence worldwide. It is just like Sauron and the forces of evil, beaten when you look at the Second Age because of the coalition of elves and people, rises all over again to jeopardize Middle Earth and enslave its folks. SS soldiers, performing unspeakable deeds throughout the Holocaust remind united states of mindless orcs whom complete the requests of the masters without thinking. The uneasy alliance created because of the democratic capitalist nations utilizing the communist Russians through the Second World War is a lot like the alliance of elves and dwarves; even though they aren't keen on each other, they unite against a standard enemy. Geographic similarities; the role of the Nazgul and V2 rockets; the similarity of Sauron's military aided by the German war machine; Saruman's similarity to Mussolini; the likeness of Dead Marshes to your battlefields of Somme are also small but essential things."}

{"question":"neural development toddler brain adolescent brain compare","doc_text":"Indeed, according to this measure, humans have the largest coefficient of taste (7.5), which is much larger than that of the dolphin (5.3) and the mouse (0.5).\nBut does having a bigger brain mean your intelligence level is higher?\nSome studies will answer yes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has enabled scientists to compare the size of the brain to some human beings and sought to link these measurements to the intelligence of those humans.\nStatistical meta-analyzes of 26 different studies showed that the level of association between brain size and intelligence ranged from 0.3-0.4. More recently, genome-wide association studies on more than 20,000 human samples have revealed the discovery of a gene associated with the determination of an individual\u2019s intelligence level.\nAccording to the results of the study, the difference in the gene (HMGA2), which is responsible for the composition of the protein that regulates DNA copies and cell growth, is associated with increased internal volume of the skull and IQ as well.\nTo be honest, I find this correlation somewhat confusing. It is clear that there is a Mai that affects the level of intelligence more than the size of the brain otherwise Albert Einstein was the world\u2019s feat and the average brain size is unlucky. It is important to think about how to define intelligence and to keep in mind that the studies mentioned above show a correlation between brain volume as a result of an individual in the IQ test.\nAlthough this test is the most widely used in history, it can not in any case measure all aspects of human intelligence nor be a constant display of all cognitive abilities of individuals.\nFortunately, more information can be detected when we look at the brain in more detail. Many scientists now believe that the complication of the cellular and molecular structure of neural connections or synapses is the true determinant of the computational power of the brain.\nThis view is also supported by the findings that IQ is more closely related to frontal and gray matter volumes, which contain more dense numbers of neurons and synapses, than to the total size of the brain. Another research comparing the proteins at the ends of neural engagement in different organisms suggests that the components of synapses at the molecular level have a huge impact on IQ during the evolutionary history of organisms.\nSo even though having a large brain is a predictor of greater intelligence, IQ probably depends more on the extent that different parts of the human brain communicate effectively with one another."}
{"question":"sensory processing disorder misophonia differences triggers","doc_text":"These studies indicate that depersonalization is a symptom that involves differences in sensory perception and subjective experiences.\nHISTORICAL. Depersonalization disorder may be a reflection of changes in people's sense of self or personal identity within Western cultures since the eighteenth century. Historians of psychiatry have noted that whereas some mental disorders, such as depression, have been reported since the beginnings of Western medicine, no instances of the dissociative disorders were recorded before the 1780s. It seems that changes in social institutions and the structure of the family since the mid-eighteenth century may have produced a psychological structure in Westerners that makes individuals increasingly vulnerable to self disorders\u2014as they are now called. Experiences of the unreality of one's body or one's self, such as those that characterize depersonalization disorder, presuppose a certain notion of how the self is presumed to feel. The emphasis on individualism and detachment from one's family is a mark of adult maturity in contemporary Western societies that appears to be a contributing factor to the frequency of dissociative symptoms and disorders.\nThe symptoms of depersonalization disorder have been described earlier. Although DSM-IV-TR does not specify a list of primary symptoms of depersonalization, British clinicians generally consider the triad of emotional numbing, changes in visual perception, and altered experience of one's body to be important core symptoms of depersonalization disorder.\nDSM-IV-TR notes that patients with depersonalization disorder frequently score high on measurements of hypnotizability.\nThe lifetime prevalence of depersonalization disorder in the general population is unknown, possibly because many people are made anxious by episodes of depersonalization and afraid to discuss them with a primary care physician. One survey done by the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) indicates that about half of the adults in the U.S. have had one or two brief episodes of depersonalization in their lifetimes, usually resulting from severe stress. About a third of people exposed to life-threatening dangers develop brief periods of depersonalization, as do 40% of psychiatric inpatients.\nDepersonalization disorder is diagnosed about twice as often in women as in men. It is not known, however, whether this sex ratio indicates that women are at greater risk for the disorder or if they are more likely to seek help for its symptoms, or both."}

{"question":"I'm fascinated by exotic fish breeding behaviors. What are the typical spawning patterns and egg development processes across different tropical fish species?","doc_text":"The Brook Trout is a species of fish in the Salmonidae family. Some other members of the family include various salmon, char, grayling, and whitefish species. People in different regions call this fish by different names, including coaster, mud trout, squaretail, brook char, and more. Read on to learn about the Brook Trout.\nDescription of the Brook Trout\nThis species has dark colored scales, with light and red colored speckles across its body, and a red abdomen. This coloration becomes more vibrant in spawning males. Size varies based on the region and the individual.\nThese fish generally measure between 10 and 26 in. long, and weigh between 1 and 6 lbs. However, exceptionally large individuals can reach up to 34 in. and 15 lbs.\nInteresting Facts About the Brook Trout\nThese fish have a number of interesting traits and behaviors. Learn more about what makes this species unique, below.\n- Popular Fish \u2013 Nine different U.S. states consider this species their state fish, including West Virginia, Michigan, Virginia, New Hampshire, Vermont, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and North Carolina.\n- Hybrids \u2013 This species sometimes breeds with the closely related lake trout. When this occurs, they produce hybrid offspring known as splake. Though fast-growing, most splake cannot reproduce.\n- Invasive Populations \u2013 Humans introduced this species to several places outside of their native range. Invasive populations exist in New Zealand, Europe, and Argentina. The impact of these populations varies based on the region.\n- Coasters \u2013 One population of this species lives primarily in the great lakes, and migrates out to nearby rivers and streams to reproduce. People in these regions call this group \u201ccoasters\u201d and have historically utilized them as a source of food and for sport fishing.\nHabitat of the Brook Trout\nDifferent populations live in different habitat types. Some populations utilize freshwater habitats their entire lives. Other populations have anadromous life cycles, and travel to the ocean for their adult life, returning to freshwater to spawn.\nSome of the different types of ecosystems that these fish inhabit include lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, coastal seas, estuaries, and more.\nDistribution of the Brook Trout\nThe natural range of this species extends throughout North America. You can find this species as far north as Canada, and as far south as the southern United States."}
{"question":"How do wave power plants impact marine ecosystems and what are their effects on global pollution compared to other energy sources?","doc_text":"We looked at daily rainfall and snowfall records from 1948 to 2011, identified the largest storms at each weather station, and analyzed when those storms occurred and how much precipitation fell with each.\nAnother key finding of our report is that the biggest rainstorms are getting bigger. The amount of precipitation released by the largest annual storms in Minnesota increased by 12 percent from 1948 to 2011.\nWhile scientists predict that the trend toward more storms with extreme precipitation will only intensify as a result of global warming, there are actions we can take to minimize the danger.\nScientists tell us that we have very little time in which to prevent the worst effects of global warming \u2014 and a great deal of work to do. The good news is that the pollution reductions called for by scientists are achievable, and we already have started putting some of the most important pollution-reduction strategies to work.\nAt the federal level, the Obama administration has proposed carbon-pollution and fuel-efficiency standards for new cars and trucks through 2025, as well as carbon-pollution standards for new power plants. Vehicles and power plants are the two largest sources of carbon pollution, so getting these proposed standards finalized and on the books this year is critical to tackling global warming.\nWhile these are important steps, we need to do much more at the state, local and federal levels if we expect future generations not to judge us as neglectful, delinquent stewards of our nation.\nNow is the time for us to come together to solve this challenging problem and embrace solutions that will leave our planet better for generations to come."}

Marine plastics are also an area of research mainly the presence of microplastics. The data will be useful for future monitoring programs and environmental risk evaluation.\nThe effects of these pollutants (biomarkers) are being studied in aquatic organisms (bioindicators) to understand the mode of action of these pollutants and their negative impact to the wellbeing of these organisms and how these organisms deal with the exposure to these pollutants.\nIn more detail, our research focus in three main lines: 1) establishment and validation of biomarkers and bioindicator species as early warning tools for the presence of classical and emerging contaminants, in estuarine and coastal environments, 2) study the regulation and functioning of detoxification processes in fish species and to evaluate the potential of emergent contaminants to modulate them, and 3) assessment for the presence of microplastics in marine ecosystems and potential effects to the biota.\n\u25cf Assessment of damage caused to the aquatic ecosystem from the sewage spillage in the Cunningham River\nSewage spillages are among the major contributors to aquatic pollution in estuaries and coastal areas. Raw human wastewater contain a mixture of contaminants, that include high concentrations of organic compounds such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous. Biodegradation of the sewage organics result in the production of inorganic nutrients (such as nitrate and ortho-phosphorous) which lead to eutrophication of the aquatic environment. Eutrophication is a known consequence of sewages discharges that seriously impacts the health and development of most organisms inhabiting any aquatic environment. Sewage also contains heavy metals and these can bio-accumulate in fish and shellfish making them unhealthy and unsafe for consumption.

{"question":"toxic waste dump locations minority communities research history first study","doc_text":"You can then let Minemax Scheduler find an optimal solution that jointly considers the block\u2019s source locations as well as its range of possible final destinations. Using this integrated approach will lead to a truly optimal solution that maximizes the net present value of the project. The integrated approach is particularly beneficial for modelling accurate trucking requirements because we calculate truck hours based on correct cycle times to the final waste dump location rather than \u201crough estimates\u201d to an arbitrary point.\nThis allows us to use the correct total truck hours as a maximum capacity constraint for the optimization process. To improve the accuracy even more, we can also use trucking costs as an input to the financial model used by Scheduler to make its optimization decisions. Not convinced yet? Let\u2019s take a closer look at some examples.\nTraditional vs Integrated Approach\nTo compare these two approaches, we modelled an example of a mine operation with one pit, one waste dump and one processing plant to optimize a 12-year schedule in Minemax Scheduler.\nThe Traditional Approach\nFirst, we modelled our example using estimated waste trucking to demonstrate the traditional approach. For this, we used estimated cycle times from the block pit location out to a centroid of the waste dump, determined the total truck hours and used them to constrain the capacity of the schedule. Then we ran an optimization on the model to find the best schedule that maximizes NPV, and viewed reports with trucking requirements per time period.\nThe movement chart for the traditional approach shows an optimal schedule utilizing a maximum of 50 trucks to move the ore and waste material.\nThe Integrated Approach\nNext, we modified the basic model using the integrated approach. We imported a detailed waste dump model split into separate dump lifts and smaller \u201ccells\u201d on each dump lift, set appropriate precedences between the cells and calculated waste truck hours based on cycle times to the individual cells in the waste dump. Then we optimized the model and viewed the reports with the movement chart showing the trucking requirements per year.\nThe movement chart for the integrated approach shows a need for up to two additional trucks between years 2010 and 2014 when compared to the traditional approach.\nThis means that if we used the traditional approach for this scenario, we would have underestimated the number of trucks in our schedule, leaving us one or two trucks short of being able to move all the material according to the planned schedule. So the mine plan that was produced using the traditional approach is in effect, not practically achievable."}

It is designed to protect people and pets from sharp and potentially dangerous metal edging. Metal \/ Steel edging is commonly used as a border to separate landscaping materials. Because of its simplicity, low cost, crisp and curvy style, and ease of installation, metal strips are an effective solution for lawn edging. However, the exposed metal edge is very sharp, and many children and pets are injured from metal edging every day. Many home owners have purchased homes and are unaware of the dangerous exposed metal edging that was used in their landscaping. Most realize the danger after it is too late, and they are making a trip to the veterinarian or emergency room. Removing and replacing metal edging with another type of edging can be very laborious and costly. Even disposing of metal edging can be a safety concern. Now, there is no need to remove the existing metal edging as Guard-n-Edge can be easily installed over the existing metal edging to convert it into a safe and decorative border.

{"question":"rainwater tank install location considerations water harvest","doc_text":"Klik hier om dit artikel in het Nederlands te lezen.\nDuring my most recent trip to Uganda I have spent more than three wonderful, but also very impressive weeks at the location of HWMCO-Uganda; I was part of the daily activities organized for the children, that way continuously interacting with them and learning more and more about them and their world. Usually, the children come to take part in activities on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, when they are free from school, but during the period I spent with them they were having a school holiday of several weeks; always during school holidays they come to the location both on weekdays and during the weekends.\nEvery day, the children would show up in the morning, first of all officially greeting everyone of the team with a humble, \u201cgood morning\u201d. The day would then start with the children contributing their part in maintaining the location; some were assisting in cleaning the room where many activities take place, others started watering plants and trees, sweeping the location, or weeding the garden. Whenever they noticed me around while they were carrying out their tasks, a proud smile would appear on their faces.\nAfter the children had then washed their hands and feet with fresh water taken from the rainwater tank, they would be divided into several groups for activities to get started. A group of children would collect their brass band instruments, for them to exercise notes and melodies; another group, all of them girls, started exercising juggling; some of the older girls took part in knitting and crochet activities; others enjoyed themselves with activities such as jumping rope or playing soccer. Throughout the day the groups would change and also small groups of children would be taken apart for educational purposes. Whenever they got thirsty they could go into the activity room where boiled water from the rainwater tank was available for them to drink.\nFor myself, I would be found playing educational games with groups of children, puzzling with them or teaching them in counting. Also, I was involved with the knitting and crochet activities. Knitting is hardly known in Uganda, it had shortly been introduced to the girls a few months earlier, but they had not been able to do it on themselves. Crochet is much better known, there I could only add to their skills. I also introduced French knitting to them.\nBeing very aware of the importance of it for just every child, I made sure to give them some personal attention in everything I did. On some Sundays I surprised the children with pancakes."}

No one predicted that Trump will win white. And I think I think what's interesting is we still lean up against correlation and big data. So I fundamentally believe that it starts with the art first was this Small data, then you can use science whether science is big data, mining of data, artificial intelligence, or if it is, neuroscience and, and stuff in the science world.\nEric: And what do you think obviously, there's a big part of the industry, especially in the advertising world that is driven by and really worships creativity, coming up with something that they would probably argue that data doesn't tell you. Maybe it gives you the insight and the direction, but it doesn't give you the idea. And then of course, you can weave into here the whole conversation about AI and how it's never going to replace creative directors and all that stuff. But you know, the other thing, of course, well known quote, of if I ask people what I wanted the Henry Ford thing, it would have been a faster horse, not a car. Well, how do you think about the space for and the need for creativity? And I'd say intuition.

You can connect the dots, you don't know how you're doing it, but you know what the outcome is. So that may be art. In the end of the day. I'm a huge fan of creativity and always believed in creativity. But let's just be frank, Eric creativity is dead. And advertising agency selling creativity is dead, there's very few of them left. Because they become prostitutes, they have sold out through data would quite often do a blurry data, for the sake of pleasing a client so they could wash their hands internally and justify direction without being fired."}
{"question":"west nile fever ebola symptoms comparison","doc_text":"Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia experienced the widespread Ebola virus outbreaks last year and a new report has shown that as many as 10,900 extra malaria deaths may have occurred last year due to the disruption of healthcare services in the three countries in west Africa. The interruption of insecticide treated net (ITN) delivery resulted in an additional 3,900 deaths.\nThese new estimates of malaria deaths that would have been prevented by health systems when functioning normally, suggest that the west African Ebola outbreak could have resulted in comparable number of malaria deaths as those due to Ebola itself (8981 by Feb 1, 2015). However, the findings also indicate that implementing mass drug administration (MDA) and ITN campaigns to coincide with the 2015 malaria transmission season in May\/June could largely mitigate the impact of Ebola on malaria.\nLead author Dr Patrick Walker explained that the ongoing Ebola epidemic in parts of west Africa largely overwhelmed already fragile healthcare systems in 2014 making adequate care for malaria impossible and threatening to jeopardise progress made in malaria control and elimination over the past decade.\nThe worst case scenario, assuming that the Ebola epidemic led to a complete end to malaria care, shows that the number of untreated malaria cases could have increased by 45% (1.6 million) in Guinea, 88% (1.3 million) in Sierra Leone, and 140% (0.52 million) in Liberia in 2014. Around half of these cases are expected to occur in children under the age of 5. What is more, lapses in ITN delivery could have led to another 0.84 million malaria cases in 2014.\nThe new estimates also suggest that an absence of clinic and hospital care would have increased malaria deaths by 35% (5600 deaths) in Guinea, 50% (3900) in Sierra Leone, and 62% (1500) in Liberia in 2014. Moreover, the authors estimate that in 2015, pre-Ebola levels of healthcare provision would be responsible for preventing 15600 malaria deaths highlighting the urgent need to support health system recovery.\nTheir projections suggest that emergency MDA campaigns can be a highly effective method to reduce further malaria mortality and the burden of non-Ebola fever cases upon still fragile health systems in 2015."}
{"question":"From an accessibility standpoint, I'd like to know if nuclear liver scans require more specialized facilities compared to bone radiography equipment?","doc_text":"Piezosurgery for Treatment of Large Recurrent Mandibular Osteoma\nOsteomas are infrequent benign bone tumors of uncertain etiology. They are usually situated at extremities and their occurrence in the jaws is relatively rare. There are 3 types of osteoma: central, peripheral, and extraskeletal. Preoperative presumptive diagnosis is performed by means of radiography using orthopantomographs, computerized tomographs, or cone beam scans. Treatment is surgical and consists of careful exeresis and curettage of the adjacent tissue. In recent years, piezoelectric surgery has been used to treat bone pathologies in the maxillofacial area, orthopedic surgery, and neurosurgery. When used for the exeresis of a bone lesion, the device minimizes risks and eliminates possible complications arising from affectation of the vascular and nerve structures close to the lesion.Objective:\nThis clinical report describes a peripheral mandibular osteoma situated in the left mandibular basilar which recurred 45 years after surgical treatment at another center.Methods:\nFor resection, the surgical approach followed the scar remaining from the earlier surgery and was performed using piezoelectric surgery. Surgery did not cause hemorrhagic complications, affect the sensitivity of the left labial menton, or cause paralysis of the lower lip.Conclusions:\nBased on the present patient, it may be concluded that mandibular osteoma treatment by means of piezoelectric surgery makes precise exeresis possible with less affectation of the important surrounding structures such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve."}

As Award winners in their own right, these finalists represent the very best of engineering with the national judging panel seeking to identify those unique finalists that demonstrate outstanding excellence, innovation and best practice.\nABOUT THE PROJECT\nThe Memorial Walk in Newcastle provides a key link between Bar Beach and Strzelecki for pedestrian traffic whilst providing amazing views of the ocean to the East and Newcastle City to the West. Opened on Anzac Day 2015, the walk also pays homage to the Anzac Spirit and servicemen from the Hunter Region that fought in the First World War, and functions as both a tourist attraction and permanent war memorial.\nIntegrated into the walk is 160m of suspended footbridge, floating up to 10m above adjacent ground level. Curved stainless steel trusses form both the main structural elements of the bridge as well as represent the DNA of the soldiers that fought in World War 1, as it is DNA testing which is currently being used to identify soldiers that never made it home.\nNorthrop Consulting Engineers developed the design of the bridge in conjunction with EJE Architecture. As the structure of the project is the key aesthetic focal point for the project, the structural components serve both loadbearing and sculptural functions.\nThe bridge floats above the Strzelecki cliffs, which are approximately 80m above the adjacent beach. Hence, site constraints and constructability considerations added further complications to the structural design of the bridge, with off-site construction a must from both a staging and WHS perspective. The fabricated stainless steel bridge sections and precast concrete columns were chosen as the primary structural elements as these materials allow for the strict quality control required whilst limiting dangerous site works."}

It is perfect for smoothies. Most protein powders are not good for smoothies because they are made with protein concentrates and isolates, foods stripped of everything but the protein.\nUnlike real foods, protein concentrates and isolates are missing the nutrients that make food taste good. In other words, they can ruin a good smoothie. With enough trial and error, you can make these protein powders work, but how many chalky smoothies are you willing to make?\nAnother reason why drink wholesome is perfect for smoothies is that it is sweetened with monk fruit. Monk fruit, also known as lo han guo, is a small, melon-like round fruit native to Southeast Asia. Monk fruit sweetener is made by removing the seeds and skin, crushing the fruit, and collecting the juice, which is then dried into a powder.\nWe use monk fruit sweetener because it has a sweetness similar to that of sugar. Artificial sweeteners and stevia, on the other hand, are either way too sweet, or have a bitter aftertaste. Order samples to experience the monk fruit sweetness for yourself.\nNow without further ado, here is the best peanut butter banana protein shake recipe.\n-1 cup ice\n-1 cup dairy-free milk\n-\u00bd cup drink wholesome peanut butter protein powder\n-1 ripe banana\n-1 tbsp peanut butter\nPlace all of the ingredients in a blender and blend for 30 seconds.

{"question":"How does competition work in the Tomiki aikido system?","doc_text":"Re: Is is it still Aikido if you take away the Japanese clothes, etiquette and other things?\nYes and yes. Yes, the instructional paradigm of aikido includes transmission from reiho. The etiquette happens to be Japanese and based upon a pre-modern Japan in many respects. Yes, aikido is still aikido without these alternative transmission devices. I think you can argue a need to replace those elements lost without the transmission device. I think you can argue aikido does not offer a complete education if it does not contain the elements. Of course if you argue this you need to consider the entirety of excluded curriculum as being damaging to aikido...\nI think we should naturally strive towards a goal of expressing aiki in any surrounding, under any conditions. This is difficult enough, let alone placing constraints on what you wear or how you act...\nI can appreciate the need for rei to help with all those lessons you learn by observation. I do not mean to discount their value and personally I belive that those lessons need learning. But I do not think removing them makes aikido less - it just places a creative burden on sensei to find a way to effectively teach those lessons.\nI am glad that aikido was not developed in the US in the 90's. Can you imagine the balloon pants...? Please Hammer, don't hurt 'em."}
{"question":"How does competition work in the Tomiki aikido system?","doc_text":"Although aikido is a relatively recent innovation within the world of martial arts, it is heir to a rich cultural and philosophical background. Aikido was created in Japan by a man named Morihei Ueshiba. Before creating aikido, Ueshiba trained extensively in several varieties of jujitsu, as well as sword and spear fighting. Ueshiba also immersed himself in religious studies and developed an ideology devoted to universal socio-political harmony. Incorporating these principles into his martial art, Ueshiba developed many aspects of aikido in concert with his philosophical and religious ideology.\nAikido is not primarily a system of combat, but rather a means of self-cultivation and improvement. Aikido has no tournaments, competitions, contests, or \"sparring.\" Instead, all aikido techniques are learned cooperatively at a pace commensurate with the abilities of each trainee. According to the founder, the goal of aikido is not the defeat of others, but the defeat of the negative characteristics which inhabit one's own mind and inhibit its functioning.\nAt the same time, the potential of aikido as a means of self-defense should not be ignored. One reason for the prohibition of competition in aikido is that many aikido techniques would have to be excluded because of their potential to cause serious injury. By training cooperatively, even potentially lethal techniques can be practiced without substantial risk.\nIt must be emphasized that there are no shortcuts to proficiency in aikido (or in anything else, for that matter). Consequently, attaining proficiency in aikido is simply a matter of sustained and dedicated training. No one becomes an expert in just a few months or even a few years.\nText on this page excerpted from The Aikido Primer by Eric Sotnak."}
{"question":"How do adult and fetal lung progenitor cells compare to autologous versus allogeneic CAR T-cells in terms of their therapeutic potential and implementation challenges?","doc_text":"Transplantation of Bmi1\u2013\/\u2013 fetal liver cells resulted in only transient hematopoietic cell reconstitution, suggesting that the transplanted mutant fetal liver HSCs failed to generate more HSCs but gave rise to multipotent progenitors that could sustain hematopoiesis for up to 4\u20138 weeks. Similarly, Bmi1 is needed for the maintenance of neural stem cells found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. As with HSCs, the reduced self-renewal of Bmi1-deficient neural stem cells led to their postnatal depletion in vivo, but the proliferation and survival of committed progenitor cells were essentially normal (26). Given the broad ranges of phenotypic changes in Bmi1-deficient mice, including posterior transformation and neurological abnormalities (31), and its broad tissue distribution (32), it is likely that Bmi1 regulates the self-renewal of other types of somatic stem cells.\nmay also play a key role in some types of cancer (33\u201335). In approximately 11% of cases of mantle cell lymphoma, the malignant cells have a three- to sevenfold amplification of Bmi1 DNA and express high levels of the protein, implicating this gene in this invariably lethal form of lymphoma. In a mouse model of leukemia, Bmi1 was essential for the maintenance of leukemic cells (36). Enforced expression of Hoxa9\/Meis-1 in both normal and Bmi1-deficient mouse fetal liver cells, followed by transplantation, initially resulted in infiltration of the bone marrow by cells that looked like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts, and mice developed a bone marrow infiltrate that resembled AML. However, only Bmi1 wild-type AML could be serially transplanted. Taken together with the detection of high levels of Bmi1 in human AML stem cells (25), these results suggest that Bmi1 is also required for the self-renewal of leukemic stem cells.\nIn WI-38 human fetal lung fibroblasts, Bmi1 is downregulated when the cells undergo replicative senescence, but not when they are quiescent. Additionally, Bmi1 extends replicative lifespan but does not induce immortalization when overexpressed (37)."}

When combined with project management discipline, both concepts provide numerous benefits to an organization and reduce the chance of a project failure.\nAgile PM can produce a better quality product since it comes with built-in safeguards which allow itself to maintain its highest possible value. A few of the techniques it employs is it takes advantage of the automated testing tools to determine defects in a 24-hour cycle. This behavior permits the development team to be proactive during implementation. Another advantage of agile process is it allows for the development team to conduct \u2018lessons-learned\u2019 after each sprint cycle. A sprint cycle is a two-three week development where the team focuses on specific task items to be finished within the spring cycle.\nAnother benefit to agile project management is it can stimulate team morale and increased collaboration and ownership between team members. Agile development allows team members to be self-regulated and this privilege can encourage creativity and innovation. Since agile development operates on a sprint cycle; this pushes each team member to work together on a daily basis to discuss and review progression and roadblocks which sponsors collaboration and ownership of the product.\nAgile project management is incredibly powerful to an organization; however, it requires an experience project manager as well as a skilled agile manager to see the benefits.

As of 2017, 71% of American brands are already on Instagram. In 2019, this percentage likely exceeds 80-85%, bearing in mind the yearly growth rate of nearly 50%. With so many users you can imagine how any Instagram mistakes you make can be costly.\nIn fact, such a vast presence of brands on Instagram doesn\u2019t mean that each of those businesses managed to utilize the service wisely. Many companies still struggle to increase the number of their followers, expand their reach, and eventually drive traffic to their website by the means of Instagram by making various social media mistakes.\nYet if you failed once in your marketing endeavors, it\u2019s not time to give up. Online entrepreneurship is more than just a knowledge of how to create a website for a small business and put your offers in there.

{"question":"services available schizophrenia treatment social support medication therapy residential care","doc_text":"In most cases, the recovery phase will involve a variety of treatment methods, such as counseling sessions, peer support, and if needed, medical care. Treatment is also adjusted depending on the needs of the patient.\nTreatment of psychological addiction to drugs is usually done in the second phase of the inpatient rehabilitation process. This second part of treatment is crucial, because when a person starts to abuse a drug, not only does the physical body become addicted, but so does the mind. Treating psychological struggles with addiction are just as important as addressing the physical symptoms.\nIf staying at a drug rehab center is not for you, then, there are outpatient treatment options available. With outpatient services, you can live at home while attending substance abuse treatment sessions for several days a week at the rehabilitation facility.\nOutpatient rehab programs are similar to inpatient rehab services in that there are different types of treatment depending on the types and intensity of services available. Outpatient treatment programs can vary in length. Some intensive outpatient programs can require a minimum of 9 hours and up to 20 hours of participation in treatment per week. Patients can take part in this type of program for two months and up to one year if needed. Matching the patient with the right treatment program will depend on the level of severity of the addiction, the length of time they have been using the drug, and their health and life commitments.\nIndividuals enrolled in outpatient programs will also have the options of individual and group therapy, support groups, medication treatments, and workshops on life-coping skills.\nCompleting your initial rehabilitation phase is just part of the recovery process. Depending on your level of addiction and particular needs, you may also need to look at extended care and possibly long-term rehab.\nPatients that seek support for lifelong sobriety will choose one of these options. When looking at ongoing care, you can also choose between inpatient residential programs and outpatient programs.\nThere are also options for people who may not be ready to return home once they complete rehab. Sober-living homes can provide living arrangements during an individual\u2019s extended care process. This works as a transitional period and atmosphere until a person is ready to go back into society.\nLong-term rehabilitation is the same as inpatient rehab, but for a more extended period, that can range from 6 to 12 months. This type of rehabilitation is helpful for individuals that are severely addicted or may be at risk for chronic relapse."}

It was proposed to construct a bridge over the Ohio River into West Virginia at that location. A report completed for the West Virginia Department of Highways (WVDOH) in 1964 recommended a bridge over the Ohio River near the Fort Steuben Bridge, and a limited-access freeway on the hillside northwest of Harmon Creek Valley to Marland Heights. It would include connections to WV Route 2 and OH Route 7.\nIn 1970, Wilbur Smith & Associates prepared the US 22 Feasibility Study for the WVDOH, the Jefferson County Regional Planning Commission, and the Ohio Department of Highways which evaluated six alternative alignments for US Route 22 through Ohio and West Virginia. 3 Four of the alignments would cross the river near the Fort Steuben Bridge, and the other two would cross the river upstream at or near Alikanna. It was heavily favored that a new crossing would be located just south of the Fort Steuben Bridge because of its central location to Steubenville and Weirton. 1 By November 1972, it was determined that an alignment 500 feet downstream from the Fort Steuben Bridge.\nThe proposed river structure was a unique cable-stayed box girder bridge that would provide 800 feet of horizontal clearance and 69 feet of vertical clearance above a normal pool. 3 It would include two 12-foot lanes in each direction with a 12-foot outside and 6-foot inside shoulder with the ability to restripe the bridge for three lanes in each direction with 3-foot shoulders. The proposed bridge would tie into the ultimate upgrading of US Route 22 in the region, including a freeway (completed in 1972) from Harmon Creek Road in Weirton proceeding eastward toward Pittsburgh and freeway proposals in Ohio."}

Stigma has contributed to the scarcity of adequate treatment centers that provide short- and long-term care; lack of insurance coverage and reimbursement; lack of trained providers; macro- and micro-aggression towards those with OUD, their families and even their treatment providers.\nI believe some ways we as a community can help increase the ratio of recovery from OUD are by: understanding and accepting that those with OUD are not the blame for their illness and neither are they in control of it; using non-stigmatizing language; recognizing that OUD is a lifelong illness that needs the chronic disease model of management; and encouraging, supporting and lobbying for the use of treatment with medication for this devastating disease.\nHere in West Virginia, treatment with medication is available. Treatment with medication works.\nRetired; Chairperson, Pocahontas County Prevention Coalition\nI, unfortunately, came to know all about stigma when my two daughters developed opiate use disorder (OUD) and both died of an overdose.\nStigma keeps problems and awareness in the shadows. People don\u2019t want to talk about substance use disorder (SUD) thinking they are the only ones who have been affected by this affliction. Without knowledge and discussion, stigma delays diagnosis and treatment.\nStigma can prevent people from welcoming harm reduction programs, treatment facilities, and sober living houses into their communities. Stigma can even affect the method of treatment of the disease and undermine the data supporting treatment with medication, which has proven to be the standard of care.\nAccording to the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration, medication with treatment reduces heroin use and overdose deaths. It increases social functioning and retention in treatment while decreasing crime, and infectious diseases. And yet many in the public, rehabilitation facilities, and medical professionals believe treatment with medication is just exchanging one addiction for another. Those with knowledge about treatment with medication must speak up and educate everyone about its benefits.\nThe stigma surrounding treatment with medication stems from the belief that addiction is a moral failing, and it can be overcome with will power."}

{"question":"toxic waste dump locations minority communities research history first study","doc_text":"What do the Columbia Basin, Chesapeake Bay, Puget Sound and the Great Lakes have in common? In addition to being large wet places where people fish, boat, work and play, these waters are all suffering from pollution levels that don't allow them to function properly or to meet the needs of the communities that rely on them.\nBonus question: What do the last three great bodies of water have in common that leaves the Columbia as the odd ecosystem out? Answer: Seventy to several hundred million dollars a year from Congress to fix the most important pollution problems facing them.\nOur communities throughout the Columbia Basin have used a variety of toxic chemicals for a variety of purposes. The toxic legacy we've created continues to affect the health of our rivers, fish and people today. Toxic cleanups are never inexpensive. Cleaning up a 1,200-mile river and an approximately 259,000-square-mile basin will require substantial and sustained funding. Sen. Jeff Merkley and Rep. Earl Blumenauer of Oregon have introduced S3025 and HR4652, the Columbia River Restoration Act of 2010, which would authorize funding to study and clean up toxic pollution in the Columbia. This legislation addresses a longstanding need to understand the Columbia's toxic history and employ new toxic reduction practices to restore our river and our fisheries. Whenever new funding authorization is considered, it's important to take a realistic look at the economic cost associated with the circumstances.\nWe must understand what the toxic condition of the Columbia is costing us to assess the value of a potential $40 million annual investment in addressing the source of those costs. The Oregon Environmental Council conducted a study quantifying the cost of environmentally attributable components of asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, lead exposure, birth defects and neurobehavioral disorders. The council's conservative calculations concluded that in Oregon the cost of health effects attributable to unnecessary toxic exposure for adults and children combined is at least $1.57 billion per year. The cost of impacts to children's health alone is $1.10 billion per year.\nBecause these costs are diffuse and spread across Oregon, we don't recognize them as preventable consequences of allowing our rivers and skies to be treated as toxic waste disposal systems.\nWe are debating many ideas about what could be done to reduce toxic pollution without any substantial funding to support the answers. It took a long time and a tremendous investment of money and actions to pollute the Columbia Basin to its current state."}
{"question":"How do you know if there's no correlation between variables?","doc_text":"How do you calculate the power of a correlation?\nUsing a two sided test, 5% significance level test (\u03b1=0.05) with power 80% power (\u03b2=0.2), the required sample size is approximate 47 (n=47)\u2026.Correlation Coefficient using z-transformation.\n|\u03b1||Significance level (two sided test)|\n|1-\u03b2||Power of the test|\n|N||Sample size needed|\nWhat is power in correlation?\nThe power of a test is calculated as 1-beta and represents the probability that we reject the null hypothesis when it is false. The main application of power calculations is to estimate the number of observations necessary to properly conduct an experiment. XLSTAT allows you to compare: One correlation to 0.\nHow does correlation affect power?\nHigher correlation within subject gets you more power when the test being done is a differencing, equivalent to a paired t-test. The standard deviation used in calculating effect size is multiplied by \u221a1\u2212\u03c1.\nHow do you calculate effect size from correlation?\nThe effect size of the population can be known by dividing the two population mean differences by their standard deviation. Where R2 is the squared multiple correlation.\nWhat is G*Power used for?\nG*Power is a tool to compute statistical power analyses for many different t tests, F tests, \u03c72 tests, z tests and some exact tests. G*Power can also be used to compute effect sizes and to display graphically the results of power analyses.\nWhat does Corr among Rep measures mean?\nRepeated measures correlation (rmcorr) is a statistical technique for determining the common within-individual association for paired measures assessed on two or more occasions for multiple individuals. Unlike simple regression\/correlation, rmcorr does not violate the assumption of independence of observations.\nHow do you calculate effect size for power analysis?\nGenerally, effect size is calculated by taking the difference between the two groups (e.g., the mean of treatment group minus the mean of the control group) and dividing it by the standard deviation of one of the groups.\nWhat is the effect size in correlation?\nAs such, we can interpret the correlation coefficient as representing an effect size. It tells us the strength of the relationship between the two variables. 30 is considered a moderate correlation; and a correlation coefficient of . 50 or larger is thought to represent a strong or large correlation.\nWhat is effect size DZ?"}

{"question":"ways export modified 3d object surface design to new file format","doc_text":"By default, Inkscape uses its own variation of the SVG format, Inkscape SVG. Inkscape SVG files contains data specific to Inkscape and it\u2019s features. Inkscape does export to standard SVG (Plain SVG) format and compressed variations of SVG.\nArt created in Inkscape can be saved in numerous other file formats, including pdf, eps, and ps (PostScript). If you plan to go back and forth between Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator, I recommend using Inkscape\u2019s default SVG format. Even though I get a bunch of errors dialogs while opening Inkscape SVG files in Illustrator 10, I get the least trouble this way. Plus Inkscape\u2019s layers are preserved. I\u2019ll go into this deeper in a future Inkscape tutorial. But that\u2019s what\u2019s currently working for me.\nNow if you have plans to export your work into Adobe PhotoShop or GIMP for further work, that\u2019s not so straight forward. Inkscape can export to GIMP\u2019s native file format XCF, but you must have a copy of GIMP installed first. Inkscape needs to access certain libraries that GIMP possesses to translate what you have into a XCF file. To learn how to enable this ability, read How to Enable Saving to XCF in Inkscape. There\u2019s also a version for enabling XCF for Windows 8.1 users.\nThere is a SVG plugin for PhotoShop, but it takes a while for it to decrypt your SVG file. The other downside is that it won\u2019t recognize your Inkscape layers. Also it\u2019ll create a layer for every single object and path that\u2019s in your SVG file. So if you\u2019re working on a piece that uses a ton of paths, then it\u2019s not even worth it.\nIf you\u2019re not so worried about your layers, you can easily export to a PNG file.

Diesel and Velux\nCan it get more simple than these logos? I think not. In both cases, a red rectangle gives a feeling of straightforwardness combined with the aggressiveness of bright, primary red. Upper case white letters add a feeling of modernity and draw in the eye without any of the seriousness of black. These two logos are certainly very similar, but they are just as dissimilar.\nDiesel, a jeans and sportswear brand, uses ultra-plain letters for a contemporary feeling, with a tagline below hinting that successful living can be had by using this brand. Velux, a window covering company, uses a heavily serifed font that suggests leadership roles in their industry and a strong sense of tradition. These logos are definitely similar, but the fact that they are similar and belong to companies in such disparate industries will keep them from feeling like copycats.\n4. Sun Microsystems and Columbia Sportswear\nA square on its side made up of four interwoven parts: it sounds so simple and yet so unique that it is hard to imagine two different companies successfully using this element as a logo design and the cornerstone of their brand. However, there are a few differences. Sun Microsystems uses a business-like blue and waves the square out of their name. Columbia, on the other hand, has an earthy brown that is representative of their earthy brand and gives a more \u2018basket-like\u2019 feeling to their logo design. It should also be noted that the companies use very different fonts, which make it easy to tell them apart, and text in the logo that clearly denote their industry.\nThese logo designs can co-exist for several reasons. First, as with several of our previous examples, they are not in the same industry. In fact, it is unlikely that two brands as disparate as this will ever be in the same store or even on the same city block. Second, there are several key differences that make up for any similarities. These include differences in color, differences in the makeup of the logo design, and differences in the fonts chosen for the logos. Sometimes a similar logo design can be pulled off with finesse, but the situation has to be handled with care.\n5. Obama \u201808 and Pepsi\nIs Obama \u2018the real thing\u2019?"}

Bread Has Only Very Little Amount of Essential Nutrients\nThe bread made from grain flour mostly contains only carbs and very little amount of nutrients.\nEven whole wheat bread does not have enough nutrients as it is generally thought to be.\nThe worst part of bread is the lack of nutrients and the phytic acid present in it. The phytic acid blocks the absorption of minerals from other foods.\nThe gluten present in the bread also can damage the intestinal lining that will further decrease the absorption of the nutrients.\nThe bread-eaters need to depend on other foods like vegetables and fruits to meet the nutrients required by the body.\nThe protein got from the grains is very insignificant, and the bread-eaters need to look for essential amino acids in other food sources like meat and fish.\nSome of the studies say that the fiber found in whole grain bread can lead to faster exhaustion or burning of Vitamin D stores in the body which will result in Vitamin D deficiency.\nAnother serious drawback of whole wheat bread is its impact on increasing the LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) in the blood.\nHow To Choose The Good Bread?\nThe white bread made of refined grain is most harmful to health.\nHowever, whole grain bread is comparatively healthy and good for consumption."}

{"question":"recipes raw cooked kale differences","doc_text":"Most cases of salmonellosis are not treated with antibiotics. In fact, antibiotics may prolong the period during which the person can infect others. Antibiotics sometimes are prescribed for infants, the chronically ill and the elderly to treat or prevent complications in those at increased risk for invasive disease.\nCan salmonellosis be prevented?\nPeople are far more likely to contract salmonellosis at home than in a restaurant, so be sure to wash hands with soap and water after toileting and before handling foods.\nSalmonella bacteria are killed when food is thoroughly cooked. This means cooking ground beef to at least 155 degrees and making sure all food is cooked properly. Once cooked, any food held in a buffet should be kept hotter than 140 degrees. Cross-contamination \u2013where food is contaminated in the kitchen after it has been cooked \u2013 may be avoided by using different utensils, plates, cutting boards and counter tops before and after cooking. Cooked food that stands at room temperature for a long time, especially poultry, is at risk.\nDefrost frozen food in the refrigerator or microwave. Refrigerator temperatures should be kept colder than 40 degrees. Rinse poultry in cold water before cooking. Avoid raw milk, raw hamburger meat and raw eggs (many recipes, such as those for homemade ice cream, call for eggs with no subsequent cooking; substitute pasteurized eggs in these recipes). Food contaminated with salmonella may look, smell and taste normal.\nBecause fruits and vegetables have now been identified as a source of salmonella, it is important that these food items be thoroughly washed in running water before they are eaten.\nWash utensils and wooden cutting boards thoroughly with hot, soapy water. Salmonella may lie dormant for a year or more and then \"wake up\" when food is present. They also may live in the cut marks on a wooden cutting board. Use an acrylic board that can go in the dishwasher. If using a wooden board, rub down or spray the board with a solution of one ounce bleach to one gallon water and allow to air dry. Cutting boards for raw meat and poultry should not be used for cheese, raw vegetables and other foods that will not be cooked before being served.\nTo prevent the spread of salmonella, wash hands thoroughly after using the bathroom and before handling food. Do not allow an infected person to handle food or work in the kitchen."}

{"question":"virginia oyster industry aquaculture development permit requirements disease monitoring","doc_text":"This standard includes requirements for risk analysis, design, construction, operations etc.\nIn 2015, there was a new regulation on joint responsibility for recapturing escaped fish in rivers. In the same year the OURO (the aquaculture industry association for escaped fish) was established to enforce the regulation. The regulation defines when the proportion of escaped salmon in a river has reached a level that makes it necessary to put measures in place. The OURO board carries out the assessments and plans any measures needed. It is obligatory to join the association. Any measures required will be funded by the fish farmers through a mandatory fee, payable by those who do not trace their fish. This compulsory scheme replaced the voluntary Environmental Fund (Milj\u00f8fondet), which was set up and funded by the aquaculture industry in 2011. The old Environmental Fund implemented various measures in over 100 rivers and spent around 30 million Norwegian kroner in the four to five years that the fund was operational. The funds were mainly used on monitoring and recapturing escaped fish, education and tracing.\nOther important measures to prevent escapes are:\n- Training and knowledge sharing. Since 2008, courses set up by the aquaculture industry, the government and researchers have been offered every year. The courses are in great demand and attract high numbers of participants.\n- Innovation and improvement of equipment.\n- Making sure that mooring systems and equipment are suitable for the site, and that different parts of the equipment are compatible with each other.\n- Guidelines for best practices.\n- A public escape commission, organized by the industry, with the intention of learning from previous mistakes.\n- Learning from near misses. Reporting, sharing experiences and having good preventive measures in place.\nMore research is needed to clarify to what extent escaped farmed salmon affect wild salmon. It is clear that any activity has an impact, but it is important to understand if and to what extent the survival and evolution of wild salmon are affected by escaped salmon. It will also be important to standardize and optimize a method for monitoring escaped fish. This is necessary to make sure that the right measures are put in place.\nPublic escape statistics\nIt is mandatory to report all cases and suspected cases of escaped fish. The numbers are published on the Directorate of fisheries' website. The statistics show a downward trend for escaped salmon since the peak in 2006.

{"question":"violin bow string maintenance cleaning","doc_text":"Taylor uses the traditional all-wood construction and the necks of these guitars have a reputation for superb action and playability.\nThe twelve-string is usually an acoustic though twelve-string electric guitars are available. Twelve-string guitars are not the same as double-neck guitars. Double-neck guitars are essentially two guitar necks bolted onto one body. Twelve-string guitars have the regular six strings and a second set of thinner strings with each string of the second set corresponding to the note of its regular string counterpart. The second set of strings are tuned an octave higher. The strings form pairs; so you still play the guitar in the same manner as a standard six-string.\nTwelve-string guitars produce a brighter and more prominent tone and are harder to play than a standard six-string guitar. They are usually confined to niche roles, such as rhythm guitar. The additional strings require more pressure to press down and bending notes also requires an extra muscular effort. Twelve-string guitars are more expensive to buy than the standard acoustic or electric and may need more maintenance because of the strain the additional strings place on the neck.\nAn archtop is a hollow or semi-hollow acoustic or electric guitar which uses steel strings. The arched top creates a unique timbre and other elements taken from the design of the mandolin or violin also add to the distinctive tone of the archtop guitar. The body of the archtop guitar, whether hollow or semi-hollow, has a sound block in the middle and they also have violin f-holes cut into the table.\nArchtop guitars may be acoustic or electric and can look very similar with the only distinguishing feature being an electromagnetic pickup. One problem with archtop hollow-bodied guitars is that when played through an amplifier they tend to generate feedback. The semi-hollow archtop was developed to make feedback less of an issue. Archtop guitars have been particularly popular in jazz music because their thicker strings add tone.\nSome solid-body electric guitars have an arched top body shape but the name archtop is usually reserved for the hollow and semi-hollow guitar.\nThe steel guitar is unusual in that it is played horizontally, either across the players knees or on its own stand. There are two main varieties of the instrument, which are played using the metal slide, or 'steel' from which the guitar takes its name.

It is a greener form of energy than burning fossil fuels and by using electric powered vehicles in just one of our sites in Italy we have already reduced our C02 output by 150 tons a year.\nOur Packaging sites typically have large roof areas which can be ideal for the installation of Solar Power panels. Once installed the panels can deliver zero carbon electrical power for at least 25 years. This can be used to power our sites and other battery technology, such as electric vehicles.\nIn some countries readily available biomass, plant or animal material, can be used as fuel to produce electricity or heat. This allows for the installation of biomass boilers which burn this material, providing steam to power our manufacturing processes.

Dr. Rigby explained that he would not proceed with the operation if he thinks the device will cause any complications.\nAnyhow, I was prepared for the worst but continued to trust the Lord to grant healing mercies. And God has certainly used Dr Rigby to bring a sense of peace, trust and security before the surgical procedure. After he left the room Jared said, \u201cWhat a very nice man; such a gentle soul and his countenance, the way he talks reminds me so much of Vic!\u201d (Vic is a good friend of ours who died a couple of months ago) Surprisingly, Jared thought the very same thing I had in mind while talking with Dr. Rigby \u2014 he really did remind us of Vic.\nJared left the hospital that night when visiting hours ended, and it was quite strange being alone, confined in a hospital bed for the very first time! I\u2019ve never had a surgery nor have been confined in a hospital until that day. I hardly get sick and never even had been to the A&E to see a DR except when I had to accompany someone who needs an immediate medical attention. Therefore it was rather unusual to find myself in a hospital bed, and I had a hard time going to sleep that night."}

Most of these are managed by a municipality and mostly government funded. The different types of institutions ranges from separate day-care institutions (Vuggestue), kindergartens with a day-care department (Integrerede institutioner) and in-home day-care (Dagpleje).\nWhere Is Child Care Worker\nThe quality of the center based child care can be very influential on the child and on their overall development. Recent study showed that children in low end classrooms saw the activities as forced while the children in high end classrooms had more memorable experiences. Even though this being the case between high and low end classrooms, other aspects such as the child's background and living situation can play an important role in their development. Active children may thrive in the educational activities provided by a quality commercial care center, but according to the National Center for Early Development and Learning, children from low quality centers may be significantly less advanced in terms of vocabulary and reading skills. Classes are usually largest in this type of care, ratios of children to adult caregivers will vary according to state licensing requirements. Some positive aspects of commercial care are that children may gain a sense of independence, academic achievement, and socialization. Not only is this age crucial for the improvement of their social skills, but also it begins the stages of understanding a classroom setting. Childcare is seen as a reasonable option because it is different than parenting, since it can be seen as more of a routine for the child. This in turn will only have a negative impact on the child if the parent is not their for the emotional needs of the child. Children are placed into centers of socialization and learn many similarities and differences from one another from a very young age. Children are also placed into settings to develop their linguistics and cognitive abilities, which can be measured through observations. Not only is this age crucial for the improvement of their social skills, but also it begins the stages of understanding a classroom setting.

There are handy moisture meters, for instance, that help you water your plants in time. But also think about plant food, potting soil, substrate and pest control. Some accessories actually make taking care of your plants easier, while others contribute to growing healthier houseplants.\nTo this day, most houseplants always die from excess water. This is a shame and often very simple to prevent with a handy water meter.\nThe best soil\nNot every houseplant thrives on universal houseplant soil; succulents like airy soil, orchids thrive on bark and most other houseplants prefer a substrate like Lechuza-Pon. The soil you put your plant in, that is the base and that is where it should take root. The better the base is, the stronger your plant will become. We have written a blog about Zeoponic, a professional substrate with great advantages, which is suitable for almost all houseplants.\nIn nature, old leaves swirl off plants and fall to the ground, where they slowly decompose. This creates new nutrition for the plants and you actually have a kind of cycle. Unfortunately, this doesn't work in the home and plant feeding is often necessary to keep your houseplants in good condition.\nDid you know that many planters are not waterproof at all?

{"question":"trying to save my houseplants need help what color light wavelengths do plants use","doc_text":"I hear about it time and again. Someone wins a quad copter or purchased one after being convinced at a farm show, to get it home and use it for pretty pictures of their field once or twice. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are advantages to finally having an aerial view of your crop in-season. But, true agricultural aerial imagery is so much more than a pretty picture.\nWe specialize in three types of imagery at Hewitt Precision Insights \u2013 NDVI, RGB, and thermal imagery. Each type of imagery serves a specific purpose and fulfills a need depending on what an individual grower is searching for.\nNDVI is best suited for in-season imagery of your growing crop. NDVI stands for Normalized Difference Vegetative Index. It\u2019s basically a mathematical formula that measures the reflected light at different wavelengths. The healthier the plants are, the more light they reflect allowing us to differentiate between less healthy and healthier plants. These images are visualized as a color spectrum much like a yield map. Just like a yield map, I use red colors for the less healthy plants, moving up the spectrum towards orange, yellow, green, and finally blue as the healthiest areas in your field. With this information, we can go out and scout the less healthy areas to find the reason they are not performing as well. This can be from bugs, disease, fungus, or terrain. After we find the issue, steps can be taken to improve the health before yield damage occurs. Data shows that NDVI imagery can detect crop threats 10 days before the naked eye. Once an issue is seen in a field, the damage is already done. This imagery allows us to save yield.\nRGB is best suited for an introductory to aerial imagery. Seeing your field from a bird\u2019s eye view gives you the ability to see the variation in canopy color across the whole field. Using this imagery, we can go find out why the lighter green, or yellow spots in the canopy are less healthy. This allows us to make a change before any damage gets worse through the growing season. I say this imagery is a good introduction, because after you see it, I think you\u2019ll be excited about the possibility of getting more resolution and contrast in your fields.\nThermal is best suited for bare ground mapping. Thermal imagery is a recording of temperature. This is useful for soil type mapping, planting time decisions, and tile mapping."}

Because research proves that omega 3 with high EPA (Eicosapentaenoic acid) will reduce schizophrenia symptoms effectively.\nYou can also use daily supplements of omega 3 but the proper checking should be done before consuming. Some fish oils are not properly filtered or laboratory tested. So have a look at the label and make sure that they are high in EPA.\nResearch also confirms that the need for antipsychotic drugs may be reduced with EPA intake from fish. In fact, a study performed over 300 people in the United States for 3 months have provided results with great improvements in reducing the severity of schizophrenia.\nIn 2010, a study was published in General Psychiatry providing the positive effect of omega 3 in reducing the development of psychotic illness.\nInclude salmon, pumpkin seeds, flax seeds in the diet.

I know this isn't how I usually post, but the last 24 hours have been horrible. Pain, arguing with my husband (which we never do), taking too many pills last night - I just wanted to sleep, sleeping all day and continuing to argue with my husband when I woke up this afternoon. I'm very scared and don't know what is happening. My husband wanted to call 911 last night but said he wouldn't if I told him what pills I had taken.

I started crying this afternoon after my husband made us some pancakes and we didn't have any milk to drink because we have no money. Every time I think about my kids (27 and 30) I start crying. My husband left a little while ago to go to work. He'll be there until 11 pm. I asked him to take all of the pills out of the house and he freaked. At least I recognized the potential - although I really don't think I would do anything because I have felt so cruddy all day (when I was awake). I feel like I need help but I'm afraid to go to the hospital or something. I just don't know what would happen. I'm afraid they would make me stay and I don't think I could handle that.

{"question":"types information systems business management decisions","doc_text":"Instrumentation is made up of a large number of small data types. These data types are shared by the different service modules 103 using a publish and subscribe model.\nIn a publish and subscribe model, the remote services proxies (and therefore the systems management systems) publish their data to a service provider. The service modules 103 register interest in specific types of data that are needed to fulfill the respective service module processing.\nMore specifically, data from a systems management instrumentation proxy 306 may include patch information, operating system package information, disk configuration information, system configuration information, system alarms information, storage alarms information and performance information. This information is published via, e.g., a wide area network (WAN) to a management tier 310. Various service modules 103 then subscribe to the information in which they are respectively interested. For example, a patch management service module 330 might be interested in, and thus subscribe to, patch information and operating system package information. A configuration management service module 332 might be interested in, and thus subscribe to, the disk configuration information, the patch information, the operating system package information and the system configuration information. A storage monitoring service module 334 might be interested in, and thus subscribe to, disk configuration information and storage alarms information.\nThus, with a publish and subscribe model, many different types of data are published by a customer using the remote services customer deployed infrastructure. Service modules then subscribe to these data types. More than one service module 103 can subscribe to the same data. By constructing the instrumentation data in a well segmented manner, the data can be shared across many services.\nSharing data across many services reduces duplication of instrumentation. By making data available to newly developed service modules, those service modules need to only identify instrumentation that does not exist and reuse and potentially improve existing instrumentation. Sharing data across multiple services also reduces load on customer systems. Removing the duplication reduces the processing load on the customer's systems. Sharing data across multiple services also reduces development time of service modules 103. As more instrumentation is created and refined, service modules 103 reuse the data collected and may focus on developing intelligent knowledge based analysis systems to make use of the data.\nAccordingly, the separation and segmentation of the infrastructure from the service modules enables services to be created in a standardized manner ultimately providing greater value to the customer.\nThe systems management API's 410 includes systems management API's 418, integrator 212 and proxy integrators API 430."}

Although water is mainly used in conventional dirt gardens, Murray and Milne were also using fish water from their aquaponics system to water their wicking systems with spectacular results. We had a few questions raised on Murray\u2019s Aquaponics forum for more information.\nWhat is a Wicking Bed?\nA wicking vegetable garden bed system is an easy to build vegetable growing system developed in Australia by Colin Austin who looked at solutions to growing food systems in desert communities. The fact that it works so well for the lazy gardener is a bonus! Wicking Beds are essentially an enclosed water reservoir that allows the vegetables to be watered from below the plant\u2019s root zone. Its an idea way to grow root crops. Normally the system is powered by rainwater. But adding nutrient rich fish water from your aquaponics system will turbo charge your wicking bed even more. The fish water is fed once a week in summer through a slotted pipe that allows the water to flow down and slowly \u201cwick\u201d it\u2019s way up through capillary action and feed the plant roots from the bottom up. Its an ideal solution if you live in a hot dry environment or like we do \u2013 with lots of sandy soil where nutrients are easily leeched away. Its also a good way to grow root crops like potatoes and carrots in a conventional dirt garden system rather than aquaponics which suit above ground growing plants like lettuce and tomatoes.\nWhat sort of container for Wicking Beds?\nMurray uses a fibreglass tub at least 400mm deep but there is really no set rule as to how deep you should make them. Some people use an old refrigerator or bathtub found at the tip. You could use an infinite variety of containers provided they do not leak. If you take a look at the video clip here your will see Murray explaining Wicking Beds with Milne Matthews at around the 9:35 mark. Just scroll the Youtube video clip forward and see them explain how the system works. Murray uses a 90mm diameter pipe with slots cut out at the base to enable water to leak out of the pipe.

You might say it\u2019s 2011\u2019s The Fighter (the true story of Micky Ward starring Marky Mark and Batman) \u2014 a riveting family drama disguised as a violent sports film.\nWithout the benefit of a \u201ctrue story\u201d behind it, Warrior does have the danger of being construed as cliched, but as always, it\u2019s all about the execution of the story. I don\u2019t want to give too much away because the mysteries of the relationships play a big part in the film\u2019s allure and sustaining the drama. Tom Hardy is Tommy, a child wrestling prodigy who escaped his abusive father (and trainer) with his mother as a teenager. Edgerton is his big brother Brendan, a former UFC fighter turned struggling physics teacher. Nick Nolte plays their reformed father. The event that brings them all together is Sparta, a $5 million winner-takes-all grand prix-style MMA tournament featuring the world\u2019s top fighters, including a frightening undefeated Russian champion.\nThere is a sense of inevitability in this Gavin O\u2019Connor film (he also wrote the script and co-produced), but it hardly matters because Warrior is a genuinely moving, gripping and explosive drama that touches on such universal themes as forgiveness, redemption and unbreakable familial bonds. I don\u2019t think the film would be what it is without the top-notch performances of its three stars. Tom Hardy brings a brooding, tragic presence to the enigmatic Tommy, while Edgerton is picture perfect as the underdog fighting for his family.

And you realize that other kinds of bugs are important, and you realize that all these plants are blooming, all these trees are blooming, that you never realized before.

Water, wind, and even humans are wonderful at doing this without actively being part of moving pollen too.Some plants do not need animal transport of pollen, like hemp Cannabis sativa, which is adapted for wind pollen dispersal.\nFlowers attract animal pollinators by color and smell to encourage the pollinator to participate in moving pollen grains. There is an idea that certain colors and smells attract a certain group of pollinators. This idea is called pollinator syndrome. While not entirely scientific, they are a simplified rule of thumb for a researcher to work from.\nOne of the reasons understanding pollinators is so difficult is that they span many taxonomies (and of course taxonomies themselves can change). Dr. Jeff Ollerton (Ollerton, 2017) of the University of Northampton, United Kingdom does a wonderful job presenting a picture of what taxa are pollinators and gives an idea of the number of species in each group as well. This big-picture view gives us a good idea of which animals are pollinator, where to find them, and what plants they need for food and nesting sites.

The cores of three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on Japan's central east coast were molten wrecks. The deadly radiation once bottled inside their concrete containment domes \u2014 well, nobody knew exactly where it went.\nSo a group of citizens decided to find out.\nThe years-long nationwide act of citizen science that followed armed Japan's citizenry with information never before publicly available, and forced the country's government and institutions to adapt to a political reality unthinkable just a few years earlier. Their story is one of three examples of the diffusion of scientific research explored in \"Citizen Science in the Digital Age: Rhetoric, Science and Public Engagement,\" a new book by Carnegie Mellon University's James Wynn.\nCitizen science is not a new concept. The Smithsonian Institute relied on the practice to gather data for a weather project in the mid-1800s. But the digital age has vastly expanded its potential and usefulness.\nWynn's book explores how this practice is changing the arguments that steer public policy by raising awareness about risk. If risk data are no longer the sole province of scientific institutions and governments, if the information is gathered and held by the public, that \"changes the way people can argue,\" said Wynn, associate professor of English and rhetoric in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences.\nTake Safecast, the effort by Japanese citizens to use homemade Geiger counters to record radiation readings around the country, and display that information in an online map.\n\"If you don't have data, and the government is the only source of data, they're the ones who choose how that data is displayed, they get to choose who gets that data, they get to choose how that data is characterized and framed,\" Wynn said.\nSafecast volunteers gave people a far more detailed picture of the accident's aftermath, and discovered that the government had been ignoring two types of radiation that posed serious dangers to humans if ingested.\nBut citizen science is not always an unambiguous benefit. Two other cases Wynn explored \u2014 a climate science investigation in the United States and a sound-mapping project in London \u2014 showed how ideological or political motives can influence public debate.\nAnthony Watts, a TV weatherman and skeptic of anthropogenic climate change, teamed up with a University of Colorado climatologist to photograph the locations of government temperature monitors."}

The applied design has previously been used in a study of adults,8 and its main strength lies in the complete and nationwide data coverage during several decades and in the high quality of the diagnostic data, which is based on comprehensive clinical assessments of all mental disorders by cross-disciplinary clinical teams, including child and adolescent psychiatrists. Public health care in Denmark is free of charge, and monetary factors are thus less likely to affect the likelihood of receiving treatment in our study compared with studies performed in other countries.\nHowever, the applied methods also have limitations. Our study was not aimed at examining time trends, and, as in other observational studies, our estimates may be biased by cohort effects.34 Our sensitivity analyses suggest slight overestimation of the risk of a few mental disorders in the main analysis. This overestimation may be related to higher incidence rates in younger cohorts and changes over time in thresholds for referral, attitudes toward mental illness, available resources, and\/or environmental risk factors. The risks may also be underestimated because register-based studies are unable to detect mental disorders for which the patients or their families do not seek help (eg, \u201cwait and see\u201d). Further, we did not include individuals with mental disorders diagnosed outside hospital departments (by psychiatrists in private practices). However, in Denmark, most children and adolescents assessed and treated for mental disorders receive such care within public hospital departments."}

At a price of $299, the headset comes with a movement-detecting gyroscope and wireless capabilities to communicate with a computer.\nThe average brain is made up of over 100 billion neurons that send electrical impulse when interacting. The technology behind the Epoc is called non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG), allows these neural impulses brain's to be interpreted by the headset.\n\"Emotiv is a neuro-engineering company and we've created a brain computer interface that reads electrical impulses in the brain and translates them into commands that a video game can accept and control the game dynamically,\" Ms. Le explained.\nAlthough headsets that interpret neural activity are not new, Ms. Le said the Epoc was the first consumer device that can be used for gaming applications.\n\"This is the first headset that doesn't require a large net of electrodes, or a technician to calibrate or operate it and does require gel on the scalp,\" she explained. \"It also doesn't cost tens of thousands of dollars.\"\nThe medical use of Electroencephalography dates back to the early 20th century, but it's only been within the last thirty years the technology has been used to explore interfaces between the human brain and a computer.\nThe headset can interpret a wide variety of emotions, such as excitement, tension, meditation, and frustration. Facial expressions such as smiles, laughs, winks, raised eyebrows as seen in shock, furrowed brows in anger along with cognitive actions such as push, pull, lift, drop and rotate (on six different axis) are also interpreted by the Epoc.\nFor gaming applications, the Epoc can be used to give authentic facial expressions to game avatars.

The process produces no notches, material thinning or undesirable diaphragm effect, says Home Mojal, product manager for Telsonic Solutions Inc.\nWhen welding plastic parts, TUW is not impacted by interference media in the weld seam, such as water, grease, silicone and oil. For this reason, the procedure is very effective at seal-welding plastic enclosures with internal electronic components.\nThe Soniqtwist system generates few particulates and creates neat and clean edge areas during forming operations, such as swaging and riveting. It also can be used for welding filled components.\nOptimizing the Process\nMojal recommends manufacturers do several things to optimize the TUW process.\n- Use an energy director in most plastic welding applications. Be aware that the energy director design criteria may differ from those for linear ultrasonic welding.\n- No energy director is required in most metal welding applications. The weldment, especially the one at the anvil side, should be as stiff and rigid as possible.\n- Eliminate sharp corners and edges. This will prevent vibration fatigue cracks and necking.\n- In metal welding, make the joining surfaces as clean as possible.\n- Coatings such as silver, gold or nickel are usually no problem\u2014and may even increase the weldability and welding strength.\n- Finally, Mojal advises suppliers and OEMs to contact Telsonic as early as possible in the development process to optimize the TUW process for each application.\n|The Powerwheel System: Splicing and Terminating Wires|\nIn 2011, Telsonic introduced the PowerWheel system at the Productronica Show in Munich.

If infection substantially reduces a host's residual reproductive value (RRV), however, then an acceleration of effort may instead occur (e.g. terminal investment). Reproductive acceleration would theoretically allow hosts to maintain or exaggerate their sexual signal upon infection. This would create a deceptive message from the perspective of the chooser, who may unwittingly copulate with an infected mate to their detriment. Using the cricket Allonemobius socius, we assessed the potential for reduced RRV to accelerate male reproductive effort and create a dishonest signal. RRV was manipulated through male age and simulated pathogenic insult. Reproductive effort was measured as calling song energetics, mating success, latency to mate and nuptial gift size. We show that males adopted either an accelerated or decelerated reproductive strategy upon infection, and that this decision was probably mediated by RRV. Moreover, males who accelerated their effort produced a dishonest signal by increasing their song energetics while providing fewer paternal resources (i.e. smaller gifts). Our study is one of the few to document the existence of dishonest signals and relate dishonesty to a potential reduction in female fitness, underscoring the conflict inherent in sexual reproduction.\nProceedings of the Royal Society B-Biological Sciences\n\"The influence of male age and simulated pathogenic infection on producing a dishonest sexual signal\" (2012).

As an off-the-shelf product, however, allogeneic T cells derived from healthy donors carry the risk of recognizing the patient\u2019s body as foreign, which can cause a serious side effect called graft versus host disease (GvHD).\nBaylor and Cell Medica plan to overcome this problem by developing off-the-shelf therapies based on CAR-modified NKT cells generated in large volumes from healthy donors. While endowed with powerful cancer-killing properties like conventional T cells, invariant NKT cells express special T cell receptors that are not associated with GvHD. Hence allogeneic NKT cells can be used to treat multiple cancer patients with minimal risk of GvHD. The success of this program may expand significantly the potential use of cell-based immunotherapies on a cost-effective basis for the treatment of cancer patients.\nExclusive License & Development Plan\nThis new project will be conducted under the exclusive license and co-development agreement between Cell Medica and Baylor, announced in June 2016. Under the agreement, Baylor will perform the research required to develop off-the-shelf NKT cell therapies with funding and strategic input from Cell Medica. Cell Medica will have an exclusive option to develop all products and technologies arising from this effort, under the terms of the licensing agreement. As announced previously, Cell Medica and Baylor expect that their collaboration will generate a significant number of new products for Cell Medica\u2019s pipeline."}

The primary elements mentioned above at the city-centre located Leeds Art Gallery, as well as notable collections of \u2018Old Master\u2019 and British painting dating from before 1840 at Temple Newsam House, while the Gascoigne family paintings and some British Impressionists are shown in the settings of the Edwardian house, Lotherton Hall. In both these latter venues the fine art collections are integral to historic country house displays, and, taken overall, with the Art Gallery which is best described as a gallery of modern and contemporary art, the collections offer visitors and researchers a wide range of engagement through different display styles and strategies.\nWe have collected Victorian pictures since the Art Gallery opened in 1888. Whilst not comprehensive, our collection holds some remarkable works.\nOf particular note are the landscapes, characterised by Sogne Fjord by Adelsteen Normann, Pre-Raphaelite romantic pictures like Waterhouse\u2019s The Lady of Shalott, \u2018modern moral subjects\u2019 of everyday life like Holl's The Village Funeral and Tissot\u2019s The Bridesmaid), as well as paintings depicting contemporary events like the war in Afghanistan represented by The Drums of the Fore and Aft by Edward Hale.\nWe are probably most associated with the Leeds artist John Atkinson Grimshaw, the holdings of whose works has grown to encompass the largest of any public collection.\nBritish and French Painting 1850-1900\nWe hold a major collection of French art of the Barbizon school, including important works by Courbet and Corot.

You could also earn interest with your NFT portfolio by lending to others.\nNFT Environmental Impact\nAs with other cryptocurrencies, each NFT minted does have some impact on the environment. For instance, Bitcoin mining uses enough energy to power 10 million homes a year.\n26. How do NFTs Impact the Environment?\nMost NFTs work on the Ethereum blockchain, which requires a proof of work system to confirm each new block. The process of confirming each block is called mining and consists of computers on the network racing to solve a complex problem.\nThe first computer to solve it verifies the block and collects the gas fees. Thus, miners invest in more computer power, and if that power comes from sources that emit greenhouse gases, the environment is negatively impacted.\n27. Ethereum\u2019s Carbon Footprint is Similar to That of Sudan\nAlthough not as carbon-intensive as Bitcoin, Ethereum is currently estimated to consume 44.94 terawatt-hours of electrical energy and release 21.35 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year28.\n28. The Average NFT Has a Carbon Footprint Similar to an Average Person in the European Union\nDigital artist Memo Akten analyzed 18,000 NFTs and found the average carbon footprint similar to that of the average person living in the European Union28.\nThis large footprint is partly due to the many transactions involved with NFT minting, bidding, sales, and transfer of ownership. Overall, NFT emissions are estimated to be ten times higher than the average Ethereum transaction.\n29. Ethereum is Planning a Shift to Lessen Environmental Impact\nLuckily, blockchain networks realize their platforms\u2019 impact on the environment and are attempting to mitigate it. The developers of Ethereum are planning to move to a less carbon-intensive proof of stake system called Ethereum 2.0 in 2022.\n30. The Shift to Ethereum 2.0 Could Reduce NFT Energy Usage by 99%\nProof of stake systems results in fewer emissions because they don\u2019t require mining. Thus, while some platforms have already moved to proof of stake systems for trading NFTs, the majority remain on the Ethereum blockchain.\nHence, the shift to Ethereum 2.0 should significantly reduce energy consumption28."}

{"question":"Hi! I'm managing an old building that needs renovation. What are the best ways to preserve its historical features while making it more energy efficient?","doc_text":"With so many options available, it can be overwhelming to know what features to look for. Fear not, as we\u2019ve compiled a list of important factors to consider before making your purchase. It\u2019s important to invest in a vacuum that not only suits your cleaning needs but also supports your efforts in managing asthma and COPD. Let\u2019s explore some key features you should keep in mind.\nWhen considering a smart vacuum cleaner for managing asthma and COPD, one important feature to look for is the presence of HEPA filters. HEPA, which stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air, filters are designed to capture even the smallest particles of dust, pet dander, pollen, and other allergens that can trigger asthma and COPD symptoms.\nHere are some key benefits of HEPA filters:\n|Benefits of HEPA Filters|\n|Traps Small Particles: HEPA filters are designed to capture particles as small as 0.3 microns, which is smaller than many allergens and other irritants.|\n|Improves Air Quality: By removing allergens and other irritants from the air, HEPA filters can improve overall air quality in your home.|\n|Reduces Symptoms: By removing triggers for asthma and COPD symptoms, HEPA filters can help reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms.|\n|Long-Lasting: HEPA filters are designed to last for a long time, often several years, before needing to be replaced.|\n|Energy Efficient: Despite their high level of filtration, HEPA filters are energy efficient and don\u2019t consume a lot of power.|\n|Cost-Effective: While HEPA filters may cost a bit more than standard vacuum filters, they are highly effective and can save money on medical expenses by reducing asthma and COPD symptoms.|\nThere are many different types of HEPA filters, and some smart vacuum cleaners even have multiple filters to provide even greater filtration capabilities. When looking for a vacuum cleaner with HEPA filters, make sure to check the specifications to see what kind of filter is included and how often it needs to be replaced. It\u2019s also important to note that while HEPA filters can be highly effective, they are not a cure-all solution and should be used in conjunction with other asthma and COPD management strategies.\nSize and Weight\nWhen it comes to selecting a smart vacuum cleaner for asthma and COPD care, one important consideration is size and weight."}

What are the best ways to preserve its historical features while making it more energy efficient?","doc_text":"Old and ageing properties are crammed with history and contain a certain undeniable charm, but when planning on rejuvenating its looks, the most challenging decision to make is whether to renovate or demolish.\nWhen deciding whether to demolish or renovate, there is no right or wrong decision as both options have their pros and cons. Deciding on whether to demolish or renovate is dependant on several factors, including what is optimally suitable to your needs and requirements.\nBefore moving on with your decisions to either renovate or demolish, you will have to keep in mind the building rules in your area. There are laws or by-law, in many areas, that prohibit the demolition or renovation of a house which is deemed to be of historical value or a certain age. A council can also forbid any work on the property should they feel that renovating will alter the overall look of the particular area.\nVarious factors need to be considered when deciding whether a renovation or demolition project in Brisbane is the best option for you. We look at them below;\n- What Is Your Goal?\nThe goal of your project is the most critical aspect to consider. If you are looking to add an extra room or make alterations to the plumbing, your best option will be to renovate than pulling the entire building down.\nIt will be a more prudent decision to demolish the entire house, should you be looking to make substantial changes that will affect the structural integrity of the whole building.\n- The Condition Of The House.\nYou will need to find an outstanding demolition company in Brisbane to entirely demolish an old property that you have purchased at a bargain price. Old buildings are usually in poor condition, and a renovation is a waste of your money as it is just masking the cause of the problem and not fixing it.\nThe best solution, in this case, would be demolishing the entire house and using your tailored layout to build a new one. A demolition in Brisbane allows for you to create a home that accommodates your specifications, such as living areas that are facing a north-easterly or northern direction to maximise on sunlight, or installing solar panels.\n- Your Budget.\nMoney talks. A small scale renovation is a more affordable option than demolition. It is important to work your budget out first when you intend to have something done on a grander scale. Speaking to contractors about your plans will make you understand whether a renovation, or a demolition will cost more."}
{"question":"How do Arctic Ocean methane releases compare between gas hydrates and pingo-like features?","doc_text":"Japan is celebrating a groundbreaking science experiment in the Arctic permafrost that may eventually reshape the country's fragile economy and Tokyo's relationships with the outside world.\nFor an unprecedented six straight days, a state-backed drilling company has managed to extract industrial quantities of natural gas from underground sources of methane hydrate - a form of gas-rich ice once thought to exist only on the moons of Saturn.\nIn fact, the seabeds around the Japanese coast turn out to conceal massive deposits of the elusive sorbet-like compound in their depths, and a country that has long assumed it had virtually no fossil fuels could now be sitting on energy reserves containing 100 years' fuel. Critically for Japan, which imports 99.7 per cent of the oil, gas and coal needed to run its vast economy, the lumps of energy-filled ice offer the tantalising promise of a little energy independence.\nCan't really fault the Japanese for wanting to get at this stuff, but there are lots and lots of environmental problems associated with methane mining, which I have written about here. My favorite is the (admittedly small) possibility to a catastrophic release of methane, a nasty if short-lived greenhouse gas. To ask \"Can we mine [methane hydrates] without triggering a disaster that makes the K-T event look mild by comparison\"? may overstate the danger, but even Japanese scientists are worried that drilling into the unstable deposits off their country's coast might trigger \"massive landslides\" on the ocean floor, thus setting hydrates loose in the atmosphere.\nA couple of points in conclusion. Firstly, the Palaeocene\/Eocene thermal maximum was a time of mass extinction thought to have been caused in part by a vast release of methane hydrate, so doomsday warnings like the one above are not entirely ungrounded. Secondly, the \"underground source\" noted in the piece is almost certainly the Mallik research well, located in the Mackenzie Delta in the Northwest Territories. This experiment is a Japanese\/Canadian co-venture. Your tax dollars at work."}

{"question":"As an environmental consultant in the healthcare sector, I'm interested in how different cultural celebrations can be made more sustainable. How do traditional Christmas gift-giving customs affect environmental sustainability, and what eco-friendly alternatives are available for holiday celebrations?","doc_text":"To ensure genetic diversity and reduce the impacts of genetic drift, the population would need to be made up of individuals from different regions, ethnic groups, and with varied genetic backgrounds. In addition, reproductive strategies such as inbreeding avoidance or controlled breeding could be used to maintain genetic diversity.\nRepopulation of the earth would also require careful planning and management of resources such as food, water, and shelter, as well as healthcare services to maintain the health and wellbeing of the population.\nThe precise number of humans required to repopulate would depend on a variety of factors such as genetic diversity, demography, and environmental factors. An MVP of 500-10,000 individuals would be necessary to ensure long-term survival, but careful planning and management would be required to achieve a successful repopulation.\nHow many humans can the earth support?\nThe question of how many humans the earth can support depends on several factors, including resource availability, environmental sustainability, and technological advancements.\nOne crucial factor to consider is resource availability. The earth has limited resources, including food, water, and energy, which are essential for human survival. As the global population continues to grow, the demand for these resources increases, meaning that the earth can support a limited number of people.\nThe carrying capacity of the earth, therefore, depends on how efficiently we use our resources and how we manage them.\nAnother factor to consider is environmental sustainability. The ecosystems on which humans depend are sensitive to environmental changes. Overpopulation can cause environmental degradation, such as deforestation, loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and water pollution. These impacts can affect the surrounding communities and limit the earth\u2019s capacity to support life.\nTherefore, the earth\u2019s carrying capacity depends on how well we manage the environment and minimize our ecological footprint.\nLastly, technological advancements can also affect the earth\u2019s carrying capacity. Technology has played a significant role in increasing global agricultural productivity, energy efficiency, and waste management. By developing sustainable technologies, we can enhance the earth\u2019s capacity to support more humans without compromising the environment.\nEstimating the number of humans that the earth can support is not a straightforward answer. Several factors come into play, including resource availability, environmental sustainability, and technological advancements. Therefore, to ensure that the earth can support the current and future generations, we need to manage our resources, reduce our impact on the environment, and invest in sustainable technologies.\nWhat population of the world is 1 %?"}
{"question":"outdoor mural painting church artwork protection","doc_text":"State Sen. Tom Davis was within his rights to express concerns last week about a piece of student art displayed at Robert Smalls Middle School that included the controversial quote, \"You can't have capitalism without racism.\"\nBut he aired his criticism publicly -- on Facebook and in email to the media -- before he had all the facts, including that the painting had already been removed from display. As a state senator, his words almost certainly carry more weight with school officials and the public at large than the average person's; he should be more mindful as a result.\nThe quote is from a 1964 speech by Malcolm X. Robert Smalls principal Denise Smith said the painting was part of a Black History Month project in which eighth-grade advanced art students researched the civil rights movement and teamed up to create artwork based on that research.\nSmith said attribution for the quote, originally missing from the exhibit, was added later and conceded it should have been there from the start. She also said students should have included more context in the display.\n\"In retrospect,\" Smith wrote in her email, \"because this artwork display illustrated a period of American history, the students should have included appropriate text along with their paintings that provided the proper historical context. Without that context, someone viewing the paintings might have mistakenly believed that the students or the school were endorsing a particular political or social viewpoint, which certainly was not the case.\"\nHer response was reasoned in a way that Davis' initial communications were not. In an email to school district administrators and Board of Education members, Davis said he received a photo of the artwork from an outraged constituent. Even as he sought an explanation, he concluded it was inappropriate for display at a public school. Before anyone from the school district could respond, Davis shared his email with the media and posted a photo of the painting on Facebook, where he called for it to be removed.\nHad he waited 20 minutes for Smith's response before posting to Facebook, Davis would have learned the painting had been taken down even before he requested it. And he would have learned it was a single painting and not the \"mural\" he described.\nThe painting was part of a rotating, month-long exhibit of student art that also depicted Maya Angelou and the Harlem Renaissance, as Smith explained in her email to Davis.\nIn this context, the Malcolm X artwork, while perhaps still objectionable with the quote, seems hardly worth the uproar Davis seemed intent on creating."}
{"question":"what are advantages of variable speed drives for energy saving how to prevent electrical accidents when installing them","doc_text":"Manuel R. Suarez\nKumana & Associates\nThe result of years of development and lessons learned inFPSOs is that FLNG facilities are finally being built and the first units will soon come onstream. One of them even includes a \"re-gasification\" step that offers interesting advantages for savings and project flexibility.\nThe concept of an \"all-electric\" LNG plant, where all variable speed process drives are electric (i.e., motors, not turbines) has been around for years. Despite advantages in this configuration, few projects have been built (e.g.,Snohvit in Norway). A possible reason is that despite advances in electric drives, early designs and engineering produced when technology was basically limited to turbines continue to be applied under the notion that \"existing engineering\" is a cost saver. That is usually true but not in this case. Savings opportunities and improved process designs are being missed as a result.\nThe advantages of \"all electric\" onshore are even more significant offshore. The advent of FLNG could promote the all-electric design, and could result in a merger of the two concepts into an all-electric FLNG.\nTwo key characteristics for successful FLNG projects are efficiency and flexibility. The liquefaction technology must be highly efficient in operation, energy use, space, and cost. One reason to choose FLNG is commercial flexibility. Accordingly, the technology selected should be flexible enough to allow processing of a range of feed gas options (e.g., composition, pressure, rates). In turn, LNG train size is a function of the selected technology and the power required for the compressors and drives. A plant configured with multiple trains results in smaller liquefaction modules, an advantage in the space-limited offshore applications."}

{"question":"what agricultural practices and quality control requirements needed for medicinal herbs laboratory testing","doc_text":"Third party certification usually refers to the involvement of a third-party certification body accredited to ISO 17065. This is the most stringent (and costly) of the three processes described and includes a testing program plus site audits to check quality management systems, recall procedures, and more. The certification body decides the acceptability of where the product is tested, but it typically must be performed by an ISO 17025 accredited laboratory (the laboratory is also audited and approved by the certification body). The certification body will also audit the manufacturing site(s), headquarters, or any other location of operation they deem necessary to review. The end result is the certification-body attestation of compliance, a stamp of approval on your product, and a listing on their online registry.\nExample: NFPA 2112 is a standard that requires third-party certification for compliance at both the component and the garment levels; testing alone is not adequate to label the product to the standard.\nThird party testing means just that: testing performed by a third-party. Some third-party testing laboratories are accredited to ISO 17025, which means another independent, third-party body has audited them for a quality management system and technical competence. Not all third-party laboratories are accredited. If your internal specifications or the standard you are working with require testing by an accredited, third-party laboratory, ask for the laboratory\u2019s scope of accreditation.\nExample 1: ANSI\/ISEA 107-15, for high visibility products, requires background material to be tested by an ISO 17025 accredited third-party laboratory.\nSelf-Declaration can be described as a manufacturer\u2019s attestation that they meet a certain standard. Some manufacturers have in-house testing facilities and produce their own compliance or quality control data (generally with the exception of large-scale testing, as there few facilities with these capabilities).\nExample 1: ASTM F1506 is also a self-declaration standard, and it has no third-party requirements at all. A manufacturer could, theoretically, perform all testing in-house themselves and call their product compliant.\nExample 2: ANSI 107 is a self-declaration standard for the finished product; however, there are third-party requirements for the components used in the garment. At the end of the day, the self-declaration of the finished product means the onus is on the manufacturer to ensure the proper process was followed and that the product is compliant. Keep in mind that all certification bodies and some third-party labs will perform this check for you upon request."}

What were the key measurements for moisture content, protein levels, and test weight?","doc_text":"The U.S. winter wheat harvest is underway and early projections indicate another sizable crop is coming out of the fields. With U.S. carryover stocks for all wheat up nearly 45 percent from a year ago, prices have seen downward pressure in recent weeks. As a result, U.S. wheat is once again very competitively priced with other origins.\nUSDA\u2019s latest projections place 2010\/11 winter wheat production at 1.5 billion bushels, a three percent decline from 2009\/10. This reduction is due mainly to what USDA expects to be a 30 percent drop in soft red winter (SRW) production compared to 2009\/10. The outlook for HRW and winter white wheat is much different, however, with USDA projecting larger crops for both classes.\nUSDA expects increased harvested area and greater yields to offset an 11 percent decrease in HRW planted acreage. The largest production increases are expected in Texas, where the crop is expected to double, and Oklahoma, where USDA\u2019s forecast calls for a 67 percent increase from last year\u2019s crop. USDA currently pegs the HRW crop at 979 million bushels, which would be an increase of 40 million bushels from last year and eight percent above the five-year average. Winter white wheat production is pegged at 219 million bushels, an increase of nine percent from 2009\/10. Crop conditions are also up from last year with 66 percent of the winter wheat crop rated in either good or excellent condition, compared to 44 percent a year ago.\nHRW FOB values prices ran well above other origins for much 2009\/10 marketing year. In fact, HRW FOB values out of the Gulf were nearly 40 percent greater than Russian wheat prices in June 2009. That situation has changed dramatically, however. In the latest Egyptian GASC tender on May 28, 2010, 11 percent protein HRW was offered at $179.50 per metric ton FOB, only one dollar more than a winning Russian bid of $178.50 per metric ton. Commercial traders indicate that HRW FOB values have fallen even further in the past week to approximately $160 per metric ton, a level not seen since September 2005.\nThe latest USDA commercial sales data indicate buyers are taking advantage of lower HRW prices."}
{"question":"setting up first fish tank how many times day feed fish remove uneaten food after feeding","doc_text":"If they are siblings of the breeders, they will be tolerated and become part of the colony, helping to guard the perimeter. If they are not siblings of the pair, you might find them up near the surface trying to hide in a corner. It is best to remove these fish, as they will never be accepted into the colony. Once fry begin to appear, add extra food for them. Using a baster, gently add a squirt of newly hatched brine shrimp right into the fry group once a day. Add extra finely ground flakes at feeding time, too. As they grow and disperse, you can eventually start feeding them the same foods as the adults.\nThe colony will grow and ultimately take up as much room in the tank as it can, and there will be nowhere else for the fish to go. At this point, the pair usually stops spawning. Before you reach this point, it\u2019s a good idea to thin out the tank. Many fish breeders do this once or twice a year. One caveat I will have to add is that it is nearly impossible to remove fish from a tank with a rock pile! Once it is set up, you won\u2019t want to be tearing it down too often. But be aware that you will have to thin out the population at some point.\nRemember, in the wild, predators would be removing some of the fry and juveniles. That doesn\u2019t usually happen in our aquaria. So once or twice a year, plan an afternoon to give the tank a makeover. I\u2019ve found the easiest way to do so is to carefully remove the entire rock pile from the tank and then net the fish you want to remove. If you try to chase them around with a net without removing the rock pile, all you will do is spook the fish and waste your time. You might get one or two, but most will dive for the safety of the rock pile. By removing it, you will remove their hidey holes and make them much easier to catch with much less stress on both you and the fish. After removing as many fish as you feel adequate, reset the rocks in a similar arrangement. The remaining fish will figure things out on their own.\nI find that most of the fairy cichlids are in high demand, and local shops usually love to get locally raised fish in trade."}

{"question":"As someone studying environmental education approaches, I'm curious about why natural outdoor settings are considered effective for teaching environmental literacy?","doc_text":"It is fair to say that workers\u2019 environmental education is an underdeveloped field, especially in comparison with managerial and technical training and school-based environmental education. At the international level, education of front-line workers is often mentioned in passing and is overlooked when it comes to implementation. The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions has commissioned a series of studies on the educational dimension of environmental protection, and in its next programme of work will directly look at the shop-floor workers and their environmental educational needs.\nWhat follows are several examples gathered through the WEI at Cornell University that illustrate both practice and possibility in worker environmental education.The WEI is a network of managers, trade unionists, environmentalists and government policy officials from 48 countries in all parts of the world, committed to finding ways that workers and the workplace can contribute to environmental solutions. It addresses a wide range of industries from primary extraction to production, service and public-sector enterprises. It provides a means for education and action on environmental matters that seeks to build knowledge at the workplace and in academic institutions that can lead to cleaner and more productive workplaces and better connection between internal and external environments.\nAustralia: Eco-Skills Modules\nThe Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has developed new approaches to workers\u2019 education for the environment that provides both broad social awareness and specific competencies for employment, especially among young workers.\nThe ACTU has organized an Environment Training Company with a broad mandate to address a variety of sectors but with an initial focus on land management issues. This focus includes teaching ways to handle reclamation work safely and effectively but also ways to assure compatibility with indigenous peoples and natural environments. With input from trade unionists, environmentalists and employers, the training company developed a set of \u201cEco-Skills\u201d modules to establish basic environmental literacy among workers from an array of industries. These are integrated with a set of skill competencies that are technical, social and safety oriented.\nEco-Skills modules 1 and 2 contain a broad base of environmental information. They are taught alongside other entry-level training programmes. Levels 3 and higher are taught to people who specialize in work focused on reduction of environmental impacts. The first two Eco-Skills modules are composed of two forty-hour sessions. Trainees attain skills through lectures, group problem-solving sessions and practical hands-on techniques. Workers are assessed through written and oral presentations, group work and role plays."}

It does this by measuring ground cover, animal numbers, fertiliser amounts, slope, and soil types, in resolution up to five metres. Then it calculates the flow of water across and under farmland, and how much rain each part of the land can absorb.\nWith this data, LUCI can predict how many animals each part of a farm can hold, and how much fertiliser can be applied, before run-off occurs. It also highlights areas where water could be slowed by features such as sediment traps, planting, or changes to tillage. If adopted widely, LUCI could later be used to predict the health of rivers and streams."}
{"question":"How does the requirement for having written documentation compare between forming a sole proprietorship and creating an LLC in terms of mandatory paperwork?","doc_text":"Is Ubi the same as federal tax ID?\nState tax ID numbers and federal Employer Identification Numbers are assigned to businesses that employ workers, but EINs can also be assigned even if the company has no workers. UBI refers to Unrelated Business Income.\nHow much does it cost to get a business license in Washington state?\nThe Business License Application costs $19 (one-time fee ). The registrations with the departments are free, however, the Business License Application also includes what are called Specialty Endorsements and City Endorsements. Those will cost extra and will also need to be renewed each year.\nDoes an LLC have to be renewed every year?\nThe LLC annual fee is an ongoing fee paid to the state to keep your LLC in compliance and in good standing. It\u2019s usually paid every 1 or 2 years, depending on the state. This fee is required , regardless of your LLC\u2019s income or activity. Said another way: you have to pay this.\nWhat comes first LLC or business license?\nThink of it this way: getting an LLC is the first step and creates a legal foundation for the business . A business license gives you the right to operate. Depending on what kind of business you have and where you live, you may need to get business licenses from your state, county, or town.\nDoes an LLC have to have insurance?\nOne of your employees could be injured at work. No matter your business structure, nearly every state requires businesses with employees to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance . An LLC is no exception. If required by law, you\u2019ll need to carry coverage to help cover lost wages and medical bills.\nShould I form an LLC or sole proprietorship?\nWhile the Sole Proprietorship is the simplest and most popular form of business start up, it may not provide entrepreneurs with the legal and tax advantages that an LLC does. Therefore, a member is not personally liable for the debts of the LLC . A sole proprietor would be liable for the debts incurred by the business."}
{"question":"setting up first fish tank how many times day feed fish remove uneaten food after feeding","doc_text":"How Long After Fish Dying Can You Add New in the USA\nWater from the pet store can contain diseases and parasites that will be transferred to your beautiful community tank at home. All new fish being put into a community tank should be quarantined for two weeks, at least, before adding them into your aquarium.\nHow long after adding fish can I add more?\nYou generally want to wait at least two weeks between introducing new additions to your fish tank. This gives time for the biological filter to get caught up again. This time also allows the new fish to get used to the fish tank, and the older, more established fish to get used to the new additions to your fish tank.\nShould I get another fish if one dies?\nAny dead fish should be removed, as its body will quickly rot in the warm, bacteria-laden water. A corpse will pollute water, risking the health of other fish in the tank. If it died from disease the last thing you want is other fish consuming its body parts, so remove immediately.\nCan you reuse a fish tank after a fish dies?\nFish can leave disease behind and bacteria can develop, especially if a dead fish is left in the water for any prolonged period of time. First off, you should remove the other fish from the tank and place them in a separate tank. You will want to let the tank go through a nitrogen cycle before adding new fish.\nCan I add more fish after a week?\nWait until both the ammonia and nitrite levels have risen and then fallen to zero before adding more fish. It usually take about 3-6 weeks for a new aquarium to go through the initial nitrogen cycle, so fish should be added only a few per week during this time.\nCan I add fish after 24 hours?\nIf you introduce bottled bacteria and water from an established tank at the shop, the nitrogen cycle can be completed after 24 hours. It will take about a day for the chemicals to eliminate chlorine and bacteria to bring ammonia and nitrates to healthy levels for fish to live in.\nHow long before I can add fish?\nFilling Your New Aquarium After purchasing your new aquarium, make sure to set it up, add water, substrate and plants and allow it to settle for at least 24 \u2013 48 hours before adding fish. Once you\u2019ve got your aquarium set up, you\u2019ll be ready to choose which fish will populate your tank.\nDo fish feel sad when another fish dies?"}

The International opens in full on October 5.\nThe Collection of Modern and Contemporary Art\nThe Carnegie Museum of Art presents an ambitious reinstallation of its modern and contemporary art collection, lead by two of the 2013 Carnegie International curators, Dan Byers and Tina Kukielski. The curators have selected over 200 objects, which include a great number of works acquired through past Internationals. Altogether, 8 large galleries have been reinstalled. Rather than de-install the museum's collection galleries for the International, as in the past, this project brings the exhibition into conversation with past iterations, and contextualizes the museum's important collection both in terms of larger art movements, and how the museum and Pittsburgh engaged with artists around the world.\nThe Playground Project\n\"The most interesting place in the typical playground is the drinking fountain.\"\n- Richard Dattner, Design for Play, 1969\nThe Playground Project presents some of the most outstanding and influential playgrounds from Europe, the United States, and Japan from the mid-to-late 20th century in order to prompt a reconsideration of our own time and the way we approach childhood, risk, public space, and education.

{"question":"How does heat affect clay drying and workplace lung risks?","doc_text":"Plaster naturally dries at a slow rate, and rushing its drying can cause premature cracks. The right humidity level for plaster application is between sixty and seventy percent.\nHaving the right temperature is crucial to the proper drying process. Plaster takes longer to dry in cold and damp rooms, while warmer temperatures help it to set faster. Plaster that has not been properly maintained will be weak and may crack easily. The temperature of the room must be 41 degrees Fahrenheit or above, as anything below that will result in poorer bonding and possible problems. Plaster that is applied to a room with high humidity needs a constant temperature of at least seventy percent.\nA dry layer of plaster will take longer to set than one that has a thin layer. Temperatures can also make it take longer to set. Other factors that can affect the amount of time it takes to dry are the thickness of the plaster and whether the area has a natural current. Winter temperatures can also affect how long it takes for plaster to dry, especially if there is not much sunlight or heat. However, these are factors that can be controlled.\nMold can form on wet plaster\nIt\u2019s possible for mold to form on wet plaster if the material becomes saturated with water. Plaster is made of a non-porous substance derived from lime or clay. The water can only penetrate the surface of the plaster, and the mold will grow only on it, without producing any toxins. If you see mold growing on your plaster, it\u2019s probably not the mold you think it is. It\u2019s most likely mold growing on paint, dust, or organic particles that are present in the area.\nOften, artists seal plaster surfaces to minimize the porosity. It\u2019s also important to keep the relative humidity level as low as possible, since high or low humidity can lead to several problems. Mold can form on wet plaster when the material dissolves in water, and is particularly susceptible to mold. Mold can be easily damaged by abrasive materials. Mold can be especially problematic on antique pieces, such as paintings, sculptures, or furniture.\nOften, white mold can be the culprit in a damp environment. If you notice white mold, it\u2019s likely that you have mildew, a common fungus in the same environment. You may mistake it for efflorescence, a mineral deposit caused by seepage of water. To test for this fungus, try a water test."}

{"question":"As someone who does regular testing, I'm wondering how different measuring devices compare in terms of accuracy - are specialized high-end devices really worth it compared to standard ones?","doc_text":"Some expensive electronics or mechanical devices are designed to be shock-resistant. However, the manufacturers often market the level of shock-resistance in units of g-force (I know g-force is really a measure of acceleration). I'm not really convinced that that's the proper unit.\nIn fact, the Wikipedia article for mechanical shock describes shock as a sudden acceleration or deceleration. Here, the term \"sudden\" seems to imply that the acceleration or deceleration is not constant during a shock, which would mean that there should be a jerk component to the equation that describes the movement or position of the object as a function of time.\nSo here are my three related questions:\n- Is shock better expressed as g-force per second? If not, why (i.e. why is g-force a better unit)?\n- When you bang a smaller object that is reasonably rigid (e.g. a wristwatch with stainless steel case and bracelet) against another object that is reasonably massive, immovable, and rigid (e.g. a brick wall), how does the plot of position as a function of time actually look like, supposing we can record time and distances with extreme precision?\n- Do common mechanical devices suffer mostly from high acceleration or from high jerk?\nUpdate The ISO 1413 shock resistance standard seems to give some clues. The testing procedure consists of letting a 3 kg hard plastic hammer traveling at 4.43 m\/s hit a watch. Which suggests that we really care about the instantaneous transfer of energy or of momentum.

{"question":"As someone deeply interested in religious studies, I'm curious about how traditional Judaism views the relationship between human moral development and divine commandments. Can you explain their perspective on this?","doc_text":"In his first speech as a Knesset member, Habayit Hayehudi\nChairman Naftali Bennett defended to Torah studies of the ultra-Orthodox community, but also stressed that \"serving in the army is a mitzvah.\"\nDuring his speech on Tuesday, Bennett focused on religious affairs and Jewish education. \"Let's admit to the truth: The religious services sector has become a machine that creates alienation. It's no wonder that one-third of all Israeli couples wed outside the rabbinate. Let's turn the religious services into a focal point that will illuminate the real Judaism to all of the people of Israel,\"\nhe told the plenum.\n\"We must bring the beauty of Judaism to all the people of Israel.

This is not a religious mission. It is an Israeli mission.\"\nThe Habayit Hayehudi leader said Israelis must believe in the righteousness of their path, and alluded to the \"two states for two peoples\" paradigm. \"We must know that the land of our forefathers is not a piece of real estate, and that there is no need for me to speak of geo-strategic depth to explain why this is important to me.\n\"I live in Ra'anana and feel safe because my brothers protect me from the mountains of Binyamin and Samaria. There is no room in our divine little piece of land for another country. It won\u2019t happen, but friends, before any discussion on the territories, it must be said that the Land of Israel belongs to the nation of Israel.\"\nBennett continued to say that the next government has a \"historic opportunity to bring about real cooperation\" between all segments of Israeli society with regards to equal share of the national burden.\nAddressing the universal draft debate, he said \"Studying Torah is an existential interest of the entire nation of Israel."}
{"question":"I keep seeing QR codes being used for inventory management in businesses - what are the main benefits of using this system?","doc_text":"Barcodes, a residual technology of the Cold War, have influenced several crucial sectors, from retail to logistics. Scanning a barcode can tell you all about the item, from its origins to the required conditions for storage.\nWhile big corporations are financially content with creating a barcode inventory management system, small and medium businesses (SMBs) may face obstacles due to scale. Yet, the availability of that feature can bring several advantages to any enterprise. Here\u2019s a short guide on how SMBs can have barcodes for their inventory system.\nWhat Are Barcodes?\nYou can consider barcodes as a representation of several lines of data within a single picture. A few barcodes have attached numbers to ensure precise readings. A scanner converts that information to readable data within a fraction of a second. The numerals are for manual operation if the original code is no longer readable.\nThere are two kinds of barcodes currently in commercial use.\nIt is the most popular form of barcode you can find. 1-D barcodes contain multiple lines of varying widths. The lines\u2019 order and width let the barcode reader obtain the relevant input.\n2-D barcodes are scanned over an area instead of a line. They may take longer to scan but offer far more possible combinations and contain more information than 1-D barcodes. The most well-known examples are in the form of QR codes.\nWhat To Consider With a Barcode Inventory System?\nThe barcode inventory system can create more efficient stock storage for every business. However, that efficiency can vary with scale and industry type. So, it\u2019s best to consider a few influential criteria before deciding on the best approach for your business.\nBefore deciding on the system, it helps to set your inventory goals. Measure the available space and other storage factors to determine which barcode system might suit you best. You want to spend only a few resources for short-term storage or limited stock.\nThe efficiency of your barcode system is only as good as the software for keeping track of the inventory. It\u2019s best to avail of something that can run on all the computers within your organisation. At Qbasis, we can deliver a customised solution that can relay the information on smartphones or through RFID chips for easier access.\nAny software is only as good as the hardware supporting it. Therefore, you must collect a good barcode generator and scanner compatible with your system. The labels must remain visible until the packaging gets discarded."}

He acknowledges the great strides made by the three MV-22 deployments to Iraq, but notes that the two theaters have many differences. As planners at VMM-261 develop a mission that will take the Osprey from Bastion to the Pakistani border, 850 miles round trip, Amland comments on the Osprey\u2019s benefits.\n\u201cThe Osprey can collapse the battlespace, and go into areas that are not suitable for landing a [KC]-130J,\u201d he says.

{"question":"what ancient christians special knowledge salvation","doc_text":"The need for the Christian ministry is just as great today as it was in the first century despite the fact that about 30 percent of the world\u2019s population professes to be Christian. The unchristian actions of the greater number of these professed followers of Christ reveal that true Christianity has not touched their hearts. As with ancient Israel, God can say of them: \u201cThis people have come near with their mouth, and they have glorified me merely with their lips, and they have removed their heart itself far away from me.\u201d\u2014Isa. 29:13.\n22 The professed Christians of Christendom need to be taught the basic truths of the Scriptures. They need to be told the good news of God\u2019s kingdom; they need a hope created in them for world peace and just rule by means of the kingdom of God. They are like the unfruitful Israelites who suffered from a spiritual famine. Although they profess to be Christians, they are in need of true Christians coming to them with nourishing spiritual truths. There are such Christians today who are doing that very thing.\u2014Amos 8:11.\n23. Who today realize what a Christian\u2019s responsibility is, and how are they like the early Christians?\n23 Realization of the responsibility that rests upon every Christian to engage in the Christian ministry spurs Jehovah\u2019s witnesses to teach the truths of Christianity \u201cpublicly and from house to house\u201d as the apostles did. (Acts 20:20) In 194 lands they are following the example of Jesus by going among the people and preaching to them wherever they can be found. Like the early Christians, they train those who respond to the good news of the Kingdom to teach still others. Thus all who come within the New World society of Jehovah\u2019s witnesses are encouraged to participate in the Christian ministry. It matters not if a person can spend only a few hours a month in the ministry. He can still obey Jesus\u2019 command to preach. These modern-day Christians take to heart what the apostle Paul said: \u201cFor with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.\u201d\u2014Rom. 10:10; 2 Tim. 2:2.\n24.

The magnetic lines of force have less room and are squeezed closer together. It follows that Proximity Effect is stronger when the conductors are closer together. It is also stronger when the side facing each other are wider.\nSpume is the name generally given to the small particles of metal that are ejected from the welding \u201cV\u201d during the high frequency welding operation as a result of electromagnetic forces produced by the weld current. Stainless steel spume tends to be in the form of very small, spherical particles of metal and refractory oxides. It is extremely important to always have coolant directed at the weld point and in between the deforming wheels to prevent spume build-up.\nThe optimum weld power is the minimum power at which a satisfactory weld is obtained. Adjustment of the weld power is generally done by observing the spume which occurs at the apex of the weld. The spume, which appears as yellow or orange droplets of small diameter, usually spurts downstream from the weld area. A moderate, continuous spume is the best indication of adequate weld power and steady mill conditions. Uneven spume is an indication of uneven welding conditions and usually of poor weld quality. It can be caused either by mechanical irregularities in the mill, such as deforming wheels, fin tilt roller, tips or excessive weld power.\nTulsa Fin Tube is a world leader in high frequency resistance welding for fin tubes and finned pipes.

{"question":"planning to go camping range creek bears food safety precautions need to know","doc_text":"It also means you take whatever common-sense precautions you can to protect yourself and other hunters. Here are a few tips to keep you and others safer the next time you go hunting:\n- Advise other hunters about where you plan to set up. Doing so is beneficial because it isn\u2019t only common sense safety-wise; it will also prevent other hunters from making noise in the area where you\u2019re trying to track and hunt.\n- Many states and private hunting clubs require hunters to wear a certain amount of hunter orange. Even if you aren\u2019t required to do so by law, it isn\u2019t a bad idea, especially when hunting fast-moving game (think waterfowl).\n- Keep an emergency medical kit and a cell phone on you at all times because anything could happen. Hunting accidents, snakebites, broken bones and twisted ankles are all possibilities for which you need to be prepared.\nBe the Predator, Not the Prey\nThere\u2019s a famous scene in the original Jurassic Park movie where the park warden thinks he is hunting a raptor. Just before he takes his shot, however, he realizes that his target was acting as a distraction while another raptor snuck up on him. While this is an extreme example, it\u2019s a reminder that each time we go hunting, we are stepping into a world where we aren\u2019t always highest on the food chain.\nKnow what animals are present in the area in which you plan to hunt. Are there bears in the area? What about mountain lions? Coyotes, wolves and wild boars can be extremely dangerous to humans, especially if they feel threatened or provoked. You also need to be aware of poisonous snakes, spiders, ticks, ants, and mosquitoes. Any one of these creatures can ruin a hunt and cause extreme displeasure, or even death.\nDue to the combination of weapons, nature and wild animals, there will always be an element of danger when it comes to hunting. By following the aforementioned hunting safety tips and using common sense, however, you can have a good time and gain peace of mind by knowing that you\u2019re doing everything within your power to protect yourself and everyone around you."}

They\u2019re asking for more complex solutions that go beyond classroom observations, student test scores and other recent proposals. Some are even suing state officials over teacher reforms.\nIt\u2019s obvious we still have a long way to go before a consensus is reached. But lessons have been learned along the way. Many education experts agree the following steps are essential items to be considered when creating a fair and comprehensive teacher evaluation system.\nDetermine and address the cause of so many teachers getting high ratings.\nEven though the past\u2019s high teacher ratings were the initial cause for implementing new teacher evaluation systems, research performed by Matt Kraft of Brown University and Allison Gilmour of Vanderbilt University, shows that the new processes in place for evaluating teachers still rate a majority of teachers as effective.\nSo why are principals giving teachers these high ratings? Kraft and Gilmour\u2019s study shows that principals have many worries when considering giving teachers a low rating. These include finding good teachers to take the place of less effective teachers, concern over a teacher\u2019s morale after receiving a low rating, and the difficulty involved in the process of dismissing a teacher. It seems that the easiest way to resolve this issue, would be allowing principals to have more of a voice in the creation of new teacher evaluation systems.\nDon\u2019t evaluate every teacher in every grade and every subject based on test scores.\nThere are many issues in the method of using test scores to evaluate teachers. One of the consequences is the creation of new tests for classes other than reading and math, and for grades other than third through eighth. Some schools are giving teacher evaluations based on the school averages or courses the teachers didn\u2019t participate in. There must be a credible test to evaluate teachers based on test scores. This test must thoroughly assess a teacher\u2019s influence on student growth.\nCreate a system that encourages teachers\u2019 professional growth.\nA report by New America states that, \u201cFor the most part, states have prioritized getting evaluation systems up and running and are only beginning to think about using them to promote ongoing teacher learning and growth.\u201d\nIf a teacher isn\u2019t performing up to or above expectations, and even if they are, states should have a system in place that encourages continued education and progress."}

{"question":"What changes did Michigan's Funeral Representative Law from 2016 bring to funeral arrangements and who can be appointed as a funeral representative?","doc_text":"Though our laws and perceptions of what it means to be a family are becoming more inclusive, it can still be challenging for those with non-traditional next of kin relationships when it comes to planning a funeral at a funeral home in Dublin, CA. The most common non-traditional relationships are same-sex couples, Common Law marriages, and separated but still married couples.\nThere are three criteria that have to be met in order to couples to be considered legally married under general Common Law. If you are married under Common Law, it\u2019s important to know that it might be tricky for a funeral home or service to validate a Common Law Marriage after one of the people passes away. Unless a Declaration of Informal Marriage has been filed by a county clerk, many funeral homes will ask a different next of kin person to sign the necessary funeral documents as there are penalties involved in allowing a non-documented marriage to serve as legal standing to be a next of kin. To avoid any concerns or issues after a death, Common Law couples should file with the county clerk before a death.\nThanks to modern legislation, legally married same-sex couples have the exact same rights and next-of-kin spouse status as heterosexual couples. However, the this is only the case if the couple is legally married at the time of death. Without proof of a legal marriage, the funeral home or service will have to look to a different member of the family to take on final disposition responsibilities and decisions.\nMarriage is a complicated relationship, and oftentimes married couples are separated but not legally divorced. In this scenario, the spouse would be still be responsible for making all necessary funeral arrangements and paying for them. Unless there is a clear legal proof of divorce, the marriage is still valid, and the spouse is the next of kin. This is more common than you might think and is a confusing situation that causes a lot of delays in making funeral home or cremation plans.\nThese days, most states have a process in place for getting around difficulties with next of kin relationships. Depending on the state, there is usually a form that people can fill out, sign and file to give a specific person the responsibility of all death-related decisions. This form allows you to choose who you want to make your funeral arrangements and is valid at the vast majority of licensed funeral homes and cremation providers.\nBe sure to look into the specificities of your state law or reach out to a lawyer for the most up-to-date information and guidance."}

Under this specific scenario and application regime, a PEC value of 3.7 \u00b5g\/\u2113 was predicted to occur in the study area. Dichlovos is an insecticide and acaricide used in the study area on spinach, cabbage, other vegetable crops and on grapes. The Environmental Health Criteria (EHC) review concluded that, with the exception of gross spillage, recommended use does not constitute a hazard for aquatic and terrestrial organisms (Tomlin, 2000). It is non-persistent in the environment with rapid decomposition in the atmosphere (Tomlin, 2000). Parathion is classified as a compound with low mobility based on Koc values and leaching studies. Parathion is rapidly degraded under laboratory and field conditions (Tomlin, 2000). It is an organophosphate insecticide and acaricide which has a moderate toxicity to aquatic invertebrates and fish (Mulla and Mian, 1981). Parathion was applied to vegetables (cabbage, cucumber and lettuce), grapes, tobacco, maize, and cotton within the study area. Cypermethrin is a pyrethroid insecticide used on cabbage, lettuce and onions as well as tobacco and maize in the study area. The EHC concluded that biological degradation is rapid, with the subsequential levels of cypermethrin and its degradation products in soil and surface waters being very low (Tomlin, 2000). Thus, under field conditions, fish are not expected to be at risk from normal agricultural usage of cypermethrin even though it is classified as being highly toxic to invertebrates and vertebrates. Bollmohr et al. (2007) indicated an acute exposure toxicity ratio of 0.01 based on calculated concentrations found in water of 0.001 \u00b5g\/\u2113. The PEC value given by PRIMET was higher than these estimates (0.2 \u00b5g\/\u2113) thus resulting in a higher ETR of 55. This value translates into higher potential risk. Deltamethrin is also a pyrethroid insecticide that is highly toxic to fish under laboratory conditions using a continuous exposure but is not toxic to fish under natural conditions using a natural exposure regime."}

Fifty percent of the population will be black. Other studies are seeking to clarify the physiologic pathways through which stress affects cardiovascular outcomes?including hemodynamic, sympathetic nervous system and neuroendocrine mechanisms, and inflammatory processes. The ultimate goal is to determine whether stress management interventions can alter these physiological indicators and improve cardiovascular outcomes.\nAdditional research supported by the Institute includes studies that are addressing the genetic basis of behavioral risk factors and the relationships between risk-promoting variables (psychosocial stress, smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, lack of adherence to cardiac medications), presumed mediating variables (sympathetic nervous system activity and insulin metabolism), and CHD risk factors.\nThe Institute supports several investigator-initiated studies to develop and evaluate interventions that seek to improve cardiovascular outcomes. One study is seeking to determine the efficacy of a personalized health plan intervention that incorporates mind?body techniques targeted at reducing various risk factors for CVD?such as insulin resistance, inflammatory markers, and self-reported negative effect.

{"question":"What effects do tourist activities have on both mountain skiing areas and coral reef environments, and how are these impacts being managed?","doc_text":"Coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to the impacts of sea-level rise and possible changes in local meteorology. Tropical coral reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef, may be able to keep pace with sea-level rise-but will be vulnerable to bleaching and death of corals induced by episodes of higher sea temperatures and other stresses. Measures to facilitate adaptation include better rangeland management; plantings along waterways; and research, monitoring, and prediction. Active manipulation of species generally will not be feasible in the region's extensive natural and lightly managed ecosystems.\nHydrology and Water Resources: Vulnerability appears to be potentially high. Any reduction of water availability, especially in Australia's extensive drought-prone areas, would sharpen competition among uses, including agriculture and wetland ecosystem needs. Freshwater supplies on low-lying islands are also vulnerable. More frequent high-rainfall events may enhance groundwater recharge and dam-filling events, but they also may increase the impacts of flooding, landslides, and erosion, with flood-prone urban areas being heavily exposed to financial loss. Reduced snowpack and a shorter snow season appear likely, and New Zealand's glaciers are likely to shrink further. Some adaptation options are available, but the cost involved would be high.\nFood and Fiber Production: Vulnerability appears to be low, at least in the next few decades (potentially high sensitivity coupled with high adaptability). Agriculture in the region is adaptable, and production increases are likely in some cases. However, there may be a trend toward increased vulnerability in the longer term-especially in warmer and more water-limited parts of Australia, where initial gains for some crops are eroded later as the delayed full effects of climate change (e.g., changes in temperature and precipitation) tend to outweigh the more immediate benefits of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Impacts will vary widely from district to district and crop to crop. There will be changes in growth and quality of crops and pastures; shifts in the suitability of districts for particular crops; and possibly increased problems with weeds, pests, and diseases. Rangeland pastoralism and irrigated agriculture will be especially affected where rainfall changes occur. Changes in food production elsewhere in the world, which affect prices, would have major economic impacts on the region. With regard to forestry, the longer time to maturity results in a relatively large exposure to financial loss from extreme events, fire, or any locally rapid change in climate conditions."}

{"question":"What do Lusitania's exploration difficulties and organic farming's yield issues share?","doc_text":"Many gardeners want to use biological remedies in the fight against pests, as well as fertilizers. But what should we use as natural fertilizer and insecticide?\nWe can use many natural things such as banana peels, coffee grounds, seaweed, tobacco dust, and many more. But you must know how and what amount you should use for your garden safety.\nHere we will discuss the benefit of tobacco dust for the garden and lawn. Everyone knows about tobacco. It\u2019s harmful to health. But the fewer people know that tobacco is good for plants and it has vast use in agriculture and livestock as insecticide, fungicide, and fertilizer.\nSo, let\u2019s know How and why you should use tobacco dust in your garden or lawn?\nBenefits of Tobacco Dust\nWhat is tobacco dust?\nTobacco dust is the brown color waste that produces in the tobacco industry. It is mainly a by-product of the cigarette company. The tobacco dust can be found in the horticulture center in different packages for use as organic insecticide or fertilizer in domestic gardening. It can apply to crops in liquid and powder form.\nLet\u2019s have a look; why tobacco dust use in organic gardening?\n- Tobacco dust contains a high amount of Nitrogen, Potassium, Phosphorous, and Iron.\n- It is a great source of Nitrogen for newly grown houseplants.\n- It has a high organic matter that makes it a good fertilizer.\n- The tobacco dust promotes the active growth of the plants and also improves the yield and quality of the fruit. Moreover, it improves soil health by increasing the availability of trace elements and useful minerals.\n- Tobacco dust also acts as a natural insecticide because of the nicotine that remains in it.\n- It improves the electrical conductivity, water intake capacity, and water holding capacity of the soil.\nDo you know? The use of tobacco dust as fertilizer can increase 40 % of the yield.\nComposition of Tobacco Dust\nThe chemical composition of tobacco leaves is complex and rich, it includes not only nicotine (from 0.7 to 5%) and other alkaloids, but also organic proteins, carbohydrates, aromatic oils, etc. and minerals (calcium, potassium, magnesium, sulfur). This means tobacco dust are not only able to destroy harmful insects, but also to enrich the soil."}
{"question":"environmental social implications waterway transport systems urban areas","doc_text":"Noise pollution has become one of the main problems of modern cities, having a negative impact on the health, comfort and quality of life of citizens. However, with the development of innovative technologies, new opportunities appear to combat this problem. In this article, we will look at some innovations and technologies that help create quieter urban environments.\n- Sound insulation and acoustic materials: One of the key approaches to reducing noise pollution is the use of special materials for sound insulation. Acoustic panels, soundproof wallpaper, special coatings for floors and ceilings - all this helps to absorb and reduce the sound level, preventing its propagation and reflection from surfaces.\n- Smart Transport and Traffic Management: Intelligent transport management systems can significantly reduce the noise from cars and public transport. Automatic speed control, traffic flow optimization and the use of electric and hybrid vehicles help to reduce noise and emissions of harmful substances.\n- Green areas and sound-absorbing vegetation: Creating green areas and parks with an abundance of vegetation is an effective way to reduce noise in an urban environment. Plants, especially those with dense foliage, can absorb and break up sound, creating a calmer atmosphere.\n- Active noise reduction: Modern active noise reduction technologies allow you to reduce the noise load by using systems that emit an anti-wave of sound, neutralizing noise waves. Such systems are used, for example, in acoustic panels, headphones with active noise reduction and even in some public spaces where noise can be significant, for example, around construction sites or transport hubs.\n- Quiet materials and technologies: Special quiet materials used in construction, such as noise-absorbing concrete and asphalt, help reduce sound reflection and noise levels in urban areas. In addition, engineers and architects are developing new designs and technologies, taking into account aspects of noise protection and creating quieter buildings and infrastructure.\n- Information systems and warnings: The development of information systems that warn about noise events and notify citizens of temporary changes in the noise environment, allows people to take measures to minimize the negative impact of noise on their health and comfort. This may include warnings about noisy events, construction work, or temporary changes in traffic.\n- Public education and awareness: Raising awareness of citizens about the problem of noise pollution and its impact on health and quality of life can contribute to changing attitudes towards noise. Conducting campaigns that teach noise reduction measures and involving citizens in the decision-making process to improve the noise environment are important aspects of combating noise pollution."}

{"question":"What defines proper evidence-based clinical medicine?","doc_text":"Welcome to the Department of Chemical Pathology at the University of Pretoria\nChemical Pathology (also known as clinical biochemistry\/clinical chemistry) is a discipline that interfaces with almost every clinical specialty, as up to 70% of clinical diagnosis requires the input of laboratory investigations.\nIn this Department, we are passionate about, and dedicated to the discipline in particular and pathology in general and this is borne out in our enthusiasm to achieve excellence in teaching, clinical training, research and laboratory service.\nChemical Pathology overlaps with the discipline of metabolic medicine and in some countries, the UK, for example, it is integrated with metabolic medicine to cover the domains of lipidology, metabolic bone disease, nutrition, inherited metabolic disorders and diabetes\/endocrinology. This illustrates the vast overlap of chemical pathology with clinical medicine. Thus, chemical pathologists are often called upon to manage these disorders either in the outpatient or inpatient setting. A substantial component of the discipline also overlaps with molecular genetics owing to the importance of molecular diagnosis in many inherited metabolic diseases. In summary, Chemical Pathology occupies a central facilitative and enabling role in clinical medicine, without which proper patient management will not be possible. It is not just in secondary and tertiary health care where it is important, chemical pathology is also important for primary health care where screening tests are often used to determine disease patterns and occurrences and risk management in otherwise healthy individuals.\nProspective students who are looking for more information are encouraged to\ncontact the department on 012-319-2114"}

But the ability to digitize the process of managing services in terms of adoption has not been nearly as successful as that of managing products with eProcurement technologies.\nPart of this is due to the focus of what these solution are designed to do.

For instance, based on the US Census Bureau Services Survey (2015), temporary workers was $119M compared to $2,455M related to professional business services.

A market without rules, with a lot of competition and little cooperation?\nThis book draws up the balance sheet of 50 years of development aid and provides an overview of all relevant players, of opportunities and obstacles, of successes and failure. It details numerous examples and information on development projects from all over the world. Readers may be tempted to get involved in development aid, but they will also be more cautious than before."}

These tumors start in the exocrine cells of the pancreas. The following table describes the most common pancreatic exocrine tumors.\n|Adenocarcinoma||Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of pancreatic cancer. It accounts for about 90% of all pancreatic cancers. It begins in the cells lining the pancreatic duct.|\n|Acinar Cell Carcinoma||Acinar cell carcinoma is a very rare form of pancreatic cancer. Some tumors may cause excessive production of pancreatic lipase, the enzyme secreted to digest fats. Pancreatic lipase levels can be measured in the blood.|\n|Intraductal Papillary-Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN)||An IPMN is a cystic tumor that grows from the main pancreatic duct or from side branches of the duct. The tumor may appear as a finger-like (papillary) projection into the duct. An IPMN may be benign at the time of diagnosis. However, it has a risk of progressing to malignancy. This risk is high when the IPMN originates in the main pancreatic duct. An IPMN may therefore be a precursor for adenocarcinoma.|\n|Mucinous Cystadenocarcinoma||Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma is a rare, malignant, cystic tumor. The cyst is filled with a thick fluid called mucin. It is similar to an IPMN but occurs in just one area of the pancreas, more commonly in the tail of the pancreas. These tumors are mostly seen in women.|\nThere are other rare types of exocrine pancreatic tumors not discussed in this table.

{"question":"exocrine pancreatic insufficiency symptoms causes patient numbers usa","doc_text":"Basic Facts About Type One Diabetes\nDiabetes is scientifically known as diabetes mellitus (DM). There are several information about diabetes that people get confused about, which are facts and which are myths? Here are some basic facts you should know about diabetes mellitus:\nThe cause of diabetes mellitus\nIn a nutshell, diabetes is caused by the insufficiency of insulin in the body. Pancreatectomy (surgical removal of the pancreas) and other endocrine dysfunction can cause insufficiency of insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreatic glands, which is responsible in lowering glucose levels in the blood stream.\nClinical symptoms Diabetes Mellitus\nThe three P\u2019s, polyphagia, polydypsia and polyuria, generally characterize diabetes mellitus. Polyphagia \u2013 is excessive appetite, polydypsia \u2013 excessive thirst and polyuria is excessive urination. There is also hyerpglycemia or increased glucose concentration in the bloodstream. Glycosuria is also present which is characterized by the presence of sugar or glucose in the urine.\nTypes of Diabetes Mellitus\nThere are two types of DM, the type 1 and type II. Type II is the non-insulin dependent DM or NIDDM while Type I is the insulin dependent DM or IDDM.\nCharacteristics of Type I DM\n\u2022 IDDM or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus \u2013 Therapy is through the administration of insulin to the patient.\n\u2022 Thin patients \u2013 Patients with this type of DM are usually thin as compared to type II.\n\u2022 Early onset of disease \u2013 The disease occurs at an earlier age, usually before 40 years of age than the type II DM that is why it is also called juvenile diabetes.\n\u2022 Ketosis is prominent. Ketosis is the increased concentration of ketone bodies like acetone, hydroxybutyric acid, and acetoacetic acid in the bloodstream because lipids are metabolized for energy more than carbohydrates. The increased metabolism of lipids will also increase ketone bodies because ketone bodies are the products of ketone metabolism. Normally carbohydrates in the form of glucose are metabolized for energy, but since insulin is insufficient and glucose cannot be metabolized properly, the lipids or fats are then utilized for energy.\n\u2022 Hyperglycemia \u2013 The concentration of glucose in the bloodstream is elevated even in fasting samples collected in fasting blood sugar tests."}

Therefore, mRNA-RBD can induce a substantial T cell response against SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigens aside from humoral immune responses.\nIt has been reported that the virus-binding but non-neutralizing antibodies induced by infection or vaccination may possibly elicit the ADE effect46,47,48,49,50. Thus, we also compared the differences in the proportions of neutralizing antibodies to binding antibodies between prime and boost immunization procedures.

Unfortunately, some care home employees do not treat residents the way they deserve. Elder abuse comes in many forms, so it is important to recognize the common signs.\nThere are six types of elder abuse that may occur in a care home setting. To protect your loved one, always remain vigilant to the possibility that he or she is a victim of harmful actions.\nPhysical abuse is the use of force or violence which may result in injury. Bruises, burns, cuts and other visible signs of physical abuse should be investigated.\nElders who are vulnerable may become the target of a sexual abuser. Your relative may not have the ability to tell you about sexual abuse, making this one of the more difficult types of elder abuse to uncover.\nAn emotionally abused elder may become withdrawn or complain of ill treatment from one or more care home employees. These concerns should be investigated to ensure that the treatment does not constitute abuse.\nIf you notice that your relative\u2019s money is disappearing without explanation, it may point toward financial exploitation. This type of abuse may also involve the theft of assets such as jewelry and other personal property.\nThe care home has an obligation to provide food and other provisions to elderly residents. If there is a failure to honor these commitments, you have a right to have the matter investigated.\nAbandonment covers situations where a person or persons responsible for the care of an elderly resident have deserted their duties.

The cavorting lights put on a show worthy of an appearance at the West End. As our group stood looking at the Aurora Borealis, a silence fell and we simply allowed the various colours to light up our souls. Magical, peaceful, enigmatic! In our opinion, there aren\u2019t that many places better than Finnish Lapland to catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights. With crystal-white snow, the stark winters of the northern hemisphere provide the perfect backdrop for seeking out the Aurora Borealis. Our Aurora Borealis hunt with Mikko is one of the most memorable experiences of our March 2019 holiday to Ruka and Rovaniemi. Witnessing the Northern Lights in Finland often tops people\u2019s bucket lists, but for now, we are ecstatic to cross this one off ours."}

Also prominent at the show were new thermosets for higher temperatures and new reinforcements based on basalt or carbon fibers with weight and other advantages over glass.\nBasalt & other fiber news\nBasalt fibers, a promising new reinforcement, are becoming more readily available. Kamenny Vek in Russia has started up a new furnace that will add 10 million lb\/yr to its current capacity of 2.5 million lb\/yr. Basalt is 20% to 30% stronger than E glass and only 5% heavier, so using it can save weight and cost. Basalt producers also claim that glass fibers in composites, unlike basalt, necessitate more frequent maintenance of waste incinerators.\nKamenny Vek came out with a new 600 tex basalt-fiber tape and is working with Ahlstrom Glassfibre Oy in Finland to develop a multifunctional (multi-resin) sizing for basalt fibers. The target is lighter weight reinforcement for very large parts like windmill blades. Ahlstrom says the new sizing will be available on basalt fabrics this year in all standard commercial weaves, for the same price as previous basalt fabrics sized for single resins such as epoxy, vinyl ester, and polyester."}
{"question":"What healing roles do masters serve in martial arts versus veterinary settings?","doc_text":"The promotion of Daoism in China, wedded to the knight-errant tradition, parallels the resurrection of the samurai spirit for Japan\u2019s modern army, whose officers carried swords as symbols of the Japanese soul\u2026.\u201dAlready by the end of the 19th century there seems to have been a political dimension to the perception of Daoism\u2019s role in the martial arts. This would become more pronounced as the Republic era progressed. In time it would become the single most important defining factor in the great Taiji debate.\n\u201cAlthough 19th century reformers had pointed out that archery and charioteering were part of the classical Confucian curriculum, they could only sell the martial as an expedient for national salvation and could not turn it into something transcendent. If progressive 19th century reformers rejected Daoism as representing passivity and superstition, a subset of conservative intellectuals intuited that only Daoism could transform the martial arts into a dao.\u201d (Wile p. 21)\nIronically some of the strongest institutions and voices supporting the Zhang Sanfeng\/Daoist origins of Taiji came from the KMT backed martial arts establishment. While still dedicated to the modernization and standardization of the traditional fighting arts, the Daoist origins of these practices became a critical element of the argument that they were in fact \u201cnational\u201d in character and could be used to strengthen the people, both physical and spiritually. If the reformed martial arts were to be made to serve the national good, it was important to show that they stemmed from China\u2019s ancient primordial past. The myth connecting Zhang Sanfeng and Daoist alchemy to the creation of Taiji, which was quickly establishing itself as the national art, served this purpose admirably.\nOf course not everyone was equally happy with this development. Regional masters in local marketplaces disliked the competition from the new national Guoshu networks as it threatened their livelihood. Yet they did not have much of a voice in elite debates over social reform or the nature of national identity.\nInstead it was leftist intellectuals, also interested in the role of physical culture in social reforms but opposed to the KMT and its conservative policies, who voiced the loudest concerns about the links between Daoism and the traditional martial arts."}

Citizens of foreign heritage constituted approximately 3 percent of the population; they were not subjected to discrimination.\nPolitics and culture reflect a heritage of matai privilege and power, and members of certain families have some advantages. While there was discrimination against women and non matai, who only occasionally reached high office, women (and particularly the few female matai) played an important role in society.\nWhile the law prohibits the abuse of women, social custom tolerates their physical abuse within the home; such abuse was common. The role and rights of the village fono and tradition prevented police from interfering in instances of domestic violence, unless there was a complaint from the victim which village custom strongly discouraged. While police received some complaints from abused women, domestic violence offenders typically were punished by village fono, but only if the abuse was considered extreme (that is, visible signs of physical abuse). Village religious leaders also may intervene in domestic disputes. The Government punished persons responsible for extreme assault cases, including by imprisonment.\nThe Government did not keep statistics on domestic abuse cases, but acknowledged the problem to be one of increasing concern. Under a project funded by the Australian government and attached to the Ministry of Police, the Government was working to develop an interagency approach to combat domestic violence. One aim of the project was to train police officers to respond to domestic disputes and to work with NGOs to support their counseling of victims and abusers. At year's end, proposed options to accomplish the project's goals were under consideration by the Government.\nMany cases of rape still go unreported because tradition and custom discourage such reporting; spousal rape is not illegal. Nonetheless, the authorities noted an increasing number of reported cases of rape, as women slowly became more forthcoming with the police. Rape cases that reached the courts were treated seriously. Convicted offenders often were given sentences of several years' imprisonment.\nProstitution is illegal; it existed, but was not a major problem. The law does not address sex tourism specifically; however, it was not a problem. The law prohibits sexual harassment; it was not a widespread problem but was believed to be underreported.\nWomen have equal rights under the Constitution and statutory law, and the traditional subordinate role of women is changing, albeit slowly, particularly in the more conservative parts of society."}
{"question":"domestic abuse victim workplace rights nyc","doc_text":"The penal code provides for a maximum punishment of life imprisonment for rape; however, most rapes were prosecuted in the magistrates' courts, which have a sentencing limit of 10 years. There were inconsistencies in the sentences imposed for rape by different magistrates; sentences generally ranged from one to six years' imprisonment. The Fiji Women's Rights Movement and the Fiji Women's Crisis Center pressed for more consistent and severe punishments for rape. The Court of Appeal has ruled that 10 years is the minimum appropriate sentence in child rape cases. Women's activists continued to press for the formal criminalization of spousal rape, which is not a specific offense; however, husbands have been convicted of raping their wives.\nAlthough there is no specific law against domestic violence, it can be prosecuted as assault. Police claimed to practice a \"no-drop\" policy, under which they pursued investigations of domestic violence cases even if a victim later withdrew her accusation. However, women's organizations reported that although police generally were more responsive to domestic violence cases than in the past, they were not always consistent. Courts dismissed some cases of domestic abuse and incest or gave the perpetrators light sentences. Incest was widely believed to be underreported. Traditional practices of reconciliation between aggrieved parties were sometimes taken into account to mitigate sentences in domestic violence cases. An active women's rights movement sought to raise public awareness about domestic violence.\nFour women's crisis centers funded by foreign governments operated in the country. The centers offered counseling and assistance to women in cases of domestic violence, rape, and other problems, such as child support.\nProstitution is illegal, but it occurred, particularly in cities. Sex tourism is prohibited by law but reportedly occurred, particularly in tourist centers such as Nadi and Savusavu, including cases involving children. Taxi drivers, hoteliers, bar workers, and others reportedly acted as middlemen, facilitating the commercial sexual exploitation of children.\nThe Human Rights Commission Act specifically prohibits sexual harassment, and criminal laws against \"indecent assaults on females\" prohibit offending the modesty of women and have been used to prosecute sexual harassment cases. Under a new employment relations law that came into effect in April, sexual harassment in the workplace is a specific ground of complaint that can be filed by workers.\nWomen have full rights of property ownership and inheritance but often were excluded from the decision-making process on disposition of communal land, which constituted more than 80 percent of all land.

I wrap the work to slow the drying process or leave the work uncovered or force the drying process so that I can keep working. The clay has to be just right and it has taken years for me to accurately anticipate the proper timing.\nOnce the animal body is fully constructed, I will take a sponge and smooth out the body and the legs, then put it back under plastic so they do not dry out whilst I work on the heads. Once the head and neck are carved and the attachment place is scored, I am ready to attach the head, body and tail together. The neck is slightly hollow and I need to cut a hole in the body to let the hot air escape during the firings.\nBefore the first firing in my kiln, the animal is again wrapped in plastic so the clay will even out. The drier clay will take water from the wet clay. The animal spends up to a week or more in plastic to allow for a slow dry process, which acts to minimize cracking."}

Report gives comprehensive insight on various clinical and non-clinical parameters associated with the expansion of global nano chemotherapeutics market. The clinical and pricing insight on chemotherapeutics nanoformulations of approved drugs helps to understand the current market scenario of the nano chemotherapeutics.\nNano chemotherapy is emerging as an important anti-cancer modality by supplementing the traditional chemotherapy. The main aim of nano chemotherapeutics is to improve the therapeutic efficacy of currently available chemotherapeutic agents by combining it with a nano scale delivery component. The majority of the cancer nanodrugs in the market are liposomes and polymer based nanoformulations which lower the toxicity and enhance the delivery of chemotherapeutics through the passive targeting. It is based on enhanced penetration and retention effect to reduce the lymphatic drainage in tumor tissue.\nConventional chemotherapeutic agents are distributed non-specifically in body where they affect both cancerous and normal cells and thereby it limit the dose availability with in the tumor and also results in suboptimal treatment due to excessive toxicities. To overcome the limitations of chemotherapy treatment, many more therapies has also been emerged.\nThe use of nanoparticles by both passive and active targeting strategies can enhance the intracellular concentration of drugs in cancer cells while avoiding the toxicity in normal cells. When the nanoparticles bind to a specific receptors and then enter the cell, usually enveloped by endosomes through receptor mediated endocytosis and thereby bypassing the recognition of P glycoprotein.\nNanomedicine has already met with success in oncology domain with various product commercially available in the market. By releasing the efficacy of nanomedicine in oncology, it increases the interest of the market players to commercialize the products in the field of nanotherapeutics and helps to increase the global market. The future of nanotherapeutics is bright and especially for the reversible cross linked nano carriers which are decorated with the cancer targeting ligands and it promote the endocytic uptake in tumor cells. The approach has the potential to overcome the drug resistance which is often with conventional chemotherapies.\nFor the next generation cancer nanotherapeutics, the complexity is higher which are under clinical development in terms of hybrid structures, surface physiochemical characteristics and mechanisms of delivery and action. There have been rapid advances in the nano therapeutic field in the past decade."}

From a societal point of view, firm growth has been perceived as economic generator and job creator. In entrepreneurship research, growth has been an important part of the field (Davidsson, Delmar and Wiklund 2006), and many have used growth as a measure of success. In strategic management, growth has been seen as an approach to achieve competitive advantages and a way of becoming increasing profitable (e.g. Russo and Fouts 1997, Cho and Pucic 2005).\nHowever, although firm growth used to be perceived as a natural pathway to profitability recently more skepticism has emerged due to both new theoretical development and new empirical insights. Empirically, studies show inconsistent and inconclusive empirical evidence regarding the impact of growth on profitability. Our review reveals that some studies find a substantial positive relationship, some find a weak positive relationship, some find no relationship and further some find a negative relationship.\nOverall, two dominant yet divergent theoretical positions can be identified. The first position, mainly focusing on the environmental fit, argues that firms are likely to become more profitable if they enter a market quickly and on a larger scale due to first mover advantages and economic of scale. The second position, mainly focusing the internal fit, argues that growth may lead to a range of internal challenges and difficulties, including rapid change in structure, reward systems, decision making, communication and management style.\nThe inconsistent empirical results together with two divergent theoretical positions call for further investigations into the circumstances by which growth generate profitability and into the circumstances by which growth do not generate profitability."}

This way teachers can learn from each other\u2019s experiences and will feel more supported.\nPeer mentoring can build teachers\u2019 skills and confidence. You may consider inviting an experienced secondary teacher who has worked with secondary students with different abilities to work with you for a day, or working with a specialist in the field to support the participation of students with disabilities and developmental challenges in your program.\n4. Learn about the different types of disabilitiesLearn about the different strengths students may have, and read evidence-based strategies that are effective in school settings for each disability.\n5. Learn about common challenges\nYou might see students in your class needing support for different kinds of challenges. These might be challenges following instructions, staying calm or building relationships. You can read more about some common challenges students with disabilities may have and find strategies and tips to support your teaching."}
{"question":"What are the 4 teaching approaches for speech disabilities?","doc_text":"17 of 2002, defines, \"severe or profound intellectual disability\" to mean, \"a range of intellectual functioning extending from partial self-maintenance under close supervision, together with limited self-protection skills in a controlled environment through limited self care and requiring constant aid and supervision, to severely restricted sensory and motor functioning and requiring nursing care\".\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was ratified by South Africa in November 2007, sets out in article 1 thereof that, \"persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others\".\nThis \"definition\" is preferred by the South African disability sector.\nAs 9 October rapidly approaches, it is interesting to consider how the 2011 census determines whether a person has a disability. For census purposes, the understanding of disability is inferred by the questions that will be posed to those interviewed to determine their status.\nIn the 1996 census, people were asked the following in relation to their disability status:\n\" Does the person have a serious sight, hearing, physical or mental disability? If yes, circle all applicable disabilities for the person: Sight 1; Hearing\/Speech 2; Physical disability 3; Mental disability 4\".\nBy the 2001 census, the question was remodelled as follows:\n\" Do you have any serious disability that prevents your full participation in life activities (such as education, work, social life)? MARK ANY THAT APPLY. None, Sight, Hearing, Communication, Physical, Intellectual, Emotional (Yes\/No response options)\".\nOn the basis of this question, the data collected in the 2001 census indicated that there were about two and a quarter million (2 255 982) people with various forms of disability in South Africa, constituting 5% of the total population enumerated in that census.1 On a global scale, more than a billion people or about 15% of the world's population are estimated to live with some form of disability, based on 2010 global population estimates.2\nThere has been extensive analysis into the manner in which these questions have been formulated.3 In her presentation Disability Measurement and Statistics - The State of the Notion4, Marguerite Schneider points out that there are many individual factors that are subjectively considered when responding to the question \"are you disabled?\""}
{"question":"What are some of the common wrong beliefs that custody evaluators might have about what's best for children?","doc_text":"The financial support of any children \u2014 both during marriage or after divorce \u2014 rests solely with the father. This is the children's right upon their father, and courts have the power to enforce child support payments, if necessary. The amount is open for negotiation and should be in proportion with the husband's financial means.\nThe Quran advises the husband and wife to consult each other in a fair manner regarding their children's future after divorce (2:233). This verse specifically holds that infants who are still nursing may continue to breastfeed until both parents agree on the period of weaning through \"mutual consent and counsel.\" This spirit should define any co-parenting relationship.\nIslamic law stipulates that physical custody of the children must go to a Muslim who is in good physical and mental health, and is in the best position to meet the children's needs. Different jurists have established various opinions of how this might best be done. Some have ruled that custody is awarded to the mother if the child is under a certain age, and to the father if the child is older. Others would allow older children to express a preference. Generally, it is recognized that young children and girls are best cared for by their mother.\nSince there are differences of opinion among Islamic scholars about child custody, one might find variations in local law. In all cases, however, the main concern is that the children are cared for by a fit parent who can meet their emotional and physical needs."}
{"question":"What are some of the common wrong beliefs that custody evaluators might have about what's best for children?","doc_text":"Child custody is an issue with divorcing parents. Custody may also be an issue for unmarried parents.\nCustody Labels: Physical and Legal\nMinnesota law uses two child custody labels: Physical Custody and Legal Custody.\n- Physical Custody: The right to determine where a child lives and daily, routine care. Physical custody includes sheltering, feeding, and clothing the children. This is what many people think of when they hear the word \u2018custody.\u2019\n- Legal Custody: The right to make major decisions regarding a child\u2019s religious upbringing, education, and major medical care decisions.\nChild Custody Designations: Sole and Joint Custody\nIn Minnesota, a parent may have both legal and physical custody of his or her child. However, sometimes a parent only has legal custody of his or her child. And in severe cases, a parent may not have physical or legal custody. Minnesota courts use the labels \u201csole\u201d and \u201cjoint\u201d to make these distinctions.\nJoint Physical Child Custody\nWith joint physical custody, both parents live with the child and having the right to make daily, routine decisions, such as what the child will eat and wear for the day. Importantly, both parents share a structured parenting time schedule with the children to manage this routine.\nHistorically, there was a preference to award only one parent sole physical custody. Usually, this was the mother. However, this has changed. Parents are more frequently awarded joint physical custody of their children. However, this is still determined on a case by case basis.\nIn addition, there is a presumption that each parent should have at least 25% of the time with their children. This presumption applies in most situations.\nJoint physical custody doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that each parent has the child for 50% of the time. This is where it gets confusing. In Minnesota, parenting time refers to how much time a parent spends with the child.\nFor example, both parents could share joint physical custody, but one might only see the child every other weekend. In other words, the amount of time a parent has with a child is separate from child custody labels.\nRead Parenting Time in Minnesota to learn how parenting time works in Minnesota.\nJoint Legal Child Custody\nThis refers to both parents having the right to make major decisions regarding a child\u2019s religious upbringing, education, and major medical care decisions.

A hydrogen bond is a type of dipole-dipole interaction; it is not a true chemical bond. These attractions can occur between molecules (intermolecularly) or within different parts of a single molecule (intramolecularly).\nA hydrogen atom attached to a relatively electronegative atom is a hydrogen bond donor. This electronegative atom is usually fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen. The electronegative atom attracts the electron cloud from around the hydrogen nucleus and, by decentralizing the cloud, leaves the hydrogen atom with a positive partial charge. Because of the small size of hydrogen relative to other atoms and molecules, the resulting charge, though only partial, is stronger. In the molecule ethanol, there is one hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen atom, which is very electronegative. This hydrogen atom is a hydrogen bond donor.\nHydrogen Bond Acceptor\nA hydrogen bond results when this strong partial positive charge attracts a lone pair of electrons on another atom, which becomes the hydrogen bond acceptor. An electronegative atom such as fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen is a hydrogen bond acceptor, regardless of whether it is bonded to a hydrogen atom or not. Greater electronegativity of the hydrogen bond acceptor will create a stronger hydrogen bond. The diethyl ether molecule contains an oxygen atom that is not bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a hydrogen bond acceptor.\nA hydrogen attached to carbon can also participate in hydrogen bonding when the carbon atom is bound to electronegative atoms, as is the case in chloroform (CHCl3). As in a molecule where a hydrogen is attached to nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine, the electronegative atom attracts the electron cloud from around the hydrogen nucleus and, by decentralizing the cloud, leaves the hydrogen atom with a positive partial charge."}

{"question":"Is arts recognized as a core academic subject?","doc_text":"\"As a professional discipline, homeland security is complex, dynamic, and interdisciplinary and not given to facile definition. As an academic discipline, homeland security is relatively new and growing, and its workforce aging. As such, there is an acknowledged need to develop academic homeland security programs to try and meet anticipated workforce needs. However, the lack of an accreditation system or a set of available published outcomes (or standards) have complicated efforts towards homeland security program development. At present, determining which courses to teach and which outcomes in each course to pursue must be left to anecdotal conversations, reviews of the scant textbooks available, and idiosyncratic experience and judgment. Consequently, as homeland security programs have proliferated throughout the country even a cursory review of these programs on the Center for Homeland Defense and Security (CHDS) website reveals an uneven and inconsistent set of core student outcomes. Using practicing professionals in a variety of homeland security areas as subject matter experts, this study was designed to elucidate a set of core academic areas and student learning outcomes that could characterize the intellectual underpinnings of the discipline and the outcomes on which an undergraduate degree in homeland security could be based.\"\n2010 Naval Postgraduate School (U.S.).

{"question":"In my role developing parent engagement strategies, I'm trying to identify effective ways parents can support their children's learning process. What specific actions can parents take to boost their child's academic achievement?","doc_text":"Child support determinations and requests can be stressful to manage for a number of reasons:\n- Real costs specific to only the child can be difficult to determine\n- Unpaid support can be punishable by jail time\n- If one parent feels the amount is unfair it could cause tension or arguments\nSome parents choose to take all child support payments and place them into a bank account in the child's name for use as an adult. Other parents need this weekly or monthly income supplement to help with daily living costs like food and housing. Whatever your needs, keep in mind child support is meant to cover the costs of living for your child. If you use it only as such, there should be little cause for complaint from the other parent.\nAlthough children typically live with one parent the majority of the time, healthy co-parenting still needs to take place. Co-parenting with a person you no longer live with can be challenging, especially as you redefine your relationship.\nCo-parenting does not mean you have to be best friends with your child's father. It doesn't even mean you have to like him. What it does mean is you are both committed to discussing important events and issues regarding your child and trying to agree on a unified approach. While it may not be possible in all situations, there are a few key points to remember when communicating with your child's father:\n- Keep each other informed of important extra-curricular activities and events.\n- Stay positive and cordial when speaking in front of your child.\n- Save difficult discussions for a time when you can speak alone.\n- Live by the golden rule: treat your child's father as you wish to be treated.\nRole of Romantic Partners\nAt some point, you or your child's father may decide to enter into a new romantic relationship. Preparing yourself emotionally for this occasion can take time. It can be helpful to discuss expectations about when your child should be introduced to a parent's new romantic partner and what roles that person should take on before any new relationships start.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, single mothers have the lowest median income of any family type.

{"question":"What are the benefits of vitamin D fortification in foods, and how does its absorption differ for bariatric surgery patients?","doc_text":"In 1994 Congress passed the DSHEA which allowed manufacturers more leeway on advertising without running afoul of the FDA. Starting in 1998 the FDA began REQUIRING fortification of products with folic acid.\nIn the case of aspirin, despite clinical studies showing aspirin effect in preventing deaths if given during and after heart attacks, the FDA prevented manufactures from advertising this claim. Later the FDA relented allowing the claim for heart attack patients however it is not an allowable advertising claim to use aspirin as a preventative measure for those at high risk for a first heart attack.\nVitamin C is a dietary supplement and as such it does not go through FDA approvals. The studies on Vitamin C are extensive and the diseases it may have an impact on are many. While Vitamin C is undergoing clinical trials in relation to its treatment use in cancer patients not all of the benefits, or off-label usage if you\u2019ll allow the term, will undergo clinical trials. Since Vitamin C falls under dietary supplementation unless a pharmaceutical company were able to isolate and synthesize the compound in Vitamn C that helps lessen cold duration, for example, then the pharmaceutical company would be unable to patent the drug. No patent = no money as any company would then be able to make the same claim with their Vitamin C.\nWhile the FDA certainly has its place it is not an infallible agency. By tying essential oils up in FDA approvals many would lose out on the benefits of said oils. There is also the matter of choosing what \u2018claim\u2019 to apply for FDA approval on. Looking at Lavendula angustifolia and the many studies on its myriad of uses: which would YOU pick for the FDA approval process and which uses would you relegate to \u2018off-label\u2019 usage?\nWhat is Off-label Usage?\nAmoxicillin is a drug and its on-label usage is the treatment of respiratory tract infections yet it is commonly used in the treatment of stomach ulcers and mentioned in medical guides for use in such a manner. Since it is no longer under patent it will most likely never gain on-label usage for stomach ulcers. From this example by narrowing Lavendula angustifolia approval to one usage for the ease of passing through the approval process you would effectively limit its use and prescription in medical settings. By turning a natural product, that has been used safely for thousands of years, into one that requires a prescription you would limit who might have access to said product."}

{"question":"What are the essential tools needed for basic electronic construction, and how should you properly maintain the soldering iron tip during use?","doc_text":"Stained Glass Soldering Temperature\nStained glass soldering temperature is something I get asked about a LOT. Here are answers to common questions.\nStained Glass Soldering Temperature Questions\nTemperatures For The Hakko FX-601\nThe temperature you need for soldering a bead with the Hakko FX-601 is normally between 360C and 410C (680-770F).\nI say \u2018normally\u2018 as it depends on a couple of factors including tip size, solder type and how quickly you move the iron along the seam. Those who are quicker have their stained glass soldering temperature set at 410C but if you solder more slowly you need to reduce the temperature to 360C.\n360C is a good temperature for starters as it gives you more time.\nHow Tip Size Affects Stained Glass Soldering Temperature\nSome say the size of the iron tip is more important than either the wattage or the temperature. My feeling is that they work in tandem and all feed into the optimum soldering experience. The most important thing is consistent temperatures and no cold spots.\nThe Hakko FX-601 comes with a small tip \u2013 3\/16\u2033 \u2013 which is good for decorative soldering and delicate operations but not so good for running a bead. I\u2019d suggest buying 1\/4\u2033 and 3\/8\u2033 for more control over your beaded seams.\nYou don\u2019t have to worry that the larger tip will cause your solder to spill over. It sounds obvious but the width of the bead depends on the outer edges of the foil joint. The solder is not going spread out onto the glass if you use a wider tip.\nHow To Use The Iron Tip To Control The Temperature\nThe front edge of the tip is the coolest area, next is the side edge, the hottest area is the flat sides. You can control the melting solder by how high off the work you keep the iron.\nIf you want more heat change the angle of the iron tip \u2013 hold it flatter so that more of the iron tip is exposed to the solder. Do the reverse for a cooler iron, hold the tip more vertical (giving less of the iron tip to heat the solder) and the process will slow down. When you get super quick and confident you can turn the temperature up. You just have to move faster!\nYou\u2019ll find the optimum temperature for YOU by experimenting."}

{"question":"What are the positive externalities of public transit?","doc_text":"All physiological processes require energy to run, yet no one uses the word \"addiction\" to describe the dependence of physiology on energy. At best one might say that we are addicted to cheap gasoline but that is just another way of referring to hidden subsidies. So in the end, it all turns on one key question: What is the real cost of gasoline, and how does that differ from what we pay at the pump?\nThe \"Real\" Cost of Gasoline\nAt least ten independent attempts have been made that I know of to estimate a price for gasoline at the pump which corrects for all hidden subsidies, tax breaks, and external costs. The aggregated estimates for all hidden subsidies, tax breaks, and external costs in the USA fall into an astonishing range: from a low of nearly zero to a high of $1.7 trillion per year.\nThe differences between these estimates come from the joker in the deck: external costs, which are known in economics as \"externalities.\" Whenever money changes hands, there are some costs and benefits in the transaction that are not reflected in the price paid. These are the externalities of the transaction.\nEvery time my car runs through a tank of gasoline, for example, there is an increment in local air pollution. This air pollution causes an increase in respiratory diseases (asthma, emphysema, pneumonia ...), and hastens some deaths in my community. Thus medical expenses in my community will increase by a small but measurable amount, there will be suffering and loss of income, and there will be loss of useful life. These are examples of \"negative externalities\" of my purchase of a tank of gasoline, because they are external to (i.e. not reflected within) the transaction itself. Positive externalities are also possible: these are external benefits.\nNeedless to say, estimating the size of these externalities is a matter of some difficulty and controversy. Being myself an asthmatic and highly sensitive to air pollution, I am nevertheless reminded every day that external costs are real and significant.\nLet us set aside external costs such as health for a brief moment, and consider only direct subsidies and tax breaks. What would happen if Congress were to eliminate all direct subsidies and tax breaks for the petroleum industry? By my rough estimate, the pump price of gasoline in the USA would only rise by 5 to 50 cents per gallon."}

{"question":"What are the main symptoms of IBS?","doc_text":"Releasing Anger To Ease Your Symptoms\nAnger is a funny thing. It's useful by letting us know that something\u2019s happened that we\u2019re strongly displeased about. But holding onto anger for any length of time has little benefit. That's because it keeps us stuck in a place of negativity that holds us back and prevents us moving forward.\nThis same pattern happens when you get angry because something triggers your IBS. And it doesn't matter whether it was caused by something you did or by someone else.\nNow I\u2019m not saying that you should never get angry or annoyed about IBS. Severe gut symptoms, overwhelming pain, and the impact this has on your life are certainly annoying. So feeling angry is normal.\nAnd sometimes the anger can even be helpful, at least after it first happens. Anger is a primal emotion that can help you to judge the severity of the situation and the importance of an event. So feeling anger after your IBS is triggered focuses your attention and forces you to reflect on what may have triggered your symptoms. And if you can work out what the trigger was, you can then take steps to avoid this trigger in the future.\nSo, anger can be a useful emotion for helping you to manage IBS.\nBut anger is only useful if you release it after it\u2019s served its purpose.\nUsing anger wisely\nThe problem with anger arises when you hold onto it for longer than is necessary. When you keep replaying the cause of the anger over and over in your mind, refusing to let go of the frustration. It\u2019s especially problematic when it goes on for hours or days after the event is over. When this happens, anger doesn\u2019t serve you, but instead becomes a hindrance.\nSince IBS can be made worse by stressful emotions, the negativity of anger can impact your symptoms and make them worse.\nThis is something I\u2019ve experienced firsthand many times. Most of my anger used to be directed at myself. Back when I used to believe that I was causing my IBS, I would get angry at myself every time it got triggered. I\u2019d berate myself for first causing the symptoms, then I\u2019d get angrier because I couldn\u2019t stop the symptoms either. The anger would spiral out of control and things would get even worse.\nBut even after I realized that my IBS was not all in my head, I\u2019d still get angry at myself if my symptoms were triggered."}
{"question":"found weird animal stripes pattern formation science explanation alan turing","doc_text":"Alan Mathison Turing was born on 23 June 1912 in a nursing home in Paddington, London. He was the second child of civil servant Julius Mathison Turing and his wife Ethel Sara Turing. His early childhood was defined by his parents' absence. Alan and his elder brother John lived with foster families until 1926, because of his parent's constant absence due to his father's job in Madras, India.\nTuring's formal eduction began at Hazlehurst Preparatory School where he was apparently an average pupil, though often preoccupied with his own ideas. In 1926 he passed his Common Entrance Examination and began attending Sherborne School despite the General Strike of that year, which meant he had to cycle 60 miles a day to school and back. He had a hard time fitting into the public school way of life, but his close friendship with Christopher Morcom seemed to help, and for the first time Turing seemed to have found someone he could share his thought and ideas with.\nAll this was not to last, as tragedy struck in February 1930. Morcom caught tuberculosis and died, kick-starting a passion for understanding the processes behind human thought in Turing, and a conviction that he must now do what Morcom could not, which apparently sustained him through the crisis. His preference for science over all other subjects, which had been made even stronger than before by his friend's death, often found him at odds with the schools headmaster, and almost led to an abrupt termination of Alan's academic career as, despite his apparently excellent grasp on physics, he was almost denied the opportunity to take his exams as it was feared that he would embarrass the school by failing them.\nThis never happened, and in 1931 Turing won a scholarship to King's College, Cambridge and began his undergraduate life studying mathematics, a subject in which he earned his degree in 1934. His time at Kings seems to have been a happy if confused one, as it was at about this time he started to become conscious of his homosexuality. His personal life remained confused, though, and he had a hard time making friends. His completion of his undergraduate course was followed by a Fellowship of King's College in 1935 and the Smith's Prize in 1936 for work on probability theory."}

Blamey also told me a story of Turing's arrival at Sherborne during the General Strike: apparently it was you who took the message when he telegraphed from Southampton. Anecdotes of this kind will all help me to construct a readable narrative, and I wonder whether you would be able to help me with further comments?\"\nHarris evidently responded in the affirmative, for several of his stories are included in the book, including why he appointed Turing as his personal servant, or \"fag\", as part of the traditional public school practice of fagging. He had been impressed, he said, by Turing's initiative in cycling the 63 miles from Southampton to Sherborne so as not to miss the first day of the summer term when the trains were cancelled due to the strike. In turn, Harris's younger brother, David, would become Turing's fag on joining the school \"and found him well-meaning but absent-minded as a master\" (p. 58).\nIn the second and third letters, Hodges expresses his dismay at forgetting to return a photograph album and history of the school which Harris had evidently lent to him, and thanks him for his \"warm response\" to the biography, which had been published in the UK the month previous, in October."}

At first, the company thought the attack was just a server outage, but it was soon clear it was the Ryuk ransomware.\nAnother term for ransomware such as Ryuk that targets large enterprises for high ROI is \u2018big game hunting.\u2019 These large-scale attacks involve detailed customization of campaigns to best suit the individual targets, increasing the effectiveness of the attacks. \u2018Big game hunting\u2019 therefore requires much more work from the hacker; it is also a normally launched in phases.

{"question":"four ways answering questions buddhism what are they","doc_text":"Four Schools of Buddhism\nAn understanding of how Buddhist philosophical systems evolved allows us to see the ever-growing subtlety and refinement of view. As typically occurs both historically and logically, one school grew from another, and different views emerged gradually. Four schools of Buddhism are covered as follows:\nThe first two schools, the Vaibhashika (Great Exposition) school and the Sautrantika (Sutra) school, searched for the basic building block of the universe, and because these basic particles were seen as truly existent, these two schools are known as realist schools. These two schools assert only the selflessness of persons, not the selflessness of phenomena.\nWith the third school, the Chittamatra (Mind Only) school, the intrinsic reality of external objects is questioned. It is argued that whereas the mind is real, the objects perceived by the mind cannot have independent existence because of that very reliance on the mind to ascertain them.\nFinally, there is the Madhyamaka (Middle Way) school, the fourth and \u201chighest\u201d, or most subtle school. The Madhyamaka view is the \u201cmiddle way\u201d because its position lies between what it sees as the eternalism of the first two schools that sees objects as existing from their own side, and the nihilism of the Chittamatra school that asserts that things and events have no reality at all.\nThe four schools are divided into the non-Mahayana schools of Vaibhashika and Sautrantika and the Mahayana schools of Chittamatra and Madhyamaka.\nSource: Excerpted from Tsering, Geshe Tashi.

{"question":"four ways answering questions buddhism what are they","doc_text":"It all starts with reviewing what you are currently doing (with the goal of having more space for proactive support).\nThe name of the game is prevention and early detection.\nIdeally you want to look for ways to take preventive measures to eliminate problems or, at worst, detect problems before they get too big. This is how you greatly reduce firefighting support.\nThis can be done in multiple ways\u2026\nAlways track and review support tasks that are arising!\nWith both repetitive and time consuming tasks, take the extra time to root out the cause.\nThen ask how you can systemise or automate your process so that they don\u2019t even occur. Often it\u2019s when small, easy tasks are neglected that problems surface.\nEach time a technical error arises, is it because you failed to do routine maintenance or take preventive measures?\nIs it possible to catch problems in their earliest stages?\nIn handling a reactive tech task, do you simply fix it and move on, or do take the extra step of creating alerts and notifications within your monitoring tools?\nMonitoring and analysis tools are your best friend when it comes to reducing reactive support and optimising maintenance. Automating tasks and using external services can also really help her as well (which we\u2019ll cover below).\nAs far as systems, sometimes you absolutely need a senior developer to tackle a problem. But if the same problem repeatedly occurs, it makes sense to spend extra time documenting how to solve it. Eventually that document can be handed off to a junior developer, freeing up time for more important projects for your senior dev team.\nYou should also track and document your client questions, problems and inquiries. If you find that you are constantly answering the same questions, then create ways for the client to get the answer without your additional input.\nThis could be done by adding a frequently asked questions section on your site. Instead of answering the same thing over and over, you simply point clients directly to the answer.\nEven better, if you are using support software such as SupportBee, Zendesk or Freshdesk, you may be able to create a knowledge base where questions can be asked and related answers are automatically fed to the client. This removes extra communication steps.\nYou can also use the information you collect to feed into design and development project cycles. For example, if you find that editing content causes a lot of problems for clients, you can change the way something is implemented in the CMS to make editing easier, thus requiring less support."}

{"question":"fungal sinusitis diagnosis immune deficiency causes","doc_text":"Stray and feral cats often present with small patches or entire areas of missing fur. There are quite a few possible causes, including ringworm (a curable fungal infection), flea dermatitis (an allergy to fleas), or a healed-over injury such as a wound or burn. The only way to diagnosis the problem is to visit a veterinarian, but here is some basic information on common causes:\nRingworm typically presents as a small, circular or oval patch of missing fur. The skin beneath may be scaly or scabby. It is especially common on cats\u2019 ears, face, and legs but can appear anywhere on the body. Ringworm spores can spread to other animals and humans, and it can be annoying to treat, but it is not serious except in severe cases when an animal\u2019s immune system is compromised. Ringworm is usually diagnosed with a fungal culture. The vet will scrape the area and pluck a few hairs from the animal, place it in the culture, and wait for it to develop, which can take several weeks. In humans, ringworm clears up in a few days with use of over-the-counter anti-fungal cream. In pets with fur, it can take longer to go away. Depending on the severity of the fungal infection and the cat\u2019s immune response, ringworm could away on its own or it might require veterinary treatment. We have had success in eradicating minor ringworm infections in foster cats using a prescription anti-fungal topical lotion applied once per week. Some cats may require stronger medicated baths or oral medications.\nFlea dermatitis (allergic reaction to fleas) often affects larger areas of the cat\u2019s body, giving the cat a patchy, scraggly appearance. The fur may be thin or missing along the back, sides, or stomach. A few minutes with a flea comb can tell you if your stray cat has a flea infestation. There is one simple solution: get rid of the fleas and the allergy will go away! City Kitties recommends using a prescription product such as Revolution or Advantage Multi, not an over-the-counter medication or bath like Hartz \u2014 those don\u2019t work well and can actually harm cats.\nOld scarred-over injuries such as abscesses sometimes result in areas where fur simply does not regrow. Usually these patches are smooth, as opposed to the scaly or scabby appearance of skin on a ringworm fungal infection."}

Some of these disputes may turn ugly. There is no shame in admitting that you cannot surmount your disputes on your own.\nToday, we will look at mediation as a tool to get through a divorce.

In the meanwhile, you can try to figure your way through a difficult situation.\nTips to avoid mediation backfiring\nHuffPost has an article discussing things you may not know about divorce mediation. For example, some believe mediation gives you an advantage over your partner. This is not true. Not only that, but your mediation attempts may work if you go into them with this attitude. Mediation is not a magic cure-all. You must go into it with good intentions and give it a genuine try.\nMediation is also not legally binding.

{"question":"genetic treatment success rate retinal cells vs amoeba reproduction","doc_text":"Understanding female IRD carriers\nResearch into X-linked inherited retinal diseases often focuses on males, but a study at CERA is aiming to make sure everyone benefits from newly developed treatments.\nInherited retinal diseases (IRD), a broad group of genetic eye conditions caused by changes in a person\u2019s genetic code, do not always affect men and women in the same way.\n\u201cA majority of female carriers of X-linked IRDs have a near-normal retina, while at the other end of the spectrum is quite severe disease, similar to what males with these conditions experience,\u201d says Sena Gocuk, optometrist, CERA researcher and PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne.\nThe condition of many female carriers can often be so mild that it is only identified after a male relative is diagnosed with an inherited disorder.\nThis lesser severity has led past research to focus only on males with these diseases, but a new study at CERA is seeking help change that.\nChromosomes, the thread-like structures located inside the nucleus of living cells, contain the instructions for how those cells should operate.\nThey also determine a person\u2019s biological sex; females have two X-chromosomes and males have one X-chromosome and one Y-chromosome.\nFor IRDs caused by changes in the DNA code of eye genes found on the X-chromosome, the sexes can be affected in very different ways.\n\u201cConditions like choroideremia, and some forms of retinitis pigmentosa, are X-linked conditions, meaning they are caused by faults in the X-chromosome,\u201d says Gocuk.\n\u201cFor males, who only have one X-chromosome, a single copy of the mutated gene means that they will develop the retinal condition.\u201d\nFor females, who have two X-chromosomes, an X-linked retinal condition may present quite differently \u2013 with some women having no symptoms, and others noting changes in their vision.\n\u201cIf a female has one mutated and one normal gene, individual cells decide which of the two X-chromosomes are expressed,\u201d says Gocuk.\n\u201cBecause of that, you get a wide spectrum of disease severities.\u201d\nSurvey and study\nThe study involves clinical visits, where Gocuk will learn more about the eye health of female carriers of these X-linked retinal diseases.\nParticipants will receive genetic testing and counselling, undergo a comprehensive eye examination to assess their retinae, and also have the opportunity to continue in the study to monitor how their vision changes over time."}
{"question":"geothermal energy benefits environment effects mining","doc_text":"Hydro Electricity has been around since ancient times. Hydropower was used before power plants that generate electricity with the use of natural resources like oil were used. With the depletion of natural resources and the harmful effects of green house gasses released into our atmosphere due to the burning of oil, we can begin to look into renewable sources of energy. Solar power, Geothermal and Hydropower are some types of renewable energy sources. For my preliminary research done in The Aqueduct Futures Studio I have begun to look into the benefits of Hydro Electricity. I begin by looking into the five largest hydro plants in California. Most of the substantial plants are located in the north due to the amount of water that is needed for these plants to operate. The poster gives facts about power generated, capacity of water that a specific hydro plant can take in and the height of the dams where these hydro plants are located to give a sense of how grand these power structures are. With benefits also come impacts, I address some of these like climate change, snowpack and some ecosystem impacts. The research portrayed is minimal but crucial in the understanding of how infrastructure may change in the years to come for a more expanding future."}
{"question":"geothermal energy benefits environment effects mining","doc_text":"Project Case Study\nDeveloping a mining tax regulatory framework for South Sudan\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Mining\nEffects of civil war on the mining community\nThe effects of civil war and political uncertainty in South Sudan had been causing difficulty in the country\u2019s mining sector.\nGovernment institutions at various levels had been issuing mining titles to private companies regardless of whether they had the legal authority to do so, which eventually led to the announcement of a moratorium on mining licenses in 2010.\nTo help regulate the industry, in 2011 we were asked to work with the Ministry of Energy and Mining in South Sudan to draft a Mining Act and make recommendations for the mining tax framework and related regulations. The project aimed to foster economic and social development by facilitating private sector investment and development of the mining industry, in order to generate jobs and revenue and also offer marketable skills to local people.\nThe project also focused on building institutional capacity to enable transparent and effective sector governance in the Ministry.\nWe successfully drafted the 2012 Mining Act, which would end the moratorium and allow licenses to be granted to foreign firms to explore South Sudan\u2019s mineral deposits and will the way for foreign investment.\nTo protect the interests of the citizens of South Sudan, we proposed a fiscal framework for the minerals sector, and the Mining Act allows the government an optional equity stake of up to 15% in large scale mining operations. It also officially establishes the Ministry of Petroleum and Mining as the regulator for the sector and establishes a mining cadastre to issue and manage mining licenses. These measures will provide the government a managed revenue stream, contributing significantly to GDP and help the country move away from its over-dependence on oil revenue which before the blocking of the pipeline provided 98% of GDP."}

{"question":"diabetic looking for healthy food suggestions what meals good for blood sugar control","doc_text":"One in ten people in the US currently has diabetes and the incidence is growing such that the CDC projects that as many as one in three people in the US may have diabetes in 2050! As such, the prevalence of Diabetic eye disease is likely to increase. Diabetes can impact the eye by increasing the risk of cataract, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. However, good blood sugar control and annual dilated eye exams by an eye physician can detect and treat these findings early to prevent loss of vision.\nWhat is Diabetic Retinopathy?\nDiabetic retinopathy results from sustained uncontrolled blood sugars over several years which damage blood vessels nourishing the retina. The retina is the light sensitive film lining the back of the eye that translates light into images. Diabetic vascular damage in the retina may result in swelling, bleeding, and scar tissue formation within the retina.\nDevelopment of Diabetic Retinopathy\nPersistent suboptimal blood sugar control can weaken the blood vessels nourishing the retina resulting in bleeding and leakage of fluid into the retina. If the leakage impacts the central part of the retina known as the macula, diabetic macula swelling (edema) ensues and central vision may become blurred and distorted. As the retinopathy progresses, the damage to the retinal blood vessels may ultimately result in closure and poor perfusion to the peripheral retina. This may result in the development of abnormal new frail blood vessels that may tear and bleed into the eye clouding the vision and leading to scar tissue formation. This scar tissue can pull on the retina and lead to retinal detachment with loss of vision.\nWho\u2019s at risk of Diabetic Retinopathy?\nAll patients with diabetes (type 1, type 2, and gestational) are at risk of diabetic retinopathy. Risk of retinopathy onset and progression increases with poorly controlled blood sugars, duration of diabetes (most patients will develop some form of retinopathy by 15 years), associated uncontrolled high blood pressure & cholesterol, active smokers, and diabetic patients going through puberty\/pregnancy.\nHow to prevent Diabetic Retinopathy?\nWhile diabetic retinopathy isn\u2019t always preventable, following up for regularly scheduled exams is one of the most important ways to prevent vision loss. Most diabetic patients should expect to develop some form of diabetic retinopathy in their lifetime if they live long enough."}
{"question":"heart attack treatment ems hospital options","doc_text":"What is the average life expectancy after a heart attack?\nIndeed, data from the United States National Vital Statistics Reports shows the median life expectancy of non-MI individuals aged 65-69 is 18.7 years, while it\u2019s just 8.3 years for those who have suffered a heart attack.\nDoes having a heart attack shorten your life?\nOnce you have a cardiac event like a heart attack or a stroke, your life expectancy decreases. Each time it takes a little more out of you and makes it harder to come back to normal. That being said, if you make all the necessary changes and wholeheartedly adopt a healthy lifestyle, you can live a full and long life.\nCan you live a good life after a heart attack?\nMany people go on to live full, healthy lives after having a heart attack. Knowing common heart attack symptoms, as well as taking steps to prevent another heart attack, are great ways to increase your life expectancy after such an event.\nCan a person survive 3 heart attacks?\nThe average person who survives a first heart attack may survive a second, sometimes a third, but very few survive more, said Dr. Edward I. Morris, a cardiologist at Washington Hospital Center, across town from Cheney\u2019s hospital.\nAre you more likely to have a second heart attack?\nAbout 1 in 5 people who have had a heart attack will be readmitted to the hospital for a second one within five years, according to the American Heart Association.\nHow do you strengthen your heart after a heart attack?\nRegular cardio exercise can make your heart stronger. Examples include walking, jogging, running, bicycling, and swimming. Exercise helps your heart pump blood and deliver oxygen to your body. It can lower your cholesterol level and blood pressure.\nWhat triggers heartattack?\nA heart attack occurs when one or more of your coronary arteries becomes blocked. Over time, a buildup of fatty deposits, including cholesterol, form substances called plaques, which can narrow the arteries (atherosclerosis). This condition, called coronary artery disease, causes most heart attacks.\nHow does your life change after a heart attack?\nHere are nine steps you can take to beat the odds.\n- Don\u2019t smoke. \u2026\n- Control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. \u2026\n- Check for and manage diabetes. \u2026\n- Get regular physical exercise. \u2026\n- Maintain a healthy weight. \u2026\n- Eat a heart-healthy diet. \u2026\n- Control your stress level."}

{"question":"armenian culture preservation and resistance ww1","doc_text":"Fact No. 22.\nThe Armenian-Persian legacy dates back to antiquity.\nWhether the name be Media, Persia, or Iran, whether the regime be the Achaemenids of the 6th-4th centuries BC, or later the Parthians or Sassanians, the Safavid dynasty in medieval or early modern times, the Qajars, or the current Islamic Republic, the Armenian and the Persian peoples share an ancient connection that stems in part from their geographic proximity, but also from a shared culture, many elements of which criss-crossed through the Alborz mountains, the Arax river, and Lake Urmia over millennia.\nThe interaction in the distant past was between kings and emperors, and between priests with probably similar practices of worship. Although the dynamic changed when the Armenians adopted Christianity in the 4th century AD and Islam spread further south a couple of hundred years later, vast areas inhabited by Armenians often continued to be ruled or influenced by the shahs next door.\nThe actions of one ruler in particular, Shah Abbas I, led to the formation of the distinct modern-day Persian-Armenian or Iranian-Armenian community. A scorched-earth policy on the borderlands during war with the Ottoman Empire in 1604 resulted in the mass deportation of Armenians from around Julfa in Nakhichevan (a region that is part of the Republic of Azerbaijan today, bordering Armenia and north-western Iran). The Armenians were resettled in the then-capital, Isfahan, which retains the heart of the Persian-Armenian heritage in the Armenian Quarter of Nor Jougha \u2013 or New Julfa, named for the old city.\nIt is Tehran, the current capital, that boasts the greatest number of Armenians in Iran today although the Armenian presence in the north-western regions of the country dates back farthest. In fact, the Armenian churches and monasteries of St. Thaddeus, St. Stephen, and the chapel at Dzordzor form part of the UNESCO World Heritage List within Iran. They continue to be visited as sites of pilgrimage.\nThrough centuries of history, the Armenian contributions to Iran range from trade, to crafts, to culture, education, and even politics. Armenian individuals were involved, for example, in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution of 1905-1911."}

{"question":"as strength coach specializing blood flow restriction bfr training what pressure levels safe and effective for bfr cuffs","doc_text":"In fact, your carb restriction can provide a stimulus to the body that has been found to prevent muscle break down as low blood sugar levels spark the release of adrenaline, therefore, preventing muscle proteins from being broken down in the workout process.\nExercises that require explosive activity is the only time that you need to be concerned about the relationship between carb restriction and performance. For these exercises, you can carb up by eating 25 to 50 g of carbs about 30 minutes before training, known as the \"targeted ketogenic diet.\" The \"cyclical ketogenic diet\" can also be used so that the carb days coincide with heavier weight training or CrossFit days. This is a popular method among athletes, such as football players.\nTo get the most of your workout, you will also want to make sure that you were getting the right amount of protein and at the right times. You want to avoid protein kicking you out of the ketosis state by spacing out your protein intake evenly throughout your meals. This is vitally important to getting the most from your weight training.\nBenefits of Weight \/ Strength Training\nStrength training and weight training or resistance training works on the basic principle of applying load to a targeted muscle or muscle group forcing the muscles to adapt and grow stronger, thereby improving your muscle fitness. Strength training is not just for bodybuilders but for any individual looking to improve their overall fitness, balance, bone strength, or who want to look and feel their best.\nStrength training benefits people of all ages and can be particularly beneficial for people with specific health issues like arthritis, heart issues, or even obesity. Our muscles tend to deteriorate as we age, making strength training an essential part of our overall fitness.\nStrengthening and toning your muscles with isometric resistance and isotonic strength training has a myriad of health benefits. Strength training improves blood pressure and is recommended at least twice weekly to maintain a healthy heart. Weight training also increases the number of calories burned by boosting your resting metabolism throughout the day, as well as during and after your workout. Combined with a keto diet, strength training can significantly reduce body fat composition and help you lose weight. Muscle is also an active tissue, which means that it burns more energy at rest compared to the fat in your body.\nStrength and weight training also boost your energy levels by elevating your level of endorphins, which are the natural opiates produced by the brain. This lifts your energy levels and improves your mood."}

Some of these are environmental and resource issues, rising energy prices, climate change, indoor environmental quality, international pressure, energy security, and natural disasters that seem to be happening more frequently than ever before. Sustainability focuses on the distant future. Resiliency focuses more on the present, e.g. How do we keep our buildings functioning during floods, long power outages, or protect building occupants from smoke and odors during wildfires?\nThere is a new chapter on Climate Change in ASHRAE\u2019s 2021 Handbook of Fundamentals. I was pleased to be a member of the International Task Force that developed that chapter. Historically, designers and planners assumed a stable climate, and heating and cooling designs were based on statistics calculated from past weather data, typically for a recent 30 year period. We are now experiencing major global changes in climate at rates 10 times greater than seen since the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago \u2013 over decades instead of centuries or millennia.\nRelative to indoor air quality (IAQ), a recent survey conducted by Honeywell Building Technologies between March and May 2021 revealed the challenges, concerns and priorities of facility managers. Globally, six in 10 respondents, for example, are now more likely to invest in technologies that optimize IAQ and other aspects of occupant health and safety, while 63% are more willing than pre-COVID-19 to implement smart building solutions that help drive efficiency or support sustainability.\nClimate and Weather\nChronic changes in climate increase the stress or demand on buildings and systems. Acute events, e.g., heat waves\/domes, sustained high night-time temperature and humidity, extreme rainfall, drought, wildfires, etc. affect near-term operational performance, occupant comfort and health, long-term energy efficiency, and productivity.\nMitigation reduces the impact of buildings and systems on the environment. It is relatively specific. Adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate that seeks to moderate or avoid harm, and exploit beneficial opportunities. Adaptation has an interconnected relationship with mitigation and resilience.\nMitigating Climate Change\n- Periodic building audits and retro-commissioning need to be done frequently.\n- Proper commissioning of retro-fitted systems in existing buildings, and all systems in new buildings must be done."}

{"question":"behavior specialist need know principle making rewards effective change behavior","doc_text":"Five commandments for paying the boss\nThe problem is not that CEOs make a fortune. It's that they are being paid for the wrong things. Here's how to change that.\n(FORTUNE Magazine) -- Need proof that the CEO pay system is broken? Just look at the chasm between the bosses' flush fortunes and the plight of their shareholders.\nThe median pay for S&P 500 CEOs hit $8.4 million in 2005, according to Equilar, a California compensation-research firm - a raise from the heady days of 2001. But over the same period shareholders' returns were close to zero.\nMisguided pay is expensive; worse, it is a recipe for decline, because it rewards self- defeating behavior, such as inflating earnings per share to wow Wall Street.\nIt is up to corporate boards to stand up to the bullying of the compensation consultants and to design plans that work for the best interests of the company. One place to start is to limit severance pay and eliminate bonuses when executives don't perform.\n\"You don't get paid for failure if things don't work out in a leveraged buyout,\" notes a prominent hedge fund manager. \"Why should you in a public company?\" And if performance is not sustained, CEOs should pay back the big bonus.\nSuch clawback mechanisms make it less likely that CEOs will \"pump and dump\" - that is, buy earnings through bad management (e.g., cutting R&D), then sell when the stock price begins to drop a few months later.\nThe principle at work should be to give the biggest rewards to those CEOs who leap the highest hurdles to build a competitive advantage for their companies.\nCEOs need to be encouraged to act like owner-entrepreneurs who relish hatching pioneering products and smashing entrenched, wasteful practices. To get there, FORTUNE humbly proposes five commandments for CEO pay.\nI. Thou shalt pay shareholders first.\nMost bonus plans are based on accounting earnings. But that number does not reflect the true profit that flows to owners. To generate earnings, CEOs use capital provided by shareholders, chiefly retained earnings.\nUnder accounting rules, companies pay no charge for that capital. But investors need a return on their capital, just as lenders charge interest for providing debt. Shareholders want the same return they'd receive from investing in any other stock with comparable risk. Today the number, called the cost of capital, is typically around 10%."}

Vaginal itch isn\u2019t a common UTI symptom, but it\u2019s possible to have two infections at once. For example, you may have a UTI and a yeast infection or a UTI and BV.\nYou\u2019ll need to see an OBGYN to determine what\u2019s going on and make sure you get the right treatment. Left untreated, a UTI may cause a kidney infection, kidney damage, and sepsis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition.\nWhite patches of skin on your vulva\nIntense vaginal itching and white patches of skin on your vulva are symptoms of lichen sclerosus. Pain, bleeding, and blisters are other symptoms. Lichen sclerosus is a serious skin condition that may be caused by an overactive immune system. Over time, it may cause scarring and painful sex. Treatment options include corticosteroid cream and retinoids. An OBGYN can help diagnose the condition, but they may refer you to a dermatologist for treatment.\nAs you age, your body makes less estrogen. Low estrogen may also occur after a hysterectomy or cancer treatment. Low estrogen may cause vaginal atrophy. This condition causes the walls of the vagina to become thin, dry, and inflamed. It\u2019s also called vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) and genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM).\nSymptoms of vaginal atrophy may include:\n- vaginal itch\n- vaginal burning\n- vaginal discharge\n- burning with\n- urinary urgency\n- frequent UTIs\n- painful sex\nSince vaginal atrophy symptoms can mimic a UTI or vaginal infection, you\u2019ll need to see an OBGYN for an accurate diagnosis. Vaginal atrophy is treated with vaginal lubricants, vaginal moisturizers, and oral or topical estrogen.\nAnother common cause of vaginal itch is contact dermatitis."}

{"question":"What's taught about German culture and Aquinas's influence on European thinking?","doc_text":"Blaga completed his undergraduate degree in 1917 and enrolled in the PhD program in philosophy at the University of Vienna. During this time he published his first two books, a book of poetry and a book of aphorisms, which sold well in Romania and helped him finance his studies. He successfully defended his dissertation in November of 1920. It was titled Kultur und Erkenntnis (Culture and Knowledge).\nBlaga\u2019s life experiences growing up in a multicultural region (Transylvania was populated by Romanians, Hungarians, Germans, Gypsies, and several smaller minority groups); experiencing the contrast between the peasant village and the modern city; and studying Eastern Orthodox theology and liturgy side by side with European philosophy, history, and science spawned in him a philosophical outlook that gives prominent place to philosophy of culture. Within the broad framework of culture Blaga finds places for science, art, history, and religion.\nBlaga\u2019s philosophical system interacts with the theories of classical and contemporary philosophers and intellectuals. These range from the pre-Socratics through early twentieth century philosophers like William James, Edmund Husserl, and Henri Bergson, and also intellectuals such as Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, and Paul Tillich. The influence of Plotinus, Kant, and the German Romantics is clearly evident. But Blaga\u2019s philosophy is not merely an attempt to synthesize the insights of other thinkers. It is a systematic and integrated attempt to address the issues that occupied the leading minds of his day.\nBlaga\u2019s early philosophical career involved research and publication rather than teaching. He published many articles and a number of books, and served as an editor for several literary magazines. His publications range from fiction to philosophy. His first book of philosophy, Filosofia stilului (The Philosophy of Style), was published in 1924. He also served his country as a statesman. In 1936 he was inducted into the Romanian Academy (a prestigious research institution). Finally in 1938 a special chair of philosophy of culture was created in his honor at the University of Cluj, a leading Romanian university in Transylvania. His inaugural essay was titled Despre plenitudinea istorica (Concerning Historical Fullness). He taught at the University of Cluj until 1949, when he was removed from his post by the newly installed Socialist government of Romania."}

To eliminate the assumption of a linear relationship between natriuretic peptide levels and BMI, we repeated the multivariable models using BMI as a categorical exposure variable. The results of these models with BMI treated categorically were qualitatively unchanged from those that modeled BMI as a continuous covariate. Model 1 used BMI as a measure of obesity, and model 2 replaced BMI with directly measured fat and lean mass values from DEXA body composition analysis. Both models are shown stratified by gender and adjusted for age, race\/ethnicity, hypertension, LV mass, and end-diastolic volume. Other considered covariates (see statistical methods section) were not statistically significant in the final multivariable model. When BMI was replaced in the models by direct measurements of fat and lean mass from DEXA body composition analysis, only lean mass retained the independent inverse association with both BNP and NT-proBNP; fat mass was not associated with either BNP or NT-proBNP, also shown in Table 4.\nLogistic regression analyses were also performed in which low BNP or low NT-proBNP were considered as categorical variables; the same covariates were evaluated in these models as in the linear regression models described above. The adjusted ORs for low BNP (<4 ng\/L) and low NT-proBNP (lowest sex-specific quartile: <7.6 ng\/L for men, <20.4 ng\/L for women) are shown in Table 5. Again, model 1 used BMI as a measure of obesity, and model 2 replaced BMI with directly measured fat and lean mass values from DEXA body composition analysis. Qualitatively, these results are identical to the linear regression models. Higher BMI was associated with increased odds of low BNP and low NT-proBNP for both men and women."}
{"question":"body composition testing methods hydrostatic weighing dexa scan radiation exposure safety concerns","doc_text":"Maintaining the monocytes in such close proximity to the irradiation sources has proven particularly effective in ensuring adequate exposure of the monocyte\/lymphocyte fraction to the activating radiation. In the case where a psoralen such as 8-MOP is used as the photoactivatable agent, the irradiation sources emit ultraviolet A radiation (UVA) as the activating radiation. To activate the psoralen, the monocytes are typically exposed to about 1-2 joules\/cm2 of UVA for a period of from about 15 to about 150 minutes.\nAs noted above, other methods of initiating the differentiation of monocytes to functional dendritic cells may be employed. It has been found that differentiation can be initiated simply by exposing the monocytes to physical perturbation. Thus, for example, centrifuging the monocytes during leukapheresis, and\/or passing the monocytes through the narrow channel in the exposure device, thereby applying gentle shearing forces to them, or subjecting the monocytes to hydrostatic pressure will initiate differentiation of the monocytes into functional dendritic cells. This differentiation into dendritic antigen presenting cells is maximized after about 6 to about 48 hours incubation, under conditions described in this application. Differentiation can also be initiated by administering a DNA binding agent, such as mitomycin C or a cis-platinum compound, to the subject. While these agents may be effective in initiating differentiation, they remain in an active state when returned to the subject and thus are not as desirable as the psoralens for treating the monocytes.\nIt should also be understood that it is not absolutely necessary to separate the monocytes from the extracorporeal quantity of the patient's blood prior to treatment. Subjecting the extracorporeal quantity of the patient's blood to physical forces, or administering the photoactivatable agent to the subject prior to photopheresis and\/or adding the agent to the quantity of blood, and then exposing the quantity of blood including the monocytes to the activating radiation are also effective in initiating differentiation of the monocytes into functional dendritic cells. As long as the monocytes are sufficiently exposed to physical forces, and\/or pharmacologic agents, such as photo-activated 8-MOP, to initiate differentiation into dendritic cells followed by subsequent incubation, separation of the monocyte population is not required.\nFollowing treatment to initiate differentiation, the treated monocytes are sequestered for incubation."}

In the lengthy, technical interview Greg reveals much about the decisions that were made and what we can expect from the console in terms of visuals in the future. Get a closer look at the formation of Flipper in this in-depth interview.\nIGNcube: Can you discuss your position at ATI and how you became involved with Nintendo\u00ae and the design of the Flipper graphics chip? Greg Buchner:\nGreg Buchner:So, going back in history, in 1997 a lot of people left SGI (Silicon Graphics Inc.), which wasn't doing well, so a bunch of us started ArtX and we aimed at doing graphics in the PC space. In early '98 we started talking to Nintendo\u00ae about being their provider for the graphics and system logic for what has become GameCube. At ArtX I was vice president of engineering and part of the founding team of ArtX.\nIn April of last year we joined ATI through an acquisition, which ATI aquired as a way to get into the [home console] space and as a way to get another graphics development team working in the integrated graphics PC space. So, through the acquisition I've maintained a similar role for the team at Santa Clara. ATI already had a team at Santa Clara plus the addition of the ArtX team. More recently I'm operating in a more technical role, I'm giving advice on how we build chips.\nIGNcube: What is your official title now? Greg Buchner:\nGreg Buchner:I'm vice president of engineering, ATI.\nIGNcube: You say you began talking to Nintendo\u00ae in 1998. So from white paper designs and initial design to final mass production silicon how long was the development process? Greg Buchner:\nGreg Buchner:Well, there was a period of time where we were in the brainstorm period, figuring out what to build, what's the right thing to create. We spent a reasonable amount of time on that, a really big chunk of 1998 was spend doing that, figuring out just what [Flipper] was going to be. In 1999 we pretty much cranked out the gates, cranked out the silicon and produced the first part."}

In practice we also find approaches that can be taken as positive examples of the new speculative views. For example, Demitrios Kargotis\u2019 and Dash Macdonald\u2019s (DashnDem) work focuses on critical citizenship education and participation. They are working directly in the public realm. Our practice at the Arts Academy in Split tackles dystopian scenarios in line with the Mediterranean approach (\u201cfrom the edge of Europe\u201d, removed from the European urban and technology centres) and challenges them from a humanist perspective.\nThe above-mentioned examples from the discursive, educational and practical context bring hope that the critique in this field will become more precise and, as David Benque states, will \u201cstart dissecting why a specific approach, or project is, or is not successful in its context\u201d.\nJames Auger (JA) is one of the pioneers of speculative design practice. He is a former member of the legendary Design Interactions department at the Royal College of Art.

With Eastern Europe under Red Army occupation, Stalin was also biding his time, as his own atomic bomb project was steadily and secretly progressing.\nIn April 1949 the United States sponsored the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a mutual defense pact in which most Western nations pledged to treat an armed attack against one nation as an assault on all. The Soviet Union established an Eastern counterpart to NATO in 1955, dubbed the Warsaw Pact. The division of Europe into Western and Soviet blocks later took on a more global character, especially after 1949, when the U.S. nuclear monopoly ended with the testing of a Soviet bomb and the communist takeover in China.\nThe foremost objectives of Soviet foreign policy were the maintenance and enhancement of national security and the maintenance of hegemony over Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union maintained its dominance over the Warsaw Pact through crushing the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, suppressing the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and supporting the suppression of the Solidarity movement in Poland in the early 1980s. The Soviet Union opposed the United States in a number of proxy conflicts all over the world, including the Korean and Vietnamese Wars.\nAs the Soviet Union continued to maintain tight control over its sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, the Cold War gave way to D\u00e9tente and a more complicated pattern of international relations in the 1970s in which the world was no longer clearly split into two clearly opposed blocs. Less powerful countries had more room to assert their independence, and the two superpowers were partially able to recognize their common interest in trying to check the further spread and proliferation of nuclear weapons in treaties such as SALT I, SALT II, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\nU.S.-Soviet relations deteriorated following the beginning of the nine-year Soviet War in Afghanistan in 1979 and the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan, a staunch anti-communist, but improved as the Soviet bloc began to unravel in the late 1980s. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia lost the superpower status that it had won in the Second World War.\nIn the power struggle that erupted after Stalin's death in 1953, his closest followers lost out."}
{"question":"Which countries have left the global nuclear arms pact?","doc_text":"The United States and Russia -- which control the vast majority of weapons -- are negotiating deep cuts to their arsenals as they look to extend the landmark Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START. Great Britain is also considering cuts, and France has already announced some.\nThis co-operation could make it less likely that new nations will start nuclear weapons programs and make them more likely to support stricter inspections, but the true test of how pleased the rest of the world is with these developments will be at the 2010 conference reviewing the nonproliferation pact.\nDealing with North Korea and Iran has proven to be a bigger challenge. Obama's outreach to Iran has yet to produce real progress on its nuclear program, and China and Russia don't appear eager to adopt the strict sanctions Obama wants to impose on the regime. North Korea restarted its nuclear program not long after Obama entered office. And while the country offered to restart talks recently, the offer was based on some ridiculous conditions: the United States would have to formally sign a treaty ending the Korean War (there is still technically only a cease-fire) and the United Nations would have to lift sanctions imposed after North Korea tested a nuclear bomb and launched a ballistic missile last year.\nThis is a complicated issue, and Iran and North Korea have both been working on nuclear programs for decades. Obama can't be expected to stop them in a year. So far, despite various efforts, he hasn't made much progress. But he'll have more chances this spring to press his case, when the nonproliferation review conference and a White House-hosted Global Nuclear Security Summit occur.

{"question":"accessing medical care via telehealth virtual consultations benefits and impact on healthcare providers during covid19 pandemic","doc_text":"As an integral part of the healthcare ecosystem, the medical device industry has experienced uncertainty and significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Along with many other stakeholders, these companies are now seeking strategies for remaining financially viable.\nDuring this crisis and beyond, medical device manufacturers are becoming painfully aware of the weaknesses in the traditional fee-for-service payment model. At the same time, they are being introduced to value-based care and its significant advantages. With value-based care, providers receive payments based on measures, such as quality, efficiency, cost and positive clinical outcomes from private payers or government programs. This approach is about taking the long view to care\u2014from the initial provider visit to months or years into the future. As a result, providers are incentivized to focus on long-term outcomes and the costs of a treatment or medical device.\nTo achieve success in this market, device manufacturers should consider working with providers to help contain costs and enhance outcomes. Stakeholder alignment is critical for value-based care, especially with payers that focus on the cost and impact on population health. When determining a target market, device manufacturers must consider the benefits, assume accountability for delivering better patient outcomes at a lower overall price and offset the potential profit decline early in a product\u2019s lifecycle by partnering with a healthcare technology company with expertise in population health.\nWith rising pressure to curb healthcare costs, it has become important for device companies to demonstrate effectiveness and assume a certain amount of risk. Finding the right technology partner can empower better outcomes using real-time data aggregation, EHR connectivity and dynamic dashboards and quality reporting.\nBefore choosing a healthcare technology partner, however, its important for manufacturers to understand the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the healthcare system, the opportunities inherent to value-based care initiatives and the importance of quality measures and data reporting.\nPandemic Exposes Healthcare System Weaknesses\nImpact on Physicians\nGiven the precipitous drop in elective and other nonessential care due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as many hospitals and private physician practices struggle financially, the limitations of fee-for-service models have never been more evident. Industry experts believe that, post-pandemic, the gradual shift towards a larger share of patient care organization revenues coming from value-based contracts will continue. Organizations making this shift are moving carefully and thoughtfully, building systems that encompass quality benchmarks and risk-adjustment rules."}

The appropriate care procedures and treatments are generally extremely effective in resolving the majority of of such problems. (Tags: Hedging Diseases Crewe, Hedge Issues Crewe, Hedge Diseases Crewe, Hedge Pests Crewe)\nDo You Cut Top or Side of Hedge First?\nWhen you have a hedge to trim, it's typically preferred to first attend to the sides and leave the top for the end.\n- Sides: Start trimming from the bottom of the hedge and work your way up to create a slight slope or \"batter\" on each side. This ensures that the base of the hedge is wider than the top, allowing sunlight to reach the lower branches and keeping the hedge thick and healthy all the way down.\n- Top: Upon finishing with the sides of the hedge, you can then turn your attention to the top. This is typically the most challenging part of the process, especially for tall hedges. Use a sturdy step ladder and aim for uniform cuts to achieve a flat, levelled top.\nIn the event of your hedge being severely overgrown, spreading theover a few seasons might be required, especially if the removal of over one-third of the hedge's overall volume is needed. Taking such a gradual approach could prevent your plants from becoming overly stressed.

{"question":"accompaniment legal proceedings child protection EU","doc_text":"We all know by now that the Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to the constitutionality of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), which makes it difficult to separate Native American children from their families, tribes and indigenous heritage.\nDespite having support from both Republican and Democratic officials, state officials feel the Indian Child Welfare Act violates the Constitution\u2019s promise of equal protection. Furthermore, state officials feel the Indian Child Welfare Act does little to protect the real needs of the child and deprives them of proper placement outside of their community. The 1978 Act was enacted after thousands of indigenous children were forcibly removed from their homes and tribal communities. Some 35 percent of all indigenous children were removed from their families and more than 85 percent were placed with families that had zero affiliation or cultural ties to a given tribal community. The generational abuse left many without a connection to their culture, language, or families.\nFamily courts typically make decisions based on the best interests of the child in question. The 1978 law determined that where Native American children are concerned, one of those interests is protecting their relationships with their respective tribes.\n\u201cThe tribe has an interest in the child which is distinct from but on a parity with the interest of the parents,\u201d Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote in a 1989 decision, Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield.\nThe Indian Child Welfare Act sets federal requirements that protect indigenous children in adoption proceedings and requires state and caseworkers to make several considerations during hearings, such as:\n- the family must be involved\n- appropriate placements that fit under ICWA provisions must be identified\n- tribal nations must be notified of the adoption proceedings\nAny measures by the courts that divert from the above, can place the child in danger. Although the Indian Child Welfare Act is labeled as the gold standard in many proceedings, states such as Texas, Louisiana, and Indiana are currently contesting the law in recent cases. According to some lawmakers, the ICWA violates state laws by simply tipping the scales and favoring tribes. Lawyers for the states feel the Indian Child Welfare Act fosters an imbalance in adoptions proceedings by favoring legal mechanisms based on race and tribal affiliation. Several tribal nations, including the Cherokee and Navajo, two of the country\u2019s biggest tribes, have intervened in many adoption cases that attempted to place children outside their communities."}

Using a specific human cDNA clone, we have isolated and characterized the human loricrin gene. We show that it has a very simple structure of a single intron of 1188 base pairs (bp) in the 5'-untranslated region; there are no introns in coding sequences. By use of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, followed by in situ hybridization with a biotin-labeled genomic DNA clone, the single-copy gene maps to chromosome location 1q21. Polymerase chain reaction analyses of genomic DNAs from different individuals show that human loricrin consists of two allelic size variants, due to sequence variations in its second glycine loop domain, and these variants segregate in the human population by normal Mendelian mechanisms. Furthermore, there are multiple sequence variants within these two size class alleles due to various deletions of 12 bp (4 amino acids) in the major loop of this glycine loop domain. By use of a specific loricrin antibody, we show by immunogold electron microscopy that loricrin initially appears in the granular layer of human epidermis and forms composite keratohyalin granules with profilaggrin, but localizes to the cell periphery (cell envelope) of fully differentiated stratum corneum cells.\nAmino Acid Sequence, Base Sequence, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1, Cloning, Molecular, DNA\/genetics, DNA\/isolation & purification, Epidermis\/ultrastructure, Genomic Library, Glycine, Humans, Intermediate Filament Proteins\/analysis, Membrane Proteins\/analysis, Membrane Proteins\/genetics, Microscopy, Immunoelectron, Molecular Sequence Data, Polymerase Chain Reaction\/methods, Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length, Protein Conformation, RNA Caps\/genetics, Restriction Mapping, Skin\/ultrastructure\nWeb of science\nLast modification date"}

Easter often occurs during Passover, as it does this year, but since Christians now use their own calculations, Passover is sometimes a month after Easter. I usually celebrate this with my in-laws. Other Jewish holidays also are connected to the phases of the moon; for instance, the Jewish new year, Rosh Hashanah, is on a new moon near the equinox in September.\nMuslims also use a lunar calendar, but theirs is purely lunar, so it drifts every year in relation to the solar calendar.

They did a lot of public building, and the populace supported them, by-and-large, in their holy military endeavors. But the Order had become exceedingly rich, and the Knights grew thoroughly accustomed to their lives of luxury.

(Even a great herbal detox won\u2019t work very well without ionized calcium.) Ionized calcium is critical in order to help promote cleansing. If the body\u2019s pH becomes acidic, it becomes harder and harder for the body to uptake other nutrients, such as minerals, vitamins or herbs. The key is to establish the proper acid\/alkaline balance in your body. An acidic pH creates a hostile internal environment, making the body struggle to get the nutrients it needs. The more acid you become, the worse you will most likely feel.\nPremier Coral Minerals are 100% fine-mesh coral powder (absolutely no additives), and are easily absorbed and assimilated. Other products may contain poor quality coral, the wrong species, or many impurities. Some contain gritty coral, often with impurities such as sand.

I personally favor the idea that it is used to gain access to crustacea, molluscks or insects embedded in rotting wood or thick algae. The fish does eat meat and can despatch a frozen prawn in record time (for a pleco). It is also reported by other keepers of these fish that they eat snails too.\nIt is a territorial fish; I had real problems keeping it with a Polka Dot Catfish, Synodontis angelicus, but in hindsight keeping two similarly patterned \"warmongers\" together was not a good idea."}

{"question":"bpmn epc rules events notation difference","doc_text":"For human style BPM which uses diagram to depict the actions of organizational members, instead of servers, may find that the additional complexity of BPMN 2.0 only adds additional complexity without sufficient benefit to the users. I guess that is what Jim means by \u201cBurn Baby Burn\u201d.\nTime will tell, but Jim Sinur points to the most likely and reasonable solution and that is that products will continue to offer multiple modeling notations to meet the needs of the various users.\nAre Business Users Too Lazy?\nIt would be arrogant to suggest that business users just need to hunker down and learn BPMN to be effective. This would be like arguing that a graphical user interface is not needed if only users would take the time to learn to use a command line interface.\nThe counter point is that business people are so busy taking care of business, that they don\u2019t have time or inclination to learn a programming language. The point that Jim is making is that the capabilities that BPMN is providing, is simply not fit for use by business people. Not that business people are too dumb or lazy. About thinking that everyone wants to become a programmer, he says \u201cIt is this IT arrogance that could sink BPM technologies.\u201d\nIn light of the discussion that has resulted from the above post, let me add a few clarifications for the readers encountering this post fresh:\n- I used the term \u201cBusiness Professional\u201d to mean a typical worker in a typical office. Clearly there are many specialties including process analysts and programmers. Process analysts and programmers are not typical business professionals. I mean to speak about the vast majority of business professionals, and not the relatively few exceptions.\n- I never say that BPMN is useless. To the contrary, I say that it is useful for programmers and other specialists like business process analysts. I have traditionally been one of the biggest supporters of BPMN. Since 2005 I have been regularly giving presentation and tutorials on the benefits of BPMN. Still, the preponderance of the evidence is that the majority of business professionals do not gain enough benefit to make it worth their while to learn about it.\n- When I say that BPMN is not useful to the typical worker in the workplace, that is not necessarily a bad thing, nor is this an insult. Everything that has a purpose, has such only in specific situations. I am simply pointing out that BPMN, contrary to a lot of the misinformation spread around, is not useful for a typical office worker."}

If you are overweight, it is more probable to lose weight with a balanced diet and exercise or through bariatric procedures than you would with liposuction.\nYou can be suitable for liposuction if you have extra body fat in particular spots but otherwise, your body weight is stable. Liposuction can also be used in some cases for breast reduction or gynecomastia treatment.\nLiposuction doesn't help with cellulite dimpling or other skin texture irregularities and it will not remove stretch marks.\nAm I a Good Candidate for Liposuction?\nTo be suitable for liposuction, you have to be healthy, without conditions that could be risky for the surgery \u2014 such as coronary artery disease, restricted blood flow, diabetes, or a weak immune system. Also, you must at least:\n- Be within 30% of your goal weight\n- Have elastic and firm skin\n- Not smoke\nWhat are the Risks of Liposuction?\nAs with any plastic surgery, liposuction has major risks, such as bleeding and a bad reaction to anesthesia.\nPossible complications of liposuction can be:\n- Uneven Contour. Your skin may end up bumpy or wavy because of irregular fat removal, bad skin elasticity, and unusual healing. These changes may be permanent.\n- Damage under the skin from the thin tube (cannula) that's used during liposuction may leave permanent spots on the skin.\n- Accumulation of fluids. Temporary \"bags\" of fluid (seromas) may appear under the skin. This fluid can be drained with a needle.\n- Numbness. You may be left with a temporary or permanent feeling of numbness in the affected area. Temporary nerve irritation can also be a complication.\n- Infection. Skin infections are not as common but still possible. Aggravated skin infection can be life-threatening.\n- Internal puncture. This happens when the tube\/cannula penetrates too deeply and may puncture an internal organ. You may need emergency surgical intervention.\n- Fat embolism."}

{"question":"bpmn epc rules events notation difference","doc_text":"Londerzeel and Meise conclude an EPC to make their buildings more energy efficient\nAs of this year, the municipalities of Meise and Londerzeel will, with the support of ENGIE Cofely and Ingenium as facilitator, render no fewer than 18 buildings more energy efficient thanks to an energy performance contract (EPC).\nThanks to EPC projects, municipalities have cut the energy consumption of their buildings by 20 to 25% as well as reducing their CO2 emissions. In Meise and Londerzeel, the EPC came into force on January 1, 2018. This is the first time that two Flemish municipalities have teamed up to submit a joint application.\nBoth municipalities own many buildings, most of which are old and therefore not up to current or future energy standards. In other words, they consume too much energy. In addition, most municipalities do not have the financial resources needed to invest in reducing energy consumption. Renovation work is often postponed.\nThe province of Flemish Brabant has also created an innovative coaching programme to help municipalities to take steps to save energy in their buildings. With this in mind, the province has opted for the EPC model. Thanks to this coaching programme, Flemish Brabant is encouraging the development of EPC projects for municipal buildings.\nAn EPC project\nFor an energy service company (ESCO), an EPC project involves implementing energy efficiency and renewable energy measures, with a contractual guarantee that the expected energy savings will be made and will continue throughout the term of the contract. The revenue generated by these savings is used to repay the cost of the investments made. This limits the financial risk for the owner of the building, in this case the municipality.\nIn the case at hand, the municipalities of Londerzeel and Meise decided to finance the investments themselves. If the energy savings exceed the guaranteed threshold, ENGIE Cofely and the municipalities will share the excess profits. If the savings are lower than expected, ENGIE Cofely will refund the difference. Once the financing has been repaid, all energy savings made go to the municipalities, which, after 15 years, will have more modern, energy efficient and comfortable buildings.\nLonderzeel and Meise\nEPCs are generally used for large buildings or groups of several buildings that consume sufficiently considerable amounts of energy."}

Instead of one or two deer, it\u2019s possible you\u2019ll spot a plethora of porkers! In fact, avid hog hunters are known to shoot hundreds\u2026yes, hundreds\u2026of hogs in one night!\nTo have a successful hog hunting trip, you will want to go out at night, and you will need lights and specialized optics to navigate, scan, spot and shoot hogs in the dark.

{"question":"What kinds of hearing problems can affect the inner ear, and how much more likely are people to develop memory issues because of them?","doc_text":"Understanding Hearing Impairment written by Michelle Tjelmeland\nWhat is hearing impairment and why is early invention so important?\nThe term hearing impairment encompasses a continuum of hearing loss from slight to profound. \u201cThe Hearing Impaired Manual: Recommended Procedures and Practices\u201d explains the term hearing impairment,\u201cThe child\u2019s residual hearing is not sufficient to enable him or her to understand the spoken word and develop language, thus causing extreme deprivation in learning and communication. Or the child exhibits a hearing loss which prevents full awareness of environmental sounds and spoken language, limiting normal language acquisition and learning achievement\u201d (5).\nOnce a hearing loss has been confirmed by medical experts parents will then be able to choose appropriate assistive technology to facilitate their child\u2019s hearing loss. Furthermore, parents will then be able to help their child develop the necessary skills needed to acquire speech and language skills and communicate effectively. Early detection of a hearing loss is imperative so invention and treatment can be established immediately. Untreated hearing loss will inevitably cause a child to be severely delayed with thinking skills and speech and language production. When a child is unable to clearly hear phonetic distinctions during the first year of life, the child is at substantial risk for language learning problems. Consequently, the child will suffer delays or failure within the educational environment and amongst peers (Schwartz, 2). Parents of a child with hearing impairment must be well-informed about their child\u2019s hearing disability. Obtaining treatment and diagnosis of a child\u2019s hearing loss as early as possible is imperative so intervention and a individualized management plan can be established.\nHow does the ear work?\nOne must understand how the ear works in order to understand the type of loss their child has. To explain, \u201csound travels through the air in the form of waves of varying frequency. The frequencies of these waves determine the pitches of the sound that is heard. Sound waves are channeled into the external ear canal where they are transmitted to the middle ear which consists of the eardrum and three small bones in the ear cavity. This part of the ear serves as an amplification system. The middle ear compensates for the loss of the intensity of sound as it travels from the air medium of the middle war to a fluid medium within the inner ear known as the cochlea. Sound travels as waves of fluid to a specific area depending on the frequency of the sound in the cochlea."}

The region's educated workers and competitive wages will help the area's recovery. \"Those are certainly locational advantages that will only continue to attract new industries in the future,\" Schnorbus said.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's district encompasses Florida and Georgia. Michael Chriszt, assistant vice president there, says his group is \"definitely seeing a pickup in manufacturing, not necessarily in job numbers, but in activity levels. Production and orders are up.\" In the retail sector, \"the outlook is much improved.\"\nThere are more positive signs. In Georgia and Florida, the number of hours worked in manufacturing has risen. While the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta noted signs of improvement in real estate, \"it's too early to say things are getting better. The growth in real estate development hasn't picked up yet. New construction is lagging a bit but we're seeing positive signs from Florida,\" Chriszt said.

Manufacturing activity has downshifted to recessionary levels in the United States and across most of the developed markets. And while some high frequency manufacturing data for September and October points to a tentative stabilisation at weak levels, the weakness itself will be a concern for policymakers. Additionally, the services sector and U.S. labour market (which typically lags manufacturing by a month or more) still show signs of potentially slowing further. Healthy employment growth and robust wage gains have supported the U.S. consumer. If the labour market slows and endangers the expansion, further rate cuts could be warranted.\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Russell Investments data as of October 30th, 2019. The business survey employment tracker is a custom composite indicator based on underlying data from Markit, the Institute for Supply Management, and the Federal Reserve System. Preliminary data for October is shown.\nThe bottom line\nConsidering these risks to the outlook, current market pricing on the near-term path for interest rates (i.e., one more rate cut through the end of 2020) looks broadly appropriate to us, even though our baseline is for the Fed to remain on hold. With the expansion entering its eleventh year, we still think government bonds have an important diversifying role to play in multi-asset portfolios.\nOn the upside, further evidence of progress toward a phase 1 deal between the U.S. and China, and importantly, an eventual removal of the tariffs that have been put in place, would be key to lifting the cloud of uncertainty hanging over the corporate sector and re-accelerating global fundamentals and risk markets in the year ahead."}

Glass jars may be reused or recycled, and they don\u2019t contain any potentially hazardous substances.\nThe vast majority of packaged goods are perfectly safe to eat. To minimize bacterial infection, some require particular handling and storage. To minimize spoiling, consume packaged fruits as soon as feasible. Before eating, some packaged meals must be reheated. When it comes to purchasing packaged goods, the grocery store looks to offer a diverse selection. On the one hand, processed foods are typically less expensive and more convenient, thanks to their long shelf life. On the other end of the scale are high-end boutique goods made using locally sourced ingredients and natural preservatives.

An emerging field of research is starting to examine the association of infectious and environmental pathogens with diabetes. In particular, the potential of these pathogens to cause low-grade inflammation that may facilitate the risk and development of T2DM. An understudied pathogen of potential interest is the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). There is some clinical evidence supporting an association between chronic T. gondii infection and the development of T2DM in both animals and humans. The objective of this review is to comprehensively assess the seroprevalence rates of T. gondii in subjects with T2DM in comparison to healthy controls to determine the risk of T2DM due to T. gondii infection. Six electronic databases (Google Scholar, Science Direct, Embase, PubMed, PLOS ONE, and Scopus) were searched using specific Medical Subject Headings terms without language or date restrictions. Fixed and random effects models were used to determine odds ratios with statistical significance being set at 5.0%. Among 1,963 studies, four studies reporting prevalence of T. gondii infection in 1,158 subjects with T2DM and 603 healthy controls met the eligibility criteria. The overall weighted prevalence of T. gondii infection in subjects with T2DM was 55.4% (range: 42.7 - 60.4%) in comparison to 32.1% (range: 21.8 - 50.6%) of healthy controls. Because of significant heterogeneity (Q = 25.529, p < 0.001, I2 = 88.25%), the common odds ratio was calculated using a random effects model at 2.34 (95% CI: 1.17 - 4.64, p = 0.016). Regardless of the limited number of studies and a lack of data, T. gondii infection should continue to be regarded as a contributing factor to T2DM disease development. Further high quality studies that include inflammatory biomarker analysis are warranted to determine the specific role of this parasite in the pathogenesis of T2DM."}

{"question":"compare image processing tools performance cloud storage data security strength weakness explain both","doc_text":"In the age of growing datasets and increased computing power, deep learning has become a popular technique for AI. Deep learning models continue to improve their performance across a variety of domains, with access to more and more data, and the processing power to train larger neural networks. This rise of deep learning advances the state-of-the-art for AI, but also exposes some challenges for the access to data and storage systems. In this article, we further describe the storage challenges for deep learning workloads and how Alluxio can help to solve them.\nData Challenges of Deep Learning\nDeep learning has become popular for machine learning because of the availability of large amounts of data, and typically more data leads to better performance. However, there is no guarantee that all the training data are available to deep learning frameworks (Tensorflow, Caffe, torch). For example, deep learning frameworks have integrations with some existing storage systems, but not all storage integrations are available. Therefore, a subset of the data may be inaccessible for training, resulting in lower performance and effectiveness.\nAlso, there is a variety of storage options for users, with distributed storage systems (HDFS, ceph) and cloud storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob Store, Google Cloud Storage) becoming popular. However, practitioners interact with these distributed and remote storage systems in an unfamiliar way from simply using the local file system on the local machine. It can be difficult to properly configure and use new and different tools for each storage system. This makes accessing data from diverse systems difficult for deep learning.\nLastly, the growing trend of separating compute resources from storage resources necessitates using remote storage systems. This is common for cloud computing and enables on-demand resource allocation, which can lead to higher utilization, flexible elasticity, and lower costs. However, when remote storage systems are used for deep learning training data, that means data must be fetched over the network, which can increase the training time for deep learning. The extra network IO will increase costs and increase the time to process the data.\nHow Alluxio Helps Deep Learning Storage Challenges\nWhile there are several data management related issues with deep learning, Alluxio can help with the data access challenges. Alluxio in its simplest form is a virtual file system which transparently connects to existing storage systems and presents them as a single system to users."}

Google\u2019s Motorola unit is losing money, the Google Nexus margin is estimated to be 20-30% and Amazon is estimated to lose money on the manufacture of its Kindle Fires. The contrast to Apple\u2019s overall 40+% gross margins and 50+% iPad margins is stark, of course. However, the long-term justification for Google and Amazon is that this is necessary to stay in the game with Apple.\nGoogle is in very early stages of this strategy. The Motorola acquisition was just competed in May. The short-term implications of the acquisition are negative: bloated employee numbers, cash flow drain, and delays of its new Motorola Droid RAZR phones. But the long-term assets are substantial: 17,000 patents which Google can use to defend against and negotiate with Apple, arguably some of the most popular cellphone designs and legacies in history (StarTAC), and deep-rooted cell phone institutional knowledge. The Google Nexus 7 was just released in June and Google adeptly entered the tablet market in a category that it did not have to go head-to-head against Apple straight out of the gate. Google compares favorably against others well in terms of app store, number of apps, number of app developers.\nThere are threats to this strategy, but these are not foregone conclusions either. What Google is doing is creating as much real estate as possible for proliferation of its search engine. Through that engine, it can sell ads. There are three threats to this business. First, if people use apps to get the information they want, they will search less. Google is protecting itself here. Google offers Android free to OEMs and to developers, and most apps built on Android are free. Thus, if people use apps rather than search on an Android device, Google can deliver ads through its own apps."}
{"question":"compare financial aspects long term maintenance google ads standard delivery versus solar panel system","doc_text":"As solar panel and installation costs continue to become more affordable, you'll see more and more business turning to solar energy to lower their electricity costs long-term.\nChoosing a Battery for Your Solar System\nOnce you decide to go green with solar, you should consult an expert on how many solar panels your home or business will need, along with the overall kilowatts that system will generate. Once you know the overall power that will be generated from your solar system, it\u2019s time to choose a battery bank.\nA good battery bank is at the core of every solar system, and without one it\u2019s impossible to store the energy generated from solar panels. This makes choosing the right battery technology extremely crucial for retaining power during off-peak production periods (when the sun isn\u2019t shining).\nThere are 3 different types of batteries used in off-grid solar systems:\n-Flooded lead acid\n-Sealed lead acid (Gel and AGM)\n-Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4)\nFlooded lead acid batteries are a wet cell battery that\u2019s filled with electrolytes. While these are the cheapest batteries available, they have the shortest lifespan and require ongoing maintenance every 30-45 days. Regular maintenance includes refilling with water, venting, and cleaning the terminals. It\u2019s important to handle these batteries with care because they contain highly toxic and corrosive lead\/ sulfuric acid. Improper care of flooded lead acid batteries may result in the leakage of explosive hydrogen gas. Most manufacturers recommend to replace these batteries every 3-4 years or 500 discharge\/ charge cycles.\nSealed lead acid batteries come in at a slightly higher price point and work better for very demanding off-grid power situations. AGM batteries are a part of this group, and feature thin glass mats that hold the electrolyte in place. For the most part sealed batteries are maintenance free but will need to be replaced every 5-7 years, depending on usage.\nBattery cells with lithium iron phosphate technology (LiFePO4) are the best choice for modern solar systems of any type. Lithium-ion batteries are more reliable, more efficient at storing and supplying energy, recharge the fastest, and have the longest life cycle (3000-5000 cycles). Lithium Battery Power offers several large capacity lithium-ion batteries depending on your specific solar wattage needs. Our batteries require absolutely no maintenance and are backed up by a 10 year manufacturer\u2019s warranty."}

{"question":"breeding for disease resistance in floriculture crops limitations and biotroph pathogen characteristics","doc_text":"Description of the topic\nTar spot complex (TSC) is a very important foliar disease of maize in many parts of the Americas. The disease complex involves three different fungal pathogens causing significant maize yield losses in tropical and subtropical areas with relatively cool and humid climates. Because of the complexity of the disease, very little is known about the epidemiology and virulence of each of the three pathogens. In addition, although CIMMYT already has several sources of resistance to this disease, very little is known about the relationship and diversity of the available germplasm and its resistance mechanisms.\nThe candidate is expected to study the epidemiology of each or some of the three pathogens involved in the complex. This will include investigating modes of pathogen survival (oversummering), transmission, infection, temperature and humidity requirements for pathogen development, among other things. In addition, the candidate will be involved in studies investigating the diversity of the pathogen and plant-pathogen interactions at the phenotypic level and on a molecular level (provided that funds and resources for this are available at the time). Lastly, the candidate will help develop genetic populations for studying TSC and other maize diseases (e.g., northern leaf blight or turcicum leaf blight) and will learn field, laboratory and greenhouse techniques used to improve the disease resistance of maize germplasm.\nExperience working with maize germplasm and pathogens; willingness to work in the field; ability to work in hot and humid environments; good English skills so the candidate will be able to write and publish scientific papers upon completion of his\/her stay at CIMMYT."}
{"question":"breeding for disease resistance in floriculture crops limitations and biotroph pathogen characteristics","doc_text":"Volume 4, Number 2\u2014June 1998\nWild Primate Populations in Emerging Infectious Disease Research: The Missing Link?\nWild primate populations, an unexplored source of information regarding emerging infectious disease, may hold valuable clues to the origins and evolution of some important pathogens. Primates can act as reservoirs for human pathogens. As members of biologically diverse habitats, they serve as sentinels for surveillance of emerging pathogens and provide models for basic research on natural transmission dynamics. Since emerging infectious diseases also pose serious threats to endangered and threatened primate species, studies of these diseases in primate populations can benefit conservation efforts and may provide the missing link between laboratory studies and the well-recognized needs of early disease detection, identification, and surveillance.\nInfectious diseases respect no species or geographic boundaries. For a parasite, closely related hosts offer new environments in which infection, maintenance, replication, and transmission remain possible. The anthropoid primates (which include humans) and to a lesser degree simian primates share broadly similar physiologic and genetic characteristics and thus susceptibility to many viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths, and ectoparasites (1) that have the potential to cross primate-species boundaries (2).\nSimilarities in pathogen susceptibility have made nonhuman primates ideal laboratory models. During the 20th century, laboratory research on captive primates has elucidated the life cycle and pathogenesis of many infectious agents and facilitated drug and vaccine development. Nevertheless, the ecology of infectious agents found in wild populations of primates has only recently been addressed. Just as captive primates have proved invaluable for research at the level of the organism, wild populations can provide the opportunity to study infectious disease phenomena at the population and ecosystem levels. Research at these levels addresses such pressing questions as the origin(s) of pathogens, determinants of pathogen emergence, and factors influencing maintenance of pathogens in animal reservoirs.\nDuring the past two decades unknown human diseases, including AIDS, Ebola fever, hantavirus infection, and dengue hemorrhagic fever, have emerged from enzootic foci. The emergence of these and other diseases has been linked to the interface of tropical forest communities with high levels of biodiversity and agricultural communities with relative genetic homogeneity and high population densities of humans, domestic animals, and crops. This interface poses a high risk for the emergence of novel disease (3-5)."}

{"question":"What should someone look for when choosing between different types of bathtubs for their bathroom?","doc_text":"How much could you be saving on your insurance? Most lawn care businesses aren\u2019t comparing their insurance policies as often as they should be. Lawn care business insurance has very specific coverage needs, and without the right types of insurance, you could easily be paying too much or not getting the types of coverage that you need. Here are some things you should consider when choosing an insurance agency.\nDoes the Agency Have Other Lawn Care Companies?\nDo they offer custom tailored packages for others in the lawn care business? Or are they simply going to give you generic business insurance? The more specialized an agency is in providing insurance for a lawn care company, the more likely you are to get better service and better coverage.\nDifferent industries require different levels of insurance. As a lawn care company, you have different coverage needs and policy details that impact your business. Insurance companies that do specialize in lawn care may even have specific plans that have been created for your needs and the ability to further fine tune them to match your insurance needs.\nWhen making claims, a company that already deals with lawn care companies will understand your claims better and get you the help that you need. Companies that do not understand the lawn care business may have more questions about the equipment you use, your employees, and your general work operations.\nWhat Additional Services Do They Offer?\nLawn care business insurance isn\u2019t just about the insurance package. After all, auto insurance comes with roadside assistance, and many homeowner\u2019s insurance policies cover emergency hotel stays. Ask your insurance company what added value they offer. These additional services are what may help you decide between similar insurance agencies.\nAre There Flexible Billing Options?\nAs a lawn care business, you\u2019re likely not doing business throughout the year. Instead, you\u2019re probably doing a great deal of seasonal work. You may not want to be paying high premiums during your off time. Seasonal billing options, payment plans, and other flexible billing can help you maintain positive cash flow throughout the year, rather than having to plan for extra expenditures during off seasons.\nHow Many Agents Will I Work With?\nIdeally, you want to have a major point-of-contact with your agency; someone who deeply understands your company and your needs. But you also want to know that there\u2019s someone else to handle your work if that agent becomes ill, takes a vacation, or is simply burdened with other work. Look at how many agents the agency has and ask questions about who you\u2019ll be working directly with."}

The major differences between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic cells are that prokaryotes do not have a nucleus as a distinct organelle and rarely have any membrane bound organelles [mitochondria, chloroplasts, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, a cytoskeleton of microtubules and microfilaments] (the only exception may be a bacterium discovered to have vacuoles). Both types contain DNA as genetic material, have a surrounding cell membrane, have ribosomes[70 s], accomplish similar functions, and are very diverse. For instance, there are over 200 types of cells in the human body, that vary greatly in size, shape, and function.\nProkaryotes are cells without a distinct nucleus.They have genetic material but that material is not enclosed within a membrane. Prokaryotes include bacteria and cyanophytes. The genetic material is a single circular DNA strand and is located within the cytoplasm. Recombination happens through transfers of plasmids (short circles of DNA that pass from one bacterium to another). Prokaryoytes do not engulf solids, nor do they have centrioles or asters. Prokaryotes have a cell wall made up of peptidoglycin.\nIn majority of prokaryotes, the genome consists of a circular chromosome whose structure includes fewer proteins that found in the linear chromosomes of eukaryotes. Their chromosome is located in the nucleoid, a region of cytoplasm that appears lighter than surrounding cytoplasm in electron micrographs. Also, a single chromosome have much smaller rings of separately replication DNA called plasmids.\nProkaryotic cell walls maintain cell shape, provide physical protection, and prevents the cell from bursting in a hypotonic environment. In hypertonic environment, most prokaryotes lose water and shrink away from their wall (plasmolyze). The cell walls of prokaryotes differ in molecular composition and construction from those of eukaryotes. The bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan, a network of modified-sugar polymers cross linked by short polypeptides."}

{"question":"classical music black composers outreach programs impact","doc_text":"Over the 24 weeks of a Classical Conversations year, there are none so glorious as the 6 weeks spent delving into orchestra and great composers.

Handel\u2019s Water Music was no problem, the soothing woodwinds are essentially easy listening, smooth jazz for the 1700\u2019s. Next week I have the privilege of introducing Mozart, the crazy haired, youthful genius of the Classical Period. Who, incidentally is one of my absolute favorite composers. I could listen to his delightful, deceptively simple sounding piano concerto #22 on repeat for hours. However (insert dark foreboding theme music here), this week we are discussing Bach. Fugues and Preludes. Harpsichord Bach. I am not a fan. I know Bach is \u201cthe man\u201d. Prolific as a composer and a father (20 kids!). Hard working and methodical in his ability to have every note in exactly the right place. He\u2019s considered a scientist of music. My local classical radio station devotes the noon(ish) hour to him in a segment called \u201cBach\u2019s Lunch\u201d. That\u2019s my kind of humor, but still\u2026harpsichord? Ugh.

As David Axelrod said a few years back, \u201cNever let a tragedy go to waste.\u201d All the while, supporters of the Second Amendment, like me, are expected to apologize, like it was our guns that were used in the crimes, or simply shut up and let the extremely vocal gun control lobbyists be the only voice in this \u201csearch for common ground.\u201d I, for one, am not going to apologize, I\u2019m not going to be quiet, and I\u2019m not going to let someone else tell me what is acceptable common ground.\nFirst, there are approximately 50 million households in our country that own firearms, and about 300,000,000 firearms privately owned in this country. 299,999,995 weren\u2019t used this week in mass shootings, and the owners of those weapons have nothing to apologize for.\nWe are either a free people, or we are not.

{"question":"What role do fats play in muscle building, and why should I avoid fatty foods before exercise?","doc_text":"Two types of unsaturated fats are monounsaturated and polyunsaturated, both of which are thought to help lower cholesterol. Examples of these fats are olive and canola oils. Monounsaturated fats also are found in avocados, nuts and olives.\nTrans fats are actually unsaturated fats that have been chemically modified. Manufacturers add hydrogen to vegetable oil in a process called hydrogenation. This increases the shelf life and the flavor stability of foods containing these fats. Trans fats can be found in vegetable shortenings, some margarines, crackers, cookies, snack foods and other foods made with or fried in partially hydrogenated oils. Like saturated fat and dietary cholesterol, they raise LDL cholesterol and increase your risk for cardiovascular disease.\nEssential fatty acids are a category of fatty acids found in polyunsaturated fats your body needs but cannot manufacture itself. Good sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids include soybean, corn and cottonseed oils.\nWhen an unsaturated fat is solidified\u2014into margarine, for example\u2014the process turns it into partially hydrogenated oils, which contains trans fatty acids.\nThe Skinny On Fad Diets\nDespite the ads that claim miracle weight-loss for some products, there simply is no magic formula for losing weight. Fad diets, like those based on cabbage soup, grapefruit or protein, may help you lose some pounds in the short run, but they don't work in the long term because they're impossible and unhealthy to maintain. The truth is permanent weight loss takes time and requires a permanent change in eating and exercise habits.\nExtreme diets of less than 1,000 calories per day carry health risks and could trigger excessive overeating following the period of extreme caloric restriction. Such diets usually provide insufficient vitamins and minerals as well. Severe dieting also has unpleasant side effects, including fatigue, intolerance to cold, hair loss, gallstone formation and menstrual irregularities. Most of the initial weight loss is in fluids; later, fat is lost, but so is muscle.\nIt is very dangerous to be on severe diets longer than 16 weeks or to fast for more than two or three days. There have been rare reports of death from heart arrhythmia when liquid formulas didn't have sufficient nutrients.\nHigh-protein, low-carbohydrate diets are still used by some people for weight loss. Although a high-protein diet will lead to quick weight loss, its long-term health and safety benefits are uncertain."}

{"question":"compare boating education options whitsundays chesapeake bay areas","doc_text":"The continuing high nutrient loads, despite reductions in point sources, to the Potomac River estuary and other nearby estuaries have resulted in increasing volumes of water with low oxygen concentrations and the increasing prevalence of dead zones within Chesapeake Bay (Hagy et al. 2004, Kemp et al. 2005, Fisher et al. 2006). In response to its declining health, the Chesapeake Bay watershed leads the nation in the cost and number of stream restoration projects undertaken per kilometer of river since 1990 (Bernhardt et al. 2005, Hassett et al. 2005). The overwhelming majority of Chesapeake Bay restoration dollars are spent on the restoration of coastal areas adjacent to the bay, with considerably fewer projects focused on restoration efforts linking upland watersheds with streams and rivers. Because water, sediment, nutrients, and chemicals are increasingly mobile, a whole-basin approach to restoration could help to reduce the discouraging trends in contaminant loading for Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River (Palmer 2009). This approach may involve increased funding for restoration efforts and stormwater management in upper parts of the watershed, in addition to local stream, riparian, and coastal restoration efforts in urban core areas at large river outlets.\nDuring the past several decades, the widespread effects of acid rain, ozone depletion, and global climate change have served as major impetus for understanding ecosystem-level processes and the creation of regional and national policies (e.g., Likens and Bormann 1974, Aber et al. 1989, Keeling et al. 1995, Vitousek et al. 1997, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2007). However, these particular disturbances are mainly associated with atmospheric pollution and typically represent a vertical perspective in understanding environmental change. Considering humans as major transporters of nutrients within and between watersheds requires more detailed information on the demographics of watershed inhabitants, their mobility, and their behavior. Initiating studies with a more horizontal perspective is likely to be a far more interdisciplinary process than has previously been undertaken, but offers the best hope of understanding the novel fluxes of energy and materials that have increasingly come to characterize large river ecosystems in post-industrial landscapes.\nResponses to this article are invited.

{"question":"I'm interested in watches with art pieces inside them. Can you tell me what the Art Piece 1 watch looks like and what rights would the building owner have if this art was painted on their wall instead?","doc_text":"Whoever coined the phrase \u201cbetter late than never\u201d clearly didn\u2019t own a watch. Watches are a valuable investment for any individual, young or old, and serve a variety of purposes. The most important aspects for consumers to consider are cost and quality, and in some cases, brand name.\nOrnate, luxurious watches are a necessity to some, while others place the focus on function. Extravagant watches can be very expensive but there are ways to acquire lavish watches for a fraction of the cost. Most watches are manufactured to last indefinitely, making used and refurbished watches a practical investment.\nUsed watches are desirable because of their cost; purchasing a second-hand watch allows shoppers to acquire a solid piece without compromising quality. All watches depreciate as soon as they are purchased, so buying a used watch allows consumers to avoid this initial drop in value.\nWhen looking for a used watch, it is often helpful to consider refurbished pieces. These watches have been carefully inspected and repaired by a watch specialist. Restoring a used watch can entail the replacement of one or two parts to several components, breathing new life into the piece. In fact, it can be hard to tell the difference between a new watch and a well-polished, refurbished watch.\nSome resellers offer a warranty on refurbished watches, providing the consumer with piece of mind. These vendors are confident that a used watch is as dependable as a new watch. In the case of a purchase made outside of a jewelry or watch store, it is helpful to clarify the age of second-hand piece in case part of the original warranty still applies.\nThe value of a used watch can also be determined by its certification. More expensive watches often come with papers that declare their authenticity and confirm their value. Any watch owner who appreciates the value of their piece will keep this important document, especially if they have any intention of selling the watch in the future. When a used watch is accompanied by a certification record, the buyer feels more secure in the investment.\nThere are also many practical advantages to buying a second-hand watch. With the exception of high-priced pieces, used watches can be easily replaced so they do not have to be diligently safeguarded.

{"question":"I'm worried about my premature baby in the NICU - what kind of tests and nursing care will they need to check their brain development?","doc_text":"Forming a Bond With Your Baby -- Why It Isn't Always Immediate\nWhy Am I Not Bonding With My Baby? continued...\nBonding can be especially difficult if you had a C-section or couldn't see your baby right after the birth. It can also be difficult if your baby was premature and had to spend time in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), or if you adopted the child. It may take longer to bond in these instances, but it eventually should happen.\nSome mothers develop postpartum depression, which prevents them from completely bonding with their baby. The pain and exhaustion from childbirth -- especially from a difficult delivery -- can also get in the way of the bonding process.\nSometimes, a mother's or father's situation can affect her or his relationship with the new baby. Any of the following can interfere with your efforts at bonding:\n- A childhood that lacked a positive parental role model\n- A history of depression or mental illness\n- A past pregnancy loss or loss of a child\n- Lack of a social network\n- Life stresses such as a difficult job, unemployment, or other financial troubles\n- Marital problems or abuse\nAre There Tips for Bonding With My Baby?\nHere are some suggestions that will make it easier to bond with your baby:\n- Ask to room-in with your baby at the hospital. Sleeping in the same room will give you more time to get to know one another.\n- If your baby is premature, ask the hospital staff if you can touch and hold him. Just talking to your baby can help the two of you bond. Visit the NICU often to see your baby.\n- Once you get home, spend as much time as possible with your baby by wearing her in a sling or carrier, rocking her on your lap, or singing her a song. Your voice and touch can be very comforting.\n- Try giving your baby a gentle massage. Research has found that massage can not only improve the relationship between parent and baby, but it also can relieve stress in premature infants and ease postpartum depression in the mother. To learn how to massage your baby the right way, get a video, read a book, or take a class at a local hospital.\n- Try making skin-to-skin contact with your newborn. This practice, called \"kangaroo care,\" is often used in premature babies, but studies are finding that it's also calming to babies born full-term. It not only helps with bonding, but it also can improve your baby's ability to breastfeed."}
{"question":"I'm worried about both my heart health and digestion - should I stick to low-fat dairy products, and what digestive problems might dairy cause?","doc_text":"What are lectins?\nLectins are a type of protein that can bind to cell membranes. They are sugar-binding and become the \u201cglyco\u201d portion of glycoconjugates on the membranes. Lectins offer a way for molecules to stick together without getting the immune system involved, which can influence cell-cell interaction.\nLectins are abundant in raw legumes and grains, and most commonly found in the part of the seed that becomes the leaves when the plant sprouts, aka the cotyledon, but also on the seed coat. They\u2019re also found in dairy products and certain vegetables. While lectin content in food is fairly constant, the genetic altering of plants has created some fluctuations.\nLectins in plants are a defense against microorganisms, pests, and insects. They may also have evolved as a way for seeds to remain intact as they passed through animals\u2019 digestive systems, for later dispersal. Lectins are resistant to human digestion and they enter the blood unchanged.\nWhy are lectins so important?\nLectins are thought to play a role in immune function, cell growth, cell death, and body fat regulation.\nImmune response and toxicity\nBecause we don\u2019t digest lectins, we often produce antibodies to them. Almost everyone has antibodies to some dietary lectins in their body. This means our responses vary. Certain foods can even become intolerable to someone after an immune system change or the gut is injured from another source. The presence of particular lectins can stimulate an immune system response.\nThere are some lectins that no one should consume. Ever wonder why you don\u2019t see sprouted red kidney beans?\nIt\u2019s due to phytohaemagglutinin \u2013 a lectin that can cause red kidney bean poisoning. The poisoning is usually caused by the ingestion of raw, soaked kidney beans. As few as four or five raw beans can trigger symptoms.\nRaw kidney beans contain from 20,000 to 70,000 lectin units, while fully cooked beans usually contain between 200 and 400 units.\nWhile many types of lectins cause negative reactions in the body, there are also health promoting lectins that can decrease incidence of certain diseases. Furthermore, the body uses lectins to achieve many basic functions, including cell to cell adherence, inflammatory modulation and programmed cell death.\nWhat you should know about lectins\nIngesting lectins can cause flatulence."}

{"question":"how matter velocity affect primordial star formation","doc_text":"By observing the velocity trajectories, it can be concluded that the velocity of each follower is time-varying periodically, which can achieve the desired velocity trajectory. Also, the velocity of virtual leader can tend to zero, which accords to the modes of the leader (1). The position trajectory within t = 20 s of the UAV swarm system is shown in Figure 6; one can see that three followers can achieve the given time-varying formation when tracking the leader. The position snapshots of the four UAVs are shown in Figure 7, where the UAVs are represented by a circle, plus sign, triangle, and square respectively. Figure 7(a) depicts the process of forming a given formation in 1\u20137 s. It can be see that the followers approach the leader from all directions, and the leader stabilizes at one point eventually. Figures 7(b) and 7(c) further show the change of UAVs position within one period . From Figures 7(b) and 7(c), it can be obtained that the formation is time-varying and the follower moves around the leader periodically. Therefore, the effectiveness of the time-varying formation tracking control scheme is validated for the UAV swarm systems (1) and (3) with the actuator faults and switching topologies.\nIf the control protocol is designed without considering the actuator faults, it can be given as follows:\nIn order to validate the ability of handling faults of the proposed method, comparison simulations are performed for the abovementioned described quadrotor UAVs system with the proposed control protocol (7) and control protocol (29), respectively. The position error curves and the velocity error curves in the X and Y directions are shown in Figures 8 and 9, respectively. In Figures 8 and 9, the solid lines are obtained by using the proposed control protocol (7) in Theorem 1, and dashed lines are obtained by using the control protocol (29). From the simulation results, it is easy to see that the formation tracking performance is good with the proposed control method, while the formation tracking performance cannot be achieved with the control protocol (29) because it does not have the ability to deal with the actuator faults. Therefore, the effectiveness of the control method in this paper is validated.\nThe fault-tolerant time-varying formation tracking control for the UAV swarm systems with actuator faults and the switching topologies is studied."}

Your attorney must fulfill the service of process requirement and provide the opposing party with copies of the summons and complaint.\nAfter the insurance company receives these documents, they have a set number of days, typically between 20 and 30, to file its response to your lawsuit with the court. Upon filing the response, your case can officially commence.\nEngaging in Discovery\nThe discovery phase is the most important part of a personal injury lawsuit and also the most time-consuming. During this phase of a lawsuit, both parties have the opportunity to request and obtain evidence and documentation to help build their cases.\nSeveral tools are at an attorney\u2019s disposal to get the information they need, including:\n- Requests for production\n- Requests for admissions\nAmong these tools, depositions are widely used and favored by lawyers.\nWhat Is a Deposition?\nA deposition lets an attorney get a recorded statement from a party, referred to as the deponent, under oath.\nA lawyer may decide to depose a party to get vital information from them to help strengthen their case. Potential deponents can include a party to the case or any witness with knowledge about the case that can provide helpful details.\nWhen an attorney wants to depose a party, they send that party what is called a subpoena. A subpoena informs that person they\u2019re being deposed and gives information regarding time and location.\nDuring a deposition, the party requesting the deposition can ask questions, and the opposing party\u2019s attorney may also have the opportunity to ask questions. A court reporter is present to properly transcribe everything people say during the deposition.\nTypically, an attorney can schedule as many depositions as they feel necessary to get everything they need before concluding the discovery phase.\nWhat Happens After Depositions Conclude?\nAfter a deposition, the attorney will usually request the court reporter\u2019s transcript of the proceedings. Having a transcript allows the lawyer to read and reread what was said during the deposition to extract the information they need most. This is usually the case for every deposition.\nOnce both attorneys have finished taking all of the depositions they want, they can either continue with discovery or conclude discovery altogether."}

Mesophyll cells are sandwiched between the leaf\u2019s upper and lower epidermis and contain numerous chloroplasts, where photosynthesis takes place. Chloroplasts are incredibly small.\nWhy is the root of a plant unable to absorb mineral salts from the soil if it is given a poison that prevents respiration?\nSince the poison prevents respiration from occurring in the root, the energy needed to move mineral salts from the soil through the membranes of the root cells into the root cannot be made.\nWhat is photosynthesis question answer?\nAnswer: Photosynthesis is the process in which green plants use sunlight to make their own food. Photosynthesis requires sunlight, chlorophyll, water, and carbon dioxide gas as raw materials.\nDoes the size of a leaf affect photosynthesis?\nYes, larger the leaf size, higher is the rate of photosynthesis. Larger leaf size has a broader surface area with more chloroplasts, absorbs more light from the sun and more number of stomata present on the surface of the leaves, which play a crucial role in gaseous exchange during the process of photosynthesis.\nHow are minerals transported into the roots of a plant?\nRoot hair cells Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis. They absorb mineral ions by active transport, against the concentration gradient. Root hair cells are adapted for taking up water and mineral ions by having a large surface area to increase the rate of absorption.\nWhat is photosynthesis for 8th class?\nPhotosynthesis is the physico-chemical process by which plants can convert light energy into chemical energy, in the form of carbohydrate from simple inorganic substances like atmospheric carbon dioxide and water. Photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide, sunlight, water and chlorophyll as its basic raw materials."}

I would repurchase this item if I could get it for cheaper. In the meantime, I will be trying out some of the other brands."}
{"question":"human role ai military decision making systems","doc_text":"recommendations without being able to assess them. This challenge can be mitigated by reverse engineering the recommendations made by AI.\n2. You Use Vendor-provided AI Without Understanding Their Models\nSome companies decide to buy or license AI from others rather than building the technology in house. As with any strategic decision, there\u2019s a downside to this approach. You can\u2019t trust the vendor\u2019s suggestions that AI will be beneficial blindly. You need to ask tough questions about how the systems protect your data and what systems AI tools can access. Overcome this challenge by asking your vendors to explain their assumptions about data and machine learning.\n3. You Don\u2019t Test AI Security Independently\nWhen you use an AI or machine learning tool, you need to entrust a significant amount of data to it. To trust the system, it must be tested from a cybersecurity perspective. For example, consider whether the system can be compromised by SQL injection or other hacking techniques. If a hacker can compromise the algorithm or data in an AI system, the quality of your company\u2019s decision making will suffer.\n4. Your Organization Lacks AI Cybersecurity Skills\nTo carry out AI cybersecurity tests and evaluations, you need skilled staff. Unfortunately, there are relatively few cyber professionals who are competent in security and AI. Fortunately, this mistake can be overcome with a talent development program. Offer your cybersecurity professionals the opportunity to earn certificates, attend conferences, and use other resources to increase their AI knowledge.\n5. You Avoid Using AI Completely for Security Reasons\nBased on the previous mistakes, you might assume that avoiding AI and machine learning completely is a smart move. That might\u2019ve been an option a decade ago, but AI and machine learning are now part of every tool you use at work. Attempting to minimize AI risk by ignoring this technology trend will only expose your organization to greater risk. It\u2019s better to seek proactive solutions that leverage AI. For instance, you can use security chatbots such as Apollo to make security more convenient for your staff.\n6. You Expect too Much Transformation from AI\nGoing into an AI implementation with unreasonable expectations will cause security and productivity problems. Resist the urge to apply AI to every business problem in the organization. Such a broad implementation would be very difficult to monitor from a security point of view. Instead, take the low-risk approach: apply AI for one area at a time, such as automating routine security administration tasks, and then build from there."}
{"question":"how compare quiet calm behavior reinforcement methods dogs birds","doc_text":"However, 18% reported using an \u201calpha roll\u201d and as many as 26% used a \u201cstare down\u201d to \u201ccorrect\u201d their dog. 11% admitting to hitting or kicking their dogs, and 14% to roughly grabbing the dog by the scruff or jowls.\nHere are the numbers that matter: The most confrontational, and I would argue, aggressive, behaviors on the part of the owners resulted in the highest levels of aggressive responses from the dogs. 43% of dogs responded with aggression to being hit or kicked, 38% to having an owner grab their mouth and take out an object forcefully, 36% to having a muzzle put on (or attempted?), 29% to a \u201cdominance down,\u201d 26% to a jowl or scruff shake. You get the idea. Of course, these are all dogs who were seen by veterinary behaviorists for aggression-related problems, but it makes the data even more important. Violence begets violence, aggression begets aggression.\nAn important distinction: Note that the authors, correctly, did NOT label the owner\u2019s responses as \u201cpunishment\u201d or \u201creinforcement.\u201d For one thing, \u201cpunishment\u201d is an action that results in a decrease in behavior, so if an owner stares a dog down (argh! who ever started that idea anyway!) and the dog becomes more aggressive, the stare down was not punishment. Second, there are all kinds of actions correctly termed as \u201cpositive punishment\u201d that have nothing to do with force or confrontations. For example, I use tons of food (positive reinforcement) to teach dogs a solid stay, and respond to breaks in a stay with a Body Block (Here\u2019s a video as an example.). A Body Block is an example of positive punishment (adding something to decrease the frequency of a behavior), but it is not confrontational or threatening if done correctly. (Note how little I move in the video, and how cheerful the entire episode is.)\nThus, the study is not so much about \u201creinforcement\u201d and \u201cpunishment,\u201d as about what happens when you threaten your dog, or forcefully and physically respond to misbehavior. Please be clear that I am not saying that if one of us occasionally raises our voice to our dog, or has a moment of humanity and loses our temper, we are going to destroy our dogs forever."}

{"question":"im curious what makes farmers change pest control methods explain system factors","doc_text":"Pest control is one of those tasks that you might think is easy enough to take on yourself \u2013 but it\u2019s important to understand the risks before you decide to DIY. In this article, we\u2019ll explore why it\u2019s best to leave pest control to professionals and examine the dangers of DIY pest control. Read on for more information!\nIntroduction to DIY Pest Control\nWhen it comes to pest control, most people think that they can handle it themselves. After all, how hard could it be? Just buy some poison and set it out, right? Wrong. Pest control is a lot more complicated than that, and if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, you could end up doing more harm than good.\nHere are a few reasons why you should leave pest control to the professionals:\n- Pest Control Products Are Dangerous\nThe pesticides and other products used for pest control are designed to be poisonous. That\u2019s why they\u2019re effective at killing pests. But if you\u2019re not careful, they can also be dangerous to humans and animals. If you use them incorrectly, you could end up making your home uninhabitable \u2013 or worse.\n- You Might Not Be Using the Right Products\nThere are a lot of different pest control products on the market, and each one is designed to kill specific types of pests. If you don\u2019t know what kind of pests you have, you could end up using the wrong product \u2013 which means it won\u2019t work and the pests will just keep coming back.\n- Pests Can Become Immune to DIY Methods Just like bacteria can become immune to antibiotics, pests can become immune to DIY pest control methods. So even if you think you\u2019ve got them under control, they could come back.\nThe Risks of DIY Pest Control\nThere are a number of risks associated with do-it-yourself pest control methods. First and foremost, if you misidentify the type of pest you\u2019re dealing with, you could end up using the wrong type of pesticide or another treatment method, which could make the problem worse.\nIn addition, many DIY pest control products are not as effective as professional-grade products, and may not be able to completely eliminate the problem. This can leave you with a false sense of security, thinking the problem is gone when it\u2019s really not.\nAnother risk is that if you don\u2019t apply the product correctly, you could end up harming yourself or your family members."}

{"question":"I've heard that Taoism is both a religion and a philosophy - what are the basic principles and characteristics that define the Tao or the Way?","doc_text":"Yet out of the midst of this din and turmoil, this strife and struggle, this hatred and jealousy of religions and sects, there have arisen, from time to time, potent voices, drowning all this noise \u2014 making themselves heard from pole to pole, as it were \u2014 proclaiming peace and harmony. Will it ever come?\nIs it possible that there should ever reign unbroken harmony in this plane of mighty religious struggle. The world is exercised in the latter part of this century by the question of harmony; in society, various plans are being proposed, and attempts are made to carry them into practice; but we know how difficult it is to do so. People find that it is almost impossible to mitigate the fury of the struggle of life, to tone down the tremendous nervous tension that is in man. Now, if it is so difficult to bring harmony and peace to the physical plane of life \u2014 the external, gross, and outward side of it \u2014 then a thousand times more difficult is it to bring peace and harmony to rule over the internal nature of man. I would ask you for the time being to come out of the network of words. We have all been hearing from childhood of such things as love, peace, charity, equality, and universal brotherhood; but they have become to us mere words without meaning, words which we repeat like parrots, and it has become quite natural for us to do so. We cannot help it. Great souls, who first felt these great ideas in their hearts, manufactured these words; and at that time many understood their meaning. Later on, ignorant people have taken up those words to play with them and made religion a mere play upon words, and not a thing to be carried into practice. It becomes \u201cmy father\u2019s religion\u201d, \u201cour nation\u2019s religion\u201d, \u201cour country\u2019s religion\u201d, and so forth. It becomes only a phase of patriotism to profess any religion, and patriotism is always partial. To bring harmony into religion must always be difficult. Yet we will consider this problem of the harmony of religions.\nWe see that in every religion there are three parts \u2014 I mean in every great and recognised religion. First, there is the philosophy which presents the whole scope of that religion, setting forth its basic principles, the goal and the means of reaching it. The second part is mythology, which is philosophy made concrete. It consists of legends relating to the lives of men, or of supernatural beings, and so forth."}
{"question":"Which natural materials produce specific color dyes?","doc_text":"Push a cart down a supermarket aisle, and you\u2019ll pass a kaleidoscope of color. The use of artificial dyes by foodmakers is up by half since 1990, and it\u2019s not limited to candy. The list of foods made pretty by chemicals now includes pickles, bagels and port wine cheese balls.\n\u201cAmericans are really turned on by a bright-red strawberry juice, and they think it\u2019s natural,\u201d said Kantha Shelke, co-president of the food research firm Corvus Blue. \u201cOr cheese \u2014 cheese is naturally a pale color, but most young kids will not eat cheese unless it\u2019s a bright, almost fluorescent orange.\u201d\nFoodmakers have used dyes since ancient times to make food more appealing to the eye. But the practice has so invaded the modern psyche that artificial dyes are being used even on some pet foods. Dogs see limited color, but apparently their owners don\u2019t like buying dull, gray chow.\nNow, federal regulators are reexamining artificial ingredients they have long deemed to be safe, prompted by scientific studies suggesting that color additives might be linked to hyperactivity in children and other health effects. On Wednesday, an advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration will begin a two-day meeting to discuss the science behind artificial dyes and whether the government ought to restrict their use.\n\u201cThere are sometimes nine different dyes in a food product,\u201d said Laura Anderko of Georgetown University Medical Center, who serves on the Children\u2019s Health Protection Advisory Committee for the Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cMoms and dads will say, \u2018Here\u2019s a fruit roll-up \u2014 that must be healthy.\u2019 But it\u2019s filled with dyes. And emerging science suggests it\u2019s a harm to children.\u201d\nTwo recent studies sponsored by the British government found that children given foods made with some artificial dyes and a food preservative, sodium benzoate, showed an increase in hyperactivity. The study sampled children in the general population, not just those known to show hyperactive behavior.\nThe studies remain controversial, with some scientists skeptical about the links that can be drawn."}

Viscoelastic properties of rubber composites reinforced by soy spent flakes and carbon black co-filler [abstract]. Proceedings of American Chemical Society National Meeting. 94:459-460. Technical Abstract: In rubber reinforcement, the filler network structure has a significant effect on rubber modulus. Different preparation methods may produce different filler network structures, and lead to different reinforcement effects. In this study, more insight on the reinforcement mechanism is obtained by comparing different preparation methods - casting versus freeze-drying. Soy spent flakes (SSF) used in this study is mostly a soy carbohydrate fraction in soybeans. Carbon black (CB) is also included as a comparison. SSF and CB are used as fillers to make reinforced rubber composites. Comparison between freeze-drying and the casting method indicates that a filler network related structure in the composites, prepared by the freeze-drying method, is more elastic than that of the casting method, and can be explained by the model of polymer mediated filler network. The shifting of G\u201d maximum in SSF and CB composites with an increased filler concentration indicates CB has a greater extent of filler-rubber interaction. The stress softening effect of SSF and CB composites again indicates the composites prepared by the freeze-drying method have better recovery behavior than that by the casting method due to their more elastic filler network structure. This study shows that the composites prepared by the freeze-drying method have a more elastic filler network structure, which can be explained by the increasing frequency of a thin polymer layer between filler aggregates."}

However, with today\u2019s computing technology, it can\u2019t be hacked.\nProof of work vs proof of stake: How is proof of stake algorithm different?\nYou can see the blockchain network is really safe with POW algorithm, however, such high security also comes at a high cost. I will explain this cost before I describe how the proof of stake algorithm is different.\nPOW algorithm requires every node to participate in the transaction validation, and this creates scalability issues in the network. The scalability reduces the more the network grows because now even more nodes will need to participate to validate a transaction.\nThe need to solve ever more complex mathematical puzzle reduces the transaction throughput. The Bitcoin users want their transactions to be included in the very next available block, and they pay fees to the miners for this. With the puzzle growing in complexity, the competition to include transactions in the next available block intensifies. The fees increase as a result.\nBlockchain was supposed to be completely decentralized. However, the ever-increasing complexity of the cryptographic puzzle makes it hard for the miners to continuously upgrade their hardware and foot the growing energy bill.\nMining pools have emerged to achieve economy of scale, and Bitcoin mining is becoming increasingly centralized with giant mining rigs operated by centralized companies at an industrial scale. This is indirectly centralizing the network.\nBefore 2018 ends, the Bitcoin mining operations in Iceland will consume more electricity than the entire domestic consumption in the country. A mathematical money without the backing of tangible asset expending this level of energy with the concomitant strain on the environment is attracting negative media coverage.\nWhat is proof of stake algorithm? In this consensus mechanism, there are a few nodes that stake their own cryptocurrencies for transaction validation. They are called \u2019stakers\u2019 and stakers are identified using a deterministic process.\nThe more the amount of stake and the longer the duration of the stake, the more likely the staker will be chosen for the transaction validation. All nodes needn\u2018t participate in the transaction validation, and there is no complex cryptographical puzzle to solve.\nAll coins have already been created and there is no mining. The transaction validation process is called \u2019forging\u2018 in PoS algorithm.\nThis improves scalability and transaction throughput."}

Its small size ensures you won't leave it behind, while the plentiful features provide flexible control. A Nikkor 3x optical zoom lens, 3.1-megapixel CCD, and the range of automatic and preset shooting modes are enough to handle most average shooting situations, plus a few difficult scenarios like nighttime light displays or bright beach exposures. The 2,016 x 1,512-pixel maximum resolution is high enough for making sharp 8x10-inch photographic prints, while lower resolution settings are perfect for conserving memory card space if you don't need large prints, or sending email attachments over the Internet. The uncomplicated user interface means you won't spend much time learning the camera. Plus, the included camera dock makes downloading images and recharging batteries a snap. With its point-and-shoot simplicity, the SQ is an excellent option for novices. However, its fashionable design may tempt more experienced pros looking for a fun snapshot camera. The high-end all-metal body with swivel lens and included \"Cool Dock\" make it relatively expensive for a 3 megapixel model, but if your budget will accommodate it, it's a very appealing little camera.\nBreaking away from most standard digicam designs, the Coolpix SQ's square body resembles an MP3 player more than a camera. Despite the square, compact size, Nikon managed to retain the popular swiveling lens design, making the camera more flexible for shooting at odd angles. The lens rotates approximate 225 degrees, facing down in the front and rotating all the way to face behind the camera (a unique self-portrait tool cleverly remaps the image in the LCD so it isn't blocked by the lens housing as it swings in front of half the screen)."}

That\u2019s why it is the goal of Gardening Know How to help avoid these issues, or at the very least amend them, by providing the best information possible so your garden will flourish \u2013 and that includes answering the gardening questions that plaque us all. In the garden, pepper growing is a common practice, and not without its own set of problems. Here are the top questions about peppers.\n1) How to treat insects on pepper plants?\nInsect control depends on the type of bug that\u2019s attacking your pepper plants. Sap-sucking insects such as aphids, scale, mites or mealybugs are easy to control with insecticidal soap or neem oil spray. (Never spray when temperatures are above 85 F.\/29 C.). Harmful pests like caterpillars, leafrollers, hornworms and potato beetles can be removed by hand, or you can apply a naturally occurring bacteria known as Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis). Pepper plants are more pest resistant when they aren\u2019t stressed; plant peppers in well-drained soil, then ensure they are watered and fertilized properly.\n2) How to fertilize pepper plants?\nPepper plants need to be fed because nutrients in the soil run out quickly. However, easy goes it, because too much fertilizer can result in big, beautiful, bushy plants with very little fruit. Here\u2019s an easy way to ensure your pepper plants have the nutrients they need: Mix a slow-release fertilizer into the soil at planting time (organic, slow-release fertilizer is great for peppers and other edibles), and then follow up with a light application of a water-soluble plant food or fish emulsion every couple of weeks. Be sure to water after applying fertilizer.\n3) What causes blossom drop on pepper plants?\nBlossom drop on pepper plants is usually the result of some type of stress. Some problems are easily rectified, but often, there isn\u2019t a lot you can do. For example, drastic temperature changes can cause blossom drop, but the plant often rebounds when the temperature stabilizes. Other possible reasons for blossom drop include poor pollination, over- or under-watering, too much (or too little) fertilizer, excessively low or high humidity, fungal diseases or insect pests.\n4) Why are my pepper plants dropping leaves?"}
{"question":"log burner or heat pump which more efficient","doc_text":"The Carcel lamp was an efficient lighting device used in the nineteenth century for domestic purposes and in France as the standard measure for illumination.\nThe lamp was invented by the French watchmaker Bernard Guillaume Carcel (1750\u20131818) to overcome the disadvantages of the Argand-type lamps then in use. The vegetable - mostly colza - oils then available were thick and would not travel far up a wick. The Argand lamps used a gravity feed which meant that the oil reservoir was located above the burner, casting a shadow and making the lamp top heavy. Carcel designed a lamp with the oil reservoir under the burner, in the body of the lamp. To keep the oil moving up to the burner, Carcel housed a clockwork mechanism in the lamp base that drove a small pump submerged in the oil tank. The winding key was located at the bottom of the lamp base.\nAnother innovative feature was that fuel was pumped into the wick tubes at a greater volume than was necessary for burning so that it overflowed the top of the wicks, thus cooling the burner.\nThe advantages Carcel claimed for his lamp in his 1800 patent in Paris were that the movement operated unattended, the oil could be used to the last drop, the lamp would stay lit for sixteen hours continuously without refilling, and it provided illumination for several persons at the same time with a single burner.\nThey were complex devices however, and were expensive and prone to problems in the mechanism. They were most popular in wealthier European cities. Their unpopularity was partially due to the necessity of having to return them to the (mostly European) manufacturers for repair. In 1829 the simpler Moderator lamp was invented, which dispensed with clockwork and used only a weighted piston to move the oil, and this eventually superseded them.\nThe French physical standard Carcel lamp consisted of a cylindrical Argand burner, and gave the standard brightness when 42 grams of colza oil were consumed per hour. The supply and draught were regulated by clockwork.\n((cite journal)): Cite journal requires"}

A few research articles:\nReasons why your titrated pressure may be wrong\nThe CPAP pressure setting determined in the sleep study may be too high once you settle into therapy.\n1. In the sleep lab, you may have experienced more REM sleep (dreaming) for the first time in years, a REM rebound effect requiring a higher pressure. On xPAP therapy after your sleep patterns return to a normal amount of dreaming, your pressure may be too high.\n2. Untreated sleep apnea may cause swelling in the mouth and throat, requiring a higher pressure setting in the lab. After xPAP treatment, the swelling may go down, requiring a lower setting.\n3. If you had nasal congestion the night of your study due to allergies, a cold, chemical sensitivity, cool air, or air flow from the CPAP machine, a higher pressure setting would be required in the lab than your usual requirements.\nSource: TS Johnson MD et al, Sleep Apnea \u2013 The Phantom of the Night, pages 168 \u2013 169\nREM (dream) sleep and sleeping on your back require higher pressure settings because of more apneic events. If you slept poorly and didn\u2019t experience REM or sleep on your back, the technician had to guess what settings you might need. The technician may estimate a pressure that is actually too high or too low.\nIt\u2019s true that your current titrated setting, if accurate, may not require an APAP. But what about next month or next year? If your weight goes up, you may require a higher setting; if it goes down, a lower one.

{"question":"I'm managing a team and want to know - what are the benefits of having employees who fit well with the company culture, and what are some effective ways to keep them from leaving?","doc_text":"Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, you most likely opted to implement remote work. Because of the increasing number of coronavirus cases all over the world, many businesses felt obligated to create an emergency Work from Home policy as a safety measure for their employees.\nReady or not, you are now managing a team whose members work 100% from home. If you are used to your employees sharing an office, you will now face some new challenges.\nFor example, how can you keep the efficiency level as high as it was during office hours, how to communicate properly, or what will your employees consider micro-managing?\n5 Steps to manage your new remote employees\n1. Spell out goals and roles\nIf every team has their tasks, during the period of remote work, make sure to be clear about what your goals are. You can\u2019t see what they are working on and suggest anything. That\u2019s why now you need to spell precisely what the goals are. Make sure to focus on achievable tasks. You can do this once every week, or once a particular task is finished. Define roles inside of your teams. Make sure they each know what they are supposed to do. If you didn\u2019t have any team-leaders, maybe this the time to appoint ones. A team-leader can organize calls in-between his team colleagues to talk essential and urgent things.\n2. Keep people updated\nAt the office, you will announce a big sale or a new important signed client loudly, but while your team works from home, you can\u2019t do that. When something like this happens, send a group message, you can even attach a screenshot as proof for it to be more engaging. Your employees still want to know what other teams are developing or how the company is doing in general. This can even be a motivation booster.\n3. Avoid micromanaging\nYou may feel the need to check in regularly to make sure everyone is online and working on their task while at home. This can lead to your employees feeling like you don\u2019t trust them. According to Brenna Loury, head of marketing at Doist, engaging you remote workers starts with a high-trust culture. Therefore, you can ask for a weekly report, but do not send messages twice a day asking about the same task.\n4. Communication and connection\nCommunication is vital in a company, but this becomes of greater importance once you decide to work remotely."}
{"question":"how do cats show dreaming behavior REM sleep","doc_text":"These signals travel to a brain region called the thalamus, which relays them to the cerebral cortex \u2014 the outer layer of the brain that is responsible for learning, thinking, and organizing information. The pons also sends signals that shut off neurons in the spinal cord, causing temporary paralysis of the limb muscles. If something interferes with this paralysis, people will begin to physically \"act out\" their dreams \u2014 a rare, dangerous problem called REM sleep behavior disorder. A person dreaming about a ball game, for example, may run headlong into furniture or blindly strike someone sleeping nearby while trying to catch a ball in the dream.\nREM sleep stimulates the brain regions used in learning. This may be important for normal brain development during infancy, which would explain why infants spend much more time in REM sleep than adults. Like deep sleep, REM sleep is associated with increased production of proteins. One study found that REM sleep affects learning of certain mental skills. People taught a skill and then deprived of non-REM sleep could recall what they had learned after sleeping, while people deprived of REM sleep could not.\nSome scientists believe dreams are the cortex\u2019s attempt to find meaning in the random signals that it receives during REM sleep. The cortex is the part of the brain that interprets and organizes information from the environment during consciousness. It may be that, given random signals from the pons during REM sleep, the cortex tries to interpret these signals as well, creating a \"story\" out of fragmented brain activity.\nReturn to top\nCircadian rhythms are regular changes in mental and physical characteristics that occur in the course of a day (circadian is Latin for \"around a day\"). Most circadian rhythms are controlled by the body\u2019s biological \"clock.\" This clock, called the suprachiasmatic nucleus or SCN, is actually a pair of pinhead-sized brain structures that together contain about 20,000 neurons. The SCN rests in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus, just above the point where the optic nerves cross. Light that reaches photoreceptors in the retina (a tissue at the back of the eye) creates signals that travel along the optic nerve to the SCN.\nSignals from the SCN travel to several brain regions, including the pineal gland, which responds to light-induced signals by switching off production of the hormone melatonin. The body\u2019s level of melatonin normally increases after darkness falls, making people feel drowsy."}
{"question":"I'm researching behavioral intervention programs and would like to understand both how cognitive activity shapes behavior and how intervention teams are structured in practice. Can you explain these aspects?","doc_text":"Nine studies reported what the effect of the intervention was on their primary outcome measure [37, 39, 45, 46, 52, 58]; in Project GEMS, we reported the effect of the intervention on our primary outcome measure. Finally, 1 study determined the appropriateness of the target group for receiving the intervention , and in Project GEMS, we established that the intervention was appropriate for our written and verbal feedback.\nOur discussion of the literature highlights that important areas of feasibility are not being adequately addressed in preliminary physical activity studies in persons with MS and this has major implications for the strength of the existing research regarding exercise and MS. We believe this might be addressed in future research through the provision of this scoping review of the literature. For example, process feasibility (e.g. recruitment) was discussed in less than half of the studies, and there is a need for more information on participant reactions to randomisation; it is not clear whether randomisation during clinical trials affects recruitment rates and how this might inform trial design (e.g. preference designs vs. RCTs). Metrics related to resources (e.g. time and resources) were explored in many studies, and this suggests that researchers are efficient at reporting these methodological areas. However, there is still a need for clarification of some aspects; for example, we do not know the costs involved in undertaking physical activity research programmes and these data are essential for both realistic application to funding bodies and the application of the intervention in everyday clinical practice. Data on management feasibility are not well reported in the included literature; without these data, replication of research studies and application of the intervention in clinical practice may be carried out in lieu of full knowledge regarding staffing and infrastructural requirements, and this may ultimately lead to failure of the intervention. Finally, there are many important aspects of scientific outcome feasibility, which require further explanation in preliminary studies, the reporting of intervention problems, and participant feedback will arm researchers with important knowledge to improve the science of physical activity interventions for persons with MS. There was a limitation of some studies to report hypothesis testing for baseline comparisons and the direct calculation of treatment effects, however these areas are not recommended in the new CONSORT extension guidelines .\nOur case study, Projects GEMS, enabled us to systematically record feasibility study in the domains of process (e.g. recruitment), resource (e.g. communication with participants), management (e.g."}

Traditional gas or electric water heaters have a .60 to .93 UEF rating, significantly lower than the 4.0 rating for heat pump water heaters.\nThe main reason why conventional water heaters have a lower rating than heat pump water heater is because of the energy it needs to power themselves. Traditional water heaters consume energy, not just to heat water but to keep it heated for storage.\nHeat pumps rely mainly on their heat pump technology, which doesn\u2019t require a lot of power to operate. By reducing energy consumption, heat pump water heaters can obtain a higher UEF rating. This also translates into more energy savings for the homeowner.\nEven though conventional water heaters have a lower UEF rating, they can still provide homeowners with energy cost savings. Whether it\u2019s a heat pump water heater or a traditional one, all water heaters have energy guide labels that show an estimated yearly cost with the maximum gallons of hot water the unit can produce in an hour.\nConventional and heat pump water heaters can provide yearly savings, but homeowners will have first to pay the upfront costs to have one of these water heaters installed. We\u2019ll take a deeper look at how these water heaters compare in terms of pricing.\nConventional water heaters, on average, are priced at $3,200 to $5,900 with installation. Whereas heat pump water heaters are higher in price, costing between $9,500 to $13,000. When shopping for any water heater in general, the following factors play a huge role in determining the final price.\n- Additional parts\n- Plumbing modifications\n- Water filtration (optional)\nHeat pump water heaters are new to the water heating industry, so there are fewer options for heat pump water heater models. This allows manufacturers to set their pricing for water heaters."}

{"question":"how does romantic imagination compare objective realism proust work perspective","doc_text":"Use SMART Objectives to Focus Goals, Plans and Performance\nBy Susan Berry & Randy Thomas, Ph.D. | minute read\nWhat's so smart about SMART? Why has this acronym become part of the vocabulary of project planning and performance management?\nObjectives that are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Aligned, Realistic\/Relevant, and Time-bound) are likely to be achieved. When generic, off-the shelf objectives get the SMART treatment, they emerge as targets that engage focus, action, feedback and learning. These targets assist development of individual work plans, and also provide a guidance system for supervisor-staff performance review discussions.\nHow Do You Write a SMART Objective Statement?\nFirst, you must decide exactly what you expect to create, and how you will recognise it when it comes to be. Now put it in words: \"Our Internet Marketing system produces a minimum of $3500 per month in product sales by 31 July 2015, with a quarterly increase of at least 5% thereafter.\" The Specific, Measurable, and Time-bound aspects are built into one short declaration.\nWill it happen? Much depends on whether your objective is aligned with things that really matter to you (and your organisation), and whether you can commit the resources to bring it about. In individuals and in organisations, resource distribution often reflects past priorities and requirements. As you develop your SMART objective, step back and compare proposed results with existing commitments in the larger organisation or systems you serve. This broader perspective can help you decide if:\n- Your proposed result is consistent with and directly relevant to larger strategic goals and desired outcomes, and\n- Your proposed result has such great pay-off potential that it is worth the resource investment it requires.\nTaking on a new initiative usually means that something else must go. If you discover that current investments are not producing the gains you had hoped for, you know where you can harvest resources for endeavours you believe will be more fruitful.\nNow that your objective embodies the \"Alignment\" and \"Realistic\/Relevant\" aspects of SMART, you are ready to use it as a target for work plans.\nUsing SMART Objectives for Feedback and Learning\nIn complex systems, feedback is the process of comparing a target state with current conditions to signal and control the need for adjustment. A thermostat, for example, provides feedback that enables the heating system to maintain its target temperature.\nIn teams and organisations, feedback involves regular check-ins to compare anticipated results with current progress."}

While the market is filled with numerous projects to explore, the triumvirate of Arbitrum (ARB), DigiToads (TOADS) and Chainlink (LINK) is currently making waves. These projects not only exemplify the expansive potential of blockchain technology but also offer high-yield opportunities for investors to ride the crypto wave to potentially astonishing returns.\nThe digital amphibian taking the blockchain world by storm is none other than DigiToads (TOADS). This whimsical project, centred around the resilient toad, aims to leap past the prevailing frog-themed cryptocurrencies, cementing toads as the new amphibian overlord of the crypto-swamp.\nDigiToads positions itself as an asset that incentivizes community involvement, while also making a noble pledge to contribute to the preservation of the Amazon rainforest. A community-driven effort at heart, DigiToads aims to bring crypto enthusiasts together, creating a robust ecosystem that offers substantial rewards for participation.\nDigiToads recently successfully conducted a presale that garnered a staggering $4.9 million, with over 309 million tokens sold. This impressive achievement, representing over 90% of the total tokens, manifests the undeniable interest the crypto-community has shown in this promising project. The current token price stands at $0.042, but with the unique approach and remarkable success of DigiToads, the prospects for significant growth appear promising.\nThe secret sauce behind DigiToads\u2019 potential success is its well-structured tokenomics, referred to as \u201cTOAD Economics.\u201d Out of a total of 585M $TOADS, a substantial portion, 69.29%, has been allocated to the presale and community bonus, which means community members stand to gain the most from this venture. Further, the project has smartly imposed a transaction tax system, \u201centering and exiting the swamp,\u201d that incentivizes holding TOADS tokens, along with their NFT counterparts.\nDigiToads has brought a fresh spin to the world of NFTs by facilitating staking. Every transaction contributes 2% of TOAD tokens to the staking rewards, providing an additional yield for dedicated TOAD holders. The implementation of a deflationary factor, in the form of a built-in token burn, ensures a constant decrease in the circulating supply, thereby creating scarcity that can potentially drive the token\u2019s price up over time."}
{"question":"how property improvements affect tax assessment and utility easement rights","doc_text":"The UK\u2019s self assessment tax regime requires taxpayers to calculate and pay their own tax liability within set deadlines. It can apply to company directors, business partners and the self-employed, but also to anyone in employment who receives untaxed income from other sources - property or the sale of assets, for example.\nGiven the complexity of calculations, and background of fines and penalties for non-compliance, the support of a qualified professional is invaluable. Handpicked Accountants can quickly recommend fully-qualified accountants with proven track records of reliability and technical know-how.\nWe have longstanding professional relationships with accountants around the country, so what can our handpicked accountants help you with? Here are some of the self assessment areas they will cover:\nA qualified accountant understands the reasons behind the imposition of penalties and fines, and how you should respond. When you need to appeal a tax decision or late filing\/payment penalty, having professional support increases your chances of a favourable outcome, and provides insight into how HMRC works.\nMissing an important tax deadline can lead to penalties and fines, so it is crucial to stay ahead of your self assessment obligations. With the demands of a busy life, however, these administrative responsibilities can feel particularly burdensome.\nFinding a good accountant to help with your self assessment tax return can be difficult without a reliable recommendation. Accountancy costs and services vary greatly, and it is easy to assume the person you hire is competent. When mistakes are made, however, it is you who is held responsible by HMRC, not your accountant, so you need to find someone you can trust.\nFines and late payment penalties are very common, and can trigger unwanted attention from HMRC.

In addition to the known numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities, with novel genomic sequencing technologies, approximately 80% of MDS patients have been shown to harbor somatic or acquired gene mutations. The mutations have been found to be related to RNA slicing, transcription regulation, DNA methylation, histone modification, DNA repair\/tumor suppressor, signal transduction, and the cohesion complex.

{"question":"I'm researching genetic therapies - what are the main differences between somatic and germline gene therapy, and what are the key ethical concerns associated with each type?","doc_text":"The Age of Personalised Medicine - The Genomics Revolution\nPublished: 16 November 2016\nPublished: 16 November 2016\nScientists had drawn up a complete road map of the human genome. The Human Genome Project, which took 14 years to complete, delivered a genetic blueprint for the 20 000 genes contained within the DNA code, giving scientists unprecedented insight into its complexity.\nOver the last decade, several international projects have been launched to sequence and compare thousands of human genomes, spanning multiple ethnic and geographical populations. This technology fast-tracked the detection of genes, or more often, sets of genes, that are associated with disease traits.\nCommon genetic variants (known as polymorphisms) that could have a range of impacts on gene function- from none to major - were identified in individuals and whole populations at variable frequencies. This finding in particular represented a game-changer for medicine, in that a person\u2019s DNA might be used to identify biomarkers that could predict disease course, and subsequently guide treatment according to that patient\u2019s genetic make-up.\nIn recent times, the concept of harnessing this genetic roadmap to personalise medicine to an individual is becoming realised, and there is a major effort underway in medical research to translate this to the clinic (NHMRC 2011).\nFor instance, cancer is a complex disease that is largely determined by genetic mutations, which can be inherited ('germline mutation') or arise sporadically ('somatic mutation'). Different genetic mutations may be responsible for the same anatomical cancer, but genetic testing (based on DNA sequencing) can group these tumours into sub-types based on the exclusivity of gene variants to that tumour. For example, breast cancer is not a single entity, but exists in multiple forms depending on the gene\/s and corresponding cell types that are disrupted. As such, prognostic genomic testing is available to characterise breast tumours into sub-types according to their genomic signature (Dai et al. 2015).\nBased on genetic testing, pharmacogenetics specifically targets a medicine to a disease sub-type. The utility of personalised medicine to treat common cancers has been particularly promising in lung, melanoma, breast, thyroid and colorectal cancers, which are each driven by differing and multiple gene variants.\nPharmacogenetics is further used as a tool to predict patient sensitivity to a medicine. Common genetic variants present in drug-metabolising enzymes can significantly impact the level of enzyme function."}

Having high-powered characters means you can demand more of them; they buy you a seat at the high-stakes plot table. But there are other reasons for enjoying larger-than-life characters and speculative fiction. By looking at the extremes of the human condition (or even examining non-humans), we can learn something about the ordinary parts too. And while ordinary characters in extraordinary situations can do astonishing things, extraordinary people can inspire us to transcend the commonplace and reach for something we never thought possible.

{"question":"how modify trust agreement when laws family circumstances change","doc_text":"Modifying Parenting Plans in Florida\nMay 25, 2015\nA parenting plan is an essential tool for co-parenting. The creation of a parenting plan is required in all cases where parents have time-sharing with minor children. The plan outlines each parent\u2019s responsibilities to the child and specifies a time-sharing schedule. Courts approve parenting plans based on the child\u2019s best interests, but sometimes it may be appropriate to change the terms of a parenting plan.\nA parenting plan is a court order, so modification requires the court\u2019s approval. To modify a parenting plan or time-sharing schedule in Florida, there must be a \u201csubstantial, material, and unanticipated change of circumstances\u201d since the custody determination was made. The parent seeking the change must show that:\n- The circumstances have substantially changed.\n- It is in the child\u2019s best interest to have the parenting plan modified.\nDetermining what constitutes a change in circumstances differs in each case, and the statute does not list circumstances that qualify as a substantial change. Instead, courts look at the individual facts of each case to decide whether a modification is warranted. Additionally, the child\u2019s input may also be taken into consideration if appropriate. Past case law can give examples of circumstances that have justified a change, which have included:\n- Evidence of one parent causing parental alienation.\n- One parent\u2019s failure to comply with the parenting plan.\n- One parent unilaterally changing the child\u2019s school.\n- A parent interfering with the other parent\u2019s visitation.\n- Not allowing the child to call the other parent.\n- Refusing to return the child after time sharing period.\n- Willfully raising false allegations of abuse against the other parent, causing trauma to the child.\n- Making obscene and derogatory comments about the other parent.\n- Serious concerns regarding the moral fitness of one parent.\n- Misleading the court in an effort to gain custody of the child.\n- Causing trouble in front of the children when the children have time-sharing with the other parent.\n- Making co-parenting as difficult as possible.\nAn acrimonious relationship and lack of communication between the parents, without further changed circumstances, is insufficient to warrant a modification of a parenting plan.\nIf possible, parents should come to an agreement about changes to a parenting plan. They then need to have their modification approved by a judge before it becomes legally effective."}

These gases are then sent to the detector for measurement.\nWhether the analysis of TOC is by TC-IC or NPOC methods, it may be broken into three main stages:\n- Detection and Quantification\nThe first stage is acidification of the sample for the removal of the IC and POC gases. The release of these gases to the detector for measurement or to the air is dependent upon which type of analysis is of interest, the former for TC-IC and the latter for TOC (NPOC).\nThe removal and venting of IC and POC gases from the liquid sample by acidification and sparging occurs in the following manner.\nThe second stage is the oxidation of the carbon in the remaining sample in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gases. Modern TOC analyzers perform this oxidation step by one several processes:\n- High Temperature Combustion\n- High temperature catalytic (HTCO) oxidation\n- Photo-oxidation alone\n- Thermo-chemical oxidation\n- Photo-chemical oxidation\n- Electrolytic Oxidation\n High Temperature Combustion\nPrepared samples are combusted at 1,350o C in an oxygen rich atmosphere. All carbon present converts to carbon dioxide, flows through scrubber tubes to remove interferences such as chlorine gas, and water vapor, and the carbon dioxide is measured either by absorption into a strong base then weighed, or using an Infrared Detector. Most modern analyzers use non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) for detection of the carbon dioxide.\n High Temperature Catalytic Oxidation\nA manual or automated process injects the sample onto a platinum catalyst at 680o C in an oxygen rich atmosphere. The concentration of carbon dioxide generated is measured with a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) detector.\nOxidation of the sample is complete after injection into the furnace, turning oxidizable material in the sample into gaseous form. A carbon-free carrier gas transports the CO2, through a moisture trap and halide scrubbers to remove water vapor and halides from the gas stream before it reaches the detector."}

{"question":"I'm managing a team and want to know - what are the benefits of having employees who fit well with the company culture, and what are some effective ways to keep them from leaving?","doc_text":"Four steps to a sound electrical safety culture\nTraining makes a difference, and so does communication.\nIt\u2019s a new engineer\u2019s first day on the job and a piece of the electrical system is not performing the way it should be. The manager asks the engineer to troubleshoot the issue, unaware the engineer has had no safety training. Afraid to appear they don\u2019t know what they are doing, the engineer approaches the equipment without any protective gear to see what\u2019s happening. We all know this could result in a serious injury, maybe even death \u2014 and this is more common in electrical facilities than one may think.\nDespite the common understanding of prioritizing safety, electrical safety is still a workplace issue. Hazardous energy and lockout\/tagout (LOTO) is fifth among safety violations cited by OSHA in 2018. However, restrictions on time and resources may lead employees to be less diligent as they should be in mitigating safety risks throughout their work day. And when safety is put second, electrical facilities can take big hits with respect to their employees and to profitability.\nTo keep electrical facilities running smoothly and efficiently, it is critical that facility managers and staff create a strong culture of safety for employees at every level. Proper training, top to bottom messaging, compliance checks and more can guarantee that employees are aware of how to work safely.\nFacility staff needs to establish a solid culture that will keep everyone safe. Here are four ways to accomplish this:\n1. Establishing safety at EVERY level. Although engineers and electricians are the people who work most closely with electrical systems, everyone from top to bottom should be well versed in the proper safety protocols. Managers should encourage their staff to take their time when completing tasks to ensure they are adhering to the proper safety procedures.\nEnforcing this and practicing it themselves will prove they are as committed to best safety practices as they want their employees to be. The single most important thing an employer can do is to empower employees to do the right thing, even if it means stopping work in an unsafe situation. Having the power to make these decisions can have positive impacts on their own and their coworkers\u2019 safety.\n2. Embedding proper communication in daily workflows. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, inexperienced employees may not fully understand safety protocols and may feel embarrassed to ask, making communication critical to ensuring effective safety measures."}
{"question":"I've been studying the relationship between maternal mental health and pediatric outcomes - what's known about how maternal depression affects infant development, and what screening protocols are currently recommended to identify at-risk mothers?","doc_text":"(13) Although there are kinks and coils to iron out, this is a win for Black women that is derived from a rich history of reproductive agency and the traditions of Black granny midwives. Other programs like the Philadelphia Alliance for Labor Support at the University of Pennsylvania and the Maternity Care Coalition should be applauded and funded for their efforts to train community doulas and extend services to clients free of charge, empowering mothers of all backgrounds to exert their reproductive rights.\nAt its core, city planning curriculum in universities around the country can do a better job of linking policy and plans to real people, real places, and real problems. There is no better place to explore innovative, blue-sky, and radical approaches to some of our countries biggest problems than inside the walls and with the resources of an academic institution. JeffDESIGN is a collaborative academic program between Philadelphia University and Thomas Jefferson University. This program teaches design and creative problem solving methods and it aims to equip the next generation of doctors with the skills and confidence to transform healthcare systems, services, spaces, and devices.(14) The way our current healthcare system is designed has greatly affected the health disparities we see today. Have you seen the inside of a labor room at your local hospital lately? How did it make you feel? Were you satisfied with your experience? The physical aspects of labor and delivery rooms and encounters with medical staff are a crucial component in addressing infant and maternal mortality. Studies analyzing women\u2019s childbirth experiences and obstetric outcomes found that satisfaction with childbirth is considered the most important qualitative outcome in assessing childbirth experience, given that women\u2019s satisfaction with this experience affects their health and their relationship with their infant.(15) Despite this research, the United States is a country with the shortest hospital stays and hardly any postpartum follow-up for mother, a very sensitive window for maternal mortality. While we appreciate the role our hospitals provide for moms-to-be, we also know that there is room to improve especially in areas of design, client comfortability, and even some medical practices.\nCity Planning directly effects the built environment around us. Pressing for incentives and policies to allow different kinds of real estate and infrastructure development is an elemental component of the profession. Creating housing programs specifically catering to the needs of at-risk pregnant women and mothers could really impact the way maternal and infant mortality is experienced in America."}
{"question":"how modify trust agreement when laws family circumstances change","doc_text":"Attorney At Law\nFree Phone Consultation\nCircumstances change over time and it often becomes necessary or appropriate to seek to modify the amount of child support or alimony that you are paying or receiving, or to adjust parenting timeshares as children get older or begin new schools. Particularly in these economic times, people's financial lives are changing rapidly. With regard to support awards, if you are a payor of child or spousal support your orders remain in effect no matter whether you have less income or no income today as compared to when the orders issued unless and until you file a motion or Request for Order application to modify them.\nWe understand how important these changes can be to your family budget, or how drastically they can affect children's lives. Whether you are seeking to modify previous orders or resisting a modification, we can assist you in the most professional and compassionate manner.\nIn order to succeed in modifying certain types of orders the law requires that a \"material change of circumstance\" has occurred since the time the last order was issued. Courts are reluctant to modify recent orders, and parties who claim that circumstances have changed when they are really just dissatisfied with the court's orders rarely achieve what they hope. And, the passage of time is generally not itself enough to qualify you for a change. Other orders that are temporary don't carry with them this burden of proof of changed circumstance. As a non-family law expert you are not likely to know the difference, but the courts always treat you as though you did. To achieve a modification you need expert assistance in setting up the grounds for what you want to change and the evidence that justifies that change.\nWe would be pleased to consult with you about the specific facts of your situation and help evaluate whether this is the best time to seek a change in the existing orders.

You need to tune her a lot, but that is just another skill you get to practice. I would definitely recommend this product, it is a steal. PS - I would get a tuner app for your smart phone as well because the tuner that comes with it can be weird at times, I tend to use both at the same time to get an idea of how it is going.\nI know nothing about violins, but my son is picking it up, practicing nonstop, and the instrument has served him well. I definitely recommend this for a beginner, sounds good, well made.\nI like the violin very much. It's cheap, but it works well for me when I'm a beginner. The sound is nice, too.\nI liked it. Very quality\nI ordered this violin for my boy, he just starts learning violin for a month. He loves it! It comes with a case which easy to carry. Very reasonable price, if you are looking for violin for beginner that is the one you should get.\nI play guitar and have always wanted to try my hand at cello but decided to check out the violin first, after doing a little research I made of list of everything I'll need and this package checked it all off and then some. Before we even get to the violin I have to brag on the case, if I found a guitar version of this case I would gladly pay twice what this entire package cost just for that because it is a nice case, everything from the smooth interior to the magnets to the compartments is a great touch. I had to do a little sleuthing to figure out how to set this guy up and it was pretty easy, the bridge stays on via tension and I recommend using the smaller tuning legs bear the bridge rather than the ones at the other end, the other thing I'll mention is that a bow will not make noise across violin strings without rosin so make sure you add it, simply drag something across the surface of the rosin block to scrape up some dust and then take your bow across the block repeatedly."}

{"question":"I'm trying to start my first garden and want to be eco-friendly. What are the most important things to know about making a natural garden, and what problems should I watch out for to keep my plants healthy?","doc_text":"I\u2019m not sure exactly when I first fell in love with fairy gardens, but I\u2019ve always loved miniatures.\nI have been collecting little things that catch my eye for years. I love the fact that I can blend two of my favorite hobbies and come up with something so fun even the grandchildren can\u2019t resist playing along.\nOne of the first things for starting a fairy garden is the foundation\u2013the container. You can use just about anything. Small containers are great to get started because they don\u2019t really need much decoration. If you have a lot of fairy garden accessories already it may be wise to choose a larger container. I have seen everything from an old cooking pot to a bathtub! Use your imagination and look around at what you already have. Do you have an old colander that isn\u2019t being useful in the kitchen? Do you have some elegant flower pots that would add some charm to your garden? Even a simple clay flower pot is a good beginning. Be sure that the character of the pot will match the look and theme of your accessories and plants.\nNext you will need some plants that will fit into a miniature scheme. Look for plants with smaller leaves. Small evergreens are often found in garden centers, produce sections of grocery stores, and in flower shops. Herbs make great fairy garden \u201ctrees\u201d. Rosemary and Thyme have woody stalks that can be trimmed to look like trees, plus you get to enjoy the herbs in your cooking and the wonderful scents of the plants. Small scale succulents also make nice plants. Keep your eyes open. You will be surprised at how you look at plants differently when you gear your thinking to a miniature scale. I have a tiny bougainvillaea that is only about eight inches tall. It is in a medium sized flower pot and is trimmed to look like a \u201ctree\u201d.\nAnother important addition to your garden are foundational things like rocks, stepping stones, or marbles. Glass marbles make adorable little \u201cwater\u201d features and rivers. Tiny stone walkways help to make your garden into an artistic composition by drawing the viewers eye into the scene. I have used aquarium gravel for this purpose and the scale of the stones look great.\nI shoot for more natural colors, but that is just my preference. Bright colors may be more fun and magical if you are creating gardens with children.\nNow you can add the details."}
{"question":"how many minutes minimum per day breathing exercises combined with relaxation observation","doc_text":"According to estimates, 14% to 18% of children are affected, but only 5% to 6% of adults and 3% of seniors.\nPsychological stress encourages teeth grinding\nIn order to get closer to the cause of teeth grinding, some self-observation is advisable. Do I tense my jaw repeatedly during the day? Is my tongue really relaxed or is it pressing against something? Am I breathing calmly and deeply enough? Physical tension often indicates a deeper, mental and psychological stress. Negative emotional stress is regarded as the undisputed leader among the causes of night-time teeth grinding. Sleep bruxism is not uncommon, especially in people with anxiety disorders, but it can also occur temporarily in periods of intense emotional stress. A therapeutic approach is advisable if you develop e.g. chronic pain, or if dentition is permanently damaged.\nHow do I get rid of teeth grinding?\nHow can you actively do something about the grinding of your teeth? First of all, a dental examination is necessary. Sometimes one needs a precise analysis of the masticatory apparatus to clarify problems with the temporomandibular joint. Usually, however, an occlusal splint is prescribed. The grinding is only treated symptomatically, but at least the teeth and joints are being protected.\nSince psychological stress is often the basis, stress management is particularly important. Behavioural therapy or psychological support can help especially with an increased perception of stress \u2013 relaxation techniques such as autogenic training or progressive muscle relaxation are considered promising measures. Medications for muscle relaxation will sometimes be prescribed, but usually only for a short time to avoid possible side effects. Sometimes, an injection of the neurotoxin Botox will be applied to loosen the jaw muscle, but is not recommended due to possible bone resorption. Physiotherapy is more advisable, such as massage or special stretching exercises for the jaw. Also, in the wider context, attention should be paid to the muscles and physiotherapeutic treatment be considered, since the cervical spine and the position of the head affects the position of the jaw: if the head is pushed too far forward, as is often the case with computer work or excessive use of the smart phone, then this may lead to tension in the muscles of the jaw. Summarizing, it can be said that almost everything that brings mental and physical relaxation can help prevent teeth grinding.\nImage source: Fotolia"}
{"question":"I've heard that dogs evolved from wolves, but I'm curious about how such aggressive animals became so friendly towards humans. Do scientists know how this transformation happened?","doc_text":"Wolves are pack animals and want to snuggle when they sleep, especially the pups. In the wild, the pups would sleep in a pile on top of each other, so it's only natural that the babies would pile onto humans when brought into captivity. People keep these animals like dogs, but they are in no way dogs. They are wild animals and will eventually act as such.\nAs with the tigers, the wolves become hunters around the time of puberty. This time frame happens much faster than humans; it only takes wolves a year to become mature. Like the tigers, the wolves need a wide hunting range to keep themselves psychologically satisfied. When humans keep these animals in pens or, worse, in a house, it's only a matter of time before they will suffer a psychotic break and attack someone. When tigers and wolves are kept indoors, it's not a question of if they will attack, it's a question of when.\nMonkeys make the list because there are simply too many stories of primate attacks. People adopt these animals due to their likeness to humans and their ability to interact with us, often on a higher level than domesticated animals. However, chimps, macaques and other primates of this genre are just a bad idea to keep as a pet.\nThese animals can be very loving and a part of the family for decades before attacking someone. This is why the attack is often a heartbreaking surprise. The animals don't always attack their loved ones; they might attack someone else, but they will eventually attack. The reasons for their aggression varies by the animal's class or breed, but many scientists believe the aggression comes from illnesses commonly caught by monkeys. The monkeys can't tell the humans they are hurting so they get aggravated and driven to lash out. Unfortunately, they don't realize their own strength and must often be killed to be stopped.\nWARNING: VIDEO MAY BE GRAPHIC WATCH AT YOUR OWN RISK\nYes, bears. People keep bears as pets because they're exotic and exciting. They are sweet as babies and their fur actually stays soft as they get older. They are attractive because they are outside of the box, furry and soft to the touch.\nThey are also far more dangerous than many other animals on this list. Bears, like the wolves and tigers, need a wide berth for their hunting grounds."}
{"question":"I'm starting a new business and I'm confused about LLC vs C corp taxes. How do they differ in terms of taxation, and what are the legal protections they offer to owners?","doc_text":"To register a limited liability company in Ghana, the basic requirements include; Get a name for the company. The name must be unique, it should not be misleading or undesirable. Next, the applicant has to obtain a tax identification number (TIN). Also, the applicant should indicate the address of the building where he intends to carry out the business. The company should be registered with the Ghana Investment Promotion Center (GIPC). After successful registration, the company will receive relevant documents that will confirm the formation of a new LLC as well as the rules and regulations that will guide the company.\nDissolution of an LLC\nThere are lots of factors that may lead to the dissolution of an LLC such as;\n- Differences of opinion among its members\n- Poor management\n- Lack of working capital\nThe plan to dissolve an LLC first has to be a result of the mutual consent of all the members. They have to obtain a certificate of dissolution from the legal authorities. They need to cancel all licenses\/permits which they obtained in the formation of the company.\nAlso, they need to inform all tax authorities about the dissolution through proper documentation. If there are pending salaries of employees, they have to clear them in order to avoid future claims.\nThe contents of the dissolution notice have to include a formal email address. This is to enable the creditors to send their claims. The company must include the deadline for creditors to file their claims. They need to explain that if the deadline elapses, they will not allow any claim. If the creditors raise a valid claim, then members will have to settle by making full repayments.\nThe company should distribute assets according to the share of capital each member contributed. The final step is to file the articles of dissolution with the state authorities in charge. This shows the formal date of the dissolution and the reasons behind dissolving the company.\nLLC Vs LTD\nWhen we talk about the LLC vs LTD, there are minor differences though they are largely the same. The state laws govern both of them.\nThe primary difference between the two is that LTDs pay tax LLCs do not.\nThe acronym \u201cLTD\u201d means limited and we commonly see it mostly within the European Union and affords owners the same protections as an LLC. Generally, they use it to describe an entity, and you will always find that corporations S and C usually end with LTD.\nLLCs provide certain benefits such that it allows members partnership and corporate benefits."}

When making a big purchase like a life insurance policy, it\u2019s smart to take your time and do a little research.

This code of law was devised with the protection of the consumer in mind, so it would be in your best interest to familiarize yourself with the contents of this piece of legislation. We know that most of our visitors do not want to study legal documents for hours, so we\u2019ve gone ahead and highlighted the key points of the law code below:\nFree Look Period In Nevada\nNevada life insurers give new policyholders a 10 day \u201cfree look\u201d period. This 10 day time frame essentially allows for an insurance policy \u201ctrial run\u201d in which the policyholder can back-out for a full refund if they are not satisfied. Life insurance policies can be lengthy pieces of text. During these 10 days, the consumer is allowed to further review the document to see if there is anything they do not like about it.\nProtection Of Personal Information In Nevada\nThere are laws in Nevada that require life insurance companies to take measures in protecting your privacy. In Nevada, your insurer is required to release all personal information they have about you at any time, per your request. They are also not allowed to share your personal information (such as medical records) with other agencies.\nNo Timely Payment Of Claims Laws\nMost states have laws that require insurance companies to make timely payment of claims once proof of death is received. Nevada, however, does not. The state allows for each insurer to set forth its own policy in regards to claim payments. Check with your insurance provider to learn more about their company policy.\nFor more information on your life insurance rights as a consumer in the state of Nevada, please contact:\nNevada Division of Insurance\nNevada State Guaranty\nIn the unfortunate event that your life insurance company goes out of business, your benefits will still be covered by the Nevada Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association."}

{"question":"I've been feeling down lately and heard that gut health might be connected to mood. What chemicals do healthy gut bacteria produce, and how do these chemicals affect both our digestive system and mental well-being?","doc_text":"However, vegetarians and vegans do not need to panic since our body can convert ALA to EPA and DHA with a variable conversion rate (8-20% and 0.5-9%, respectively).11\nFor example, 1 tbsp of flaxseeds contain 2350 mg ALA. If we take 2 tbsp and assume a conversion rate of 8%, we will get already 376 mg of EPA and DHA. Other sources are walnuts (2574 mg ALA per tbsp) and chia (1900 mg per tbsp).12\nConsider taking vitamin B12 and D as a supplement\nVitamin B12 is only found in animal products. The reason is that vitamin B12 is only produced by bacteria and Archaea. This bacteria can also be found in the human colon. However, all the B12 produced is excreted through faeces rather than absorbed because the receptors are found in the small intestine. Interestingly, our gut microbes also need B12 and there is some kind of competition for it in the small intestine.13\nVitamin D also influences the composition of the microbiome.14, 15 It is produced when we are exposed to sunlight. So, if you are unlucky enough to not see the sun for days, your body and mental health will benefit from vitamin D3 supplementation.\nIf you suffer from intestinal distress, try taking digestive enzymes\nHave you noticed bloating, gas, constipation or pain after consuming certain types of foods? It might be that your stomach acid is low or that you don\u2019t produce enough digestive enzymes to break down food. When food is not digested properly, particles arrive at the colon where bacteria ferment them. Here we are not only talking about resistant starch and fiber, but also about undigested proteins and fats, whose byproducts can lead to bloating, smelly gas and constipation. In this case, taking digestive enzymes or betaine HCl can help easer these complaints.\nEat slowly and in a peaceful manner\nEvolutionarily, when humans were stressed due to food scarcity or having to run from an animal, the body prepared for it in various ways. During these times, digesting food was not a priority and, as a consequence, less digestive juices were produced. Nowadays, this survival function is standing in your way to achieving a healthy gut microbiome."}

High-energy gamma rays may interact with photons of the EBL and generate positron-electron pairs. This introduces an attenuation feature in the spectra of distant gamma-ray sources that has been used in the past to set upper limits on the opacity of the Universe and the energy density of the EBL. In this talk, we will report the first detection of an absorption feature seen in the combined spectra of a sample of gamma-ray blazars detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) out to a redshift of z>1.6. This feature is caused by attenuation of gamma rays by the EBL at optical to UV frequencies, and points to a minimal level of EBL, consistent with the observed star formation rate and with low-opacity EBL models. We will present the Fermi observations and discuss the implications for the generation of a diffuse UV background at high redshifts.

A seven-week, double-blind continuation of ADHD treatment was administered to participants, or they were administered gradual withdrawal over three to four weeks with use of a placebo.\nAt the study\u2019s culmination, researchers used common ADHD rating scales to compare symptoms before and after the seven-week period. They found that patients who discontinued treatment saw worsening symptoms while those who continued taking methylphenidate experienced uninterrupted symptom control, even after two years or more of treatment with methylphenidate. The ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) was the primary outcome measure, the Clinical Global Impressions improvement scale (CGI-I) and the Conners\u2019 Teacher Rating Scale\u2013Revised: Short Form (CTRS-R:S) were the secondary outcome measures.\nContinuation and discontinuation groups had average (SD) ADHD-RS scores at baseline of 21.4 (SD=9.7) and 19.6 (SD=8.9), respectively.

Everything on this subject was written for a target audience of mathematicians and would motivate their use cases using mathematical examples.\nI wanted to explain the motivation behind free monads in terms that a programmer would understand and my post explains the topic in terms of creating a syntax tree and interpreting that syntax tree. Understanding free monads will greatly improve your understanding for how to build monadic domain-specific languages within Haskell. Also, many people comment that understanding free monads greatly improves their mental model for Haskell\nIO as well.\nHaskell coroutine libraries (like\nmachines) have what appear to be impenetrable implementations ... until you read Mario Blazevic's article on coroutines in issue 19 of The Monad Reader (Titled: Coroutine Pipelines\").\nIn that article he introduces the\nCoroutine type (which is now more commonly known as the free monad transformer) which unifies every coroutine implementation into a single pattern. Once you understand his article, you will understand the internals of coroutine libraries and you will be able to easily write a streaming library of your own.\nLens tutorials are the new monad tutorials, and the one mistake that all lens tutorials make is that none of them clearly explain how lenses work. The only post that ever got this right was the original post by Twan van Laarhoven that first introduced the modern formulation of lenses (Titled: \"CPS Functional references\"). The problem is that post is incredibly hard to find even through a dedicated Google search for lens tutorials because the title is obscure and the post only has a single mention of the word \"lens\". I actually had trouble finding this post even by browsing his blog archive because I didn't recognize the title.\nHonorable mention: The\nlens-family-core library is the only lens library that actually hews closely to Twan's original presentation, so I highly recommend that you study its source code to further improve your understanding.\nI still can't find a good blog post on Church encoding, so I will not link to anything. However, once you learn how to Church encode a data type you will suddenly see this pattern everywhere.\nEqually important, many high-performance Haskell libraries (like\nattoparsec) use Church encoding for efficiency reasons and understanding Church encoding will allow you to understand their internal implementations."}

In such a first encounter (with a new book, a new person, a new language), you can ignore the occasional troubling aside and focus on the big picture. But as you get used to things, you can't avoid the episodes that are harder to talk about.\nAs a beginning medical student, I was mostly confused. As a fourth-year student who's just completed his sub-internship (a sort of pre-residency), I've become less confused and more intimately involved in the contradictions of the hospital. Once I become a resident, I might become too overwhelmed by life and death to write at all. Now, at the end of this column's first year, I thought I should take stock of my reactions to what I've seen. \"Love\" and \"hate\" are the first words that come to mind for many things I've encountered this past year. Sometimes I hate and love the same thing in succession.\nI hate going into rooms of people who are very sick. They lie in their beds, staring at the wall. What's the right thing to say to them? Most of the time, as little as possible: I already know this from visiting the sick as a layperson. But as a doctor-in-the-making, I'm no longer someone who visits the sick. I now intrude on them for their own good, asking them questions they would rather not answer and viewing their bodies in ways that they never would countenance when healthy. While I try to build rapport, strengthening the doctor-patient relationship through our basic human connection, more often than not our conversation doesn't exceed the bare minimum. I need to get my work done; they need to get their rest. So I leave the room feeling guilty, while they lie there feeling no healthier than before.\nAt the same time, there are patients I come to love even though I know them only slightly. An older, frum woman was admitted with pneumonia. The admitting team described her as demented. According to the technical meaning of the term, this was correct: She suffers from a constant, progressive decline in cognitive function.

However, the measurement of profit can vary and should be considered with other factors.\nFor example, profit varies greatly from company to company and from industry to industry. Because companies vary in size, it is often more appropriate to consider profit as a percentage of sales (profit margin) when comparing one company to another. As well, varying accounting methods can greatly influence profit, and these changes may have little to do with a company's actual operations.\nChanges in profit are the subject of much analysis.

{"question":"inherited grandma antique ring make it bigger possible problems","doc_text":"A friend of mine was on holidays with her beau (now husband). They were browsing in an antique store, as one does when on holidays, and she came across a stunning antique ring. She told 'beau' how much she liked the ring and casually mentioned that 'it would be a perfect engagement ring'. Several months later 'beau' proposed with the antique ring and of course she said 'yes'. The engagement ring was a little big so she looped it on a chain around her neck with plans to have it re-sized. Later that night the pair celebrated with their families at a local restaurant. At the end of the dinner the ring still hung around her neck, but as they walked from the restaurant along a short wide path to the car, the necklace and the ring disappeared. Upon realising that the ring was gone when she arrived at the car, the couple and their families spent hours searching for the antique ring, but the ring was never found.\nAside from the financial loss, my friend received a new ring that she adores just as much and we've decided that the ring was cursed, a piece of bad luck not meant for her finger. We invented all kinds of stories to explain the ring's curse - perhaps it was the product of an unhappy marriage, a proposal gone wrong or the ring of a criminal. I don't actually believe any of our imaginative stories, but they certainly turned me off genuine antique engagement rings.\nI still love love love the vintage style of an antique ring - delicate and refined, a vintage style engagement ring is perfect for soft feminine hands. Intricate settings and multiple diamonds define this style, but the good news is that you don't have to buy old when it comes to a vintage style engagement ring. I especially love these rings from Larsen Jewellery. Unlike the rings of yester year they're not storing up any dark secrets - they're brand new and just for you!\nWhich ring is your favourite? I am in love with the trio with pears!"}

Check out other small business ideas.\nSTEP 1: Plan your business\nA clear plan is essential for success as an entrepreneur. It will help you map out the specifics of your business and discover some unknowns. A few important topics to consider are:\n- What are the startup and ongoing costs?\n- Who is your target market?\n- How much can you charge customers?\n- What will you name your business?\nLuckily we have done a lot of this research for you.\nWhat are the costs involved in opening a ski resort?\nThe costs of opening a ski resort are significant. Business owners need to purchase land, cut trails, buy equipment, build lodges and other buildings and install lifts. These don\u2019t even take into account employee\u2019s initial wages, insurance costs, permit fees and energy costs. According to EHow, snowmaking equipment alone costs millions of dollars, and land can run hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nExisting resorts come up for sale fairly regularly, but they also cost a lot to purchase and begin operating. When CNC Lifestyle Properties, which owns major resorts around the country, listed its 16 ski resorts for sale, they collectively were worth hundreds of millions of dollars. A small resort in New York was listed for much less. It only cost $475,000, but almost all of its equipment would have to be replaced."}
{"question":"international export procedures hazardous goods regulations workplace safety precautions","doc_text":"Hong Kong\u2019s busy international port has a zero-percent import duty rate for all trade, giving exporters an extra incentive to ship their goods to Hong Kong as opposed to mainland ports. If taken further, thanks to CEPA, a zero-percent import tariff structure exists for mainland China if goods are first imported by Hong Kong and then re-exported into the mainland. For agricultural goods, it is nearly a carte-blanche for suppliers to bypass tariffs and safeguard profit margins by using Hong Kong as a go-between. Goods such as frozen beef, which have a general import tariff rate of 25% (of the value) in mainland China, have a zero-percent rate in and out of Hong Kong. A virtual free-trade backdoor was unlocked when CEPA was adopted on top of Hong Kong\u2019s free trade port.\nFor international suppliers of agricultural goods, Hong Kong and China not only have separate import tariff structures, but also separate quality control and food security administrations. In mainland China, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) is responsible for import-export food safety, while in Hong Kong its Centre of Food Safety regulates food trade for the SAR. Consequently, asymmetrical import regulations can appear, with mainland China sometimes banning certain agricultural goods while Hong Kong chooses to keep the proverbial door open for imports. In the case of frozen beef, as of mid-2015, mainland China had maintained its 2000 ban on US beef over bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or \u2018mad cow\u2019) concerns. Meanwhile, Hong Kong has continued imports of US beef unabated. It is unknown exactly how much US beef is re-exported into mainland China. In general, there is limited information on the type and amount of agricultural commodities that are shipped to Hong Kong, but ultimately destined for dinner tables in the mainland. This short brief will attempt to shed light on which agricultural good are imported by Hong Kong and re-exported to China.\nIn order to determine which agricultural goods are being re-exported to mainland China, ChinaAg compared the proportion of imports (from the world excluding China) to exports (only to mainland China). Hong Kongese production of agricultural goods must be taken into consideration as well since these goods would likely be exported alongside foreign-produced imports. However, with the exception of a few processed food products, Hong Kong is not a major a producer of agricultural goods and only grows small amounts of fresh commodities."}

That's what I want to share with you today. Three ways - three research heresies - that I\u2019ve used to explain to these people what it is to do their jobs.\nThis whole idea of finding the explanations leads me on to this. The Beginning of Infinity is a book by David Deutsch, a theoretical physicist.\nHe's got this theory that human knowledge doesn't advance by data and facts and evidence and what he would call empiricism. Instead, human knowledge advances through us coming up with better explanations to make sense of the data, the facts and knowledge.\nAnd that the act of explaining things is fundamentally a creative act, not an analytical one. I am going to try and do some of that for us today.\nThe first unhelpful belief that we hold as user researchers is that \u2018user needs\u2019 is an important concept for training user researchers.\nI think this is unhelpful. I do not agree with this.\nI get where it comes from. One of the places is the first government design principle.\n\u2018Start with user needs\u2019 has been hugely important for government. I love this principle. It\u2019s brought a lot of user centered design into government. It has been a rallying call for researchers and designers to come and work in government. Me included. I work in government because of this.\nBut when I work with researchers on our teams I've come to the conclusion that \u2018user needs\u2019 is actually a harmful concept for training researchers. Or teaching researchers what the job of a researcher is.\nI know this is quite a big statement. So I want to explain myself.\nThis is me joining GDS and leaving cxpartners, a design agency I worked for. You can see I'm excited because there's a nice exclamation mark!\nWhat you can\u2019t see is I'm actually nervous and slightly scared. The reason I'm nervous and scared is that - in the job description, and in the job advert, and on the service manual, and even in my objectives - there\u2019s this concept of \u2018user needs\u2019.\nThe truth is that I don't understand how to relate \u2018user needs\u2019 to my work."}

How do the work hours compare between being an athletic trainer in a DME department and a phlebotomy technician?","doc_text":"Choosing a Phlebotomy Technician Course near Yorklyn Delaware\nPicking the right phlebotomy technician training near Yorklyn DE is an essential first step toward a gratifying career as a phlebotomist. It might seem like a challenging undertaking to evaluate and compare each of the training options that are available to you. Nevertheless it\u2019s necessary that you do your due diligence to ensure that you obtain a superior education. In fact, a large number of potential students start their search by considering two of the qualifiers that initially come to mind, which are cost and location. An additional option you may look into is whether to attend classes online or commute to an area campus. We\u2019ll talk a bit more about online schools later in this article. What\u2019s important to keep in mind is that there is a lot more to comparing phlebotomy training programs than finding the closest or the cheapest one. Other factors including accreditation and reputation are also important considerations and should be part of your selection process too. To assist in that effort, we will provide a list of questions that you should ask each of the phlebotomy schools you are evaluating to help you choose the best one for you. But before we do that, let\u2019s cover what a phlebotomist is and does, and afterwards resume our conversation about online training.\nPhlebotomist Job Summary\nA phlebotomist, or phlebotomy technician, collects blood samples from patients. While that is their primary responsibility, there is in fact so much more to their job description. Before drawing a blood sample, a phlebotomist needs to verify that the tools being used are sterile and single use only. Following the collection, the sample must be properly labeled with the patient\u2019s information. Afterward, paperwork has to be properly completed in order to track the sample from the time of collection through the lab testing process. The phlebotomist then transports the blood to either an in-house lab or to an outside lab facility where it may be tested for such things as infectious diseases, pregnancy or blood type. A number of Yorklyn DE phlebotomists in fact work in labs and are accountable for ensuring that samples are tested correctly utilizing the highest quality control procedures. And if those weren\u2019t sufficient responsibilities, they might be asked to train other phlebotomists in the collection, delivery and follow-up process.\nWhere do Phlebotomists Practice?"}

I currently practice for a half an hour a day and would like to work up to at least two half hour practices per day.\nI\u2019m very glad to hear the video is helping. The cramping and tiring is pretty normal at first, but you should check whether your hand is positioned uncomfortably, or is tense in any way. That could be affecting it. Experiment a little to see if it works better with a bit of relaxation, or slightly different hand position. Otherwise, it\u2019s just a matter of the muscles that control the fingers getting stronger, which comes naturally with time. I don\u2019t know what to suggest as warmup exercises, as the rolls you\u2019re doing are what some people do as a warmup. Try doing them a little more slowly at first, without the video running.

{"question":"I've been reading about women's activism - what's the difference between how domestic workers' rights are handled in Asia versus how women's participation is supported in peace processes?","doc_text":"In several European countries, including the UK, Norway and Spain, the highest smoking uptake rates are now seen in disadvantaged girls.22\nA recent analysis of World Health Survey data from 50 countries19 shows how tobacco use is spreading from HICs to LMICs, particularly among disadvantaged groups, and how these trajectories differ by gender, age and stage of diffusion of smoking in a country (as described in the four-stage cigarette smoking epidemic model of Lopez and colleagues23). This analysis reveals that the key drivers of the tobacco epidemic such as increasing gross domestic product in LMICs (which increases cigarette purchasing power) and increasing educational status (which increases awareness of health risks) have a differential impact on women and men, and are mediated by gendered social, cultural and economic factors. These factors include social norms and restrictions on women's smoking, as well as shifts in women's social and economic status.\nWomen's emancipation and increases in status have long been associated with increases in smoking. Young urbanised women are often among the first to adopt cigarette smoking in LMICs. The link between gender empowerment (measured by economic and political participation) and smoking has been positively correlated,24 establishing that as the gender empowerment measure for women rises, so does the gender smoking ratio. While the correlation of women's status with smoking uptake may explain initiation, it may not explain the economic and gendered patterns of smoking once diffusion has occurred.25 For example, Pampel,26 using a complex set of indicators to measure a \u2018gender-equality\u2019 hypothesis that included social and cultural as well as economic independence, concluded that there was no support for a causal relationship between increased equality and increased smoking among women in HICs."}

From celebration will come the energy to do whatever it takes to bring about social change.\n~Marshall B. Rosenberg\nPANinA has always been about Peace People and Events that embody Peace And Nonviolence in Action. Originally oganized around geographic communities, PANinA was launched on 7-7-7 for the first global Live Earth Concert. Here is a report on the event from Abingdon, VA:\nThere was a viewing of about an hour of the concerts with ElderSpirit members followed by lunch and live local music at White's Mill followed by new connections made in Unicoi, TN. Two lessons learned: There is socially-conscious music being written whether or not one likes it, and there is a generation of young adults who \"get it\" and are ripe for proactive social change. Read more about the other seven events that comprise the history of PANinA 1.0.\nThis newest incarnation of PANinA was launched on 2-18-12, the second birthday of the Consciousness Transformation Community (CTC). The critical lapse in available energy for virtual community-building that has brought about the collapse of formal structures such as the CTC is actually a sign of maturity as we move into deeper connection with local community."}
{"question":"is nonviolence good for defending property","doc_text":"When the state declared it would incorporate open standards and open source in all future technology acquisitions, critics charged the commonwealth with \"socializing the software industry, destroying intellectual property in its wake and undermining the pillars of our capitalistic economy.\"\nIn fact, intellectual property was fiercely defended and promoted, new private-sector players came to the table and newly developed applications are in production at costs one-third below market value. The code is available through the Government Open Code Collaborative Repository, a clearing-house others have talked about for a decade or more, but that Massachusetts actually built.\nQuinn's deeper concern is that the road ahead for public-sector IT is a cul-de-sac without reform on four fronts: open funding that aligns the budget cycle with technology life cycles; open infrastructure that focuses on building it once and building it right; open design in government focused on the citizen; and an open civil service that makes public service an attractive career choice, addresses the retirement wave that already has come ashore and confronts what he calls the union practice of \"defending the indefensible ... insistence on archaic work practices and ... continued stifling of job choice.\"\nIt ought to be good watching."}

As Webster was their ammo bearer, Clancy and Mike yelled at him to bring more ammo, but Webster did not move out of his foxhole. After numerous shouts from both men, Clancy took out a grenade and threw it right in Webster's foxhole. The pin on the grenade was still in place, unbeknownst to Webster. Webster quickly fled up the dike to get ammo.\nWhile recuperating back in England, Webster missed the Battle of the Bulge fighting and rejoined his unit in February, 1945 after being formally released by the hospital. What he found was a decimated regiment, exhausted, weary and bitter over his absence and the loss of friends. Soon thereafter, Easy Company discovered their first concentration camp, witnessing firsthand the walking and also the unburied dead of the Landsberg Concentration Camp.\nAuthor Stephen Ambrose had this to say about Webster: \"He had long ago made it a rule of his Army life never to do anything voluntarily. He was an intellectual, as much an observer and chronicler of the phenomenon of soldiering as a practitioner. He was almost the only original Toccoa man who never became an NCO. Various officers wanted to make him a squad leader, but he refused. He was there to do his duty, and he did it - he never let a buddy down in combat, in France, Holland, or Germany - but he never volunteered for anything and he spurned promotion\".\nAwards and decorations\nHis list of authorized medals and decorations are:\n- Bronze Star\n- Purple Heart with one oak leaf cluster\n- Good Conduct Medal\n- European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with Arrowhead and 4 service stars\n- World War II Victory Medal\n- Army of Occupation Medal\n- Presidential Unit Citation with one Oak Leaf Cluster\n- Combat Infantryman Badge\n- Parachutist Badge with 2 jump stars\nHe was the last of the surviving Toccoa veterans who had fought in Normandy to be sent home.

With a story that has been concentrating on villains, Layman and Fabok have given Batman fans a unique mix of gritty detective stories and fun moments reminiscent of the character's animated series.\nIn fact, it's animation that helps to inform the work by Fabok, who burst onto the scene at DC by helping out with David Finch's work on Batman: The Dark Knight.\nNewsarama talked to the artist about his unique style on Detective Comics, drawing The Joker, and his hopes for the future.\nNewsarama: Jay, what drew you to the chance to work on Detective Comics?\nJason Fabok: I've always wanted to work on Batman. That was my main goal when I started this crazy ride a few years back. Batman has been my favorite character since the first time I saw Tim Burton's Batman movie as a child. I\u2019m still in a state of shock that I'm even working on a Batman title. I never thought that I'd get this chance so early in my career.\nAs for how I got this opportunity, it was right after the Batman Annual that Mike Marts approached me and asked if I was ready for a \"Big Project.\" I was curious as to what he had up his sleeve and it turned out to be Detective Comics. I couldn't turn something like that down.\nNrama: Were you aware of John Layman's work before? What did you think of the chance to work with him as he started on a DC Batman comic?\nFabok: I knew he was a hugely popular writer with Chew but hadn't found the time to check out his work. But right from the get-go, I felt we've really clicked. We had some great conversations as to what he wanted to do with the series and what my thoughts were as well. I honestly couldn't believe how close our vision was for the series. He pitched a fun, action-packed, detective comic that reminded me of the old Batman animated series. I loved the idea of each issue being it's own story while having a connecting tie through the arc."}

The building steps back on the upper floors to create a gradual transition between the single-family residential neighborhood on the north and the commercial development abutting other sides of the property.

The attractive elements of the building\u2019s design and the streetscape improvements complement and enhance nearby revitalization and redevelopment initiatives.\nIt is extremely rare that sustainability and affordability go together. At vPoint, sustainability was an integral part of the project design process. Located at the heart of Arlington\u2014a transit oriented development (TOD), yards away from the metro station, bus lines and various other amenities, the project is imbued with green amenities like hi-performance mechanical systems, high-performance windows, energy efficient\/water saving appliances, energy efficient lighting, reflective roof, electric car charging stations and green power. These are just a few examples of how this development pushes the green envelope. The most sustainable quality is the diversity of use on site from church to day care, office to education, along with affordable and market rate units.\nIn addition to the green features mentioned above, vPoint is abound with amenities like designer kitchens, stainless steel appliances, in-unit washing machines, high-end fixtures, wood flooring, a resident\u2019s lounge and business center, an outdoor space that includes grill and lounge seating, and a conference room that can transform into a mini-event space. The existing onsite amenities like the church and day care center adds to the appeal.\nThe project recently earned the LEED Gold Certification. It also won the Urban Land Institute Smart Growth Award, and the 2012 Washington Building Congress Craftsmanship award.\nWith minimal amenities and less than inspiring design of their buildings, affordable housing has never been fully integrated with their neighbors, and this has been the status quo for decades. vPoint is clearly a game changer for affordable housing that co-exists with market rate units and other civic uses, offering features, location and amenities that used to be the exclusive domain of high-end condos."}

Also supplied to the overlay control logic circuit are four signals from the CPU 80 of the user pod. These four signals are H Tone Enable, OSD Enable, System Video Enable and Transparent. The overlay control logic circuit 366 reads the value of these logic signals and either enables or disables a set of tri-state buffers 368, 370 and 372 on the tri-state buffers 352, 354 and 356. These tri-state buffers 368, 370 and 372 couple the outputs of the onscreen processor 364 to the leads that connect to the monitor's color inputs.\nWhen the tri-state buffers 352, 354 and 356 are in their high impedance state, and the tri-state buffers 368, 370 and 372 are active, then the video screen will only display those signals produced by the onscreen processor. Conversely, if the tri-state buffers 368, 370 and 372 are in their high impedance state and the tri-state buffers 352, 354 and 356 are active then the monitor displays the video signals produced by the remote computer system. If both sets of tri-state buffers 368, 370, 372 and 352, 354 and 356 are both active, then the monitor will display the video signals produced by both the onscreen processor and the remote computer system."}

{"question":"jennie wade death circumstances gettysburg civilian casualties statistics","doc_text":"Discourse Does Not Match Falling Sept. 11 Death Toll\nBy Shankar Vedantam\nWashington Post Staff Writer\nThursday, November 22, 2001; Page A18\nNearly 2,000 names have been removed from the lists of those dead and missing in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- but it would be hard to tell that from the public discourse in America over the past two months.\nInitial estimates of 6,030 casualties in New York, Washington and western Pennsylvania had dropped to 4,132 by yesterday and will probably fall further as officials sort through the confusion and remove double-counted names and other errors. Politicians, pundits and the general public, however, have often used numbers larger than the steadily declining count.\nThe discrepancy reflects both the resilience of statistics and a curious psychological irony: Although people are glad that there were fewer victims, powerful political, social and emotional forces conspire to make reducing the number of casualties difficult.\nFor once a number becomes a symbol for tragedy, reducing it runs the risk of seeming callous and implying the tragedy was not as bad as previously thought, say statisticians and sociologists who study how numbers are used.\n\"Once a number gets into circulation, it takes on a life of its own,\" said Joel Best, author of \"Damned Lies and Statistics.\" \"People become invested in it, they feel they need to defend it, criticism of the number becomes a criticism of larger principles.\"\nThe toll of missing and dead has fluctuated because of confusion over casualties in New York. The plane crashes in Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon were known early on to have caused 44 and 189 casualties, and those figures have not changed. But an accurate count has been far more difficult at the World Trade Center.\nOfficials in Manhattan were inundated with missing-person reports -- often of the same person and sometimes with different spellings. Dewi Williams, a spokesman for the British consulate, said yesterday that about 26,000 phone calls to British officials triggered initial estimates of 200 to 300 dead and missing Britons. The current number is 63.\nOn Monday, when official reports were putting the number of victims at 4,184, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said, \"It is now 69 days since September 11th, when coldblooded terrorists turned civilian airliners into flying bombs and used them to kill 5,000 innocent people.\"\nOn Oct."}

Many of the men who were part of what is known as the \"Tuskegee Airmen Experience\" were not pilots and did not aspire to be.

Theodore Randall, an Indianapolis native, served as commander of the CTD at Tuskegee.\nTuskegee pilots ended up fighting in aerial combat over Europe and North Africa. Many were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\nIn Indiana, the Tuskegee Airmen were honored at a ceremony last October during which a stretch of I-65 from Seymour (not far from the site of the Freeman Field Mutiny) to the Bartholomew\/Johnson County line was named the Tuskegee Airmen Highway."}

For three years, the group met secretly each Saturday, hence the name, Oyneg Shabes which means \u201cthe joys of Shabbat.\u201d\nRuins of the Warsaw Ghetto, 1943.\nFor the Oyneg Shabes no subject was taboo. No detail too small. Under Ringelblum\u2019s meticulous direction, members of the secret society tried to create a portrait of all aspects of Jewish life in the Ghetto. They wrote essays about corrupt Jewish police and collaborators, about young smugglers, underground schools, religious affairs, the secret economy, and prostitution. They collected poetry, Ghetto humor, songs and folklore. The Archive recorded statistics on deportations and deaths. They collected issues of the dozens of underground newspapers circulating in the Ghetto. And, because Ringelblum had close relationships with members of the Zionist youth movements, he was also able to support and document the emergence of their plans for armed resistance.\nRingelblum encouraged everyone, not only Oyneg Shabes members, to write. He ran essay contests for children to write about their lives in the Ghetto. The Archive also collected artifacts: armbands, official Nazi pronouncements and Judenrat issued IDs. Candy wrappers, tram tickets, theater posters, announcement of concerts and lectures\u2014the stuff of daily life was also included. Moreover, in an ongoing effort to make sense of what was happening beyond the Ghetto walls, Oyneg Shabes members debriefed eye-witness survivors of destroyed Jewish communities who managed to straggle into Warsaw.\nAt first Ringelblum believed he and his collaborators were collecting the raw material from which, after the war, they would write volumes of history. As the stark truth of the Nazi machine for total annihilation of the Jews emerged, it became increasingly clear that they themselves would probably not survive, but rather that they were collecting the raw data from which others would write their history after the war."}

Standish\u2019s careful critique shows the necessity of a depoliticised geography curriculum the irony of which would be that it would ensure that every child could point to Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan on a map.\u2019 Prof. Dennis Hayes \u2013 Oxford Brookes University, UK 'A prescient and critical analysis of the changing face of geography teaching. This book deserves to be widely read and debated. Alex Standish's book puts current trends in geography teaching in historical and critical context. It comprises a forthright and timely defence of geographical education for its own sake.' Dr Jim Butcher, FRSA, Department of Sport Science, Tourism and Leisure, Canterbury Christ Church University. Since the early 1990s, educational policy makers and some subject leaders have been seeking to fundamentally change the teaching of geography in UK and US schools, from a subject which encourages students to explore spatial concepts, ideas and skills, to a more ethics based subject concerned with the promotion of environmentalism, cultural diversity and social justice. In this book the new approach is critically examined, within a historical and ideological context, addressing a number of fundamental questions: Should geography be used as a tool for the delivery of citizenship ideals? How does this affect the intellectual and moral value of geographical education for young people? If the state and teachers are taking more responsibility for the values, attitudes and emotional responses of students, how will they learn to develop these qualities for themselves? If global perspectives shift the focus of education from learning about the outside world to learning about the self, what is its vision of social progress and conception of social change? This book advocates a return to liberal models of education, arguing that the new approach to geography currently being promoted for schools fundamentally undermines the educational value of the subject, and the freedom of young people to shape the world in which they live. A vital resource for teachers and student teachers alike, Global Perspectives in the Geography Curriculum makes a significant contribution to the growing debate about the future direction of the discipline itself."}

Fiscally, these fires have caused $2.975 billion in damages.\nSome of the most destructive fires ever recorded have happened this season, like the Mendocino Complex Fire, burning more than 459,000 acres to become the largest complex fire in the state\u2019s history. A complex fire is two or more individual incidents located in the same general area which are assigned to a single incident commander or unified command, according to the National Park Service\u2019s Fire Terminology glossary.\nCamp Fire in Northern California, which started on November 8th, has claimed 83 lives, making it the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California\u2019s history. 536 people are still missing; this number is down from past weeks. The fire decimated whole towns, like Paradise, California. The fire destroyed homes, buildings, cars, parks, basically everything in sight; 18,000 structures were burned to the ground. As of November 21st, the fire was 80% contained.\nThe Woolsey Fire in Southern California also started on November 8th and was highly publicized due to the region it engulfed. The fire destroyed buildings, houses (including those of celebrities), and highways in the Los Angeles area; 1,500 structures destroyed and 341 damaged. This fire is 98% contained as of November 20th. In both fire cases, the Camp Fire and the Woolsey Fire, mandatory evacuations took place.\nHow do these fires start? Why are they so bad?\nWildfires can start in a number of ways, as long as there\u2019s a spark. From there, the fire needs oxygen, heat, and fuel to expand. Because California has the oxygen in the form of wind, heat in the form of summer weather, and fuel in the form of trees and other plants, the fires explode in size and spread rapidly.\nScientists have said that increased amounts of natural fuel (dead trees, grasses) and atmospheric conditions (global warming) have contributed to California\u2019s fire susceptibility.

For more info visit www.alcuinschool.org.\nAlcuin School provides a proven effective, progressive education for its students which begins in the Toddler program and extends into the high school years with the acclaimed IB Programme.\nThe IB Diploma Programme is an integrated curriculum with study in six subject areas, compared to a single-subject focus of other programs and assessments. Students must use their content knowledge to solve problems, make conjectures and inferences, and think deeply about the big questions of the disciplines.\nIn recent years, Texas has experienced tremendous growth in IB curriculum within the state. According to Texas IB Schools (TIBS), Texas has one of the highest concentrations of IB World Schools in the world. TIBS suggests that if Texas were a country, it would be ranked five out of 144 in total IB World Schools, behind the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.\nStudies show that students who participated in the IB are better prepared for university studies, perform better when they are there, are more likely to graduate (and graduate sooner) than other students. In addition, they are also more likely to enroll in selective institutions.\nIn addition to hearing more about how IB gives students an academic advantage, guests learned how Montessori education serves as an excellent transition to the IB curriculum. Although there are more than 1,119,000 IB students enrolled at 3,747 schools in 146 countries, fewer than 10 schools combine the advantages of Montessori and IB in the way the programs are implemented at Alcuin.\nAbout Alcuin School\nA vibrant, nurturing, coeducational academic community serving students from toddler to 12th grade, Alcuin School uses the Montessori and International Baccalaureate program methods to foster critical thinking and a lifelong passion for learning. With faculty support, students at Alcuin School are eager to embrace change, question the status quo, and prepare for their future as leaders in a global society.

{"question":"I'm curious about different ways that humans used animals for transportation in the past - what are some examples of how animals were used for moving people and goods?","doc_text":"Some companies have already banned animal testing with their beauty products, and are trying to put an end to all of it.\nThe beauty company LUSH. For more than 30 years, they have been fighting against animal testing. It\u2019s Cruel and ineffective, and despite some changes in the last four decades, there\u2019s still so much more to be done, says the LUSH company. This company advertises for animal testing awareness on all of their products like bags, packaging, and even on the receipts. In Europe, India, Israel, and Norway animal testing for cosmetics are banned. One good thing that has come out of animal testing, is animal testing for medical purposes. Due to animals and people being able to get the same illnesses some research is very beneficial to humankind. All medical research is planned out, and experts only use animal experimentation for urgent purposes. Scientists do try to keep the welfare of the animal in mind as they are experimenting, which means a small number of an applicable species can be used.\nVeterinarians are an essential part of the medical research team. The veterinarians make sure that the animal is being treated humanely and they also provide the medical\/surgical support. The animals are protected through laws, regulations, and policies to provide humane treatment to all of the animals in the research. The Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Animal Welfare Act give details about day-to-day animal care. Some good examples of animal testing for medical research would be on dogs to discover insulin for people with diabetes, monkeys for the polio vaccine, pigs for skin grafts for burn victims, and mice for a rabies vaccine.\nMany people are against animal testing for beauty-products but, of course, we have people that would love to say that it is okay. Animals are a great way to further research on humans. This makes sense but, not all animals have the genetic makeup of a human. That means that these innocent animals that are not similar to humans were just inhumanely slaughtered all in the name of research. If scientists would like to discover more about humans, they could find some humans that have no problem being tested on. Some people believe that animal testing is cheaper than others.\nThis is also false. The USA spends $16 million dollars annually for animal testing at the taxpayer\u2019s dollar."}

The law would mean that Holocaust survivors or their heirs wouldn\u2019t obtain fair compensation for their former property, according to Jakub Finci, chairman of the country\u2019s small Jewish community.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s another injustice done not only to Jews but all other former owners who waited 50 years to get back their property,\u201d Finci said. The Inter-Religious Council, which includes Jewish, Muslim, Catholic and Orthodox representatives, says the legislation would leave people whose apartments were nationalized with little possibility of regaining their property. (...)\nWith parliamentary elections looming in October, legislators who backed the apartment law were seeking to gain votes from the vast number of people who still live in state-owned apartments, Finci said.\nThe law does offer some compensation to those who lose their property \u2014 in the form of property in another location \u2014 but there\u2019s no requirement that the alternate property have the same value. \u201cSo someone can take up a property in Sarajevo and the original owner could get a plot in the forest somewhere,\u201d Finci said. Restitution has been a thorny issue across the former Eastern bloc, with compensation often serving as a substitute for restitution.\nFinci estimated that about 2,000 apartments in the city belonged to Jewish families when they were nationalized by the socialist government of Marshal Josip Broz Tito. The law also means that the Jewish community will lose 71 Sarajevo apartments that it owned communally before World War II.\nThere were 12,000 Jews living in Sarajevo before World War II. Before the Bosnian war of the early 1990s, there were 1,800.\nToday there are about 1,000, including 700 in Sarajevo, where property prices have soared as a massive rebuilding plan has helped restore the city\u2019s grandeur.

From the point of contact, the polymer forms a molecular bond with the water and won\u2019t release it. Why is there water in compressed air systems? When air is compressed, moisture in the air concentrates to the point where the water starts condensing and turns into free water.

{"question":"What percentage of performance horses have gastric ulcers?","doc_text":"M1 signifies the presence of metastatic disease. Sampling of at least 15 lymph nodes is recommended during surgical staging (see Curative Surgical Resection below). A staging laparoscopy prior to definitive surgery to exclude peritoneal carcinomatosis should be considered in patients with stage T1b or greater disease without radiographic evidence of distant metastases. Pathologic review should include (1) grade of tumor; (2) histologic subtype; (3) depth of invasion; (4) whether lymphatic or vascular invasion is present; and (5) if there is known metastatic disease, the status of HER2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry or fluorescent in situ hybridization or both.\nUlcerating gastric adenocarcinomas are distinguished from benign gastric ulcers by biopsies. Approximately 3% of gastric ulcers initially believed to be benign later prove to be malignant. To exclude malignancy, all gastric ulcers identified at endoscopy should be biopsied. Ulcers that are suspicious for malignancy to the endoscopist or that have atypia or dysplasia on histologic examination warrant repeat endoscopy in 2\u20133 months to verify healing and exclude malignancy. Nonhealing ulcers should be considered for resection. Infiltrative carcinoma with thickened gastric folds must be distinguished from lymphoma and other hypertrophic gastropathies.\n- Curative Surgical Resection\nSurgical resection is the only therapy with curative potential. Laparoscopic techniques achieve similar outcomes and lower overall complication rates as open gastrectomy. After preoperative staging, about two-thirds of patients will be found to have localized disease (ie, stages I\u2013III). In Japan and in specialized centers in the United States, endoscopic mucosal resection is performed in selected patients with small (< 1\u20132 cm), early (intramucosal or T1aN0) gastric cancers after careful staging with endoscopic ultrasonography. Approximately 25% of patients undergoing surgery will be found to have locally unresectable tumors or peritoneal, hepatic, or distant lymph node metastases that are incurable.

{"question":"I'm a workshop owner and I've been thinking about getting a band saw. What features make it good for different types of cuts, and what safety measures should I keep in mind to prevent injuries?","doc_text":"Increasing Student Interaction in Class\nI have just prepared next Tuesday's workshop on 'Increasing Student Interaction in Class'. It is the first time this one has been offered and I'm pretty enthusiastic about the topic. So far there are 8 people enrolled, which will just about be enough for me to take the approach which I think is crucial: this workshop, of all workshops, cannot be a pure and simple powerpoint presentation where participants sit and listen! I have to model, so far as I can, what I want to communicate. So I have worked out what I hope will be an hour's session that is almost entirely interactive, and at the times when it isn't, this too has a specific reason and point to convey. The biggest challenge for me, and probably the biggest novelty for the participants, will be the use of clickers, but I'm excited about trying these out for myself. I have to admit my participants will be my guinea pigs, but I've had a good introduction to clickers from Hannah in the Teaching Grid and this context is absolutely perfect for trying them out in safety. I trust that those attending will not eat me alive or the workshop slide into chaos and bedlum! I've done some reading to back up my thinking about the benefits of student interaction in class, although this is fairly familiar territory for me, and I have also spent some time finding and watching a variety of vodcasts on YouTube, especially about the use of clickers in class. Somewhat frustratingly, I haven't actually found a vodcast which actually models good practice in the use of clickers. Most do exactly what I've been at pains to avoid in my session: lots of talk about the benefits, lots of 'presentations', but lamentably little which demonstrates a full-length class where they are integral to the session and where the lecturer models excellent practice. Maybe there's a niche here...\nAre there likely to be any other challenges that I have to cope with? Yes, if the clickers don't work, or if I haven't got a sufficiently good grasp of how they are used. I'm always a bit nervous when it's a first time using something, but I have done my prep and the TG staff will be around to help out if need be. I shall go to the Grid at least an hour early to make sure all is in order."}
{"question":"I work with machine tool standards and optical measurement systems, and I need to understand the relationship between measurement uncertainty and tolerance limits. How do different machine tool standards handle accuracy specifications, and what approach is used in optical shaft measurement to ensure measurement reliability?","doc_text":"Rather than measuring the initial and final lengths (Li and Lf) of the test member, dilatometry measures the difference in length \u03b4L between the test member and the reference member. Because \u03b4L is generally much less than Li and Lf, the measurement accuracy is enhanced. Error sources in dilatometry include an imperfect knowledge of the reference member's CTE and inadvertent temperature differences between the test member and the reference member.\nIn interferometry, the expansion of a test member is measured relative to the wavelength of monochromatic light. A monochromatic light beam is split into first and second signals which are directed along first and second optical paths before being recombined. The optical paths are configured to include reflection from opposite ends of the test member. The difference in the optical path lengths causes a phase difference in the first and second signals which affects the amplitude of the recombined signal.\nExpansion of the test member causes the first and second optical path lengths to change and this change is reflected in a change in the amplitude of the recombined signal. The measurement accuracy can be on the order of the radiation wavelength which is generally small, e.g., \u02dc1 micron for visible light. Interferometry measurement systems are typically complex and expensive. Error sources include the temperature sensitivities of optical equipment (e.g., lenses and retroreflectors) which must be exposed to the test temperature.\nDilatometry and interferometry measurement techniques are best suited for the measurement of homogeneous test members which expand linearly. Because their constituent parts may have different CTEs, composite members often bend or twist as they expand. Conventional dilatometry and interferometry techniques are typically not configured to correct for this complex expansion.\nExemplary composite members which are subjected to thermal stress are the solar wings 22 and 24 of the satellite 20 of FIG. 1. The satellite has a body 26 which carries various communication antennas, e.g., dish antennas 28, 29 and 30 and an array antenna 31. The solar wings 22 and 24 extend in opposite directions from the body 26 and they each carry a plurality of solar cells 32 on one wing face.\nThe satellite 20 is typically maintained in an attitude which directs the antennas at the Earth. The solar cells 32 convert solar radiation 33 to electrical energy for operation of the systems of the spacecraft 20."}

I should take stock out in Nature's Miracle! This all started two years ago. First We got rid of our futon, then last year we moved in with my fiance, Lucy peed on our microfiber couch. We delt with it, professional cleaners, plastic, etc. We moved again last October and Over Christmas, My husband bought me a beautiful new leather sofa. Guess what... a week later, Lucy peed on it! I can't win! Three houses, three sofas, each in a different location. Leather is easier to clean, but this is ridiculas! I tried the no stay boundary spray, positive and negative reinforcement. She didn't have a UTI, I took her to the VET several times over the last year Nothing seems to work. Please help. I really don't want to get rid of her, but she is ruining our furniture\n- Cast your vote for which answer you think is best!\nIt seems like Lucy doesn't like change, especially in environments. However, she shouldn't be urinating on the couch if you are keeping her litterbox as clean as you say. What about the cat litter you are using? Cats do not like scented cat litter. Does the litter need to be changed more frequently and not just scooped? Try adding a third litterbox. You should have one more litterbox than cats - in your case - you need three litterboxes. Keep them scrupulously clean! Scrub those soiled areas with Nature's Miracle and let it thoroughly dry. Lucy shouldn't want to go on that same spot. If it were my new couch, I would take it one step further and keep a blanket or sheet on the couch with a waterproof protector underneath (like you would use for a child who pees the bed). I always keep a sheet on my couch just to keep it clean from my cats, but they never pee on it. I hope this helps some."}

They called on the FDA to regulate all types of e-cigarette products that also meet the standard definition of tobacco products.\nThose that do not meet that standard should be regulated by whichever means the FDA feels appropriate, the cancer groups added.\nAmong other recommendations is a call for e-cigarette manufacturers to provide the FDA with a full and detailed list of their products' ingredients; a call for warning labels on all e-cigarette packaging and ads to advise consumers about the perils of nicotine addiction; and a ban on all marketing and selling of e-cigarettes to minors.\nContainers for the liquid nicotine used for e-cigarettes should also have childproof caps, to reduce the chances of accidental poisoning of children, the groups said.\nASCO and AACR further urged that some of the tax monies levied on both traditional and e-cigarette products be used for research into whether or not e-cigarettes have any real value as a smoking-cessation tool, or contain any health hazards.\n\"We are concerned that e-cigarettes may encourage nonsmokers, particularly children, to start smoking and develop nicotine addiction,\" ASCO President Dr. Peter Paul Yu explained in a news release. \"While e-cigarettes may reduce smoking rates and attendant adverse health risks, we will not know for sure until these products are researched and regulated.\"\nASCO and AACR aren't the first organizations of health professionals to come out for more regulation of e-cigarettes.

{"question":"What security measures should be taken for parking and vehicle safety?","doc_text":"Improving school security\nThere\u2019s no sure way to put a cost on a human life, yet we attempt to put a price to it almost daily; whether determining the extent of medical treatment; engineering vehicles we drive; or taking steps to thwart the actions of a sick man like the one who mowed down 20 children and six adults at the Sandy Hook School.\nAt some point we question that, while extra treatments and medication may lengthen a life, whether what is gained in time is offset by what is lost of quality of life. Cost enters this discussion, too.\nCost is often the driver in motor vehicle engineering. Safety is a valid marketing consideration, but there\u2019s a point where we\u2019re prepared to take the risk even as we know the possible consequences. Otherwise, we would all be driving tanks.\nThe same can be asked of the safety of our children.\nIn response to the Newtown massacre, the National Rifle Association CEO, Wayne LaPierre, suggested all schools should have armed guards. At least one community in Arizona has followed his advice and armed parents, on a volunteer basis, to watch over schools.\nHere, the response has been more tempered. Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney, Mayor Scott Avedisian and acting School Superintendent Richard D\u2019Agostino don\u2019t favor armed school guards, whether they are members of the Warwick Police Department or contracted security personnel.\nD\u2019Agostino implemented a policy of locking elementary school doors and has been reviewing security at secondary schools. This is a reasoned approach, and one within the existing capabilities and resources of the department.\nWill it stop a Newtown tragedy?\nThere\u2019s no way of knowing, although, as those who want more security will point out, the doors at Sandy Hook were locked. An armed guard would have probably made the difference in that case. That said, we agree with Pilgrim Principal Marie Cote that, regardless of all the measures that can be taken, someone who is determined will find a way to do it.\nIn weighing the options, we need not only consider child safety and security, but also the environment we are creating. Schools need to be safe places, not forts. Vigilance is a part of the equation. We all need to be sensitive to what is happening around us and how it impacts us. Good drivers do that all the time. But, do we seriously want to drive tanks to make us safer on our highways? Do we seriously want our kids attending armored schools? That\u2019s not a direction for our schools."}
{"question":"What role does education play in soil conservation efforts?","doc_text":"Display to header level\nInitiatives in Pennsylvania and on a national level promote the study of bird populations and the protection of their habitat.\nOrganizations and governments involved in conservation efforts can make important contributions to protecting birds, especially threatened and endangered species. The development of farmland and open space often destroys critical habitat for bird migration, breeding, and wintering. Preserving these natural areas ensures healthy bird populations and intact ecosystems.\nLand trusts, in particular, can be key partners in bird conservation. The 2013 State of the Birds report, submitted to the U.S Department of Interior by 15 bird conservation groups and government agencies, found that more than 100 bird species have at least half of their populations on private land. Many of those species are in decline and in desperate need of habitat conservation. Considering that a majority of land in the United States is privately owned, the ability of land trusts to work directly with landowners means that they can play a major role in the effort to secure, restore, and protect habitat for birds.\nThe National Audubon Society is a prominent bird-focused conservation organization. It coordinates a number of bird conservation programs, many of which are implemented by local chapters and state offices, including Audubon Pennsylvania.\nThe Important Bird Area (IBA) program is an initiative by BirdLife International designed to help organizations and governments prioritize conservation efforts in the most important places for birds. In the United States, the National Audubon Society and local partners administer the IBA program. To date, Audubon has identified nearly 3,000 IBAs covering over 400 million acres.\nIBAs are areas that provide essential habitat for birds, including sites for breeding, wintering, and migration. An IBA can consist of a few acres, or thousands of acres. Land in an IBA can be public or private, protected or unprotected. To be designated an IBA, an area must meet at least one of several objective criteria.\nAfter designating land as an IBA, the Audubon Society works with partner organizations and local chapters to develop and implement an IBA conservation plan. Plan activities vary from IBA to IBA and can include bird monitoring, habitat restoration, land protection, and proposing changes to municipal land use policies.\nIBA designation does not offer legal protection to the identified area; it simply recognizes the area as having outstanding value to bird conservation."}
{"question":"chemical enzyme requirements digestion process linked unlinked sugar molecules","doc_text":"Plants have two main immune responses\u2014the hypersensitive response, in which infected cells seal themselves off and undergo programmed cell death, and systemic acquired resistance, where infected cells release signals warning the rest of the plant of a pathogen's presence. Chloroplasts stimulate both responses by purposely damaging their photosynthetic system, producing reactive oxygen species. High levels of reactive oxygen species will cause the hypersensitive response. The reactive oxygen species also directly kill any pathogens within the cell. Lower levels of reactive oxygen species initiate systemic acquired resistance, triggering defense-molecule production in the rest of the plant.\nIn some plants, chloroplasts are known to move closer to the infection site and the nucleus during an infection.\nChloroplasts can serve as cellular sensors. After detecting stress in a cell, which might be due to a pathogen, chloroplasts begin producing molecules like salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which can serve as defense-signals. As cellular signals, reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules, so they probably don't leave the chloroplast, but instead pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule. All these molecules initiate retrograde signaling\u2014signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus.\nIn addition to defense signaling, chloroplasts, with the help of the peroxisomes, help synthesize an important defense molecule, jasmonate. Chloroplasts synthesize all the fatty acids in a plant cell\u2014linoleic acid, a fatty acid, is a precursor to jasmonate.\nOne of the main functions of the chloroplast is its role in photosynthesis, the process by which light is transformed into chemical energy, to subsequently produce food in the form of sugars. Water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are used in photosynthesis, and sugar and oxygen (O2) is made, using light energy. Photosynthesis is divided into two stages\u2014the light reactions, where water is split to produce oxygen, and the dark reactions, or Calvin cycle, which builds sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. The two phases are linked by the energy carriers adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+).\nATP is the phosphorylated version of adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which stores energy in a cell and powers most cellular activities."}

{"question":"What research methods are scientists using to study coral survival, and what specific threats have they discovered through their investigations?","doc_text":"Chapter 3. Psychological Science & Research\nPsychologists study the behaviour of both humans and animals in order to understand and improve the quality of human lives.\nPsychological research may be either basic or applied in orientation. Basic research and applied research inform each other, and advances in science occur more rapidly when both types of research are conducted.\nThe results of psychological research are reported primarily in research reports in scientific journals. These research reports have been evaluated, critiqued, and improved by other scientists through the process of peer review.\nThe methods used by scientists have developed over many years and provide a common framework through which information can be collected, organized, and shared.\nThe scientific method is the set of assumptions, rules, and procedures that scientists use to conduct research. In addition to requiring that science be empirical, the scientific method demands that the procedures used be objective, or free from personal bias.\nScientific findings are organized by theories, which are used to summarize and make new predictions, but theories are usually framed too broadly to be tested in a single experiment. Therefore, scientists normally use the research hypothesis as a basis for their research.\nGood theories are falsifiable. This means that the relationships between the variables that are predicted by the theory can be shown through research to be incorrect.\nScientists use operational definitions to turn the ideas of interest \u2014 conceptual variables \u2014 into measured variables.\nIt is important for psychological research using humans and animals to be ethical. Our ethics codes are developed from the moral principles of weighing risks against benefits, acting responsibly and with integrity, seeking justice, and respecting people\u2019s rights and dignity.\nResearchers must follow specific ethics codes, providing rules for how to conduct studies. Some historical events that impacted our ethics codes today are the Nuremberg trials, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Belmont Report.\nDecisions about whether psychological research using human and animals is ethical are made using established ethical codes developed by scientific organizations and on the basis of judgments made by the local Ethical Review Board. Informed consent, deception, and debriefing are all considered when deciding if research will be approved.\nPsychological studies start with a research design that vary according to its strengths and limitations, and it is important to understand how each differs.\nDescriptive research is designed to provide a snapshot of the current state of affairs. Descriptive research allows the development of questions for further study but does not assess relationships among variables. The results of descriptive research projects are analyzed using descriptive statistics."}

{"question":"Can ACFM and Hall probe field measurements both work through surfaces without direct contact?","doc_text":"What's a Bar Code?\nHand held laser scanners are the most expensive of the scanning devices, but offer the largest depth of field making them an appropriate choice for a wide variety of non-contact applications.\nHow Lasers Work Hand held laser scanners use a laser diode to create a scan line by projecting a beam of energy off a rotating prism or oscillating mirror. The beam is reflected out the scanner window onto the bar code, where light energy from the bars and spaces is reflected back to the scanner, collected on a mirror, focused, and read by a photodetector. The resulting signal may then be read using decoding software within the scanner or at the terminal or host.\nLasers have their advantages over CCDs. They're not bar code width-dependent. Depth of field is significantly greater and lasers can work in direct sunlight because the amount of reflected light is much greater and much more defined; the signal return is in a defined pathway. Also, lasers don't have to touch the bar code. There's a visible scan line which allows for larger bar code reading.\nLaser technology is an excellent choice for non-contact applications, and the only choice for applications that require reading distances of a foot (.3048m) or more. Available in both hand held and fixed mount form, lasers are easy to use, read a wide variety of code densities, and allow for easy reading of bar codes from irregular surfaces or throughglass. Because they are non-contact devices, lasers will not wear out repeatedly scanned labels.\nHand-held lasers can scan media in hard to reach places, on curved surfaces, or through plastic. They also add longer label life to your application.\nThe light generating medium in first-generation moving beam laser installation was a Helium-Neon laser tube. In the past few years semiconductors capable of producing laser light have been incorporated in most laser products..\nLaser diodes, both visible and infrared, are in a package about the size of an LED. Compared to the gas tube used to create Helium Neon lasers, the laser diode is much smaller, requires significantly less power, and is more durable. This makes these hand-held devices suitable for portable data collection terminals or for fixed-station decoders that are powered from the terminal.\nFixed-mount lasers allow both hands to be free for use in handling product or paper. In addition, self-triggering mechanisms allow these lasers to operate without human intervention."}

{"question":"I'm an x-ray technician trying to understand different injuries. Which scan is better for finding broken bones: regular x-rays of ankle fractures or x-rays of hamate hook fractures?","doc_text":"Bone cancer X-rays\nWhat does bone cancer look like on an X-ray?\nReading X-rays is a specialist job. Most of us can't make much out of them, unless it is something really obvious like a complete break in a bone.\nBone cancer may show up as a thinning of the bone, so the affected area may look paler and less dense on the X-ray. Cancer can lead to a break in a bone, called a pathological fracture. A pathological fracture happens in abnormal bone because it is weak. It can happen after a minor knock or when doing routine activities. Pathological fractures can show up quite clearly in X-rays, like any other break.\nMost cancer cells in bones have spread there from another part of the body. These are called bone metastases, or secondary bone cancers. Primary bone cancer can look quite different and may show as an expansion on the side of the bone where the tumour has grown out from the bone itself. This may look like a shadowy area extending out from the affected bone. The tumour can lay down calcium deposits in this outgrowth and these may show up on X-ray as clearly defined white patches. Your doctor may call this sclerotic changes or sclerosis. Sclerosis means hardening. Secondary prostate cancer in the bones commonly has a dense, sclerotic appearance.\nSometimes the bone has a lacy appearance. The cancer causes holes to develop in the bone, making it look like lace or net. Your doctor may describe these changes as lysis or lytic changes. Lytic means cells that hat been broken down.\nThe type of primary bone cancer called osteosarcoma often looks dense (sclerotic) on X-ray. Or it may be a mixture of thickened areas and holes. Doctors call these areas sclerotic and lytic. You may see these terms used on the X-ray report.\nRated 4 out of 5 based on 25 votes\nQuestion about cancer? Contact our information nurse team"}

{"question":"Can my family join me if I get a Greek Golden Visa?","doc_text":"by Expatguru - 01\/29\/2010\n\"This article describes some important information for those planning to bring their families to the kingdom\"\nOkay, so you have been offered a lucrative job in Saudi Arabia and have signed the contract. You have been promised that you would be able to bring your family after the mandatory probation period. You have submitted all required documents for stamping of your visa and are all set to go. Now, all you need is a visa and a ticket and once you land in the kingdom, after the probationary period you can start processing the papers for your family to join you, right? Well, not always.\nExpats planning to relocate to Saudi Arabia on family status must be aware that there is something called a \"visa profession\". Do not get this confused with the profession which you have been hired for. Let me explain this in detail. Every organization in the kingdom will be allotted a certain number of visas at the beginning of each Hijri year. Prior to this, the organization must have submitted their requests to the Ministry of Labor in the kingdom. The Government carefully evaluates each request and releases a certain number of visas in each category. It doesn\u2019t always happen that the organization would get the same quantity and category of visas applied for. So, they end up with taking whatever is given to them and bring people in whichever visa is available.\nSo, you might, in reality, be an engineer working in a reputed firm, but the visa you have arrived may not actually mention your profession as an engineer. The problem is that if the profession mentioned in your visa is that of a non-supervisory category, for instance, labor, mason, carpenter, etc., you would not be eligible to bring your family because of restrictions by the Government. As a policy, the Saudi Government wants to make sure that only those who can support their families would be issued a family visa. Changing one's visa profession after arriving in Saudi Arabia is not an easy task.\nSo, how do you ensure that your visa is actually the profession for which you have been hired? Well, to be safe, make this as one of the conditions before signing the contract that you need a supervisory category visa in case the appropriate visa is not available with your employer. When your visa comes stamped from the Saudi Embassy \/ Consulate, check the passport and get someone who can read Arabic translate the profession mentioned in the visa."}

{"question":"Can you tell me how the flowering process is different between rice and wheat plants when they begin to bloom?","doc_text":"Calla lilies are cultivated in containers or grown in a garden. Different varieties have different coloured flowers, but the most common calla lily has white, trumpet-shaped flowers and dark green foliage. Calla lilies grow in any climate, but flowering can be hindered without enough light and care.\nCalla lilies grow nice and green in shady areas. However, if the calla lily is to bloom, it needs at least four to five hours of direct sunlight. The afternoon sun may be too hot for the calla lily, but a morning sun or a western sun is ideal.\nFertilising calla lilies once in spring with a 5-10-10 nitrogen-phosphate-potassium fertiliser provides enough potassium and phosphates for promoting blooms and little nitrogen, which promotes more foliage than blooms. Calla lilies need a rich soil provided by fertilising the ground the rhizomes are planted in each spring.\nCalla lilies grown in containers and stored indoors for winters never have the rhizomes divided. Calla lilies produce few flowers or no flowers at all when the rhizomes are clumped together. Divide the rhizomes and make more than one plant, and each one flowers during the season.\nWater is necessary for flowering calla lilies. Lilies need moist soil to grow and flower. During dry periods, provide at least 2.5 cm (1 inch) of water to the ground around the calla lily keeping the soil moist. Laying down 2.5 to 5 cm (1 or 2 inches) of mulch around the base of the plant helps keep the soil cool and the soil moist longer.\nCalla lilies spread out as the rhizomes multiply. When the plants grow together with other plants or shrubs, crowding occurs, as well as a fight for the nutrients in the soil, which will slow down or stop flowering. Calla lilies need room between plants to grow and flower. Plant calla lilies at least 15 cm (6 inches) away from other plants.\n- 20 of the funniest online reviews ever\n- 14 Biggest lies people tell in online dating sites\n- Hilarious things Google thinks you're trying to search for"}
{"question":"Could you explain in detail how the fact section of a case brief should be structured and what specific categories of legally relevant information need to be included?","doc_text":"The SMART Goal-Setting Process\nOne of the most powerful methods of motivation is goal setting. The SMART method helps you set goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound. Management systems, such as management by objectives, incorporate goal-setting basics into the entire system.\nDr. Edwin Locke pioneered goal-setting research in the 1960s. Locke suggested that working toward a goal provided inherent motivation to reach that same goal. He also showed that employees are motivated by a combination of clear goals and specific, helpful, appropriate feedback. In 1990, Locke and Dr. Gary Latham published \u201cA Theory of Goal Setting and Task Performance,\u201d their seminal work, which reinforced the need for specific and difficult goals.\nYour objectives usually fall into one of four categories: process, impact, outcome and personal. Process objectives describe who will participate, their interactions and activities. Impact focuses on the longer-term impact of your work. The RapidBI website reports that outcome objectives \u201clet you know how you will change attitudes, knowledge and (short-term) behavior.\" Personal objectives are used to measure and compare individual performance.\nThe SMART criteria require goals to be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound. Specificity keeps your goals straightforward, well defined and detailed. Making measurable goals prevents ambiguous statements such as \u201cmake new contacts\u201d and replaces them with \u201ctalk to five new people each day.\u201d Make sure your goals are reachable, since impossible goals simply set you up for failure. According to RapidBI, realistic goals don\u2019t need to be easy--instead, they should be hard, but something toward which you are willing and able to work. Time-bound goals keep your work structured and add a sense of urgency to push you into action.\nSmartER goals rely on some additional criteria including extending, exciting, rewarding and recorded. The goal should extend your abilities to keep it from seeming boring and purposeless. Exciting goals are most likely to be accomplished since they create a greater desire to do the work. According to RapidBI, for a goal to be rewarding, you should know what it will mean to you and what your outcome will be upon completion. You should record your objective and progress to increase your chances of completing the goal.\nSteps for Businesses\nThe Management Skills Advisor website offers the following seven steps for successful SMART goal-setting in your business. First, explain what SMART goals are, including their purpose and the benefits."}

{"question":"who were first people interviewed monthly newsletter eso 2019","doc_text":"There are way too many people thinking, \u201cas long as we send out our newsletter regularly it will engage our audience\u201d; if only it were that easy\u2026.\nIf your nonprofit is serious about engaging your audience and getting them to donate or volunteer then you need to have a sound email marketing strategy to ensure your newsletter becomes a signal instead of noise.\nToday I am going to explain a strategy for your nonprofit organization that you need to follow. It almost guarantees that you will increase your open and click through rates and engage your supporters.\nFirst here are some statistics you need to be aware of:\n\u2022 Targeted emails drive 18 times more revenue than broadcast emails. Thanks Emma\n\u2022 Email list segmentation is considered the most important tactic used for email marketing\n\u2022 Segmented email campaigns have a 14.32% higher open rate than non-segmented campaigns. (Mailchimp, 2016)\n\u2022 And just so you know how you compare to the benchmark; in the nonprofit sector the average open rate is 24.98% and the average click through rate is 2.76%.\nThe good news?\nYou can implement this strategy for your newsletter\u2026. even if you have a small database of subscribers and use a free platform such as MailChimp\u2019s free plan.\nSo what is this email segmentation strategy all about?\nIn an ideal world we would only receive emails that were of interest to us. The sad truth about monthly newsletters is that they take a lot of time to create and are not engaging supporters like they used to.\nMost people suffer from an overflowing email inbox and simply do not have the time to read through a newsletter. In the nonprofit industry newsletters are mostly read by the employees of the nonprofit organization and not the target audience.\nThe solution? It is easy for a potential donor to just ignore a newsletter which has say five articles of which he has little interest. In this instance, a potential donation is lost. However, by sending targeted emails, the potential donor\u2019s time is saved, and interest is gained.\nBy targeted email I mean segmenting your mail list into various groups. For example you could divide your email base into:\n\u2022 Regular donors\n\u2022 Once-off donors\n\u2022 Potential supporters\n\u2022 People who have attended an event\nNow instead of sending 1 monthly newsletter with five articles to all of these readers, you send one relevant article to each group. By doing this it makes the newsletter more targeted and the readers only get information on what they are interested in."}
{"question":"advantages draining water pipes versus leaving faucets running winter vacation home","doc_text":"No Water Dispensing From Hot Side of Faucet? (Here's a Fix)\nWhether you\u2019re doing the dishes, taking a shower, or simply washing your hands, having hot water in your home is essential. If there\u2019s no hot water coming out of your faucet, you could be facing a major dilemma.\nThe main reason that water won\u2019t come out of the hot water tap is that the water heater is leaking. Hot water won\u2019t come out of your faucet if your pipes are frozen or if the diverter valve is stuck and damaged. Your faucet may not dispense hot water if you haven\u2019t flushed your water tank in over 3 years.\nWe\u2019re going to take a look at all of the different things that could be causing this issue. There are easy fixes to get hot water up and running again in your home. Let\u2019s dive into the factors that could be causing the disruption.\nCheck Every Faucet\nThe first thing you\u2019ll want to do is check all the faucets in your home to see if hot water will come out of any of them. Sometimes a single faucet can get clogged, causing a block in the flow of water.\nIf the water temperature is fine, the problem lies in your faucet itself. If it\u2019s a major problem, calling a plumber to get the job done for you may be the easiest solution.\nJust Getting Cold Water\nIf there\u2019s no hot water coming out of the designated side of the faucet, it could be your water heater. This is especially true if the cold side is working just fine. Water heaters malfunction for a number of different reasons.\nThere could be a leak, a sediment build-up, or it could\u2019ve just come unplugged. Flush the water heater, allow it to heat up, and try the faucet again. No worries, there are details on how to flush the water heater later on.\nLook for Frozen Pipes\nIf you live in a state that experiences brutal winters, you\u2019ll be well aware of what frozen pipes can do. They can stop water from flowing to all of the faucets in your home. If you\u2019re not getting hot or cold water or just lukewarm water, this could be the culprit.\nYou\u2019ll need to have the pipes thawed out before the water will start coming out of the faucet again. To unfreeze the pipes, you could use a hairdryer or a heat gun."}

The sleep disorder is characterized by frequent episodes of disrupted breathing during sleep.\nTheir golf performance was assessed before and after up to six months of a sleep apnea treatment called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which helps keep a person's airway open by providing a steady stream of air during sleep.\nThe therapy led to less daytime sleepiness and improved sleep-related quality of life. The men also had a significant 11 percent drop in their average golf handicap index, a formula used to estimate a player's skill level.\nAmong better golfers who had a handicap of 12 or less at the start of the study, the average handicap fell by almost 32 percent after CPAP treatment, according to the study, which was published in the Dec. 15 issue of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.\nThe men attributed their improved golf performance to factors such as improved concentration, endurance and decision making.\n\"With the cognitive enhancement afforded by successful treatment of their sleep apnea, they saw measurable improvement early and more significantly than those who were less skilled,\" Benton said in a journal news release.\nThe researchers said most avid golfers in the United States are men aged 40 to 70, which is a group with a high rate of sleep apnea.\n-- Robert Preidt\nSOURCE: Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, news release, Dec. 13, 2013"}
{"question":"I'm doing home repairs - what's the safest way to work high up?","doc_text":"The best way to repair any type of surface, whether a brick or a concrete slab, is with stucco. Although stucco can be difficult to work with if not applied correctly, it can be done for any kind of surface. With some level of DIY expertise, anyone can handle most minor stucco repairs, but it\u2019s wise to leave the more complex repairs to professional contractors as you might end up doing even more damage than good.\nWith so many different types of stucco products on the market, and so many companies claiming to offer \u201cthe best,\u201d how do you know which one you should buy? The first step is to consider the area that will need repairs, including what type of repairs are needed. For example, if your home has siding, then a specific type of stucco is probably not necessary. However, there are other types of stucco that are better suited to siding repairs.\nNext, you should determine the size and type of damage that needs to be repaired. If your home has extensive damage, it may not be possible for you to repair the entire surface yourself, so having a professional come out and inspect your home is probably in your best interest. In the case of damaged areas that cannot be fixed by hand, such as a cracked driveway or sidewalk, you should contact a stucco company that specializes in driveway repairs. A professional stucco company should also be able to recommend the best products for repairing damage caused by hail, tree limbs, or other objects. The company should be able to provide you with some suggestions for choosing the products to use for the repairs and should let you know if they do any repair jobs on a walk-in basis.\nOnce you know the extent of your stucco damage and have determined the types of repairs that are necessary, you will need to decide whether the damage is so extensive that it cannot be repaired. For instance, if your home has multiple layers of siding, you might have to replace the entire roof. While the roof is not usually the first thing to be replaced, it\u2019s still important to consider what it will cost to repair the other layers of the siding. If your home is completely destroyed by hail, then replacing the entire sections of the home might be the only option. It is wise to also check for leaks in the home, and make sure that you are aware of any problems before you start any repairs. to avoid problems later."}
{"question":"When it comes to ensuring safe driving, how do the recommended precautions differ between elderly drivers and teenage drivers?","doc_text":"You share the road with motorcyclists in Cleveland every day when you are driving in your car. If you are thinking about parking your car to ride your motorcycle to experience a bit of freedom and excitement, you may want to brush up on some safety tips first.\nMotorcycles may be a cool alternative to regular automobiles, but they are not as safe. For instance, they do not offer as much protection as most motor vehicles, and the stakes are much higher in accidents. Besides the risk of falls, motorcyclists are in danger of sustaining serious and life-threatening injuries in motorcycle accidents. You should always wear proper safety gear and follow all traffic laws and courtesies. Here are a few hazards that motorcyclists encounter every day on the roads that you should keep watch for:\n1. Inexperienced motorists\nNew drivers mean more driving errors. Because such drivers lack proper experience behind the wheel, they are likely to make crucial mistakes that make the roads more dangerous for others, especially bikers. Common errors that inexperienced motorists make that cause motorcycle accidents include failing to yield the right of way, not checking for motorcyclists when driving, changing lanes, making left-hand turns and traveling too closely behind motorcycles.\n2. Distracted and drunk\/intoxicated drivers\nDefensive driving is a must, especially when you are on a motorcycle. Distracted and intoxicated drivers are a danger to everyone, not just bikers. People who drink, use drugs and medications that cause impairment, text and other activities that impact driving behaviors often fail to identify potential hazards. This often results in them operating their vehicles recklessly, making it harder for bikers and motorists to safely anticipate and avoid dangers and situations that lead to avoidable accidents.\n3. Commercial vehicles\nBikers must pay extra attention when sharing the roads with commercial truck operators. Semis, trailers and other large trucks have blind spots that cars and SUVs do not have that make them extremely dangerous to motorcyclists. Keep in mind that if you are on your motorcycle around commercial trucks, drivers may not be able to see you.\nWith proper precautions and sufficient distance between your bike and other vehicles, it is possible for you to steer clear of the above dangers and remain accident- and injury-free."}

But, essentially, my work at Bonneville Environmental Foundation is under the business development umbrella. So, I interact with businesses and entities, such as governments, cities, counties, universities, and other nonprofits, who are interested in looking at their own impact, especially from a water carbon and energy perspective, and doing something about it.

From an energy perspective obviously there\u2019s efficiencies and conserving energy. But at the end of the day, most businesses, I don\u2019t know any business that doesn\u2019t have any footprint at all, there is some effect.

Theor Appl Genet (2005) 110: 1011. doi:10.1007\/s00122-004-1916-1\n- 121 Downloads\nAn restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based genetic map of ryegrass (Lolium) was constructed for comparative mapping with other Poaceae species using heterologous anchor probes. The genetic map contained 120 RFLP markers from cDNA clones of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), and rice (Oryza sativa L.), covering 664 cM on seven linkage groups (LGs). The genome comparisons of ryegrass relative to the Triticeae, oat, and rice extended the syntenic relationships among the species. Seven ryegrass linkage groups were represented by 10 syntenic segments of Triticeae chromosomes, 12 syntenic segments of oat chromosomes, or 16 syntenic segments of rice chromosomes, suggesting that the ryegrass genome has a high degree of genome conservation relative to the Triticeae, oat, and rice. Furthermore, we found ten large-scale chromosomal rearrangements that characterize the ryegrass genome. In detail, a chromosomal rearrangement was observed on ryegrass LG4 relative to the Triticeae, four rearrangements on ryegrass LGs2, 4, 5, and 6 relative to oat, and five rearrangements on ryegrass LGs1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 relative to rice. Of these, seven chromosomal rearrangements are reported for the first time in this study. The extended comparative relationships reported in this study facilitate the transfer of genetic knowledge from well-studied major cereal crops to ryegrass."}

{"question":"why earth domes good for growing plants","doc_text":"- If you are using cups it\u2019s a good idea to plant three to four seeds per cup, and at least two per cell in the seed trays. This will insure that something comes up in each cup or cell. Don\u2019t forget to write on each cup what you planted in it, or mark your row of cells in the seed starting tray with popsicle sticks. Do this for each type of plant you will be growing.\n- Place your cups into the sheet pan, or any kind of container with a short lip on it that will hold water. Make sure your seed starting trays come with a bottom that holds water, most do. Some come with domes too but I don\u2019t think these are necessary.\n- Ok it is critically important to keep the soil moist. When you get up in the morning spray the top of the soil. Do this again in the evening or whenever you notice the surface of the soil is dry. But minimally twice a day. You must be consistent about this. After the seeds sprout and become established you can start watering from the bottom. Just pour some water into the tray and you will be watering all the cups at the same time. not to much though you don\u2019t want to over do it. As they get bigger more water will be required.\n- After the seedlings reach about three inches tall you will need to decide what plant in that cup or cell is the strongest. Using a pair of scissors cut the other seedlings off about 1\/4\u2033 above the soil or pinch them off with your finger nails. Be careful not to injure the one you want to keep. You do not want to pull the ones you are culling out, this could damage the strong plants roots.\n- Now I suggest using cups right from the start because at some point if you are growing in a seed tray with small cells \u201clets say a Tomato plant\u201d it\u2019s roots are going to fill out the cell. If you don\u2019t transplant it into a larger container like a plastic cup it will become root bound this will stunt the further growth of the plant. So I just start right out in the larger cups. By the time they are in danger of becoming root bound, it\u2019s time to plant them outside anyway.\n- How to harden off your plants. About a week before it\u2019s time to transplant out in the garden you have to harden your plants off."}

{"question":"maximum precision machined springs versus wire","doc_text":"Contact us today:\nExact Metrology, a comprehensive 3D metrology service provider and hardware sales company, is excited to announce that a large scale Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) has been installed at their office location in Moline, Illinois.\nThis machine is a high-accuracy CNC coordinate measuring machine that guarantees a maximum permissible error of E0, MPE = (2.5+3L\/1000)\u03bcm. With this machine, measurement uncertainty remains within one-fifth of the dimension tolerance up to 30.2\u201d (766mm). The higher accuracy specification therefore gives it more than double the effective measuring range in terms of accuracy-guarantee capability.\nIn addition, the room the machine sits in is temperature controlled. From sensors installed on each axis scale and working in conjunction with sensors placed on the workpiece, temperatures are obtained before outputting the measurement result to the controller. The combined axis scale\/workpiece temperature compensation design used gives superior results compared to systems with sensors only on the axis scales.\nThis CMM offers a maximum drive speed of 693 mm\/s and a maximum drive acceleration of 1,732 mm\/s2 resulting in an increase of drive distance in one second. Combining high speed and high acceleration, this machine reduces measuring time. As the number of measuring points increases, measuring costs per point are reduced.\nIt will be used by Exact Metrology for precision machined parts and has a measuring volume of 47 inches by 78 inches. Components, parts and finished durable products that are designed to maintain extreme tight tolerance margins, as well as a high degree of durability are essential and common drivers for the use of precision machining. Precision machined parts typically have intricate features and need precise specifications and measurements. Additionally, many of these parts have holes, grooves, tapers, and\/or textures that require an exact fit into other components. Precision machining is used in numerous applications such as: aerospace, medical device components, electronics, oil and gas, etc. CMMs don\u2019t need the \u201cold school\u201d method of calipers, measuring tapes, and\/or rulers.\nCommenting on this new arrival, Exact Metrology co-President, Dean Solberg, said, \u201cWe\u2019re very happy to install this machine and we\u2019ve even heightened our ceilings and reinforced our floors to make sure it fits inside our facility."}
{"question":"mazda rx7 first version power specs","doc_text":"The 2017 Mazda 6 car is yet another release that has been announced by the Mazda company which is going to be released quite soon. The model is going to offered perhaps next year and is among the vehicle which have been getting an update coming out of the production line of Mazda. Mazda has also been on a tear as they have been providing cars left and right ever since the year started and have a number of new releases already lined up. But what the 2017 Mazda 6 has that other new releases do not is the added power and the quite strong output this vehicle has.\nOther vehicles that Mazda is going to produce this year do not have a great output and are solid cars which are basically measured because of its value for money equation. This is perhaps the only vehicle that promises to offer some very high performance specs and also some very premier driving ability.\nThe vehicle is getting a slew of changes that are going to make it much better and quite handsome. The vehicle is going to become quite a looker and it is all thanks to the recognizable language design that Mazda is giving to all of its future model. Mix the performance and great design together and we are getting a very nice concept and a very good update for the 2017 Mazda 6. You can read all about it in our review which is going to help you get a better understanding what the latest release brings. Also check out the positional release date and the price ranges as well.\n2017 Mazda 6 design\nThe 2017 Mazda 6 actually looks pretty amazing on the outside. Because of its great KODO design that Mazda uses for all of its vehicles, the vehicle has an absolutely cool looking design which is going to be one of its man advantages. All of the vehicles coming out of the Mazda lineup are actually incorporating this type of a design language and is what makes them unique and very handsome-looking.\nThe changes compared to the previous model include a much more angular grille to the front of the car which makes it look a little bit meaner than before. There is a huge bumper front bumper which combines with the already great looking front part of the car making it very interesting and much appreciative for the fans. The wheel arches are also great looking and are more muscular now. Compared to the sedan version, the coupe one has a more sporty look to it which is going to get much more attention than the previous model ever did."}

The Eels just couldn't get any decent amount of ball at any point throughout the match, with possession flow sitting at over 60% to the Cowboys for the majority of the game.\nThe Cowboys impressive victory was built on the back of a dominant performance from their giant forward pack with Australia and New South Wales hopeful James Tamou finishing the match with over 170 run metres, closely followed by a strong performance from second rower Jason Taumalolo who ended the match with over 140 run metres.\nIt took only 5 minutes for the Cowboys to open up their account for the night with Johnathan Thurston chasing through on a Michael Morgan grubber to get the night's first try. Two more Cowboys tries followed in quick succession with Matthew Scott and Curtis Rona both adding their own tries within the 20 minute mark.\nAmazingly, despite hardly having any ball, the Eels were able to get within four points of the Cowboys at halftime.

{"question":"which body parts does osteoarthritis affect most","doc_text":"In the first year or so of latent syphilis you can still pass the infection on. After this time, you are no longer infectious to others but you still have syphilis infection. If left untreated, the germs can slowly damage various parts of your body and symptoms of the final (tertiary) stage may eventually appear.\nTertiary syphilis can develop many years after the initial syphilis infection. Some manifestations of the disease can occur up to 50 years later. Many of these complications are potentially very serious and can make you extremely unwell. Some problems are life-threatening and can lead to death if untreated.\nSyphilis is not considered to be infectious in its tertiary stage. Tertiary complications are slowly progressive and can affect any organ of your body.\nTertiary syphilis may cause several types of complications:\n- Brain (neurological) complications. This is also called neurosyphilis (see next section).\n- Cardiovascular complications. These are problems affecting your heart and blood vessels (the cardiovascular system). Most commonly, syphilis affects the main blood vessel leading out of your heart (the aorta). Inflammation here can cause weakening of your aorta, which can stretch, forming an aneurysm. Aneurysms have thin weak walls and can burst (rupture), potentially leading to death. Even if an aneurysm does not rupture, it can seriously affect one of your heart valves (the aortic valve), leading to a heart murmur. In turn, the heart does not pump very well and becomes swollen (distended) with blood. This condition is known as heart failure. See separate leaflets called Heart Failure and The Heart and Blood Vessels for more details.\n- Gummatous disease. Gummas are soft growths (tumours) caused by inflammation. They are not cancerous (malignant) tumours but are long-term (chronic) and can affect any part of the body. They can grow on your skeleton and affect your joints; they can also cause large lumps in or under the skin. Gummas can grow on your internal organs (such as your liver) and affect organ function. Quite commonly they appear on your leg, below your knee. Gummas may be single or multiple and can vary in size between one and several centimetres."}
{"question":"When did spiders first appear in the fossil record?","doc_text":"Evolution breaks Darwin\u2019s own slow, gradual process maxim\nThis next item is included not because it is science, but because it demonstrates that not only does evolution not follow the laws of science it doesn\u2019t even follow its own laws. Punctuated Equilibrium is an update to evolutionary theory proposed in 1972 by noted paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould. It was proposed because evolutionists realized the fossil record does not conform to Darwin\u2019s theory of slow, gradual change of species. As Wikipedia explains it, the fossil record of an evolutionary progression:\n\u201c\u2026typically consists of species that suddenly appear, and ultimately disappear, in many cases close to a million years later, without any change in external appearance.\u201d\nEldredge and Gould were among the evolutionists who realized the evidence simply doesn\u2019t fit Darwin\u2019s theory, and instead of discarding the theory, changed it to allow what Darwin said was forbidden: saltations \u2013 or jumps in the fossil record. But as evolution evangelist Richard Dawkins acknowledges:\n\u201cWithout Gradualness.. we are back to a miracle.\u201d\nEvolutionists like to pretend they believe in Darwin\u2019s theory of slow and gradual change, but the fact that punctuated equilibrium was even proposed shows that 1.) The fossil record doesn\u2019t support Darwin\u2019s theory, and 2.) Evolutionists have conceded that slow gradual processes simply cannot do what they claim they can, and that in fact the only solution is something that can produce saltations \u2013 jumps. But jumps require the intervention of an agent outside of the material world; something that can intelligently manipulate natural processes to do what slow and steady processes can\u2019t \u2013 to do what Dawkins correctly characterized as \u201ca miracle.\u201d\nThis is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all the laws of science broken by evolutionary theory, but merely one sufficient to show that that Darwinian evolution does in fact break many laws of science and in fact breaks its own scientific requirements and therefore is rightfully characterized as a pseudoscience. Marine biologist Robert Carter summarizes it succinctly:\n\u201cEverything we know about the laws of chemistry, genetics, statistics and information theory argues against any life from non-life idea. But an evolutionist must believe that scientific laws are violated for life to arise from none living chemicals. That sounds like faith to me.\u201d\nSo you can legitimately call evolution pseudoscience, or you could call it religion."}

{"question":"whitey lockman babe ruth baseball career difference","doc_text":"|# 80 Babe Ruth|\nThe 1933 World Wide Gum baseball cards were printed in two different variations: English only and French and English. Today, the French and English versions are slightly more expensive than the English only cards. The Goudey Gum Company was located in Boston, so at their peak of gum card manufacturing, they opened a factory in Granby, Quebec.

{"question":"who commissioned lee friedlander photographs computing 1980s","doc_text":"\u201cCrane\u2019s goal,\u201d Rohrbach believes, \u201chas been to critique our subservience to photographic realism and to suggest that we have fallen into a bad habit of giving undue preference to that part of photography\u2019s magical language.\u201d Writing specifically of Crane\u2019s nude studies, Rohrbach writes that \u201c[e]ach body almost dissolves, becoming a sinuous river flowing across a snowy landscape.\u201d The gentle lyricism and natural sense of flow of Crane\u2019s nudes departs drastically from Weston\u2019s almost sculptural, static nudes. Such works beautifully capture the philosophical difference between Crane\u2019s \u201cchallenging vision\u201d and the vision of her contemporaries. Crane achieves what Rohrbach calls an \u201cunnerving disconnect\u201d that breaks old associations and forces us to reconnect with what we see before us.\nCrane jumps from subject to subject throughout her career, always seeking something new to cast askew and make new. In a series of collaged photographs involving neon lights, Crane \u201cjuxtapos[es] neon lights over faces like ceremonial urban masks,\u201d writes Foerstner in her essay, \u201cOn the Path to the Perfect Photograph.\u201d In Neon Cowboy (above, from 1969), Crane superimposes a grid of neon cowboy signs over a series of male nudes. Rohrbach connects Crane\u2019s use of series to the influence of John Cage\u2019s music celebrating the artistic potential of chance. Although the neon sign does not move, the male model beneath does, sometimes wearing the neon like a mask and sometimes pulling away, revealing the hollow \u201cmask-ness\u201d of the sign. Rohrbach also makes a fascinating connection between Crane and the philosopher- semiotician Roland Barthes. Contrasting Crane with Lee Friedlander, who sees photography as seeing rather than making, Rohrbach calls Crane \u201ca linguist at heart, in love with photographs as signs rather than signifiers.\u201d Such philosophical depth adds a whole new dimension to what seem to be Crane\u2019s simple pictures of people, buildings, neon signs, etc. \u201cCrane taps the everyday world for the tumultuous undercurrents of unifying themes: chance, accident, chaos, contradiction and mystery playing out before our eyes,\u201d Foerstner concurs.\nAfter years of photographing the urban landscape and its inhabitants, Crane went \u201cback to nature\u201d in the 1990s with her Coloma to Covert series."}
{"question":"I'm doing research for my college assignment and was wondering what's the main difference between how old school scientists and modern researchers think about their own influence on what they study?","doc_text":"Since at least the end of World War II, the United States has arguably been the major center for advanced research in science and technology. This has been possible, at least in part, because many of the best and brightest students and scholars have come to study or carry out research at our world-class research universities and in our centers of industry.\nOne wonders, however, how much longer the United States will enjoy this primacy if our government continues to place ideology above scientific results, both in public policy initiatives and in support of fundamental research.\nConcern about government distortion of scientific results has been growing among scientists over the past six years. In February 2004, for example, 60 prominent American scientists, among which I was privileged to count myself, voiced their concern over the misuses of science by the current Bush administration \u2014 including the manipulation of public access to information resulting from scientific studies, disbanding scientific advisory committees, placing unqualified individuals on these committees, and suppressing or altering reports by government scientists. Since that time, more than 9,000 additional scientists have signed on to this call for scientific integrity in government.\nAttempts to distort science have not been limited to the federal government. In numerous states, including my own, Ohio, state school boards have attempted to alter the teaching of high school science to give students the impression that various bedrocks of modern science, including evolutionary biology, are somehow \u201csuspect.\u201d Via a disingenuous campaign called \u201cTeach the Controversy,\u201d various groups that oppose the teaching of evolution on religious grounds have helped to convince many among the public that evolution is not on firm scientific ground \u2014 in spite of the fact that almost all of modern biology is based on the predictions of evolution, which have successfully confronted experiment and observation for more than 100 years.\nOne might argue that distorting evolutionary biology for some high school students will not impede the education of our country\u2019s very brightest students, those who may go on to become tomorrow\u2019s scientific stars. In at least one area, however, government interference has already begun to put prominent researchers in this country at a disadvantage: stem-cell research.\nBecause of government restrictions on the use of embryonic stem cells, American researchers are forced to either seek private funding for their work or go abroad. There has already been a minor exodus of such researchers to places like the United Kingdom and Singapore, where there is active support for this important area of biomedical research."}

{"question":"As a chemistry researcher studying both dental health and ionic compounds, I'm curious about fluoride's dual nature - how does it function in dental treatments, and what chemical properties make it dangerous in high doses?","doc_text":"What cosmetic dentistry procedures will give me the best-looking smile?\nAt The Dental Studio in Flower Mound, Texas, Dr. Yasi Sabour is approached by her patients regularly about the smile makeover process. Individuals with imperfections of the smile or extensive tooth loss or damage may want to talk to a professional about how they can restore the smile for proper function and health. In situations like this, Dr. Sabour may consult with patients about the advantages of cosmetic dentistry and how the smile can be improved.\nWhat is cosmetic dentistry?\nCosmetic dentistry refers to any dental treatments used to enhance the smile, and they may be used in helping patients achieve a full smile makeover. A smile makeover may be referred to as \u201cfull mouth rehabilitation\u201d or \u201cfull smile restoration.\u201d Regardless of the name, the goal is the same: repair the smile\u2019s appearance, function, and overall health. This customized plan is designed to get you the best-looking smile with high-quality cosmetic and restorative dentistry treatments to help you smile again with confidence!\nWhat cosmetic treatments might be included in a patient\u2019s smile makeover?\nBecause Dr. Sabour customizes cosmetic dentistry solutions to a patient\u2019s unique needs, no two smile makeover plans are the same. However, here are a few of the more commonly integrated procedures that can be part of one\u2019s course of treatment:\n- Professional teeth whitening. For some patients, teeth whitening is the first step and can often effectively address a dull or discolored smile. We offer professional-strength options that provide better results than kits available over the counter.\n- Dental crowns. Crowns are caps made of porcelain that are fabricated for the patient to match their existing teeth. This allows the crown to be placed over a tooth to protect and seal it while blending in with the smile.\n- Dental composite. Certain imperfections can be addressed quickly and easily in the office with dental composite, a unique resin material that can repair chipped, cracked, or gapped teeth (for mild imperfections with not bite issues involved).\n- Porcelain veneers. Another way to cover imperfect teeth is with porcelain veneers, which are thin porcelain dental prostheses made from a strong and durable material that looks just like natural tooth enamel. These restorations are often used on the teeth near the front of the smile, referred to as the \u201canterior teeth.\u201d\nHow do I learn more?"}

Playing ska music in the pre-reggae days, the Wailers had early hits including 1964\u2019s \u201cSimmer Down.\u201d Wailer tended to sing harmonies to Marley\u2019s and Tosh\u2019s lead vocals, though he wrote and sang lead on songs including \u201cDreamland.\u201d The Wailers played a central role in popularizing ska and, later, reggae to an international audience, with later hits including \u201cStir it Up,\u201d \u201cGet Up, Stand Up, and \u201cI Shot the Sheriff.\u201d But as their fame grew, Marley was placed more in the forefront of the group.

Marley and Tosh both contributed backing vocals and played on the record, as Wailer sang backup on Tosh\u2019s \u201cLegalize It\u201d that same year. As his solo career developed, Wailer branched out into other styles including dancehall and disco over the course of more than two dozen albums.

{"question":"I'm fascinated by coffee processing methods - what's unique about the honey processing technique used in places like Costa Rica?","doc_text":"In the selection process the percentage of floating cherries is reduced and plants with better and more uniformed height, yield, ripeness and quality are separated.\nFrom the evaluation performed in the Perez Zeledon region ( Southern Costa Rica) it is noticed that this varietal present a slower coffee cherry ripeness process, and since this characteristic is of great importance for the coffee cultivation in this region, a special emphasis is given to the development and evaluation of this varietal. Thus, in the year 2010, the varietal was released for the benefit of Costa Rica coffee farmers looking for late harvest varietals to avoid early rains during the harvest season and maintain the Caturra arabica high quality in the cup.\nEvaluations performed measuring growth, yield, and quality in the cup, coffee cherries ripening process and resistance to fungus and pests, The Venecia varietal present the following characteristics:\na. High quality in the cup.\nb. Big coffee bean size ( bigger that its Caturra Parent ) and yield similar to Caturra varietal.\nc. Late harvest: Coffee cherries ripe late in the coffee harvest season.\nd. Compact size of the coffee plant that favors harvesting\nThe harvest of the Venecia Varietal in the regions where it was evaluated was similar to the Caturra Varietal. It can be clasified as a varietal of medium yield.\nRegarding coffee cherry size variables and coffee bean after processing. The Venecia varietal presents bigger coffee cherry size and same or higher yield after mill processing. Coffee beans have a higher size in the 17\/64 filter, compared to the Caturra Varietal.\nSame results were obtained withe the peaberry coffee bean.\nThis Venecia varietal presents a high quality coffee cup. In several cupping events during the selection process, the quality in the cup was same or higher than the comparable Caturra and Catuai Varietals. It is more Aromatic, has more body, higher acidity, less bitterness, and overall, it was selected the best among the three varietals by selected institute cuppers.\nBecause of this varietal is of late harvest, it is recommended in micro climates where rain may interfere with optimal harvest. Besides the higher quality in the bean, the Venecia coffee Varietal allows to decrease the lost in coffee cherries due to rainfall, thus farm labor use and farm infrastructure is optimized."}

{"question":"Which organizations and funding sources are supporting the Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change project that is helping safeguard the coasts of the Cook Islands?","doc_text":"WASHINGTON, D.C.\u2014A group of scientists, policymakers, and regional leaders unveiled a new report today about national and regional preparations for adapting to a changing climate. The report, based on the National Climate Adaptation Summit, was presented to President Obama\u2019s science and technology advisor, John Holdren, at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Washington, D.C.\nThe report concludes that the United States must adapt to a changing climate now and prepare for increasing impacts on urban infrastructure, food, water, human health, and ecosystems in the coming decades. It urges local, regional, and federal decision makers to develop and coordinate climate change adaptation measures across these scales of government and with the private sector. Measures that increase resilience to climate change can include changes in technology, management practices, or institutions.\nThe report also states that proactive adaptation planning can help minimize negative impacts of climate change on our nation\u2019s communities, businesses, ecosystems, and citizens. The federal government must help set priorities and share information about relevant programs and best practices, according to the report.\nThe National Climate Adaptation Summit was convened by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in May 2010 as a result of a conversation between Holdren and the UCAR Board of Trustees.\nRelative sea level changes on U.S. coastlines, 1958 to 2008. These observed changes, measured over the last 50 years, show increases all along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, including several areas with an increase of greater than 8 inches during that time. A smaller area of coast in the Pacific Northwest has decreased by a similar amount. Sea level is not uniform across the globe, and changes are also not uniform. (Image courtesy Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States, U.S. Global Change Research Program.)\nThe report identifies seven priorities for near-term action:\nDeveloping an overarching national strategy to guide federal climate change adaptation programs. This strategy should establish agency roles, clear goals and metrics, and better mechanisms for coordinating federal and non-federal activities.\nImproving coordination of federal plans and programs. Strong management from the executive branch is needed to break down barriers, integrate planning, move funding into the highest priority areas, and maintain priorities across the multitude of involved agencies.\nCreating a federal climate information portal. This would provide single-point access to data from all relevant federal agencies and programs and would evolve over time into a more \u201cnational\u201d portal with information about relevant non-federal efforts."}

What could be better than seeing lots of beautiful quilts from all around the world and hearing the stories behind them, with the bonus of finding new bloggy friends.\nToday I'm sharing my version of a pattern by Chris Jurd called Mariner's Garden.\nThe paper pieced center is a scrap attack of blues and greens. I didn't have an overall plan when choosing my colours. I had a lot of blues and greens so figured that was a good start. When it came to choosing a background I thought I'd use orange or yellow, something sunny and bright, but when trying those options they just fell flat, but the purple really made the center pop.\nThe flowers in the setting triangles were my first attempt at applique and far from perfect, but I'm okay with that.

{"question":"Why do birds fly high up in the evening?","doc_text":"Protofeathers are in no way similar to feathers and are probably just frayed collagen fibers that originated from within the skin, not feathers from follicles outside the skin. Scientists have never observed scales turning into follicles that could produce feathers.\n8. Preening Gland\nBirds have a uropygial gland, or preen gland, at the base of their spine that secretes an oil. Birds turn their heads 180 degrees and use their beak to rub the preen oil on their feathers. Without this lubrication the feathers on birds wings can not operate properly. Dinosaurs do not have a uropygial gland. Scientists have never observed an animal evolve a preen gland and the ability to turn their heads 180 degrees to access the bottom of their spine at the same time.\n9. Modern Fossil Birds\nFor dinosaurs to have evolved into birds it would require dinosaurs to be around first but we find fossils of modern birds in layers before their supposed dinosaur ancestors. Confuciusornis feducciai and Confuciusornis sanctus are some examples of modern birds found in the Early Cretaceous period. Feathered bird fossils like Jinfengopteryx and Archaeopteryx are also found in Jurassic rock layers.\nThe fossil Archaeopteryx is considered by some to be a transitional fossil between reptiles and birds because of it has teeth and claws; however, now Archaeopteryx is considered to be a flightless perching bird. Other birds are known to have claws such as the ostrich and the hoatzin when it is young. Also the Hesperornis birds have been found that contain teeth.\nSo did dinosaurs evolve into birds?\nNO. Birds came first, then dinosaurs were created.\nAnd God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven... And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\nAnd God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so... And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."}
{"question":"working voice actor benefits creative freedom risks equipment damage","doc_text":"Overall, upgrading your processor can be a cost-effective way to improve the performance of your computer without having to purchase a new system. It can save you money in the short term and extend the lifespan of your current system, making it a better value in the long run.\nWhat are the risks of upgrading a processor?\nDamage to the computer\nUpgrading a processor in a computer can be a complex task that requires technical expertise. One of the main risks associated with upgrading a processor is the potential for damage to the computer. Improper installation can damage the processor or motherboard, which can result in costly repairs or even a complete system failure.\nAdditionally, electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage components and cause malfunctions. ESD is a static electricity charge that can build up on your body, and it can be discharged when you touch a metal object, such as a computer component. To prevent ESD damage, it is important to follow proper grounding procedures and use anti-static wrist straps when working with computer components.\nIn some cases, upgrading a processor may also require the replacement of other components, such as the cooling system, to ensure proper functionality. If these components are not installed correctly, it can lead to overheating and other issues that can damage the computer.\nIt is important to note that upgrading a processor can be a risky process, and it is recommended that only experienced computer technicians attempt it. If you are not comfortable with the installation process, it is best to seek professional assistance to avoid any potential damage to your computer.\nLoss of warranty\nUpgrading a processor may result in the loss of warranty on the computer. This means that if there are any issues with the computer after the upgrade, the manufacturer may not provide repairs or support. This can be a significant risk for those who rely on their computer for work or other important tasks.\nIt is important to note that the loss of warranty may not be the only risk associated with upgrading a processor. There may also be compatibility issues with other components of the computer, and the upgrade may not provide the desired performance boost. It is essential to research and carefully consider the potential risks and benefits before making the decision to upgrade a processor.\nWhen upgrading a processor, one of the main risks is compatibility issues. These issues can arise when the new processor is not compatible with certain motherboards or other components in the computer. This can prevent the computer from working properly and can result in a significant loss of productivity."}

{"question":"I'm doing research on hereditary cancer patterns. What makes some families more susceptible to ovarian cancer, and how does this affect their recommended screening approach?","doc_text":"An estimated 1-3% of cases of stomach cancer are caused by inherited syndromes. Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is an inherited cancer syndrome that leads to an increased risk for both diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. Patients who inherit the genetic mutation for HDGC are at high risk for developing stomach cancer at a young age.\nHistory of HDGC\nIn 1964, stomach cancer was noted in a Maori tribal family in New Zealand, following an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. CDH1 gene mutations were first described in patients from three Maori families in 1998. At this time, the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC) was formed, and the name \u201cHereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer\u201d was introduced. Families with multiple cases of diffuse gastric cancer, lobular breast cancer, or both may be affected by hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome.\nDiffuse Gastric Cancer\nHDGC leads to a cancer called diffuse-type, signet ring cell gastric adenocarcinoma. These signet ring cells appear as isolated cells or in small clusters in the lining of the stomach. Unfortunately, the diffuse type of gastric cancer associated with HDGC is difficult to diagnose because the cancer is not visible on upper endoscopy (looking into the stomach with a small camera). For this reason, most cases of diffuse gastric cancer are diagnosed at late stages (III or IV), and associated with a lower survival rate.\nLobular Breast Cancer\nWomen from HDGC families should be followed by oncologists or breast surgeons and have clinical breast exams regularly. Screening with yearly breast MRI, which can be combined with mammograms, is recommended starting at age 30. There is a possible role for preventive hormone-blocking medications to reduce the risk of lobular breast cancer in CDH1 mutation carriers. If there are many cases of breast cancer in the family, prophylactic mastectomy may also be considered, but mastectomy is not routinely recommended.\nFuture of HDGC\nResearch on the genetics, diagnosis, and treatment of HDGC is ongoing. Centers of Excellence have been established worldwide and experts from the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium continue to work together to develop new guidelines and recommendations for patients and families affected by HDGC.\nFord JM.

{"question":"Which approach emphasizes support resources more - ABA or online education?","doc_text":"To achieve the goals of this Plan, the College will build on its strengths, including a vibrant and committed faculty who offer students an individualized education; competitive and internationally recognized programs in Dance and Theatre Arts that attract students because of their quality programs and the liberal arts-based education provided at MMC; and our central Manhattan location, which makes the College particularly attractive to students in general, but especially in fields such as the performing arts, visual and media arts, media, business, and international studies, and provides unparalleled internship possibilities.\nMarymount Manhattan remains committed to the liberal arts as an essential foundation of an undergraduate education. Our liberal arts sensibility relies on our traditions, encourages exploration, and emphasizes connected learning. The programs we offer provide students with pathways for discovery about themselves and the world around them. The integrative nature of our approach is evident in the recently redesigned General Education curriculum and in our support of students\u2019 pursuit of double-majors and minors. The College encourages faculty and students to cross disciplines in building their course of teaching and study. Opportunities that allow unexpected yet transformational connections across disciplines distinguish Marymount Manhattan from other institutions. Our integrated and experiential approach to a liberal arts education leads us to new frontiers of knowledge.\nThis plan indicates how, over the next five years, the College will firmly articulate its identity, strengthen its academic offerings, make its administration more efficient, utilize its technology resources more effectively, and promote itself more vigorously. It will guide the allocation and re-allocation of resources that occurs in the annual budgeting process over these years.\nArticulating our Identity\nThe Plan was guided by discussions within the Strategic Planning Committee and among the faculty and the larger community, and reinforced by the report of our consultants, AKA \/ Strategies. It proposes that the College recognize that it is an institution with a tri-partite identity, i.e., as a college of the performing, visual and media, and liberal arts. Marymount Manhattan\u2019s strength draws from the interrelationships between and among these areas.\nMany faculty members cross the boundaries of these three branches, as do our students: e.g., the double major in Communication Arts and Business who interns at the White House; the Psychology major who is now a highly successful fashion designer; the International Studies alumna who has performed with her band on Saturday Night Live; the Dance alumna who is now a corporate lawyer and another who is in medical school."}

{"question":"Which blocks noise better, suspended or acoustic ceilings?","doc_text":"We have already discussed how to address flanking noise through floors and ceiling\nThe problem with cavity walls is it is not only the cavity allowing the free passage of noise around the party wall but the internal masonry skin is often of low density blocks. In the early days these would be known as \u201cbreeze\u201d blocks but in more recent years they have been replaced with even lower density blocks called \u201cThermalite\u201d blocks. The Thermalite blocks are more efficient at allowing noise to be transmitted through them into adjoining rooms and are a particular problem with flats when flanking noise travels up and down through these blocks into flats above and below but the soundproofing of flats is an issue I will discuss in a later article. The best way to soundproof these walls to reduce flanking noise transmission is to install a 50mm M20AD solution but can be expensive so should only be installed in extreme cases where the flanking noise is more of a nuisance. If you still want to look at the M20AD solution to reduce flanking noise through a wall go to our web page via the following link M20AD To soundproof a wall.\nAnd back to the cavities within the walls and the best way to treat these is to have blown mineral wool installed that will have the advantage of giving additional thermal insulation. Other types of thermal insulation such as injected foam or polystyrene will not be as efficient at absorbing the noise and could actually compound the problem making the noise being heard even clearer.\nMore information on how to soundproof a party wall can be found on our web page via this link soundproof a party wall.\nThis article explains how flanking noise uses the cavities and lightweight masonry of walls to gain access. More about how to soundproof a party wall will be published in the near future. If you want to see how we can help soundproof a room or garage, go to our web site via this link. Soundproof a garage.\nFor more information on soundproofing products for walls go to our web site or call us on 01993704981.\nThere is a common misconception concerning acoustic underlays and what is required of them. Most people want an acoustic underlay to reduce airborne noise such as speech and music being heard through a floor.

The plan for locks and gates for letting out the freshet in a proper manner was left for the present to be devised in due time if found necessary. William Doster, renamed the island \"Wampanoag Island\" in and built steps from the New Street Bridge directly to the island. The privately funded canal became part of the Pennsylvania Canal system, a complex of canals, towpaths and eventually railroads.

These gentlemen selected this location for the reason that the great iron and limestone beds of Lehigh County were in the immediate neighborhood; and, as the Lehigh Canal passed directly through the grounds, it would afford them the necessary water-power to drive their machinery they have now discarded water-power entirelyand could supply them with coal direct from the mines, as well as convey their products to market.

{"question":"Which creates more environmental problems: modern soil sensors or Third Revolution farming?","doc_text":"Today, we think it will be easier to colonize Mars than control our own exploding population. That\u2019s how intractable our population problem has become. Of course, you knew this already, and there\u2019s nothing newsworthy about it, but it says something about how we, as civilized people, do things. Overpopulation stresses social cohesion and brings out the worst in people, but overpopulation takes it\u2019s biggest toll on the environment. Which brings us to\u2026\nFact #2, The Environmental Crisis Even if you live under a rock, you\u2019ve heard of this. Al Gore has a new movie about it. Thanks to the endless \u201cawareness raising\u201d efforts of myriad environmental organizations, pretty much everyone knows that \u201cthe environment\u201d needs help. Everyone knows about global warming, even if they deny it. Not everyone knows that we\u2019ve lost half of the world\u2019s biodiversity since 1970, and that species are going extinct at a rate of 100 to 150 every day. Not everyone knows that this is the highest rate of extinction in geological history, since the Cretaceous Extinction Event that wiped out the dinosaurs more than sixty million years ago. You know about the environmental crisis, but the truth about it is even worse than you know.\nNot coincidentally, the Environmental Crisis also began about 10,000 years ago, with the advent of the farming lifestyle in the Middle East, considered to be the birth of modern civilization. Early farmers deforested huge swaths of land in the Middle East to grow wheat and barley, which quickly exhausted the fertility of the thin soil. They then abandoned the fallow, depleted land to erosion and continued to slash and burn their way through abundant forest rich with fish and game. That\u2019s how they turned \u201cThe Fertile Crescent\u201d into the Sahara Desert.\nNow ask yourself, \u201cWhy did the people who founded our culture, and gave birth to Civilization, burn millions of acres of wild, abundant forests, unleashing plague after plague of pests, to grow wheat and barley, thousands of years before the invention of bread?\u201d What do you think they did with all of that barley and wheat? They made beer out of it. Beer! Which brings us to the third fact you already know about.\nFact # 3, Alcoholism Alcoholism is a debilitating disease that destroys the life of the alcoholic, and creates dysfunction within the alcoholic\u2019s family."}
{"question":"Which dessert is traditionally eaten during Chinese New Year and Epiphany?","doc_text":"Drinks \/ Dessert\n16. Coconut Ice cream\nMade from Thailand\u2019s favorite ingredient coconut milk, this creamy, icy confection is best eaten on a hot day at Chatuchak. There are many vendors around Chatuchak which serve this, with a variety of toppings like sticky rice, corn, and crispy mung beans.\n17. Mango Sticky Rice (Khao Niao Mamuang)\nMango Sticky Rice is a signature Thai dessert. We heard Platinum food court sells a kick ass one. Best eaten drizzled with coconut cream on top.\n18. Belgian Waffle\nCan be found at several BTS stations, we got ours at Platinum food court. Fresh off the griddle, the waffles are soft on the inside and slightly crisp on the outside encasing a generous amount of fillings. It\u2019s so good (and cheap!!) that I\u2019ve heard people pack these back to Singapore in large boxes.\n19. Red Ruby (Tub Tim Krob)\nBest eaten after a hot and spicy meal, this sweet and refreshing dessert is also found at street food stalls. The red rubies are actually crunchy water chestnut pieces and can be eaten with a variety of other ingredients like sweet potato pieces and tapioca. Commonly eaten with coconut milk, best with shaved ice.\n20. Durian Sticky Rice (Khao Niaow Tu-rean)\nThough not as popular a dessert as its mango counterpart, this is a definite must eat for durian lovers. Unlike the mango version, this is generously drowned in coconut milk so forget about your waistline for once and eat to your heart\u2019s content.\n21. Thai Iced Tea (Cha Yen)\nForget the pseudo versions you find in Singapore. The kick ass ones are found in Thailand, with a rich creamy unique flavor which Thai tea leaves impart. We LOVED the ones sold at Rod Fai night market, near the beef noodles stall at the food section near the main road. (Stall name: Bangkok Tea)\n22. Toast with coconut custard\n23. Butterfly Juice\nMade with butterfly pea flower which is nutrient rich, this aesthetically pleasing drink is slightly sweet and tastes like the lemon barley we have during CNY. Great for quenching your thirst. This natural food coloring sauce is the same as the ones used to color nyonya kuehs\/glutinous rice dumplings."}
{"question":"Working in culinary education, I've noticed many students struggle with basic cooking skills. How do essential cooking techniques like knife skills and meal prep specifically support the nutritional needs of seniors?","doc_text":"Being a chef is not the job for everyone. Chefs have to be passionate, practiced, and talented, and it can sometimes be difficult to know whether or not the culinary art is the career choice that you want. If you\u2019re thinking about becoming a chef, here are the logistical steps you need to take.\n- Find Out if the Culinary Arts is Your Passion\nWhether you\u2019re a young person trying to figure out your next step after high school or a person stuck in a career looking for a new one, it\u2019s important to really find out if you\u2019re passionate enough about cooking to work in kitchens for a long time to come. The first step is to practice cooking and experimenting on your own, and maybe even get a job as a cook in a restaurant that doesn\u2019t require a culinary arts education.\n- Decide Which Culinary Arts Program is Best for You\nOnce you\u2019ve decided to pursue the culinary arts, it\u2019s time to start looking at the various types of programs offered out there. You may want to specialize in a type of food, like sushi, or you may want a more well-rounded approach to cooking. Either way, do your research, and find the school for you.\n- Attend Culinary Arts School\nIf you want to make cooking a profession rather than just a job, you need to actually get an education. Culinary Arts schools mold amateur cooks into highly trained professionals. You\u2019ll learn all of the skills you need to work and run a kitchen, and at a top notch program, you\u2019ll get the opportunity to learn from the best of the best.\n- Get an Internship\nMany culinary arts programs may require you to get an internship in a big restaurant. It\u2019s important to not only learn about various culinary methods, but to also hone and refine your skills. Working in an actual restaurant while you\u2019re still working on your education will help you do this.\n- Get Certified\nThe American Culinary Federation offers standardized certifications for chefs practicing in the culinary arts. Chefs who go through a certification program end up earning 7% more than chefs who did not. An ACF certification will help you get better jobs, and it\u2019ll ensure that your skills match the national standard.\n- Look for Jobs\nAfter you graduate from a culinary arts program, it\u2019s time to look for a job."}
{"question":"Why is early treatment important for autism?","doc_text":"California Confirms Rise in Autism Cases\nI know the rising rates of autism has been denied by many in the medical profession, explaining that increased diagnosis is what has accounted for the rise. A 273% increase. Want my opinion? We\u2019re doing something to our kids that are predisposing them to this condition. Multiple vaccinations, food allergies, poor prenatal\/pregnancy care? I personally believe that not every child will get autism from the MMR vaccine (which is the vaccine most blamed for the onset), but that a certain percentage of children have the genes that make them susceptible probably when combined with other factors such as a poor diet. This is NOT from the genes\u2026it is from the way we are treating the genes. It takes hundreds of thousands of years for true genetic variation to occur, and this is occurring in decades.\nCalifornia researchers say that the state is seeing a sharp rise in the number of autistic children\u2013but said they were mystified about what caused the unprecedented spread of the developmental disorder.The report by researchers at the University of California-Davis\u2019 M.I.N.D. Institute released on Thursday showed a 273% increase in the number of autistic children entering various state treatment centers between 1987 and 1998.The findings also indicate that the increase could not be accounted for by other factors such as the misclassification of cases or changing diagnostic criteria.\u201dSpeculation about the increase in autism in California has led some to try to explain it away as a statistical issue or with other factors that artificially inflated the numbers,\u201d lead investigator Dr. Robert Byrd said.\u201dInstead, we found that autism is on the rise in the state and we still do not know why. The results of this study are, without a doubt, sobering,\u201d he added.Medical experts say it is difficult to compare California\u2019s autism numbers with other states\u2019 because tracking systems are different. But they say anecdotal evidence indicates rates may also be rising elsewhere in the country.The California study, which was launched this year in an effort to determine why observed cases were increasing, looked at a statewide sample of 684 children from both English- and Spanish-speaking families.But the research did little to solve the mystery.Dr."}

{"question":"As a veterinary student focusing on feline development, I'm curious about the exact timeline of when kittens get their first teeth and how the teething process progresses - could you explain the key stages?","doc_text":"When your baby is around 6 months old, you'll probably start to see his first two teeth pushing through his gums. This process, known as teething, is an exciting milestone for parents, but it can also be frustrating if your little one is experiencing teething pain.\nA baby's discomfort from teething is caused by the fact that his new teeth are erupting through his tender gum tissue. While you may be somewhat familiar with teething issues, you might still have a tough time determining whether your child is suffering from pain related to teething or from discomfort caused by a different problem. Keep reading to learn how to recognize which of your child's symptoms point to teething pain and which symptoms may be signs of other issues that could require medical attention.\nRecognizing the Common Signs of Teething Pain\nGeneral irritability and crankiness are two of the telltale signs of pain from the teething process. If you're lucky, your baby's crankiness may only last for a brief period, although some babies remain irritable for several weeks as their teeth grow in.\nBecause of the discomfort that comes along with teething, your little one might also refuse certain foods or have trouble sleeping. Of course, some babies are picky eaters and fussy sleepers before they ever begin teething; that's why it's important to take note of your child's normal habits, so it will be easier to determine whether any behavior changes are related to his teething process.\nIf you're still unsure if your baby's symptoms are caused by pain in his gums, you can examine his gums to check for visible swelling and redness. You can also gently place a finger on or near the area where his teeth are growing in to see if he has a negative reaction to your touch.\nKnowing Which Symptoms Are Unrelated to Teething\nMany parents mistakenly believe that a baby's fever and diarrhea are connected with teething. However, experts haven't found any links between these symptoms and teething pain. If your child exhibits fevers or diarrhea, it's a good idea to call your physician to see what else might be causing these issues.\nEvery baby is unique, and while some little ones will have very strong reactions to teething, other babies will show no signs of distress at all. Keeping tabs on your baby's regular behavior and learning what signs do and don't point to teething pain will help you ensure that your little one remains healthy during this important process."}

{"question":"I'm curious about how hurricanes get their names - what's the story behind this tradition of naming big storms?","doc_text":"People tend to move their homes and businesses into the paths of hurricanes.\nAlso, the time that it takes to evacuate some crowded coastal communities is longer than the time for which accurate hurricane forecasts can be made.\nThe following are tools forecasters and researchers are using to try to figure out these great storms.\nWhile the hurricanes are still far out at sea, forecasters rely on direct observations from ships and instruments on ocean buoys. Satellites are their main toll and can orbit 22,000 miles above the equator at the same rate as the earth\u2019s daily rotation, so always they hover over the same patch of the planet. Their big picture images allow forecasters to track storms night and day all over the Atlantic Ocean. These images are the first important clues to the formation of these storms as well as their location, size and intensity.\nAs the storms move closer to land, direct measurements are made by \u201cHurricane Hunter\u201d airplanes.\nRoutinely, the US Air Force Reserve uses a specially equipped flight of C-130 aircraft to monitor approaching hurricanes. Their pilots fly into the core of the storm. Specialists aboard these planes drip instrument packages through the storms that radio back accurate information about the location of its eye, the strength of its winds, the direction and pace of its progress, and other important features such as air pressure, temperature, and humidity.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also have two special hurricane-probing planes, including a high altitude jet, that are designed for research.\nAs the storms get within about 200 miles off of the coastline, land-based weather radar begins to give forecasters importantindirect measurements. The new Doppler Radars give forecasters valuable images that give details about the internal structure of the storm \u2013 its wind fields, and how they change as a hurricane approaches land.\nForecasters are increasingly relying on computer models to help them forecast the intensity of the hurricane and its movement. Detailed information from all of the satellite sensors, and aircraft instruments, radars, ships and buoys continuously pours into thecomputer models. The results of a whole group of forecasting models are compared with one another as hurricanes approach the coast."}

{"question":"blank canvas opera premiere location date","doc_text":"Although Verdi did not attend the premiere in Cairo, he was most dissatisfied with the fact that the audience consisted of invited dignitaries, politicians and critics, but no members of the general public. He therefore considered the Italian (and European) premiere, held at La Scala, Milan on 8 February 1872, and in which he was heavily involved at every stage, to be its real premiere.\nVerdi had also written the role of Aida for the voice of Teresa Stolz, who sang it for the first time at the Milan premiere. Verdi had asked her fianc\u00e9, Angelo Mariani, to conduct the Cairo premiere, but he declined, so Giovanni Bottesini filled the gap. The Milan Amneris, Maria Waldmann, was his favourite in the role and she repeated it a number of times at his request.\nAida was received with great enthusiasm at its Milan premiere. The opera was soon mounted at major opera houses throughout Italy, including the Teatro Regio di Parma (20 April 1872), the Teatro di San Carlo (30 March 1873), La Fenice (11 June 1873), the Teatro Regio di Torino (26 December 1874), the Teatro Comunale di Bologna (30 September 1877, with Giuseppina Pasqua as Amneris and Franco Novara as the King), and the Teatro Costanzi (8 October 1881, with Theresia Singer as Aida and Giulia Novelli as Amneris) among others.\nMost performances of Aida have used a subdued, relatively brief, prelude.

{"question":"What's better for cutting energy costs: solar passive design or efficient appliances?","doc_text":"Solar energy has abundant applications. Tapping solar power requires the appropriate technology to reach the grassroots of India if we aim to move towards sustainable development for all. With this goal, TERI undertook the task of providing solar energy technology to a small district in Assam.\nWhat is a Solar Multi utility (SMU)?\nSolar Multi utility (SMU) is a platform that utilizes locally available solar energy to generate electricity through solar photovoltaic technology. The generated electricity is then used for a variety of applications such as charging lanterns, powering appliances such as computer, mobile phones, water purifier etc. An SMU is located near energy utilization points in a village to provide electricity services as per the need of the community.\nThis project dealt with designing and implementing such a platform for the Dakshin Dimoria village under the Dimoria Development Block of Kamrup district, Assam, located 40 km from Guwahati.\nThe SMU was designed based on the energy need assessment carried out at the project site for high-income generating and high valued service livelihood-generation activities. The design was a result of a market survey conducted by the project team for available appliances. Based on this assessment, the SMU was designed for powering appliances that included batteries for solar applications (specially for solar lanterns), water purifier, honey skimmer for honey extraction, chilli\/turmeric grinder, bamboo cross-cutting and splitting machines, bamboo slivering, and bamboo stick-making machines. These appliances are involved in livelihood generation activities, and therefore of critical importance to the people.\nThe entire process was broadly divided into six phases that included selection of site and appropriate solar photovoltaic (SPV) technology, designing of SMU, setting up local institutions, installation and commissioning of SMU, training and capacity building of local institutions, and monitoring the performance of SMU.\nAs a result of this project, a fully operational SMU was developed at the Dakshin Dimoria village and thereby helped in livelihood generation. In addition to this, an established institutional framework and effective service delivery mechanism was developed for ensuring long-term sustainability of the project. An installation, operation, and maintenance manual was also developed to facilitate smooth function of the SMUs.\nThe concept and purpose of SMU was well accepted among the communities. TERI also demonstrated strategies for carrying out similar projects in other regions."}

The list of illness with established origins in genetic mutations is very short, and even then the genetic factors operate statistically. The presence of a particular gene will raise or lower the percentage risk for a health issue, at the most. So one thing I learned from having my DNA sequenced is that very few diseases have a single point genetic basis, which means that gene sequences will be just one factor in a very complex brew of influences. Personal genetic knowledge is sort of like knowing your blood type: Important to know but far from sufficient.\n2) Sequencing is not just about health (and one of the reasons it should not be hijacked by the doctor squad).

{"question":"What were some of the biggest safety challenges faced by race car drivers at Le Mans during the 1960s?","doc_text":"There have been many recent developments in the world of sports car racing over the past few months, with important announcements coming from a large number of major automakers. This leads me to believe that we are on the cusp of something great, and something historic. Sports car racing has always been defined by manufacturer involvement, and I believe that is beginning to return on a large scale.\nSports car racing is one of the oldest forms of racing, and it has a long and illustrious history of manufacturer involvement. The prestige of many manufacturers is tied to their efforts and accomplishments in sports car racing in the past, especially at Le Mans, with major marques such as Porsche, Ferrari, BMW, Mercedes, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Bentley, Renault, Toyota, Mazda, McLaren, Nissan, and Ford all having a storied and celebrated history in the sport. These manufacturer efforts defined the racing, the rivalries, and the sport.\nUnfortunately, after 1999, manufacturer involvement became sparse. Mercedes pulled out of sports car racing indefinitely after an aerodynamic design flaw caused Peter Dumbreck's CLR to spectacularly become airborne during Le Mans in 1999 (Mark Webber's CLR also experienced this during warm-ups). Toyota stopped their GT-One program and transitioned into Formula 1. BMW also made a transition to Formula 1, but ran the BMW V12 LMR for one more year in the American Le Mans Series. BMW took the win at Charlotte and Silverstone, but the V12 LMR could not match the pace of the new Audi R8, and BMW retired their LMP effort before the last race of the season.\nAudi prototypes went on to define sports car racing and Le Mans throughout the 2000's. There were short lived and unsuccessful prototype efforts from Chrysler, Cadillac, and Panoz, and none of these efforts could match the Audi R8's performance, and the car won at Le Mans five times in six years (The one year an R8 did not win was 2003. Audi provided an engine, staff, and drivers to Bentley, a fellow member of the Volkswagen Auto Group, and Bentley won with the Speed 8). After another successful year for the R8 in 2005, Audi introduced its successor, the R10 TDI, which in 2006 became the first diesel to win at Le Mans."}

{"question":"what are the similarities between blue concert posters database searching and analogous color schemes in art both require analyzing relationships between colors","doc_text":"Having survived the first encounter against Kajima, Schterzen steals the Blue Destiny Unit 2 and Kajima pursued him using Unit 3.\nThe Unit 1 and Unit 3 are two variations of the same model in two different color schemes with alternative parts to distinguish each type. Unit 1 has a GM (Gundam Mass-production) type head and is outfitted for ground combat, whereas Unit 3 has the traditional Gundam type head and is refitted for space combat, with additional components added onto the existing body from Unit 1. With exception to their heads and the components for Unit 3, the only substantial differences between Unit 1 and Unit 3 are the thrusters on the outsides of the legs and the colors.\nOut of the boxes, both Units are molded in their final colors and are supplemented with polycaps to provide articulation. Unit 1 comes in its true blue and dark blue plastic, with gray parts for its joints and weapons. There is one red piece for its chin, and a clear visor for its eyes. Unit 3 comes in the traditional Gundam colors of off-white gray, yellow, red, and dark blue, with the same color gray parts for its joints and weapons as Unit 1. As standard for designs with beam sabers are a set of clear pink tubes that form the beams included on their own parts tree.\nBetween both units, there is some minor paint work to improve the looks, such as the tube protrusions from the chest, the triangle indentations on the knees and front of the chest. Additional paint work includes the targeting eyes on the top of the forehead and back of the head. For those looking at the decals, both units come with two different color sets for eyes: one red and one green. The reason for this depends on the builder\u2019s choice of whether to display the Blue Destiny in EXAM\u2019s activated mode (red) or normal mode (green). Because I use paint, I opted for Unit 1\u2019s visor in red and paint Unit 3\u2019s eyes green.\nFor the sake of variety I employed a number of aesthetics: detailing in two gray tones; gunship gray to match the plastic for joint regions and engine gray for the weapons and auxiliary parts. While it is extra work, it adds to the overall finish of the model, and makes it look like a more complex construct than it really is."}

What you get in a couple massage varies greatly based on the location and focus of the therapists you select. In a Hanoi spa, couple massage typically includes access to showers, hot tubs and more. In a therapeutic setting, the focus is on the bodywork, so while the amenities might be less extravagant, the therapists are typically better trained. In a therapeutic couple massage, each therapist has an individual conversation with the massage guest to determine his or her goals for the session. At spas in Hanoi, it\u2019s common for one massage guest to want a focus on relaxation, and the other on tending to aches and pains from athletic activities.\nBenefits of a couple massage?\n- It\u2019s not a secret that massage is great for relaxation, but for a couple this is a great way to force each other to stop and take a minute together. A couple massage is a great way to free yourselves from technology and spend a relaxing, intimate moment together and make a perfect summer holiday in Hanoi.\n- Marriage and family counselors will tell you that massage is a great way to release.

{"question":"body parts affected superficial blisters disease","doc_text":"Polymyositis is a connective tissue disease that triggers inflammation and muscular weakness. The cause is unknown, but polymyositis is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, possibly triggered by a viral infection of muscle tissue.\nThe disease is more common in women than men and tends to develop between the ages of 50 to 70 years, although anyone of any age or either sex can be affected. Usually, the muscle weakness develops gradually over the course of a few weeks or months. The inflammation may spread to other areas of the body including the heart.\nSince symptoms differ between individuals, polymyositis is hard to diagnose and may be mistaken for muscular dystrophy. In many cases, polymyositis is associated with other autoimmune disorders of connective tissue such as scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren\u2019s syndrome.\nSymptoms of polymyositis\nThe symptoms include:\n- The shoulders and hips usually affected first\n- Muscular weakness\n- Muscle wastage\n- Muscle pain\n- Swallowing difficulties\n- Tremors, particularly of the hands\n- Wide-footed stance and walking style\n- Tendency to fall over.\nProgression of weakness\nPolymyositis develops gradually over weeks or months. By the time the person experiences symptoms, they have already lost around half of their muscle fibres to the disease. The head, hands and feet are usually untouched by the disease. Difficulties may include:\n- Profound muscular weakness in affected body parts, such as being unable to lift the arms above shoulder height or lift the head off a pillow\n- Voice changes, if the muscles of the larynx are affected\n- Problems with swallowing if the oesophagus is affected, with a tendency to regurgitate food\n- Peristalsis (the muscular contractions of the bowel) may falter, leading to constipation\n- In its later stages, abnormal shortening of muscles (contracture).\nA malfunction of the immune system\nThe cause of polymyositis hasn\u2019t been found, but there is good evidence to indicate that it is likely to be an autoimmune disorder, which means the immune cells mistakenly attack the muscle fibres of the body. If a small tag (biopsy) of affected muscle is examined in a laboratory, it looks withered and studded with immune system cells."}

{"question":"body language importance real life versus experiments findings","doc_text":"Cell-free microRNAs: potential biomarkers in need of standardized reporting\n- Asbestos Diseases Research Institute, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia\nMicroRNAs are abundantly present and surprisingly stable in multiple biological fluids. These findings have been followed by numerous reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)-based reports revealing the clinical potential of using microRNA levels in body fluids as a biomarker of disease. Despite a rapidly increasing body of literature, the field has failed to adopt a set of standardized criteria for reporting the methodology used in the quantification of cell-free microRNAs. Not only do many studies based on RT-qPCR fail to address the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) criteria but frequently there is also a distinct lack of detail in descriptions of sample source and RNA isolation. As a direct result, it is often impossible to compare the results of different studies, which in turn, hinders progress in the field. To address this point, we propose a simple set of criteria to be used in conjunction with MIQE to reveal the true potential of cell-free microRNAs as biomarkers.\nIn recent years, a number of studies have shown that cell-free microRNAs are readily detectable in body fluids, such as plasma or serum. The surprising stability of cell-free microRNAs in these body fluids has been attributed to encapsulation of microRNAs in microvesicles such as exosomes (Cortez and Calin, 2009; Kosaka et al., 2010), and association with protein complexes, like high density lipoproteins (Vickers et al., 2011) and argonaute 2 (Arroyo et al., 2011; Turchinovich et al., 2011). These findings led to numerous studies aiming at the identification of microRNAs, mainly in plasma and serum, as potential diagnostic and\/or prognostic markers for a variety of diseases (Reid et al., 2011; Creemers et al., 2012; Mo et al., 2012). However, although most studies are using reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for detection of microRNAs, there is still a lack of consensus regarding isolation procedures, optimal quantification methods, reference genes, and quality control of samples."}

We want to better understand this interaction.\nProtons and neutrons are hadrons (colorless particles made up of quarks). There are two well known types of hadrons: baryons, which are made up of three quarks (like the proton and neutron); and mesons, which are made up of quarks and anti-quarks. In KLOE-2, we focus on mesons, actually light mesons (with masses up to ca 1 GeV).\nThe KLOE-2 experiment, an upgrade of the KLOE experiment, is currently running at the DAFNE accelerator. In DAFNE, electrons and positrons accelerated to ca 510 MeV each collide. From the energy of the collision, for example \u03c6 mesons are produced. The \u03c6 mesons can then decay to other mesons, and the decay products are measured in the KLOE-2 detector. The KLOE-2 detector is actually a collection of detectors, ordered here by their proximity to the interaction region: an inner tracker (to detect charged particle tracks close to the interaction region), a crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (to detect photons at small angles), a scintillating tile calorimeter covering the interaction region quadrupoles (to improve detection of KL decay photons), a tagger for low energy electrons and positrons (for two photons physics), a drift chamber (to detect tracks of charged particles), surrounded by a lead\/scintillating fiber electromagnetic calorimeter (to detect photons but also charged particles) and a tagger for high energy electrons and positrons, located after the first bending dipole (also for two photon physics). The drift chamber and surrounding electromagnetic calorimeter were already a part of KLOE, the other detectors are the upgrade."}
{"question":"As a ruminant nutrition specialist, I'm researching methane emissions from cattle digestion. What is the role of protein in ruminant digestion, and how does this relate to their contribution to global warming?","doc_text":"This is the average amount of nitrous oxide (N2O) that is in the atmosphere in a given month. The monthly average highlights the seasonal variation. The graph shows the last 3 years to highlight the seasonal variation.\nNitrous oxide has a large warming effect, with a Global Warming Potential (GWP) that is 273 times greater than CO2. Like CO2, but unlike methane, it stays in the atmosphere for a long time, on average 116 years. Besides its warming potential, nitrous oxide is also important because it depletes the ozone layer, which protects us from the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays.Wikipedia: Nitrous oxide Atmospheric occurrence\nThe primary unit here is parts per billion (ppb), which describes the average concentration of atmospheric methane per year.

{"question":"benefits drawbacks peer mediated instruction discipline school settings","doc_text":"The relationship between parent and peer attachment: The role of affect regulation\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between parent and peer attachment. It was hypothesized that aspects of affect regulation (Neuroticism, Emotional Sharing, and Positive Affect) would account for some portion of the relationship between parent and peer attachment. ^ Parent-child relationships are generally children's first (and formative) relationships: As such, parent-child relationships are likely to serve as models for all future social and emotional experiences. Affect-regulation has been implicated as influential in the link between parent and peer relations. Affect regulation can be characterized by the capacity to label affects, to contain emotional distress, and to respond behaviorally with adaptive emotional coping. Parent attachment style may exert an indirect effect upon peer attachment through specific coaching and nonspecific modeling of affect-regulation skills. ^ The participants in this study were 114 undergraduate psychology students from the subject pool at Fordham University. Participants demographics were as follows: 78 female, 22% male, mean age of 19 years, 77% Caucasian, 9% Hispanic, 6% Asian, 2% African-American, and 4% described themselves as \u201cOther.\u201d ^ Four inventories were used in this study: The Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment; the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; the Emotional Sharing subscale of the COPE; and the Neuroticism subscale of the NEO-Five-Factor Inventory. Note that all scales were administered intact, in their entirety. ^ Standard multiple regression analyses were used to test the direct effects of parent attachment on peer attachment. The indirect effects of parent attachment on peer attachment, mediated by measures of affect regulation, were examined using simultaneous-entry multiple regression strategies in accordance with Baron and Kenny's (1986) criteria for establishing a mediated relationship. Analyses indicated that aspects of affect regulation mediate the relationship between parent and peer attachment. More specifically, this study found that Neuroticism and Emotional Sharing mediated the relationship between Mother and Peer Attachment, while Neuroticism and Positive Affect mediated the relationship between Father and Peer Attachment. Study limitations, as well as various research and clinical implications are presented. Several directions for future research are suggested as well. ^\nPsychology, Social|Psychology, Clinical\nEhrman, Stephanie Gail, \"The relationship between parent and peer attachment: The role of affect regulation\" (2003).

The festival is mostly known for its Piazza Grande open-air screenings, which seats over 8 000 people and features one of the world\u2019s largest open-air screens.\nThe festival includes an International Competition, Concorso Cineasti (highlighting the first and second films from emerging directors), an Out-of-Competition selection, a Short Film Competition and the Open Doors section, which focuses each year on a specific region. This year\u2019s Open Doors features films on Sub-Saharan Africa.\nLocarno typically functions as a discovery festival, launching new trends, films and careers \u2013 for example, Roberto Rossellini\u2019s Rome, Open City screened at the first ever festival in 1946. This generally means that many of the titles in the line-up will be unknown to even the most avid of festival-circuit followers.\nThere are a few familiar faces however \u2013 Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s Goodbye to Language will be screening out of competition, as will Thom Andersen\u2019s latest offering, The Tony Longo Trilogy and some competition heavyweights such as Lav Diaz and Pedro Costa will be recognisable names to ardent cinephiles.

{"question":"I'm new to guns. What exactly does ballistics mean?","doc_text":"These three kinds of scenes are very similar in that they have to tell a part of the story by using details. Horror and action are not my strongest points as a director. I'm better at making pretty paintings than the deliberate pacing of shots which build up tension in a horror or action scene. I'm getting better at the pacing of shots in a love scene as I've had more experience with them. Horror is very very specialized and difficult to do.\nStoryboards are important in commercials. And for films with budgets so large that you know exactly what your sets will be like. But in our world they are mostly a waste of time.\nInstead, use the following rules.\nWhat's actually important\nThere are only two things that are important when shooting a movie\nAnd you read the scheduling section of the Wiki first, right?\nShooting the movie isn't important. That's the fun part of what we do. But in order to sell the movie we absolutely must have good stills. Frequently the producers rep will tell us what they want for stills. Otherwise, we need all the actors in front of a blue screen with their guns or whatever. And then we need pictures of them in character doing the things their character does. Distributors will actually reject a picture that does not have several hundred high-resolution stills.\nOne of the most important and potentially expensive deliverables on a motion picture is the DM&E tracks. We absolutely must have well recorded dialog in order to deliver those. The dialog quality is more important than the picture. Viewers will presume the picture looks terrible if the sound is terrible.\nTo recap: the two most important things are stills and sound. Everything else you do to make a movie? Tertiary or... worse...\nWhat to shoot\n- Shoot all of the action\n- all the entrances\n- all the exits\n- shoot all the dialog\n- shoot everything in the scene that anyone refers to: dead body on the floor, glass of whiskey, baccarat table.\nAnd remember that it's all about the decisions made on-stage. I don't mean the decisions the director makes, I mean the decisions that the characters make.

{"question":"What's the story behind how doctors came to completely separate the acts of healing and killing? I've always wondered about the historical background.","doc_text":"Image: Matthew Loffhagen\nPeriod fiction is a surprisingly popular genre used to place stories in the time period and setting that works best for them. It\u2019s not always completely accurate, but it does convey a spirit that\u2019s hard to capture in any other way, and there\u2019s a large readership out there who are ready to suspend their disbelief and dive in. Here\u2019s how to help them.\nWhat is period fiction?\nIsn\u2019t it just another word for historical fiction? Well, sort of. There\u2019s a lot of crossover, but talking about the subtle differences can help us filter out what we\u2019re not trying to do and polish what we are.\nHistorical fiction typically includes real historical places (London) and people (Winston Churchill). Period fiction emulates a certain period of history to create a certain feel. Maybe you just want to emulate a certain feel, maybe you want to include some anachronistic details to make the plot sing, or maybe the real history is a bit too turbulent, and you want your story to unfold without it being interrupted or upstaged by real events.\nYou\u2019ll find that much of the advice in here applies to both styles, but it\u2019s geared toward period fiction. When writing period fiction, your grasp of history doesn\u2019t need to be excruciatingly detailed and deeply philosophical. Most people read the story for the story, not for the history lesson. (There\u2019s always Tolstoy for that.) Still, even the average reader will notice if your Roman centurion suddenly jumps in a tank. That\u2019s why research is so important.\nRule #1 \u2013 Research is king\nPause for a second and imagine something with me: you\u2019re thumbing through your friend\u2019s photo album, enjoying the candid shots of her son\u2019s bar mitzvah, and you come across a professional portrait. The background is the sandy shore of a lake in town, and it\u2019s clearly a perfect, sunny day for taking pictures.\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s someone in the background. Actually, there are a few people \u2013 some are really far away, part of the background, actually helping the impression of a genuine, captured moment, but one\u2019s closer, and they\u2019re pulling a stupid face. As much as you don\u2019t want it to, that stupid face spoils the picture. It\u2019s so patently obvious that they don\u2019t belong in the photo!"}
{"question":"I'm interested in military units from the 1700s - can you tell me what happened to the Jung Braunschweig regiment at the end and why did the Seven Years War start in the first place?","doc_text":"Former cavalry officer James Brown, a veteran of Australia's inconclusive campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, sees the country heading towards another messy war in an atmosphere of open public discussion and informed national debate. Unfortunately, most of the debate is about a war that ended almost 100 years ago.\nBrown, military fellow at the Lowy Institute for National Policy, believes Australia's increasingly enthusiastic commemoration of an imperfectly remembered Anzac past actually helps prevent us from coming to terms with our contemporary military situation.\nHe is awkwardly handsome in classic junior-officer style, with the confident bearing of a man well accustomed to making life-or-death decisions, such as whether to turn his guns on enemy insurgents, and which bottle of wine to bring to his first dinner with his future father-in-law, the Liberal politician Malcolm Turnbull.\nBrown first became interested in Anzac when he heard politicians making speeches about Afghanistan at the end of the last decade.\n\"And there was no substance in any of it,\" he said, \"just cliched, hackneyed phrases: we've got to support this and that, references to Anzac and World War I.\n\"And I thought we probably deserve better, we probably deserve a bit more thought. And I was really curious about why these guys didn't get it.\n\"It's their job, and they didn't know who we were fighting in Afghanistan. They didn't know the difference between infantry and armour. If you'd asked them to articulate what the strategy was, they couldn't tell you.\n\"Afghanistan was becoming more and more unpopular, and yet at the same time these reports were being done about the centenary of Anzac. I just couldn't reconcile those two things: it didn't make sense.\"\nBrown and I meet for lunch at North Bondi RSL, where Brown is vice-president of the sub-branch. The walls hang with reminders of the real cost of modern war: photographs of three sub-branch members killed in Afghanistan.\nThey all belonged to the Special Operations Engineer Regiment based at Holsworthy, which has a special relationship with the sub-branch. They were invited as part of a deliberate strategy by the executive.\nWhile most sub-branches are dwindling, or packed with non-military affiliates, North Bondi has more than 400 members, many of whom are still in uniform."}
{"question":"medical procedure fix hole eardrum patch repair surgical options","doc_text":"Having an ACL reconstruction treatment can give you a competitive edge when it comes to sports or other physical activities. As the recovery process speeds up after the procedure, you will be able to return to training more quickly and take part in competitions if you desire. This can give you an advantage over athletes who still need to rest from their injuries.\nImproved Self Esteem\nThe ACL injury can take its toll on your self-esteem and mental health. But with an ACL reconstruction treatment, you can begin to rebuild your confidence quickly. As your mobility and strength improve, so will your self-image and outlook.\nDecrease Stress Levels\nFinally, ACL reconstruction treatment can also help you to relax and reduce stress. By relieving the source of the injury, i.e. the damaged ACL ligament, you can go through life without stress, worry and fear of another ACL injury. Moreover, improving your mobility and reducing pain in the leg area can allow you to be more active and find ways to reduce stress.\nAn ACL reconstruction treatment can offer all of these benefits, giving you your mobility and quality of life back. So if you have suffered an ACL injury, don\u2019t hesitate to consider an ACL reconstruction treatment today.\nThings To Remember When Considering ACL Reconstruction Treatment\nSome people who have undergone knee injuries or taken part in sports activities may require a surgical procedure called ACL reconstruction treatment. This treatment is often recommended by medical professionals to address issues related to knee injuries. It\u2019s essential to consider your options before opting for this treatment, as there are certain factors you must bear in mind. Here, we\u2019ll discuss the top few things you should remember when considering ACL reconstruction treatment.\nUnderstanding What ACL Reconstruction Treatment Is\nACL reconstruction treatment is a surgical procedure done to fix the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which connects the thighbone to the shinbone and helps with knee stability and movement. It becomes damaged due to certain activities or a sports-related injury and may require ACL reconstruction treatment to repair or reconstruct the ligament. This surgical procedure involves removing the damaged tissue and replacing it with a substitute.\nExpected Risks and Benefits of the Treatment\nACL reconstruction treatment is generally considered safe and effective. However, as with any surgery, there are risks associated with the procedure. Possible risks include infection, blood clots, and nerve or joint damage. Speaking to your doctor or surgeon before the procedure will help you understand the potential risks and any possible side effects."}
{"question":"melanoma prevention vs physical activity benefits cancer patients which more supported by research","doc_text":"A multidisciplinary team at Yale, led by Yale Cancer Center members, has defined a subgroup of genetic mutations that are present in a significant number of melanoma skin cancer cases. Their findings shed light on an important mutation in this deadly disease, and may lead to more targeted anti-cancer therapies.\nThe study was published July 27 in Nature Genetics.\nThe role of mutations in numerous genes and genomic changes in the development of melanoma\u2014a skin cancer with over 70,000 new cases reported in the United States each year\u2014is well established and continues to be the focus of intense research. Yet in approximately 30% of melanoma cases the genetic abnormalities are unclear. To deepen understanding of melanoma mutations, the Yale team conducted a comprehensive analysis using whole-exome sequencing of more than 200 melanoma samples from patients with the disease.\nThe multidisciplinary team\u2014drawing on their expertise in genetics, cancer, computational biology, pharmacology, and other disciplines\u2014also tested the response of tumor cells with specific mutations to anti-cancer drugs.\nThe researchers confirmed that a gene known as NF1 is a \"major player\" in the development of skin cancer. \"The key finding is that roughly 45% of melanomas that do not harbor the known BRAF or NRAS mutations display loss of NF1 function, which leads to activation of the same cancer-causing pathway,\" said Michael Krauthammer, M.D., associate professor of pathology and the study's corresponding author.\nAdditionally, researchers observed that melanoma patients with the NF1 mutation were older and had a greater number of mutations in the tumors. These include mutations in the same pathway, collectively known as RASopathy genes.\nYet mutations in NF1 are not sufficient to cause skin cancer, said Ruth Halaban, senior research scientist in dermatology, a member of Yale Cancer Center, and lead author of the study. \"Loss of NF1 requires more accompanying changes to make a tumor,\" she explained. \"Our study identified changes in about 100 genes that are present only in the malignant cells and are likely to be causative. This panel of genes can now be used in precision medicine to diagnose malignant lesions and can be applied to personalized cancer treatment.\"\nBy testing the response of the melanoma samples to two cancer drugs, the researchers also determined that, in addition to loss of NF1, multiple factors need to be tested to predict the response to the drugs."}

Of this number, 18 were exposed daily by nature of their job to various levels of the compound and had a mean 8 hour time weighted average (TWA) exposure of 18ppm over the 5 days of testing. The 9 males within the exposed group, however, had a mean TWA exposure of 32ppm. Neurological examinations showed a significant difference between neurological ratings for exposed workers versus controls. However, multiple regression analyses suggest the neurological deficits to be related to workers' prior exposure to Stoddard's-Solvent (8052413), not perchloroethylene. The effects of acute perchloroethylene exposure were examined by giving workers behavioral performance tests both prior to work and following work over a 5 day period. Although significant differences in performance of some perception and psychomotor tests were found, multiple regression analysis showed the post shift performance decrements to be significantly correlated with a measure of fatigue, not with perchloroethylene exposure that occurred during the workshift. In summary, no evidence was found of deleterious effects of perchloroethylene on workers' neurologic health or behavioral performance. However, findings strongly suggest the involvement of Stoddard's Solvent as a factor accounting for an increased incidence of abnormally large neurologic scores.

{"question":"what hardware components needed build automatic loading firing catapult ev3","doc_text":"During the French and Indian War, tactics by necessity evolved quickly in the North American wilderness. After some initial bloody tactical disasters, British leadership rapidly recognized the need to adopt a new way of warfare, shifting from a regular European style of fighting to more irregular tactics led by light infantry units. The recruits in these groups wore cut down hats, coats and leather leggings and carried equipment focused on swift movement and close, skirmish-style combat. To build out my FIW Britsh light infantry units, I\u2019ve drawn upon a variety of manufacturers.\nTo begin, I purchased the single offering of British light infantry models available from AW Miniatures. This small package comes with two copies each of just three different poses with two firing variations and one model loading on the move. The figures are dressed in the popular jockey caps of light infantry soldiers along with spare equipment on chunky molds which scale well with a variety of manufacturers.\nSeeking to layer in some significant variety to my forces, I went next to Redoubt Enterprises and their large offering of FIW figures. Redoubt offers two six-packs of British light infnatry, one with jockey caps and the other wearing basic round hats. The packages each come with no duplication of poses, offering a lot of variety in firing, loading and advancing sculpts. One figure in each set comes with a separate hands and rifle piece meant to be glued with the musket raised high in melee mode. I chose to invert the piece in a loading posture on each of the two models.\nFinally, I went to Front Rank Figurines with their vast listing of FIW models available individually for purchase. Again, there was a lot of variety here with shooting, advancing, loading and at-the-ready troops, many hauling small campaign-ready backpacks. To these, I added two NCOs \u2014 one at ease and one commanding trops forward \u2014 along with a more formal officer sold as Major General James Wolfe (middle above).\nAcross three UK-based manufacturers, these figures all fit well together as heftier 28mm casts.

Towards the end of the 19th century, it underwent a transformation and emerged as a modern language due to the efforts of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, a noted Jewish linguist.\nToday, people participating in Hebrew language learning online often find words that can\u2019t be directly translated into English.\nSome of these words are discussed below:\n1. Firgun (\u05e4\u05e8\u05d2\u05d5\u05df)\nThe word \u2018firgun\u2019 is used to describe feeling genuinely happy for another\u2019s person joy, or taking pride in their accomplishments.\nIt\u2019s also a concept, implying that a person who engages in \u2018firgun\u2019 has a generosity of spirit, and feels no resentment or jealousy towards someone else\u2019s happiness.\n2. Davka (\u05d3\u05d5\u05d5\u05e7\u05d0)\n\u2018Davka\u2019 is an incredibly versatile word, as its meaning can vary depending on the usage. One says \u2018davka\u2019 when they want to describe something that\u2019s the opposite of what they were expecting.\nThe word can also be used to describe irony, or a deliberately harmful act.\n3.

It also describes someone who tends to blow small things out of proportion.\n4. Chutzpah (\u05d7\u05d5\u05e6\u05e4\u05d4)\n\u2018Chutzpah\u2019 is perhaps one of the most popular Hebrew words used by non-Hebrew speakers. The word is commonly used in conversation and in writing by English speakers, but it does not translate directly to English.\nSomeone with \u2018chutzpah\u2019 has a lot of nerve or audacity, bordering on rudeness.

{"question":"As a prayer leader, how does making intention for regular prayers compare to Janazah prayer regarding Qibla and timing requirements?","doc_text":"Do you believe in magic?\nThe end of the year is ripe with holiday celebrations and an overwhelming field of possibility as people are willing to believe in miracles. It is the perfect time to watch as your visions, dreams, and prayers show up in your life.\nIn this episode ofThe Deep Dive with Adam Roa, I discuss the power of prayer and how you can use it to create the reality you want.\nHere\u2019s what you\u2019ll hear:\n- My own personal prayer I use to set intention and ask for strength\n- Why Burning Man is so transformational\n- How to use prayer to manifest the life you desire\n- Why Christmas is the most powerful time to set intentions\nPrayer, to me, is setting a powerful intention for what you want to experience in life.

{"question":"what makes bones move smoothly","doc_text":"Alternative names broken hip\nWhat is hip fracture? A hip fracture is a break in the top part of the femur (thigh bone) where it inserts into the pelvis to form the hip joint.\nSymptoms and signs of hip fractureSymptoms and signs of hip fracture usually follow a fall or other accident, and may include:\n- Severe pain in the hip or lower groin region, sometimes radiating to the knee. Attempting to move the hip usually results in a significant increase in pain. In some cases, there may be only thigh or knee pain. Lower back pain may also occur.\n- Stiffness, bruising, swelling, tenderness or deformity in and around the hip area.\n- A shorter leg on the side of the injured hip.\n- The leg on the side of the injured hip turns outward and is shortened.\n- Difficulty walking. (Walking may still be possible with partial fractures)\n- Inability to put weight on your leg.\nWhat causes hip fracture?In elderly people, the direct cause of a hip fracture is usually a fall or accident, which may sometimes be relatively minor. The underlying cause is likely to be osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become brittle and more prone to fracture as a result of mineral loss).\nIn younger people, however, hip fractures are usually caused by a more severe injury, such as a motor vehicle accident, sports injury or high-impact fall.\nIn some people with certain medical conditions, such as severe osteoporosis, cancer, paralysis or kidney disease, the bones can become so weak and brittle that a hip fracture can occur during regular daily activities, simply from bearing the body's weight.\nWho gets hip fracture and who is at risk?Those who suffer from osteoporosis are at risk and the risk factors are those for osteoporosis.\n- Ageing. With age, the bones gradually lose calcium and other minerals and become less dense. Loss of density weakens bones and makes them more susceptible to fracture. Ninety percent of hip fractures occur in people over age 65.\n- Female gender. Women lose bone density at a greater rate than men do, and as a result are two to three times more likely to experience a hip fracture: about one out of every seven women will have a hip fracture in her lifetime. Hip fractures are a particularly important concern for menopausal and post-menopausal women."}

Then God said, \"Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind\"; and it was so.\n25. And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good.\nLet's stop here for a moment and consider the above verses.\nThis is the day of the creation of the land animals and man.\nHere again, in verse 24, we see the use of the phrase \"living creatures\" or \"living soul\", \"neh-fesh hah-yaw\". This further emphasizes the importance of all of God's creatures, and that Man is but one of them. All of us, humans and non-humans, have a soul and a spirit.\nRemember also that God did not call forth the earth to create or make the animals, as we discussed before. It is God who made [aw-sawh] the animals as we can see from verse 25. God made [aw-sawh] the animals from what he had previously created [baw-raw].\nIn verse 25, God again emphasizes that each type of creature is created after its kind. God seems to imply that He wants things to remain as He created them, for He says of His creation when He saw it, \"that it was good.\" And since we are talking about God's created animals, we likewise need to consider the goodness, the love, the compassion that God feels towards these beings, and feel as He does.\nLet's continue with our study verses, as they relate to Man.\n26. Then God said, \" Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.\"\n27. And God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.\n28."}

{"question":"I'm new to student loans. What's the main difference between graduated repayment and IDR plans?","doc_text":"PLUS Loans for Parents\nParents of dependent students are eligible to apply for their own federal loan to help pay college expenses. We do not assume parents want to borrow to pay educational expenses. If you and your parents are interested in this program you should contact the campus financial aid office at your school. A parent may borrow the difference between the Cost of Attendance and all other student aid received by the student.\nYou (the student) must apply for financial aid using the FAFSA. You must also submit a PLUS loan request form available at your CUNY college Financial Aid Office.\nInterest rate and repayment for PLUS loans\nPlus loans taken for the 2013-2014 academic term are charged a fixed interest rate of 6.41%. The interest will not change throughout the life of the loan. Repayment of the loan begins within 60 days after the date funds are disbursed. The interest rate varies each year on new loans and is adjusted each July 1st.\nTo receive a PLUS loan you must:\n- Request the loan from the financial aid office\n- File a FAFSA\n- Parents must be able to pass a credit check\n- Parents and students must meet general eligibility requirements for federal student aid\n- Must not be in default of any loan or owe a refund to any Federal Student Assistance program\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow do my parents apply for a PLUS Loan?\nAfter completing a FAFSA your parents complete a Direct PLUS Loan application and promissory note that you'll get from your school's financial aid office. They will have to pass a credit check. If they don't pass they might still be able to receive a loan if they can demonstrate that extenuating circumstances exists, or if someone they know, who can pass agrees to endorse the loan and promises to repay it if your parents don't.\nWhen does PLUS loan repayment begin?\nGenerally, within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed (paid out). There is no grace period for these loans. This means interest begins to accumulate at the time the first disbursement is made. Your parents must begin repaying both principal and interest while you're in school.\nWhat are the PLUS repayment periods?\nThe repayment periods for Stafford Loans vary from 10 to 30 years depending which repayment plan you choose. When it comes to repayment you can pick a repayment plan that's right for you. You can get more information about repayment by going to the U.S."}

The water level of the tank should be reduced to 7\u201310 cm during spawning and the temperature should be approximately 82 \u00b0F. The aquarium must be planted with suitable plant species like Ceratopteris thalictroides, Limnophila aquatica,Riccia fluitans and Vesicularia dubyana. To build a bubble nest the male uses bits of vegetation in its nest. In nature it adds leaves, twigs, roots, peat fibers, and other debris to build a nest. The spawning session lasts for two to four hours and the female produces 300 to 800 eggs. After spawning the female should be moved to a different tank. The male picks up eggs in his mouth and put them in bubble nest and continues to guard the eggs until they hatch. The eggs hatch in about 12-36 hours, but the fry stay in the bubble nest and continue developing. In about 3 days fry become free swimming and leave the nest. At this time the male should be removed to prevent eating the young."}

Accessible websites and content include design features that increase usability across a spectrum of abilities and technologies, including use by people with disabilities and users of assistive technology.\nWhat is the University of Iowa's policy on web accessibility?\nUniversity of Iowa policy requires that all web content conform to accessibility standards described in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, version 2.0, level AA, as set forth by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Individual units are charged with developing and implementing a web accessibility strategy per the Implementation section of this policy.\nThe full policy is available at http:\/\/itsecurity.uiowa.edu\/policy\/webAccessibility.shtml.\nIs accessibility required by law?\nThe University is subject to provisions of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and the Iowa Civil Rights Act.\n- Section 504 prohibits disability-based discrimination by programs that receive Federal funds.\n- Title II of the ADA requires that communications to people with disabilities be equally as effective as communications with non-disabled people in their timeliness, accuracy, and delivery method.\n- The Department of Justice has stated that Internet and web sites are covered under both Section 504 and the ADA.\nI don't have any people with disabilities in my audience\u2014do I need to provide accessible web technology?\nYes.

{"question":"How do tax benefits differ between hybrid arbitrage funds and municipal bonds?","doc_text":"- Convertible Arbitrage: Convertible bonds combine elements of both stock and bonds in one trade. Convertible arbitrage funds build long positions of convertible bonds and then hedge the long exposure. Arbitrageurs attempt to make profits by identifying pricing discrepancies between the convertible bond and its component parts, and then continually monitoring these component parts for any change in their relationship.\n- Market Neutral: MManagers construct long\/short portfolios of equal weightings that eliminate market risks so to drive return purely from stock selection.\n- Statistical Arbitrage: Managers use quantitative analysis to construct a market neutral portfolio. Managers, typically, build multifactor models to identify those factors that have a consistent impact on security prices.\nCorporate Structure Strategies\nCorporate structure strategies take advantage of significant corporate transactions like a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy. These funds attempt to generate returns by concentrating their portfolios in companies where it is more important to understand the event. The trade involves taking less market risk in favor of more company specific risk. Sub-Strategies include:\n- Distressed: Distressed debt hedge funds invest in the securities of a corporation that is in bankruptcy or likely to fall into bankruptcy. The fund may short sell the company to profit on declining values or may purchase the security prior to the company announcing its reorganization plan to the bankruptcy court with the expectation that there will be a positive resolution with the company\u2019s creditors. A manager may also employ capital structure arbitrage through buying and selling certain securities of the same company depending on the estimated outcome.\n- Merger Arbitrage: This strategy generally entails buying the stock of the firm that is to be acquired and selling the stock of the firm that is to be the acquirer to capitalize on pricing spreads based on a successful completion of the announced merger.\n- Event Driven: Event driven managers attempt to profit from significant market events that are nonrecurring, including merger arbitrage, but also can be in the form of spin-offs, share buy-backs, and re-organizations. Because the events are nonrecurring, financial markets typically do not digest the information associated with these transactions in a timely manner.\nThese funds are designed to take advantage of a wide-range of opportunities presented by various markets. Opportunistic strategies typically take directional bets in specific markets or securities. Sub-strategies include:\n- Global Macro: Global macro funds take a macroeconomic investment approach on a global basis. These are top-down managers who invest opportunistically across financial markets, national borders, and commodities."}

This fixture comes with a lot of helpful features.\nWith the help of the Emergency Shut Down and Auto Dim functions, the master controller works as a safety device that automatically adjusts the light and maintains the optimum amount of light. Thanks to the temperature sensor, the Parlux Master Controller has the ability to control the temperature in the grow room, and if there is a rise in temperature, the device will automatically reduce the illumination, and if the temperature rises rapidly to an unacceptable level, the controller will automatically turn off all the lights until optimal temperatures are reached. It also works in the opposite direction, so if the temperature drops below the desired level, the illumination level will increase. Bearing in mind that light plays a major role in plant life, and as needed for proper growth and high yield, the Parlux master controller is designed to operate at a 24-hour time cycle, simulating the sunrise and sunset, gradually turning off and turning on the lights during a certain period of time. With this gradual reduction and enhancement of light, the master controller imitates the nature and environment that is most suitable for your plants.\nExcept that plants will be grateful for providing the most optimal conditions for growth, the function that imitates the sunset and the sunrise, will affect the durability of your master controller, as the gradual start of the light blocks high current speed. With the Parlux master controller and its design, superior performance and functionality, the lighting system in the grow room will function impeccably, thus allowing your plants to grow in excellent conditions ensuring a good harvest. It can control two lighting groups.\nUp to 80 ballasts per group. No need for timers and contactors. Plug and play - portable and very easy to operate.\nMaintains the optimum level of temperature. Nd everything you'd expect from one of the biggest & best Hydroponics stores in the UK."}
{"question":"I keep seeing news about 'the Cabinet' in different countries. What exactly does this term mean when talking about governments around the world?","doc_text":"We also have teams here focused on the local market. We are seeing acceleration in the local market in terms of kinds of projects and the sophistication of those projects. India, by history, would be characterized as a very big, small business market but I think it is transitioning to becoming a large, business market.\nIn your emphasis on the local market, you were ahead of Indian IT firms.\nWe are a 100-year-old company. We see these patterns. All things tend to rise in the world but not at the same pace. There is a phenomenon around technology and its use. It's the enabler of modern society. Countries which make a commitment to become a modern society, a 21st century infrastructure \/business, they are inherently going to make a big commitment to technology. IT tends to grow until it reaches a certain percentage of GDP, then it begins to slow. IT in India has easily grown two-times the GDP.\nIn the near term, what will be the focus areas for IBM in India?\nWe are seeing a shift in India towards more end-toend solutions. We see it in governments and in business. We see them taking on bigger, longer-term, transformational initiatives. There's new commitment to infrastructure. Businesses want to move to best practices, tighter integration, more comprehensive delivery of services with increasing focus on customer loyalty programme.\nAs the Indian middle class grows in size and the amount of disposable incomes rise, businesses of all kinds will be focused on how they service the growing populace of people who have money to spend. Discretionary funds affect banking, retail. These will be huge opportunities in these sectors.\nIBM works closely with private Indian companies. Is the Indian government a big target for you?\nYes. Indian governments\u2014both state and federal. States spend more money than the federal one. The government is our largest industry. Government tends to be many different entities around the world. We sell lots of technology to lots of government. Governments have been big clients of IBM's.\nWill you give us Indiaspecific numbers, especially about your employee count?\nWe are working our way through to the first 1,00,000. India is our second largest country from a population perspective. I would anticipate we will get bigger but not at the rate at which we grew over the past five years. In the product areas we play in, we are typically No."}
{"question":"What are the immediate environmental effects of hurricanes on coastal marshes, and how do these areas help reduce financial losses from storm damage?","doc_text":"First, although the intensity of a hurricane depends on many factors, warmer seawater tends to promote stronger storms. Average sea surface temperatures have been rising, and some parts of the North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico are warmer than average at the moment, which is a key reason why both Harvey and Irma became so strong so quickly.\nSecond, a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapour, which can result in heavier rainfall. That is true not only for hurricanes but also for weaker storms across the world. Even relatively mild tropical storms can cause great damage by dropping huge volumes of rain over one area.\nThird, apart from strong winds and heavy rainfall, hurricanes cause damage through storm surges as their winds push seawater ahead of them. Storm surges can inundate extensive low-lying coastal areas, sweeping away everything in their path. Sea levels have been gradually rising globally, making storm surges bigger and deadlier.\nScientists are still not sure about the other ways in which climate change may be impacting hurricanes. The main reason Harvey created such extreme flooding around Houston was that it stalled over the city and dumped rain for several days without moving on. We do not know if climate change played a role in creating the atmospheric conditions that made that happen.\nNor can we yet predict whether climate change will affect the number of hurricanes that occur every year. Some studies have suggested that while numbers will drop, strengths will increase.\nAlso uncertain is how natural climate variability affects hurricanes. Numbers have increased markedly in the North Atlantic since the 1990s, but this seems to be due, at least partly, to large-scale changes in ocean circulation that occur over many years or decades.\nHowever, it is clear that the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans will be at risk if Trump and his administration continue to deny the existence of climate change and its impact on the threat posed by hurricanes.\nBob Ward is policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science"}
{"question":"geographical regions showing significant decrease marine cartilaginous species","doc_text":"The current study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the H9N2 HA, that includes sequences from all of the geographical regions where H9N2 has been reported. This investigation shows how host species and geographical distribution have shaped the evolution of distinct lineages of H9 HA. This reveals clades that are both geographically and host species dependent. From these analyses new hypotheses can be generated for more specific events such as migrations or intra-species infections.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe complete set of H9N2 hemagglutinin protein sequences were downloaded from the NCBI on the 22nd of May 2013. The search term used for searching the protein database was H9N2 hemagglutinin. The sequences were exported in FASTA format.\nThe complete set of H9N2 hemagglutinin nucleotide sequences were downloaded from the NCBI on the 9th of September 2013. The search term used was ((H9N2 hemagglutinin) NOT precursor) NOT partial. The sequences were downloaded in FASTA format.\nA dataset for the complete set of Korean H9N2 hemagglutinin sequences was downloaded from the NCBI on the 15th of June 2014. The search term used was ((H9N2 hemagglutinin) NOT H5) Korea).\nAfter removal of long truncations (>40 amino-acid residues) as well as a group of sequences that were actually from other AIV subtypes, the final protein dataset contained 2,045 sequences, the final nucleotide dataset contained 1,052 sequences of which the Korean nucleotide subset contained 64 sequences.\nThe edited protein and nucleotide datasets were then broken into sub-groups based on the sequence annotations, using a short text matching program written in Perl. The data was split into subsets based on geographical location and host species.\nThe geographical subsets were based on national boundaries except for China, which was divided into its regions. Where a Chinese region had 10 sequences or less then phylogenetic analysis was not carried out. National borders have been identified as barriers to influenza transmission and so these are appropriate geographical subsets (Wallace & Fitch, 2008). A subset was created for the Americas including all of the North American and the single South American (Argentinian) sequence."}

{"question":"how did commanders injuries affect battle outcomes at cunaxa and drepanum curious about wounded leaders impact","doc_text":"About UsPeripheral nerve surgery is complex from both the diagnostic and management perspectives. Because it is a young field with new techniques constantly in development, few surgeons are exposed to the full range of nerve surgery techniques during training. And after training, few opportunities exist for mastering the full range of those new techniques or for incorporating them into routine practice.\nThis educational website was developed to review established practices and to provide detailed information about many of the newer ideas and techniques now being used in peripheral nerve surgery. Dr. William W. Campbell, Professor and Chairman of the Department of Neurology at the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, through the Comprehensive National Neuroscience Program and the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, provided start-up funds for this project. A key impetus for this project is the urgent need to develop and disseminate better strategies for treating wounded soldiers returning from continuing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nMany advances in medicine stem from a desire to improve outcomes of wounded men and women who sustain devastating injuries from warfare. Some of those injuries to peripheral nerves can lead to loss of function. However, newer techniques \u2013 in particular, nerve transfers \u2013 described on this website can improve patient outcomes by restoring some degree of function. Nerve transfer is but one new modality for treating severely damaged peripheral nerves. This website describes it and many others for treating these challenging problems, and should prove helpful for a range of specialists, including plastic surgeons, neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and general surgeons among the many health care providers taking care of patients with severe peripheral nerve injuries."}
{"question":"how did gunpowder spread from china west","doc_text":"The Great Fire of London was huge, destroying the majority of the city.\nThe great fire swept through the city from Sunday 2nd of September to Wednesday 5th of September 1666. The portion of the city inside the ancient roman walls was completely gutted. It came close to the aristocratic district of Westminster, Whitehall, and most of the suburban slums, but it was extinguished before it reached them.\nSt. Paul's Cathedral was consumed, as were 13,200 houses, and 87 parish churches (out of a total 95).\nAbout 75 thousand people were left homeless.\nOnly 6 people were officially recorded as being killed in the fire, though in reality the number must have been higher. Despite this the real numbers were also traditionally very low, though it is accepted that many refugees did die in the impromptu camps which resulted. Personally i find this surprising, however, I suppose once the fire was in full flow, the whole city knew about it, and fled from the fire as it spread. Despite this though i think the real figure must have been much higher, at least hundreds, and probably thousands. This was 1666, and the real number of people in London would have been impossible to know, many of the missing poor would have gone unreported as missing, and the fire would have been so fierce that remains would have been hard to find, especially under the rubble of the city.\nThe fire started in Thomas Farriner's bakery on pudding lane, in the early hours of the Sunday morning, spreading west across the city. The wind fanned the flames and the fire quickly got out of control. Spreading west, then north the fire spread through the center of the city.\nEventually the strong easterly winds died down, and the firefighting force used gunpowder to demolish buildings in the path of the fire to create effective firebreaks.\nThe Fire put an end to the plague at the time, which is thougth to have actually saved a great many lives.\nThe city was reconstructed on much the same street layout.\nWhat is clear is that many people will have died, and many more would have been displaced, Charles II encouraged refugees to move elsewhere away from London, as the city was not able to cope with the population which wished to stay in the city."}

More importantly, though, this little game allows us to keep our own sense of independence, which is crucial for us to staying happy with ourselves.\n5. Don't Answer To Anyone But Each Other\nA therapist I once worked with told me that worrying a lot about what other people think can be very destructive to a relationship. She suggested my boyfriend and I forget about what the people around us want for us, and instead jot down what we want from each other and from our lives.\nNow, when we feel pressure from the outside to get married or have kids or a certain type of job, we come back to these promises and remind each other that we're the only ones we have to answer to at the end of the day.\n6. Cool Down Before You Sit Down For A Serious Talk\nNine times out of ten, when something nearly unforgivable is said, it's done out of hot and heavy anger. To avoid spouting the worst possible things at one another, someone once told me to walk away when I'm mad and only come back after I've calmed down. When put into practice, it works wonders. Getting all the strong emotions out of the way before we talk helps us move through the conversation quicker than we would if we came to the table boiling with anger.\n7. Never Put Each Other Down In Public\nAlthough there's nothing wrong with innocent teasing every now and then, it's a different beast entirely to embarrass each other when you're in social settings. You should be each other's biggest fans, not one another's enemies. Even if you're not having the best day together, my mom taught me that the worst thing you can do is treat each other like crap in public. Not only does it make everyone else feel uncomfortable as hell, it makes things way, way worse between the two of you.\n8. Don't Take Things So Seriously\nIf there's no laughter, there's no life to the relationship. I doubt there are very many happy, longterm couples out there who don't joke around with each other often and keep things light. I've heard from multiple people that laughing is the key to any healthy romantic relationship, and science agrees. Studies have shown that couples who laugh together more often are happier and more likely to stay together for a long, long time."}

{"question":"original purpose chicago river flow reversal history reason","doc_text":"In 1976 the Churchill River water flow was diverted into the Nelson River at Missi falls at the mouth of South Indian Lake. This diversion, caused the Churchill River to have 15% of the original flow and created controversy stemming mainly from Cree and aboriginal groups concern over their native lands resources.\nAffects on wildlife habitat and communities along the river to the north have never been adequately measured so affects on fish and the beluga whale population are relatively unknown. In Churchill, a weir and marina was constructed as part of the mitigation process by Manitoba Hydro. Although the observation tower the marina gives a nice view of the inlet off the river, the marina gets minimal usage. The weir allows the regulation of water levels south of that point for fishing and boating excursions. The beluga whale population ventures shorter distances up-river in summertime due to the tidal flow and shallow water. This might have had some affects on the population or it may have caused some whales to change habitat location and venture to other estuaries with warm rivers flowing into them. When belugas give birth and nurture their young they have an easier time with the moderate temperature warm waters flowing from the south.\nI can\u2019t imagine what the flow of the Churchill River would be like at 85% more pressure. Guiding over a decade of Churchill Arctic summer seasons I have experienced just about every type of conditions on the river and in the Hudson Bay. Although higher water flow would not have a profound affect within the main part of the river, the mouth and inlets would be very different at tidal changes. It\u2019s very tricky at times to maneuver through the mouth of the river due to the currents and topography below. With more flow this could be easier or harder but would most likely have a bearing on fish and whales. Inlets and calving\/ nurseries would be larger and deeper farther up-river\u2026that is a surety.\nThe affects on southern communities associated with the diversion have been quite harmful in many instances. South Indian Lake was forced to relocate and has since lost most of their original one million pound whitefish production\u2026down to 100,000 pounds at last count.In the end, the benefits of the diversion and Nelson River power plants output have not been without issues.

Based on rainfall gauge data over 36 years (1981\u20132016), a frequency analysis was performed for this basin to understand and evaluate its overall flood risk; daily rainfall measurements of 119 rain gauge stations within the basin were considered. Four common probability distributions, i.e., Log-Normal (LOG), Gumbel type-I (GUM), Pearson type-III (PE3), and Log-Pearson type-III (LP3) distributions, were used to calculate the return period of rainfall at each station and at the basin-scale level. Results of each distribution were compared with the graphical Gringorten method to analyze their performance; GUM was found to be the best-fitted distribution among the four. Thereafter, design hyetographs were developed by integrating the return period of rainfall based on three adopted methods at basin and subbasin scales; each method had its pros and cons for hydrological applications. Finally, utilizing a Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model, we estimated the possible flood inundation extent and depth, which was outlined over the Chao Phraya River Basin using the design hyetographs with different return periods. This study can help enhance disaster resilience at industrial complexes in Thailand for sustainable growth."}

{"question":"I've been working with low concentration aerosols and struggling with particle deposition - what techniques are available to measure and increase the deposited dose in exposure systems?","doc_text":"Thin film deposition processes can be broadly classified into two groups: those that involve a chemical reaction, and those that are deposited by means of physical sputtering.\nSome of the more specific types of deposition processes commonly used in semiconductor technology are Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), Epitaxy, Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), and Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD). At each device level during the manufacturing cycle the wafer typically undergoes multiple process steps that deposit films of various materials such as oxide, nitride, polysilicon, and single-crystal silicon, each with different material properties such as crystalline structure and chemical composition.\nThe quality and thickness control of the thin films is critical to the chip performance and reliability. Furthermore, it can define the performance of the subsequent processing steps, making it essential that key characteristics of the deposition process are monitored and controlled. For example, film thickness uniformity after deposition impacts the performance of subsequent chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) steps. With tightening process windows, thickness control is needed both at deposition and at CMP steps.\nAnother example where the monitoring and control of film properties is essential relates to the transistor channel consisting of silicon and silicon germanium layers. For some devices these layers are measured on planar stacks, but for others they must be measured on complex 2D or 3D structures. In addition, germanium content in the silicon germanium layers must be controlled\u2014a measurement made even more challenging for those devices that have multiple silicon germanium layers, each with a different germanium concentration. Nova\u2019s in-line x-ray and optical solutions address these challenges using precise, accurate, and non-destructive metrology.\nNova\u2019s in-line x-ray-based metrology solutions are used to extract post-deposition dimensional and material information from structures. For example, our surface-sensitive x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) systems can measure thickness and chemical composition of ultra-thin films. Nova\u2019s in-line XPS is a key enabling metrology in many modules across logic, 3D NAND, and DRAM devices. Our XPS systems can measure film stacks with multiple dielectric and metal layers having nanometer-level thicknesses, without layer-to-layer cross-talk that can negatively affect accuracy.\nIn addition, our in-line low-energy x-ray fluorescence (LE-XRF) technology supplements our XPS metrology by providing additional thickness and material information by quantifying the amount of various atomic species present in a structure."}

Earlier this year, he declined to give a hearing to a bill that sought to further narrow the clergy exemption.\nPiercing the confidentiality that surrounds confessions would invite a First Amendment clash, said Ron Johnson, executive director of the Arizona Catholic Conference.\n\u201cBasically, it\u2019s the government regulating a sacrament,\u201d he said.\nCourts have largely upheld the clergy exemption.\nA January decision from the Montana Supreme Court concluded that Jehovah\u2019s Witness elders who learned of a member\u2019s repeated sex abuse were not required to report the abuse to authorities \u201cbecause their church doctrine, canon, or practice required that clergy keep reports of child abuse confidential.\u201d The man had for nine years abused two of his stepchildren as well as his stepgranddaughter.\nCalls for change\nIn recent years, adult survivors of child abuse and others have pushed to overturn these exceptions. They argue the laws allow child abuse to continue, when in other circumstances \u2014 such as a teacher who reports abuse \u2014 there is the opportunity to stop the perpetrator before further harm is done.\nLegislation introduced this year in Arizona and Utah, and last year in California, sought to remove or modify the clergy-penitent exception. The bills failed, but the sponsors say they'll try again."}
{"question":"What are the main symptoms someone should look out for to know if they are getting dehydrated from gastroenteritis?","doc_text":"What is influenza?\nInfluenza is a respiratory infection caused by the influenza virus. It is spread through respiratory droplets. After you are exposed to someone who has the flu it takes 1-4 days before you start showing symptoms. Usually it causes sudden onset of severe headache, body-ache, fever, runny nose, and cough. While you are sick with the flu, and even a day before you get sick, you are contagious, meaning you can pass the virus along to others if you have close enough contact.\nInfluenza is commonly called \u2018the flu\u2019 which is differentiated from common cold symptoms by the severity of body aches and fever. It is also different from the stomach flu or gastroenteritis, which is the vomiting and diarrhea viral illness that is often referred to as the flu.\nWhat should I expect if I get sick?\nThe symptoms will resolve after a week or so and most people will recover fully without any specific treatment for the flu. There are antiviral medications available to treat the flu (Tami flu & Relenza are two) but these only shorten the course of being sick by a day or two; their use should be minimized to prevent the flu virus from developing resistance to the medication. These medications are more effective if you start them as soon as possible after you develop flu symptoms and do almost no good if you have been sick for more than 72 hours. Like a cold, the cause of the infection is a virus and antibiotics will not get you better any faster unless you develop a secondary bacterial infection like pneumonia.\nWhile you are sick, it is best to stay home and treat your symptoms with tylenol or ibuprofen, drink plenty of fluids and rest. This will allow your body to recuperate and heal itself while preventing others from getting ill.\nOccasionally, people get quite ill and every year people die from influenza. Usually these deaths occur in the very young and very old, or people with chronic medical conditions. Last year, there was a higher than expected percentage of deaths in normally healthy individuals due to the H1N1 strain of influenza.\nIf your breathing becomes difficult at any point while you have influenza, you must see your doctor or go to an urgent care or ER for an evaluation to check your oxygen saturation, maybe get a flu test, or a chest x-ray to make sure you don\u2019t have a bacterial pneumonia which can be a complication of influenza.\nHow do I prevent it?"}

However, 1 pump out of 2 is regularly out of service. \u201cThis existing situation implies more time-consuming and exhausting water chores, has a high cost for the pump upkeep, affects the health conditions and contributes to the rural exodus\u201d, states Nicolaas VAN DER WILK, Operations Manager of UDUMA MALI. Furthermore, boreholes made unusable by defective pumps represent nearly 66 billion CFA francs (100 million euros) in lost public investments.\nMobile technologies at the heart of the UDUMA model\nThe project, under the tutelage of the Malian Ministry for Energy and Water, is offering an alternative to this situation for the Sikasso region. The Malian local authorities are going to entrust the management and the operation of 1.400 water points equipped with manual pumps to the private operator UDUMA MALI. The operator guarantees a continuous water service (72-hour max downtime) for at least 15 years and renews a large part of the equipment.\nUDUMA MALI will be charging a fixed user fee per consumed volume (500 CFA francs\/m3, 0.76 euro). The water pumps will be equipped with digital water meters. The water service is provided by a caretaker (1 on each pump) and a mechanic (1 per 50 pumps), whose remunerations evolve with water consumptions. The new water service delivery model is expected to create small-scale income-generating activities for nearly 1.500 women in the Sikasso Region.\nThe GSMA M4D Utilities Innovation Fund grant will enable UDUMA MALI to deploy mobile-enabled devices for cashless revenue collection, combining Mobile Money and Near Field Communication (NFC) technologies."}
{"question":"reframing negative thoughts psychological therapy methods low versus high income","doc_text":"Patients with eating disorders have also been found to have problematic personality traits such as perfectionism, neuroticism, obsessionality, negative emotionality, harm avoidance, low self-directedness, low cooperativeness, avoidant personality disorder, high constraint, high persistence, low novelty-seeking, high impulsivity, sensation-seeking, and borderline personality disorder (Vitousek and Manke, 1994; Cassin and von Ranson, 2005). The disordered eating behavior seems like one more comorbid symptom of a complex psychological disorder.\nOf course, psychological factors matter. It is trivial to acknowledge that behavioral disturbances like eating problems may sometimes arise in response to complex or stressful situations which also generate psychological disturbances. It is equally obviously true that an individual will not engage in treatment at all without making a decision to pursue recovery, and that this decision-making is in part a psychological act. Given the ambivalence with which most people with eating disorders view both their illness and the possibility and desirability of recovery (Williams and Reid, 2010), this decision must not be taken for granted, either prior to the start of behavior change in treatment or at any point in the ongoing decision-making required to sustain change through treatment and in post-treatment life. But acknowledging the significance of these psychological factors is quite different from claiming that the \u201creal\u201d and \u201cunderlying\u201d problem is a psychological one, for example at the level of enduring traits, and that treatment must proceed accordingly. As described above, the stronger claim has not yielded effective psychologically based treatments. In the rest of this section, therefore, we investigate five specific forms of reasoning that underpin it, and what makes these approaches both attractive and problematic.\nCorrelation Versus Causation\nOne reason why the psychological story persists despite its failure to generate effective treatments may be a confusion of correlation and causation. As noted, a multitude of correlations have been observed between eating disorders and other psychological problems. Once a correlation has been observed, a sensible next step is often to investigate possible causal links. Anxiety in general, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as a specific expression of anxiety, are amongst the most common focal points for research on the causes of eating disorders (Matsunaga et al., 1999; Levinson et al., 2019)."}

{"question":"regular vs changing dividend payments impact on company value advantages disadvantages","doc_text":"What is a debt buyback offer?\nA debt takeover bid occurs when a company redeems some or all of its outstanding bonds or other debt securities. This is accomplished by making an offer to its creditors to buy back a predetermined number of bonds at a specified price and for a specified period of time.\nCompanies can use a debt tender offer as a mechanism for restructuring or refinancing capital. It is similar to a public tender offer, where a company solicits shareholders to buy back the shares of the company.\nKey points to remember\n- A debt tender offer is a public solicitation of bondholders of a company asking them to resell their bonds or debt securities at a specified price and for a certain period of time.\n- Companies will consider a takeover bid when interest rates fall, making the cost of borrowing cheaper than holding onto older bonds at higher fixed coupons.\n- The takeover bid may be made in cash or by exchanging old bonds for newly issued debt securities of equivalent value.\nUnderstanding debt buyback offers\nWhen a company issues debt securities such as bonds, it receives a capital loan from the investors who buy it. To compensate these creditors for the borrowed funds, the issuer will typically pay regular interest or coupons to the holders of the debt in addition to promising to repay the principal when the bond matures.\nInterest payments, which are often fixed, represent a cost of debt for the issuer. It is possible that prevailing interest rates in the economy will change during the life of the bond. When interest rates rise, the value of existing bonds decreases since the coupon rate is lower than the prevailing interest rate. Similarly, when interest rates in the economy decline, issuers will be forced to pay the higher coupon rates attached to the bond unless they restructure their debt securities.\nOne method of debt restructuring to take advantage of lower borrowing costs is to make a public debt tender offer to bondholders. In other words, corporate bond issuers are turning to debt takeover bids as a way to eliminate or reduce over-leveraged, risky or high-cost capital structures.\nAlthough tenders have many advantages, they have some disadvantages. A takeover bid can be a long and expensive process, as custodian banks verify the bonds presented and issue payments on behalf of the creditors.\nTypes of takeover bids\nA debt tender offer is an opportunity for an issuing company to redeem its existing bonds at a price below the original face value and, therefore, reduce its related interest costs."}

Our work on these topics has included the publication of studies and reports; assistance to federal and state administrative and legislative bodies with responsibility over elections; and, when necessary, participation in litigation to compel states to comply with their obligations under federal law and the Constitution. We submit this testimony today in our capacity as national advocates of voting rights committed to (1) preventing efforts, such as Florida\u2019s H.B. 1355 (alternatively \u201cthe Law\u201d), to constrict voter registration and participation and (2) promoting improvements that will make our election system secure and accessible to all eligible Americans.\nThe harm caused by HB 1355 to Florida voters and community-based voter registration groups is so severe that several organizations and individuals have been forced to turn to the courts for relief.

{"question":"safety rules near sparks welder","doc_text":"How to Pick the Right Welder Technical School near Somerton Arizona\nFinding the right welding trade school near Somerton AZ is an important first step to starting your new career as a professional welder. But since there are numerous schools to pick from, how do you determine which ones to consider? And more significantly, once you have narrowed down your options, how do you pick the right one? Most people start by looking at the schools that are closest to their residences. Once they have found those that are within commuting distance, they are drawn toward the cheapest one. Yes, location and the cost of tuition are important concerns when reviewing welding technical schools, but they are not the only ones. Other factors include such things as accreditation, reputation and job placement rates. So before beginning your search for a trade school to become a welder, it\u2019s sensible to establish a list of qualifications that your chosen school must have. But before we examine our due diligence checklist, let\u2019s cover a little bit about how to become a welder.\nWelding Certificate and Degree Training\nThere are multiple options to receive training as a welder in a technical or trade school. You can receive a diploma, a certificate or an Associate Degree. Bachelor Degrees are offered in Welding Technology or Welding Engineering, but are more advanced degrees than most journeyman welders will need. Some programs are also made available in conjunction with an apprenticeship program. Below are short summaries of the most typical welding programs offered in the Somerton AZ.\n- Certificate and Diploma Programs are generally made available by technical and trade schools and take about 1 year to finish. They are more hands-on training in nature, fashioned mainly to develop welding skills. They can provide a good foundation for a new journeyman or apprentice welder, or supplemental skills for working welders.\n- Associate Degree Programs will take 2 years to complete and are usually offered by community colleges. An Associate Degree in Welding Technology offers a more extensive education than the diploma or certificate while still providing the foundation that prepares students to enter the workforce.\nSome municipalities and states do have licensing requirements for welders, therefore don\u2019t forget to find out for your location of future employment. As needed, the welder school you select should prep you for any licensing exams that you will need to pass in addition to providing the proper training to become a qualified welder."}
{"question":"How do little tunnels made by worms in the ground help plants and the soil?","doc_text":"One of the best companion plants for peppers is marigolds. These easy-to-grow flowers attract bumblebees, which are useful for pollination. They also serve as an effective barrier against the wind, preventing pepper plants from toppling over. Similarly, French marigolds are reputed to boost the flavor of peppers, while attracting pollinators to increase their yields.\nAlthough it\u2019s a good idea to plant cowpeas next to peppers, they may be incompatible. Cowpeas tend to attract Green Stink Bugs, which prefers hot pepper plants to other plants. While cowpeas may be beneficial, you\u2019ll need to wait two years before you can plant them next to peppers. Another great companion plant is lettuce, which is unobtrusive in the garden and won\u2019t compete with the pepper\u2019s deeper roots. Additionally, lettuce will shade the ground surrounding pepper plants, which will prevent weeds from growing.\nWhat Are Companion Plants?\nCompanion planting is an effective method to grow vegetables and other types of plants in close proximity to peppers. These plants will increase the health and yields of your pepper plants while at the same time attracting beneficial insects and pollinators to the garden. Peppers are sensitive to pests and diseases, so choosing companion plants that are not a threat to the pepper plant will ensure a healthy crop and less damage to your plants.\nIn the garden, lettuce, and spinach are excellent companions for peppers. These plants do not compete for nutrients and reduce weeds around pepper plants. The lettuce also helps peppers retain moisture and reduces the amount of shade that they receive. Tomatoes and peppers are part of the nightshade family, so avoiding plants in the Brassica family will prevent peppers from thriving. Lastly, peppers benefit from the shade of herbs.\nPeppers thrive in moist soil, so pairing them with a variety of plants that benefit the soil and the peppers will help to prevent insect pests. Companion plants will also help to prevent dry summers. Some plants are ideal for this purpose: they will protect the pepper from slugs and cabbage worms, while other plants will help peppers to produce high-quality fruits and vegetables.\nBest Companion Plants For Peppers\nAmong the many companion plants for peppers, basil and parsley are excellent choices. They help trap aphids and encourage predators. These are some of the best companion plants for peppers. Choose yours based on your personal preference! And don\u2019t be afraid to experiment!"}

{"question":"found article about early paralympics history want know where first international event for disabled athletes","doc_text":"|North Korean athletes and officials for the PyeongChang Paralympic Winter Games wasl through the PyeongChang Athletes\u2019 Village in Gangwon on Thursday. [YONHAP]|\nOver the next nine days 570 athletes from 49 countries, the most athletes to ever compete at a Winter Paralympics, will descend on Pyeongchang County, Gangwon, and the surrounding area to compete on snow and ice, pushing themselves to the limit in the pursuit of an elusive gold medal.\nHeading to the Games with 36 athletes, Korea hopes to win its first-ever gold at the Paralympics, while its goal for the overall medal standing is to place 10th.\nNorth Korea will also attend the Games, its first time competing at a Winter Paralympics, sending two athletes - skiers Kim Jong-hyon and Ma Yu-chol.\nAt the Paralympics, athletes will compete in 80 events across six sports - alpine skiing, cross country skiing, biathlon, ice hockey, wheelchair curling and snowboard.\nAlthough the events at the Paralympics are similar in concept to Olympic sports, the rules are noticeably different. Paralympians are assigned categories based on their impairment. These classifications determine which athlete is eligible to compete in which event and how they are scored. As different sports require different physical activities, classifications are specific to each style of event.\nLike the Olympics, the Games will begin and end with official ceremonies.\nThe opening ceremony, which begins tonight at 8 p.m., will officially declare the start of nine days of sports and spectacle, and at the center of it all are the athletes.\n\u201cI have always been a sport addict. Until [I was] 16 years old, I practiced gymnastics at a high level, but with my handicap I always experienced difficulties with the beam that I couldn\u2019t see properly. I used to fall a lot,\u201d explained Eleonor Sana, a visually impaired alpine skier from Belgium.\nIn visually impaired events, athletes race with a guide runner. The guide wears a brightly colored vest with the letter \u201cG\u201d emblazoned on it and both the guide and the athlete have wireless communication devices attached to their helmet so they can communicate to navigate the course.\nIn these events, trust between the athlete and the guide is crucial."}

Stay out of trouble by knowing when to call a pro.\nAs the seasons change, so to do the needs of the vehicle. Knowing how to prepare the car for the harsh cold and wet conditions of winter is as important as getting ready for the heat of summer. Likewise, driver adjustments maximize the benefit gained from changes in hardware.\nBy design, preventative maintenance tasks are designed to reduce wear, increase efficiency, and prevent costly breakdowns. These are some tips for prolonging the life of the vehicle. Learn how to change fluids, preserve the paint and plastics, operate the vehicle in a systems-friendly fashion and make evaluations during use in order to proactively manage vehicle longevity.\nA compelling reason to update an older vehicle is the remarkable increase in safety technologies in modern cars. Put modern technology to work by understanding and selecting the features that increase vehicle safety. Further, understand those systems so that their use increases driver awareness and reduces the risk of collisions or accidents. Also, understand the limitations of modern safety systems.\nVehicle ownership presents some common issues that are worth understanding. Changing a tire, for example, is a skill required at some point for nearly all drivers. Considering the common issues and how to prevent or handle them is the aim of this chapter. Change a tire, evaluate the brakes, add fluids, replace the wipers or jump start a car with ease.\nSome sounds, smells, warning lights or vibrations are basically harmless warnings that do not require immediate attention. Others are signs that severe damage is being done or is about to be done to the vehicle. Understanding the warning signs that indicate a need for immediate service will reduce the likelihood of operating with a severely damaged vehicle."}

Her potent voice is more suited to the opera stage or recital platform than to the choir loft. But the rest of Western classical music seems to be her oyster.\nWinner of the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s National Council Auditions in 2007, the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Competition in 2013, and the Richard Tucker Award last April, the Houston Opera Studio alumna has sung in opera houses and concert halls all over the world. Her repertoire ranges widely, from Monteverdi, Bach, and Handel through Mozart, the bel canto era, Verdi, and Wagner on up to Honegger, Menotti, Poulenc, Bernstein, Previn, Rorem, Hoiby, and Heggie. But like many mezzo-sopranos of recent times \u2014 think Cecilia Bartoli, Joyce DiDonato, and Vivica Genaux \u2014 she seems to have a special affection and affinity for Baroque composers.\nThus, she has become something of a house mezzo for Ars Lyrica Houston, which specializes in historically informed performances of music from the 17th and 18th centuries. Her work with the ensemble \u2014 founded in 1998 by harpsichordist, conductor, and University of Houston Moores School of Music professor Matthew Dirst \u2014 has focused on some rarely performed pieces. The group has used her as soloist on its recordings for Sono Luminus of Domenico Scarlatti\u2019s comic intermezzo La Dirindina and Hasse\u2019s Antonio e Cleopatra, the latter garnering a Best Opera Recording Grammy nomination in 2011. But Barton and the 13-member Ars Lyrica ensemble climbed a little further out of the musical weeds on Sept. 13 with a program devoted to Vivaldi, Gluck, Handel, and Haydn.\nConducting from the harpsichord, Dirst got the Baroque ball rolling with the Ouverture, Allegro, and Gigue and the opening aria \u201cOmbra mai fu\u201d from Handel\u2019s Serse."}

{"question":"How do urban wetlands manage nitrogen pollution and affect air quality?","doc_text":"Signed into law by President Bush on November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 enhanced existing programs and created new regulatory initiatives. Historically, the Clean Air Act addressed only major sources of air pollution and areas with severe air quality problems. Three elements of the 1990 Amendments however may have serious impact on smaller emission sources and small business, in general. These include Title I provisions designed to remedy chronic non-attainment (\"dirty air\") areas, Title III prohibitions on the emissions of hazardous air pollutants, and the Title V operating permit program.\nTitle I Non-Attainment Provisions\nOzone pollution, also referred to as \"urban smog,\" is the most prevalent air quality problem today. It is caused by emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides associated primarily with urban areas and heavy industry. The 1990 Amendments redesignated the ozone non-attainment areas based upon the severity of the ozone pollution. The \"non-attainment\" designation means that levels of ozone in a particular geographic area exceed the federal standard. At the top of the list, with the worst ozone problem is Los Angeles, which is the only \"extreme\" ozone non-attainment area. Four other classifications of more general application consist of \"severe,\" \"serious,\" \"moderate,\" and \"marginal.\"\nThe redesignation by severity of pollution was accompanied by a reduction in the amount of emissions that will subject a particular source to stringent new control requirements. Before the 1990 Amendments, only sources with potential to emit more than 100 tons per year of VOCs were affected by the non-attainment program requirements. Much smaller sources of VOC emissions are not included within the regulatory program. In \"moderate\" and \"serious\" non-attainment areas, facilities that emit 50 tons of VOCs will now be subject to emission controls. In \"severe\" areas, which include the Chicago metropolitan area, sources that emit 25 tons of VOCs per year will become regulated.\nIn the \"extreme\" non-attainment area of Los Angeles, sources that emit as little as 10 tons per year of VOCs will be included.\nNew sources that intend to locate in ozone non-attainment areas, and which emit VOCs in amounts exceeding specific thresholds, are subject to the most stringent requirements."}

{"question":"How fast can an E. coli bacteria swim?","doc_text":"And they actually rewound the tape, and they went back to that particular line of bacteria end evolved citric eaters all over again. The kind of research that Lenski is doing is important not just to answer some of the basic questions about life but to answer some important questions about our own health. E. coli and other bacteria can make us sick, and in World War II scientists developed antibiotics to kill them and it seemed like magic bullets. The problem was that the scientists discovered very quickly that E. coli and other bacteria were becoming resistant. They were evolving resistance because the mutants that could resist a little bit were doing better than the susceptible ones and over time, it became more and more resistant. So now today scientists are trying to develop new kinds of antibiotics to overcome this resistance. You know, they are trying to find these drugs that maybe bacteria have not evolved resistance to, and they found some really promising ones. For example, they found the [that] frogs in their skin made this new totally different kind of antibiotic and first it seemed like it was indeed the magic bullet that there was no way that bacteria could evolve resistance to it, but scientists decided to run [an] experiment where they exposed E. coli to a little bit of this frog drug and then a little bit more and little bit more, and sure enough the E. coli evolved resistance to it in the lab. So even before this drug makes it to the market, we already know that we have to be very careful in dealing with the evolution of resistance.\nAnother thing about life is that, as Darwin argued, life forms a tree. So he envisioned species branching of from each other through natural selection, and here is actually where those E. coli that make you sick come into the story. So, most of the strains of E. coli that you will encounter are perfectly harmless and you have got probably about 30 of them inside of you right now; but there are some that are very nasty. So these are the kinds that contaminate spinach and hamburger. Their name is E. coli 0157:H7 and when they get into you, what they do is they build a needle and inject toxins into your cells in your intestines and [your] cells form these bizarre pedestals almost kind of like this throne you are making for this bacteria that is making you sick."}

Benefits outweigh risk if a second PE is predicted to be life-threatening; however, few clinical trial data are available. A filter is most clearly indicated in patients who have:\nBecause venous collaterals can develop, providing a pathway for emboli to circumvent the IVCF, and because filters occasionally thrombose, patients with recurrent DVT or nonmodifiable risk factors for DVT may still require anticoagulation. An IVCF is placed in the inferior vena cava just below the renal veins via catheterization of an internal jugular or femoral vein. Most IVCFs are removable. Occasionally, a filter dislodges and may migrate up the venous bed, even to the heart, and needs to be removed or replaced. A filter can also become thrombosed, causing bilateral venous congestion (including acute phlegmasia cerulea dolens) in the leg, lower body ischemia, and acute kidney injury.\nIntermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) with SCDs provides rhythmic external compression to the legs or to the legs and thighs. It is more effective for preventing calf than proximal DVT. It is insufficient as sole prophylaxis after hip or knee replacement but is often used in low-risk patients after other types of surgery or in medical patients who have a low-risk of DVT or who are at high risk of bleeding. IPC can theoretically trigger PE in immobilized patients who have developed occult DVT while not receiving DVT prophylaxis.\nGraded elastic compression stockings are likely less effective than external pneumatic leg compression, but one systematic meta-analysis suggested that they reduced the incidence of DVT in postoperative patients from 26% in the control group to 13% in the compression stockings group.\nAfter surgical procedures with a high incidence of DVT\/PE, low dose unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or adjusted-dose warfarin is recommended.\nAfter orthopedic surgery of the hip or knee, additional options include the newer oral anticoagulants, rivaroxaban and apixaban.

Manyin\nSpecialist in Asian Affairs\nSince the mid-1990s, tensions have spiked periodically among Japan, China, and Taiwan over the disputed Senkaku (Diaoyu\/Diaoyutai) islets in the East China Sea. These flare-ups run the risk of involving the United States in an armed conflict in the region. Japan administers the eight small, uninhabited islets, which some geologists believe sit near significant oil and natural gas deposits. China and Taiwan both contest Japanese claims of sovereignty over the islets.\nU.S. administrations going back at least to the Nixon Administration have stated that the United States takes no position on the territorial disputes. However, it also has been U.S. policy since 1972 that the 1960 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty covers the islets, because Article 5 of the treaty stipulates that the United States is bound to protect \u201cthe territories under the Administration of Japan\u201d and Japan administers the Senkakus (Diaoyu Islands). Under the treaty, the United States guarantees Japan\u2019s security in return for the right to station U.S. troops\u2014which currently number around 50,000\u2014in dozens of bases throughout the Japanese archipelago.

{"question":"How does the Index of Urban Green Zones Allergenicity work?","doc_text":"by Corine Laan (Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences) and Nanda Piersma (Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and CWI)\nParks are necessary for sustainable urban vitality. We studied the optimal availability of parks by combining open data sets with polygons and classification frameworks from urban planning literature. Both distance and population density should be considered as measures of availability when planning urban parks.\nUrban green spaces may have a historic origin or be planned in cities for purposes such as maintaining biodiversity, recreation, health, climate control, amelioration of air pollution and fire protection. Parks and their facilities may be owned and maintained either by municipalities or private parties. Studies show a positive relationship between the availability of parks and the health and the wellbeing of residents.\nThe evaluation of urban green space has been studied from different perspectives, including city planning, user appreciation, availability and accessibility, and its function in the urban context. Many case studies from these perspectives have given city planners and municipalities tools to manage urban green spaces in their cities.\nThe classification and evaluation of urban green spaces has commonly accepted indicators such as availability and accessibility [R1]. Availability is defined here as a quantification of green spaces (in size and distance) without consideration of public availability or proximity to residential locations (WHO2016). Accessibility is defined as a quantification of green space availability to general or specified public groups in relation to distance, expressed in service radius, or neighbourhood green index.\nWith the availability of more and new data sources on green urban areas, the classification framework for urban green spaces can be further developed and detailed. Global data also enables the framework to be generalised and standardised to overcome case-specific city characteristics.\nIn our research, we include the park size and population density within the catchment area of the parks as an indicator of availability of urban parks. The case study of Amsterdam shows that including park size and population density provides a radically different availability score of parks.\nThe indicators are modelled in an interactive dashboard for the Amsterdam case.\nThe Amsterdam case\nWe use open data, provided by the Municipality of Amsterdam, and consider urban parks that are open to the public and maintained by the municipality. The parks are denoted by polygons in line with another data set from the Copernicus urban atlas data for Europe [L1]. The polygons are plotted on a 100 x 100 m grid of the city of Amsterdam."}

Your leadership team--supervisors, managers and executives--plays a vital role in ensuring employee performance levels remain high. This is a challenge for many leaders; however, it's one that can be resolved. With effective leadership, your work force can prove to be your organization's most valuable resource.\nJot down the differences and similarities among the employees who report to you, and draft an action plan for acknowledging those differences as well as the similarities. Use this planning technique to identify goals for your employees, according to their skills, aptitude and capabilities. One of the traits of an outstanding leader is the ability to develop effective interpersonal communication skills that adapt to the varied work styles, culture and needs of employees. Management and leadership are two separate functions; however, to become a good manager, your leadership style needs to be one that acknowledges the strengths in the different personalities and skills within your work force. An effective manager works to adapt her style so it works for the entire work force, not just a select few employees. Attention to the needs of a diverse work force will encourage your employees to perform well.\nExhibit behavior that your employees will emulate; modeling behavior is likely the best way to train employees in the nuances of professionalism in the workplace. When workplace professionalism becomes standard procedure, employee performance improves because your work force is proud of the manner in which they perform duties and interact with internal and external customers. Employees are most likely to exceed job expectations when they have a sense of pride in their work. In addition, praise employees for their efforts and for a job well done. Providing regular feedback to employees is another trait that true leaders and effective managers possess.\nReward employees whose performance exceeds expectations and develop performance improvement plans for employees whose performance falls below expectations. Work together with your employees to construct plans that will enhance skill sets and prepare them for future roles within your organization. Investing the time and energy in developing your work force has significant returns. In addition to improving performance, this leadership activity demonstrates you have a vested interest in your employees. This can increase job satisfaction, which can, in turn, raise the level of job satisfaction among your work force.\nCommunicate with your work force on a continual basis."}
{"question":"How should I maintain batteries, both for storage and cleaning?","doc_text":"The need to completely transform our global energy system in response to the threat of climate change is an undertaking that demands technological, policy, and market innovation. It is easy during these times of unprecedented change to become fixated on equally unprecedented technologies. However, sometimes the best solution to a new problem is to simply rethink the tools already at hand.\nRecently, I have been reminded of this fact by a remarkably unremarkable method of energy storage: gravity. Approximately 99% of grid-connected energy storage currently in use in the United States is pumped hydro, a system that uses gravity\u2019s pull to draw water through a turbine. This method of storage is both cheaper and longer-lasting than batteries. That said, pumped hydro is constrained in its ability to meet the energy storage demands of a zero-carbon, renewables-dominated grid. It has relatively poor electrical efficiency, it requires many acres of land, and must be sited where there is a natural gradient in elevation. It requires an enormous amount of water, a precious and limited resource in many regions.\nFortunately, gravity is impartial, and our storage systems need not be limited to the movement of water. Two start-up companies\u2014Gravitricity and Energy Vault\u2014believe that the gravitational potential energy of solid mass may hold the key to sustainable and economical storage of energy. These companies have subtly different designs: one proposes dropping a heavy weight down old mine shafts; the other proposes stacking hundreds of concrete bricks into a tower. But the fundamental concept is the same: pull something up with excess energy, and then generate electricity through a winch and generator as it falls.\nMany of us are inclined to think that the best solution to the immense challenge of energy storage has to come from a groundbreaking development in batteries or hydrogen production. Perhaps this is a foolish mistake. Based on the technology available to us right now, deceptively simple gravity systems may be one of our most versatile options and could solve many of the limitations inherent in other methods of storage.\n- This technology is efficient. Energy Vault says that their system could reach 90% electrical efficiency, compared to approximately 70% for pumped hydro storage and ~35% for reversible fuel cell technology.\n- This technology should last for decades, and individual components could be easily replaced should they fail. This is also true for pumped hydro storage, but is a serious limitation of modern lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells which typically last for fewer than 10 years, depending on usage."}

{"question":"plutonium waste treatment decontamination effectiveness","doc_text":"In many cases, this may provide a desirable factor of safety. In other cases, it may lead to the expensive over-engineering of a system or unwarranted increases in operational costs. Laboratory research has also determined that air temperature, relative humidity, flow rate, lamp design, and ballast engineering have significant impacts on the effectiveness of these systems. Furthermore, the location of the decontamination UV array is of crucial importance because of the potential for air eddies and corners of ducting to allow some of the flow to pass through untreated. HVAC systems designers and control contractors will have to factor these components into their plans, and base decontamination systems designs on tested parameters in order to ensure maximum effectiveness. Because of the constant airflow in modern ventilation systems, making this work in an HVAC system requires coordination between dampers (in order to slow the passage of the air enough to allow all particles to receive a sanitizing ray of UV light) and the UV light itself. While this kind of attention to detail might not be necessary in installations primarily concerned with improving the day-to-day healthiness of air, in order to control the spread of a deadly bio-terrorist pathogen (such as anthrax or smallpox) the design of a UVGI system is of critical importance.\nThe effectiveness of UV light as a germicidal agent has resulted in two other techniques for decontamination. Pulsed UV (PUV) involves pulsing UV lamps at high power at regular intervals. This technology is being increasingly applied for air and surface sterilization and decontamination due to the powerful use of advanced UV light lamps and efficient energy consumption. This is a procedure, which appears to have certain advantages of very high inactivation rates for most known microorganisms. PUV is also effective on very hazardous and \"hard-to-break\" toxic organic compounds and odors from water, air, or surfaces without producing ozone at a very high speed. These systems use mercury-free flash lamps that emit pulses at such high energy that the cells are actually physically destroyed. To have this mechanism work, the rate of the energy deposition into a microorganism (the fluency rate) must be higher than its rate of cooling to a surrounding media. In this case, a microorganism undergoes momentous overheating and disintegration."}

{"question":"How much did it cost to send a letter before 1840?","doc_text":"This article needs additional citations for verification. (April 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nPhilately (\/\/; fi-LAT-\u0259-lee) is the study of postage stamps and postal history. It also refers to the collection, appreciation and research activities on stamps and other philatelic products. Philately involves more than just stamp collecting or the study of postage; it is possible to be a philatelist without owning any stamps. For instance, the stamps being studied may be very rare or reside only in museums.\nThe word \"philately\" is the English transliteration of the French \"philat\u00e9lie\", coined by Georges Herpin in 1864. Herpin stated that stamps had been collected and studied for the previous six or seven years and a better name was required for the new hobby than timbromanie (roughly \"stamp quest\"), which was disliked. The alternative terms \"timbromania\", \"timbrophily\" and \"timbrology\" gradually fell out of use as philately gained acceptance during the 1860s. He took the Greek root word \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb(\u03bf)- phil(o)-, meaning \"an attraction or affinity for something\", and \u1f00\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 ateleia, meaning \"exempt from duties and taxes\" to form \"philatelie\".\nAs a collection field, philately appeared after the introduction of the postage stamps in 1840, but did not gain large attraction until the mid-1850s. Some authors believe that the first philatelist appeared on the day of the release of the world's first postage stamp, dated to May 6, 1840, when the Liverson, Denby and Lavie London law office sent a letter to Scotland franked with ten uncut Penny Blacks, stamped with the postmark \u201cLS.6MY6. 1840.\" In 1992 at an auction in Zurich, this envelope was sold for 690 thousand francs.\nAlready in 1846, cases of collecting stamps in large numbers were known in England. However, without reason for collection, stamps at this time were used for pasting wallpaper. The first philatelist is considered to be a postmaster going by Mansen, who lived in Paris, and in 1855 had sold his collection, which contained almost all the postage stamps issued by that time."}
{"question":"poor countries climate threats funding hurdles","doc_text":"While several winter storms came through the region, total rainfall accumulation was still below average during the 2011 monitoring period. Many of the plants that could not be located in 2011 were assumed dead because their vigor during previous surveys was rated as \u201cpoor\u201d in 2009 (NNHP 2011b, p. 3). Some of these plants may have been retracted at the time. However, many plants observed between 2008 and 2011 failed to produce fruit or flower, and fruit buds were observed to be aborted. This suggests low seed production, which would cause a decline in overall abundance over time.\nIn summary, the climate on the Colorado Plateau and Navajo Nation is predicted to become warmer with reduced precipitation in the future. We have strong evidence to suggest that the Fickeisen plains cactus is being impacted by drought coupled with increased annual temperatures. We believe that the high number of dead and missing or retracted plants in all plots monitored is influenced by below-average winter or spring precipitation at the time when plants need soil moisture to flower. Poor reproduction in the Fickeisen plains cactus is likely to worsen in the future if climatic patterns shift toward becoming more arid with increased winter nighttime temperatures. With climatic models predicting future regional droughts, it is likely that all populations of the Fickeisen plains cactus will continue to be affected by drought and climate change. However, it is not clear if drought or climate change, of themselves, present population-level threats of extinction. It appears that drought and climate change in combination with rodent predation (see Factor C. Disease or Predation, below), as a combined effect, is the more likely scenario for population-level impacts to the plant. Additionally, the small and declining populations of the Fickeisen plains cactus make the species susceptible to natural environmental variability, including climate conditions. Therefore, based on our review of the best scientific and commercial data available, we conclude that the effects of climate change and drought are threats that have significant impacts to the Fickeisen plains cactus and its habitat.\nSummary of Factor A\nBased on our review of the best scientific and commercial data available, we conclude that fire associated with nonnative, invasive plant species; uranium mining; road construction and road maintenance; ORV use; and commercial development are not threats to the Fickeisen plains cactus and its habitat."}

{"question":"How many types of dental film speeds exist?","doc_text":"Group Practice: A Closer Look\nFinancial and administrative advantages mean group practice is on the rise\nIt is the probably the dream of every dentist to one day own their practice. Private practice, or solo practice, accounts for the majority of how dental care is delivered in the United States. However, private practice dentists have fallen in number consistently over the past decade. In 2006, according to American Dental Association research, 76% of dentists were solo practitioners. In 2010, that number dropped to 69%. In the past 2 years, group practice has risen by 25%.\nThe reasons for the rise and fall of these two types of dental practices are many. Typical student debt today can be between $200,000 and $300,000. Because an additional loan would be required to purchase a practice in a still uncertain economy, many students are discouraged from entering private practice. In addition, the administrative aspect of running a successful dental practice by oneself is daunting for some. Human resources issues, insurance contracts, legal issues, marketing, financial reporting, billing and collections, and staf\ufb01ng are all areas in which dentists receive minimal training.\nGroup practice can provide a solution by allowing practitioners to practice dentistry with other professionals to share the administrative and practice management burden. Group Practice Types\nGroup practice can generally be categorized by size and management. One style of group practice has several dental practices closely laid out geographically. Each of these of\ufb01ces may have 1 to 3 dentists employed there. These practices may be owned by a single dentist corporation or by some other dental entity. Typically, the administrative costs, management, and advertising are spread out over the of\ufb01ces, resulting in less overhead per of\ufb01ce. This dental setting may prove to be attractive to dentists and patients who are looking for a smaller, individualized, private practice atmosphere.\nAnother type of group practice that is gaining in popularity is dental of\ufb01ces that are contracted with dental support organizations (DSOs). These DSOs will provide administrative and business support services pursuant to a contract. In this dental setting, there are different ownership models, but these large group practices may have several general dentists and various specialties all under one roof. The convenience of a one-stop dental setting is attractive to patients."}
{"question":"In my animal behavior class, we're comparing social structures - how different are honeybee colonies from early human hunter-gatherer groups when it comes to making group decisions?","doc_text":"Dear Secretary Vilsack:\nAs the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) develops its fiscal year (FY) 2015 budget request, we urge you to request significant additional resources to address the bee health decline challenges facing American beekeepers, including those experiencing Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Thank you in advance for your consideration of our views.\nAgriculture as we know it today in the United States may not exist without honeybee pollination. In order for the country to have a healthy and plentiful food supply, honeybee pollination is necessary. USDA has estimated that honeybees pollinate about one-third of the human diet. In addition, pollination is responsible for up to $20 billion in added crop value, particularly for specialty crops such as nuts, berries, fruits, and vegetables.\nThe nation's beekeepers are facing numerous challenges that pose a threat to our food supply. The most significant challenge that USDA has the ability to address is bee health. We are losing honeybees at an alarming rate. In 1947, the United States had 6 million honeybee colonies. Today, there are only about 2.5 million. Since 2006 alone, 10 million beehives with a value of roughly $2 billion have been lost, most of which has been attributed to CCD alone.\nMore recently, preliminary results for the national survey of honeybee colony losses show that the disturbing trend continues. The survey shows a decline of 31.1 percent of honeybee colonies during the 2012\/2013 winter, which is an increase of 42 percent over the previous winter. On average, beekeepers lost 45.1 percent of their colonies during the winter. That is an increase of 78.2 percent from the previous winter. It is our understanding that a normal loss rate is only around 15 percent.\nWhile we appreciate the work of USDA's CCD Steering Committee, we believe that more needs to be done before it is too late. From our perspective, we should be making significant investments in research activities in the laboratory and in the field. It is our hope that the FY 15 budget request includes increased honeybee research funding at the Agricultural Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, including funds specifically dedicated to researching the role pesticides may play in overall bee health decline."}

For instance, the constants K1\u2013K8 can be determined empirically using rate samples from a number of DDOS attacks, or experimentally by establishing different values for each constant and determining the effectiveness of the resulting TokenRate and TokenDepth values for blocking DDOS attacks.

{"question":"How many protons are needed to make one ATP?","doc_text":"Protons Are What Make Elements Distinct\nAll matter, including mineral crystals, is made up of atoms. All atoms are made up of three main particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons have a positive charge, neutrons have no charge, and electrons have a negative charge. Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, but electrons have a mass that is 10,000 times smaller.\nThe element hydrogen (H) has the simplest atoms. Most hydrogen atoms have just one proton and one electron. The proton forms the nucleus (the centre of the atom), while the electron orbits around it (Figure 5.5, left). All other elements have more than one proton in their nucleus. Protons repel each other because they are positively charged, but it is possible to have more than one proton in a nucleus because neutrons hold them together. The next most complex atom, helium (He) has two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus, in its most common form. Some atoms of the same element can have different numbers of neutrons. For example, forms of hydrogen exist with one and two neutrons, and a tiny fraction of He atoms have only one neutron. Forms of an element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.\nThe number of protons in an atom determines what element it will be, so the number of protons is called the atomic number of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is the mass number. The mass number distinguishes between isotopes of an element. Isotopes of an element are denoted by putting the mass number as a subscript in front of the symbol for that element. For example, the isotopes of hydrogen are 1H (1 proton), 2H (1 proton + 1 neutron), and 3H (1 proton + 2 neutrons).\nFor most of the 16 lightest elements (up to oxygen) the number of neutrons is equal to the number of protons. For most of the remaining elements, there are more neutrons than protons. This is because the more protons that are concentrated in a small space, the more neutrons are needed to keep the nucleus together. The most common isotope of uranium (U), for example, is 238U."}

{"question":"How many cuneiform tablets from Nippur are in the Hermitage collection?","doc_text":"A history of Zero\n|Ancient Indian Mathematics index||History Topics Index|\nThe first thing to say about zero is that there are two uses of zero which are both extremely important but are somewhat different. One use is as an empty place indicator in our place-value number system. Hence in a number like 2106 the zero is used so that the positions of the 2 and 1 are correct. Clearly 216 means something quite different. The second use of zero is as a number itself in the form we use it as 0. There are also different aspects of zero within these two uses, namely the concept, the notation, and the name. (Our name \"zero\" derives ultimately from the Arabic sifr which also gives us the word \"cipher\".)\nNeither of the above uses has an easily described history. It just did not happen that someone invented the ideas, and then everyone started to use them. Also it is fair to say that the number zero is far from an intuitive concept. Mathematical problems started as 'real' problems rather than abstract problems. Numbers in early historical times were thought of much more concretely than the abstract concepts which are our numbers today. There are giant mental leaps from 5 horses to 5 \"things\" and then to the abstract idea of \"five\". If ancient peoples solved a problem about how many horses a farmer needed then the problem was not going to have 0 or -23 as an answer.\nOne might think that once a place-value number system came into existence then the 0 as an empty place indicator is a necessary idea, yet the Babylonians had a place-value number system without this feature for over 1000 years. Moreover there is absolutely no evidence that the Babylonians felt that there was any problem with the ambiguity which existed. Remarkably, original texts survive from the era of Babylonian mathematics. The Babylonians wrote on tablets of unbaked clay, using cuneiform writing.

{"question":"How long did Yacov Sharir and Keith Saunders work in dance?","doc_text":"Was Yosef absolving his brothers of all responsibility since it was all part of the Divine plan, or were the brothers responsible for their brutal behavior despite the fact that all worked out?\nThe Midrash (Tanchuma Vayigash Siman 5) sheds light on this dynamic. Immediately prior to Yosef\u2019s revelation, the heated exchange between Yosef and his brothers becomes dangerously close to turning violent. Yosef understood that he must reveal his identity. \u201cYosef said to his brothers, \u2018Did you not tell me that your brother died? In fact, I purchased him, and I will bring him out to you.\u2019 At this point Yosef called out, \u2018Yosef son of Yacov come to me, Yosef son of Yacov come to me and speak with your brothers who sold you.\u2019 The brothers began scanning all corners of the room to catch a glimpse of their long-lost brother. Yosef turned and said to them, \u2018Why do you look here and there? I am Yosef your brother.\u2019 In that moment their souls left their bodies, and they were unable to answer him.\u201d\nYosef was conflicted; on one hand he was overjoyed to see his brothers and feel a sense of belonging and familial security. On the other hand, Yosef realized that these were the very men who turned an indifferent ear to his cries; these were the men who were supposed to be his beloved protectors but instead became rage-filled antagonists. These were the men who were ready to murder their own flesh and blood. Perhaps, I cannot have a relationship with them. Perhaps, it is better to remain distant and repay them in kind so they can suffer as I did. And so, Yosef calls out, \u201cYosef the son of Yaakov come to me, Yosef the son of Yaakov come to me\u201d. He is looking for his self, for his identity. Who should I be? What should I do? Should I seek revenge or reconciliation?\nYosef finds resolution with one simple phrase \u2013 I am Yosef your brother. I choose to be your brother and not an indifferent, vengeful tyrant. I make this choice not because you have earned it; I make this choice because it is best for me."}

How can we understand these claims about the intersection of poetry and politics? This course delves into the lives and works of Rich and Lorde, as we explore their respective poetic oeuvres. To Rich and Lorde, liberation was a through-line of experience between eros, politics, and language. And both express in their works understandings of gender, sexuality, and the body. In a famous interview between the two writers, they discuss poetry as the language of the dark, the feminine, the unconscious; we will explore this tendency in their work and the ways in which their respective renderings of the feminine influenced the trajectory of feminist theory and politics in the mid and late-20th century. Their conversations with one another, and treatments of their legacies by Claudia Rankine, Lisa L. Moore, Marilyn Hacker and others, will inform our investigation of poetry as part of feminist theory. How do Rich and Lorde navigate antiracism and intersectionality among allies with different race and class affiliations? How does poetic form contribute to their political practice?

They were assigned to learn one skill with simulated classroom noise and another with the simulated benefit of a classroom FM system. Both studies utilized adapted alternating treatment single-case designs and assessed performance using daily assessments on the phonological awareness skills targeted during intervention and one additional phonological awareness skill.\nIn Study 1, two participants demonstrated quicker and more pronounced improvement on the skill learned while wearing the FM system, suggesting FM systems show promise as a tool to use during phonological awareness training. In Study 2, two participants made gains on the phonological awareness skills assessed. However, a difference was not evident between skills learned in the simulated classroom FM and simulated classroom noise condition.\nThe results of Study 1 indicate that FM systems show promise during phonological awareness instruction. However, the finding from Study 2 that simulation of the signal-to-ratio of FM systems was not associated with improved performance compared to simulated classroom noise suggests that aspects of FM systems beyond the increased signal-to-noise ratio alone may be responsible for the benefit they provided.

However, last week, the Department of Education announced that they were extending their deadline to turn in your rankings to Friday, December 14. They went out of their way to stress it absolutely was not due to what an unmitigated disaster their much vaunted new parent portal is. It\u2019s simply because of\u2026 reasons. (In their defense, even before the error-plagued parent portal, the DOE had a long history of extending their own deadlines. But that was usually because either not enough students had applied to the schools the DOE thought they should or, in the case of Universal Pre-K, not enough had applied, period, despite the Mayor insisting there was overwhelming demand.)\nExcept for the specialized high schools, and LaGuardia, all other NYC public high school choices \u2013 Screened, Arts\/Audition, Ed-Opt, etc\u2026 \u2013 go on a single form.

It depends on what you\u2019re looking for.\nEarlier this year, Mayor Bill de Blasio and School Chancellor Richard Carranza introduced a bill that would change admission to the specialized high schools from a single test, the SHSAT, to admitting the top 7 percent of students from every public middle school. (Private and Catholic school kids, you\u2019re not welcome anymore.)\nAdvocates claim that grades and test scores are a much better predictor of student success than a single test.\nHere is where I get confused:\nNYC has over 400 public high schools and about 700 programs within those schools. Currently, easily one-third use grades and test scores (along with, sometimes, essays, interviews and portfolio review) to accept students.\nHow many schools use the SHSAT?\nTwo in Manhattan, two in the Bronx, two in Brooklyn, one in Queens, and one on Staten Island."}

Also, in the prophesy of Ravana's death, it refers to the Wanderer, third Childe of Caine, whose descendants destroyed themselves in madness.\nSo, to conclude, Ravnos was Dracian, of the 2nd generation, he embraced his lover, Ennoia, aka Deanna, mother of the Garou and the gypsies. He also embraced Ravana, and possibly others. Ennoia was of the Ravnos Clan until Caine cast her out for orchestrating Ravnos\/Dracian's (although according to WoD Gypsies she was not involved) death at the hands of the rest of the third generation, who ruled the Second City.

{"question":"home clinic baby development checkup difference","doc_text":"Many people realise that the web is a vast source of info, but may not fully grasp its potential usefulness for everyday tasks, like when it comes to searching for medical professionals like dentists Adelaide. Many websites have compiled thousands of reviews and ratings of the dental clinics and practising individuals.

Ask about fundamental questions like the dental cleaning fees and insurance covers that they accept. Also, you can ask for any family discounts and if they apply to you.

This is the best time to get a feel for how easy they are when it comes to communication.\nAsk them about any questions regarding the method of treatment and what type of procedures they offer at the clinic. Also, clarify if the dentist will be cleaning your teeth every time you go for a checkup, or it will be done only upon your request.

{"question":"How tall is the Temple of Kukulkan pyramid?","doc_text":"The remains of the ancient Khmer capital of Angkor contain hundreds of fantastic buildings against a dramatic backdrop of verdant jungle, and the temple of Baphuon is one of the most interesting of them.\nOne of the greatest tropes in all of fiction is the temple that, when desecrated, dramatically collapses with the heroes rushing to escape. No temple from real life exemplifies this trope more than the enormous Baphuon, which was originally 50 metres tall and still stands 34 metres today. Originally dedicated to Shiva when it was built in the 11th century, the 16m bronze and stone altar at the top was disassembled and turned into a statue of the reclining Buddha on the west side of the second story. But the stones removed were not as ornamental as they seemed: they held back a massive wall of sand which flooded out, destroying the reclining Buddha and the entire western side of the pyramid. That is certainly one way to defend your temple from beyond the grave.\nIt wasn\u2019t until 400 years later in 1960 when it was reassembled, and it wasn\u2019t opened to the public until 2011. It\u2019s got the reclining Buddha statue, only thankfully now the entire thing is reinforced with metal throughout.\nThe Red Queen Of Palenque\nIn another steamy, jungle-clad land filled with monumental buildings, but half a millennia earlier, one of the most dramatic booby traps of all time was being set in the tomb of the Red Queen of Palenque. Red, being the colour of blood, was of paramount importance to the murderous Maya \u2013 it coloured nearly all of their buildings, much of their clothing, and in the case of the Red Queen and Lord Pacal, their bones. These two Maya nobles were entombed in the base of two separate pyramid temples in stunning Palenque. The stairway from the altar to their death chambers were filled in with rocks and then sealed with another false floor, and when discovered it took years to unearth. But that wasn\u2019t the trap. The trap was what was waiting inside their sarcophagi. Their bones had been painted red with cinnabar \u2013 a deadly neurotoxin made from ground mercury ore. The deadly paste covered not just their bones, but also all of the jade, pearls, and other treasures in there with them."}
{"question":"horse severe breathing problem age starts symptoms","doc_text":"Only a small percentage of exposed children actually develop croup.\nMost at risk of getting croup are children between 6 months and 3 years of age. The peak incidence of the condition is 18 to 24 months of age.\nMost cases of croup are mild. In a small percentage of cases, the airway swells enough to interfere with breathing.\nIn most cases of croup, your child won't need to see a doctor. However, if your child's symptoms are severe or aren't responding to home treatment, you should make an appointment.\nYour child's doctor will likely ask a number of questions to help determine the best course of treatment:\n- What are your child's symptoms? Has your child had a fever or difficulty swallowing?\n- How long has your child been experiencing symptoms?\n- Has your child's cough become progressively worse? If so, how rapidly?\n- Have you noticed a pattern to your child's cough? For instance, does it get worse at night?\n- Has your child had croup in the past?\n- Has your child recently been exposed to other sick children?\n- Does your child have any other medical conditions?\n- Is your child fully vaccinated?\nCroup is typically diagnosed by the doctor observing your child's breathing, listening to your child's chest with a stethoscope and examining your child's throat. Sometimes X-rays or other tests are used to rule out other possible illnesses.\nSelf-care measures at home are effective for the vast majority of cases of croup. Aggressive treatment is rarely needed.\nIf your child's symptoms persist beyond three to five days or worsen, your child's doctor may prescribe a type of steroid (glucocorticoid) to reduce inflammation in the airway. Benefits will usually be felt within six hours. Dexamethasone is usually recommended because of its long-lasting effects (up to 72 hours).\nEpinephrine is also effective in reducing airway inflammation. It's fast-acting, but its effects wear off quickly.\nFor severe croup, your child may need to spend time in a hospital. In rare instances, a temporary breathing tube may need to be placed in the child's windpipe.\nCroup can be scary \u2014 especially if it lands your child in the doctor's office, emergency room or hospital. Comforting your child and keeping him or her calm are important, because crying and agitation worsen airway obstruction."}

{"question":"How does crop insurance protect farmers financially and what research exists on its market effects?","doc_text":"GM papaya wins approval in U.S., Japan\nHFP Editor's Note: Safety and health approvals have now been granted by the Japan Health Regulatory Organization, eliminating any scientific or health-related objection to the GM Papaya. The next step is the Agricultural marketing process which needs to have procedures in place to bring the fruit into Japan. After that, importation can begin.\nBy Harry Cline, Farm Press Editorial Staff, Apr 21, 2010 >>> Link to original\nGenetically modified papaya will soon be on the supermarket shelves in Japan just like it now is in the U.S.\nThis first-ever fresh market GMO food product is not from an American corporate giant. It is the result of tenacious research from a host of scientists and the cooperation of Hawaiian farmers. This rare feat in today\u2019s contentious debate over GMO crops was not accomplished to make a statement. It was to save an important crop for farmers in the impoverished state of Hawaii.\nDennis Gonsalves, director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center in Hilo, Hawaii, and professor emeritus of plant pathology at Cornell, detailed to the 63rd annual meeting of the Western Society of Weed Science in Hawaii how Hawaiian agriculture has done what no other ag sector has; win approval to market a genetically modified food crop in the U.S. and Japan.\nGonsalves was the project leader on the successful effort to save Hawaii\u2019s $47 million papaya industry. He is a native Hawaiian raised on a sugar plantation on Hawaii\u2019s Big Island. He received bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from the University of Hawaii and a doctorate at the University of California at Davis. He went to Cornell University as an associate professor in 1977. He spent 25 years at Cornell, yet his biggest professional achievement there saved an industry 4,700 miles away in his native island homeland.\nGonsalves left Cornell eight years ago to become director of the USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center in Hilo, Hawaii.\nPapaya is the second largest fruit crop in Hawaii. It is grown commercially for export to the U.S. mainland and Japan. Hawaii exports 25 percent to 30 percent of its papaya to Japan.\nPapaya trees can be severely damaged by the papaya ringspot virus (PRSV), which is rapidly transmitted by aphids."}

He and a group of middle schoolers installed 9-foot poles to showcase just how high the sea might be in the future.\nThe city council there agreed to include the possibility of rising sea levels in its long-range planning.\nIn 2011, after organizing a campaign to raise awareness about climate change that occurred in more than 200 cities, Loorz had the seeds of an idea that became iMatter.\nWhile the effort attracted media attention and involvement, he saw it as largely symbolic gesture that did not force political change.

{"question":"What makes the recording setup special in Rez Abbasi's album that gives it such an intimate feel when you listen to it?","doc_text":"I firmly believe that a mere six years ago, the best album in the world was released in my opinion.\nIn 2010 an album was released that was so ground-breaking it would forever change the way that I listen to music and also gave me a new purpose in life. At the time, I was only a casual music listener who just enjoyed whatever was playing on the radio in the car; that was until Scott Mescudi released his second studio album on November 9, 2010. The album is a mix of club music and emotion about a man who must overcome the biggest obstacle in life: himself. It is without a doubt the darkest album that Cudi has ever released and it is a very welcomed follow-up to his 2009 debut album. With hooks and even features by some of the most influential artists of all time such as Kanye West, Mary J. Blige, and CeeLo Green one can clearly see how influential this album would be to an awkward 13-year-old social outcast.\nThe album is the best because it appeals to feelings; the songs that really make you contemplate your life as well as wonder what Cudi felt and went through at the time of recording makes the album almost tangible and life-like. The album covers many different subjects like drugs, love, addiction, emotions, and even mental health. All of these personal aspects come across as endearing and tragic as Cudi tells you about his mistakes, regrets, and future. Not only does this album take you on a journey, it also gives the listener thoughts to ponder about and if you in any way love this album as much as I do, you\u2019ll still be thinking about those thoughts to this day. There is no other album that I have listened to that made me laugh, smile, and cry as much as this one has. For the last six years, this album has given me the same experience every time I listen to it. The change of emotions that a listener goes through is absolutely insane and is a definite recommendation for someone who has not listened to this work of art yet.\nEvery section of the album is broken down into five major parts. The first part which is called The World I am Ruling features a more uplifting and inspirational part of the album where Cudi is free to say what he wants and knows that his fans will always look up to him and support their \u201cbig brother\u201d."}
{"question":"I'm working on a school project about food science pioneers. Could you tell me if Nicolai Vavilov and the botanist Petr Zhukovsky had similar goals in their travels to Turkey?","doc_text":"RED: And where did you learn the most about winemaking?\nSCOTT: Growing up I had a lot of varied interests, not just in oenology but also in food science, so I pursued studies in Fermentation Science at the University of California at Davis. In addition to winemaking, I also explored the principles and science behind distillation, food engineering and even a little cheese-making. Since my brother and I were experimenting with home brewing during the summers, I took the opportunity to study at Davis\u2019 Institute of Brewing Studies, eventually earning a Master Brewers Certificate. After Davis, I joined the Carmel Brewing Company, and eventually assembled a brewpub in Monterey from the ground up, formulating the recipes and brewing all the beer that we would serve on tap. I had always enjoyed the engineering side of things such as fluid dynamics and heat transfer, and working in a small brewpub allowed me to be hands-on throughout the brewing process and use some of the mechanical skills I learned growing up.\nUltimately though, I found that brewing didn\u2019t really fulfill my creative side, and I found myself gravitating back toward winemaking. In 2000, I joined the Robert Mondavi family of wines working on a variety of brands that took me from Australia to Italy. These experiences abroad really shaped my philosophy about wine and winemaking, my travels to Italy clarified the synergy between wine and food, while making wine in Australia introduced me to a new approach with a focus on the details and the idea that you only get one chance to make a wine great.\nRED: What is your winemaking style or philosophy?\nSCOTT: Winemaking fulfills my artistic side without giving up the innovative hands-on experience that keeps me in touch with my family\u2019s roots in agriculture. I enjoy all of the challenges that each vintage presents in order to shape the style of wines we make at Estancia.. Our winemaking style is one that fully embraces the coastal terroir.\nRED: Tell me, what makes the Monterey and the Central Coast region so special?\nSCOTT: Born and raised in Monterey County, I have tremendous respect for the climate \u2013 the wind and fog and the impact it has on the fruit and wine."}

{"question":"What is the required body length proportion for male Great Danes?","doc_text":"One of the joys of this breed is the variety of styles seen in the breed, but any variations must always be assessed in consideration of the breed standard. This is a hands-on breed, requiring careful examination under the coat for structural reference points in order to adequately assess qualities that may be altered by creative grooming or obscured by excessive coat. Judges should ensure they place hands under the coat to feel for the forechest, tip of shoulder blades, length of upper arm, depth of body to the elbows, tight fitting elbows, good length and spring of rib, short, deep loin, bend of stifle, hindquarter muscle mass and correct tail set and length.\nSize, Proportion and Substance\nThe judge\u2019s initial impression of the Golden Retriever should be a dog of moderation and over-all balance. There is a disqualification for size, with no exemption for puppies. The standard has a disqualification for deviation in height more than one inch over or under the prescribed size range. Many puppies do not reach the minimum size by six months of age and judges should not hesitate to measure suspected over-sized or under-sized exhibits.\nThe standard calls for a proportion ratio of 11:12 based on the height from withers to ground and length from prosternum to seat bone. To the average eye, this is only slightly off square. The distance from withers to elbow and elbow to ground should be approximately equal. Many Goldens today are lacking the correct proportions and appear long and lower to the ground than what the standard requires. Length in the body should come from a well developed rib cage which extends well back, as the Golden should be relatively short-coupled and not long in loin.\nThe head is one of the hallmarks of the breed. Correct head structure is important to the retrieving function of the breed, relating to vision, scenting and carrying of the game. The head should be clean cut with a broad, slightly arched skull and a definite stop. The skull and the deep, wide, slightly tapering muzzle have nearly parallel planes, with the muzzle nearly as long as the skull. Strong muzzles and back-skulls are necessary for carrying heavy game, as a large goose can weigh 10 to 12 pounds.\nFull dentition is preferred, with a scissors bite. Undershot or overshot mouths are a disqualification."}

{"question":"How can I make sure I'm getting accurate and reliable results when measuring application launch times on my computer?","doc_text":"Hiding out in my clinic is an extraordinary health screening tool. I just got it back from being totally upgraded.\nComputer regulation thermography (CRT) is a tool used to get a functional picture of all the organ systems in the body. Testing is performed by measuring many different points on the skin which correspond to specific internal organs and tissues through viscerocutaneous reflexes. Thermography has been used in Europe for more that 20 years, and has recently been computerized to make interpretation easier and more accurate.\nHow does CRT work?\nThe autonomic nervous system, which controls automatic body functions, determines circulation to internal organs as well as the skin. It does this by altering the amount of dilation and constriction in blood vessels. Environmental temperature impacts the autonomic nervous system and, therefore, affects blood flow. By measuring the temperature of many different points on the skin before and after a cold stimulus, we can monitor changes in circulation. The actual temperature, as well as how it changes in response to the cold stimulus, provides information about the function of organs and tissues that correspond to the points being measured.\nWhat will the thermography test be like?\nAfter adapting to room temperature, the first set of measurements is taken. A ten-minute cooling phase follows before measuring the points a second time. After the results are interpreted, they will be explained during a follow-up appointment. Treatment will be based on the test's results, the patient's specific situation, and the doctor's assessment.\nWhy is CRT important for you?\nRegulation thermography is effective in the early detection of many physical imbalances and diseases. Often times symptoms are affected by areas of the body that may not at first seem directly related. Thermography can help determine what additional lab work; if any; may be needed to determine the source of ill health; and can help avoid many unnecessary, expensive lab tests.\nWhat can be determined by CRT?\nCRT can discover possible sources of chronic disease and infections. Breast, ovarian, and prostate health can also be assessed. Possible cardiovascular, stomach, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder problems can be detected using the CRT. Unknown causes of infection and inflammation, allergic or toxic reactions to food, the presence of intestinal mycosis or dysbiosis, and possible correlations between dental health and disease can all be determined using CRT. Your overall vitality can be estimated by CRT.\nHow much will CRT cost?"}

{"question":"dust collector box design requirements proper airflow considerations","doc_text":"Tracking can also be accomplished using time-clock mechanisms or, e.g., two-dimensional arrays of photosensitive devices for determining the sun's position with an attendant feedback control mechanism.\nThe collector area should be selected in accordance with the energy requirements for a particular utilization device and the solar intensity in the geographical region of interest, generally up to 1.9 kw\/m2, as affected by the geographical climate, desired periods of use during a year, typical usage periods during a day, etc. In general, collector areas of approximately 1-3 m2 will suffice for a number of household applications. As an example of the usefulness of such readily achievable collector areas, it should be considered that a typical electrical cooking unit has a power rating of less than or about 1 kw. Accordingly, a collector of an area of about 1 m2 could supply sufficient energy to replace or supplement the conventional energy supply of such a cooking unit depending on time, location and conditions. Other conventional energy using devices have similar ratings, i.e., in the few kilowatt range, e.g., normal hot water heaters, space heaters and many other devices, some of which are discussed below. Collectors having effective areas in the mentioned range could capture sufficient solar radiation to provide the energy requirements for a wide range of such existing devices with, using this invention, minimum interruption of their existing environment.\nThe degree of beam concentration effected in this component of the system is also not critical. Factors of convenience, cost, commercial availability of components, etc. will be prime considerations in this regard. Generally, the concentrated beam diameters will be in the range of a few cm.\nThe particular design of the collector\/concentrator\/collimator is not critical. Systems using lenses, mirrors or combinations thereof are all suitable. Preferably, all surfaces are appropriately treated so that the transmission of this component of the system is maximized, e.g., lenses should be coated with anti-reflection coatings, reflective surfaces should have maximal reflectivities and smoothness, etc. Larger components may be of unitary construction or can be of segmented design wherein several lenses or mirrors are so situated as to act as a single large lens or mirror. Non-limiting, exemplary systems include lens systems wherein a large collecting lens is situated with respect to the focal point of a smaller collimating lens such that the outgoing concentrated and collimated beam is of the required smaller diameter than the incoming beam of parallel solar radiation."}
{"question":"drywall repair versus primer application which process requires more coats for optimal results","doc_text":"Read Roof Restoration Melbourne \u2013 The Complete Guide.\nPeeling of Painted Colorbond or Metal Roof Tiles\nMetal is more durable than any other roof material but also has a slightly different set of rules for painting. For metal roofs, the correct installation makes a much bigger difference than with tile roofs because they\u2019re harder to repair. When one or more tiles crack, they can be replaced at practically no cost, but damage to a metal roof means the entire section should be replaced.\nWhy Metal Roofs Flake\nIn the best case scenario, the cause is merely that the primer and\/or paint are incorrectly applied or that they had expired. Repainting a Colorbond roof requires experience and correct preparation to ensure the coating will not flake off.\nIn the worst case scenario, the cause is structural weakness of the roof or that it has approached the end of its usability cycle.\nEven the slightest dents in the structure of the roof might mean that\u2019s where water will pool. As soon as you have pooling water, it\u2019s only a matter of time before it starts seeping beneath the paint, leading to flakes.\nWhat To Do When Your Metal Roof Flakes\nWe suggest you don\u2019t spend too much time or money on quick fixes. When a metal roof experiences flaking paint, it\u2019s time for a serious do-over, not a quick fix that will again fail in a few months\u2019 time. Metal roofs do not tolerate patch jobs, since the patching lines are where water can easily seep through the roof.\nThe roof should be stripped bare before applying a primer and then repainting. However, we recommend replacing the roof completely. This is because modern metal roofs are imbued with several durable coats of paint by the manufacturer, who regularly gives a lengthy warranty on the colour and the structural quality.\nHow To Prevent Flaking Metal Roof Paint\nA good primer is the key to preventing metal roof paint from flaking but also the correct application of it.\nThe primer shouldn\u2019t be thinned too much or the paint won\u2019t stick. It should also complement the metal type by chemical composition to ensure the tightest possible bond. When the primer is done right, almost any kind of paint will stick to the roof, giving you unparalleled flexibility and durability.\nThe primer should dry out completely before paint is applied.

Here, we describe two large-scale initiatives \u2014 the Human Behavior Change Project and Science of Behavior Change program \u2014 that aim to introduce complementary systematic and rigorous methods to advance the science of behavior change.\nThe burden of disability-adjusted life years, prevalence of chronic health conditions and existence of other global challenges such as pollution are common, costly and often preventable . Behaviors are critical targets of intervention to improve physical and mental well-being, longevity and the environment. However, the science behind, and findings of, behavior change interventions are frequently fragmented and inconsistently reported, and interventions are often unsuccessful in initiating and\/or sustaining behavior change. As a result of fragmentation and poor reporting, much research wastes opportunities to build forward momentum, limiting opportunities to harness and synthesize findings to systematically improve behavior change interventions, and the science informing them. Here, we describe two recent initiatives on behavior change \u2014 one from the United Kingdom and one from the United States \u2014 that were developed specifically, albeit independently, to tackle these problems. Although by no means the only international behavior change initiatives, we highlight them here because they both aim to advance behavior change science through an emphasis on common, systematic and rigorous methods, and they take different, but complementary, approaches in this pursuit. We believe that uniting these and other initiatives will cultivate a more cumulative science of behavior change that can inform policy, practice and scientific progress. The UK initiative Funded by the Welcome Trust and led by researchers at University College London, the universities of Aberdeen and Cambridge, and IBM Dublin, the Human Behavior Change Project (HBCP) is a collaboration of behavioral scientists, computer scientists and system architects (www.humanbehaviourchange.org). HBCP is developing a method and user interface to enable policymakers, practitioners and researchers to answer variants of the \u2018big question\u2019 in behavioral science: What behavior change interventions work, compared with what, for what behaviors, how well, for how long, for whom, in what setting and why? HBCP researchers are harnessing advances in behavioral and information science to build a behavior change intervention ontology (BCIO) and interactive knowledge system to organize the existing and accelerating evidence about behavior change interventions. The BCIO aims to establish a controlled vocabulary and connections between behavior change techniques and behavioral outcomes via underlying mechanisms of action, while taking into consideration moderation by intervention exposure (reach and engagement) and context (population and setting)."}
{"question":"how seasoned wood burning differs from gas fireplace safety concerns","doc_text":"If you have an old or uncertified wood-burning device, you may qualify for cash rewards to recycle it or get a discount on the purchase of new heating equipment.\nThrough the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency\u2019s Wood Stove Program, Snohomish County residents can receive $350 for recycling their old, polluting wood stove.

This process is called condensation.\nI have my students locate the box next to the arrow for precipitation, and write the word in the box. I explain that these particles of gas, in the form of water vapor, condense on particles of dust, smoke, and salt. When they grow heavier enough, the droplets fall as precipitation.

Secondary outcomes will explore changes from pre- to post-intervention in body composition, substrate oxidation, lipid profile, leptin concentration, c-reactive protein concentration, adipose tissue gene expression, postprandial lipaemia and postprandial appetite regulation\/perception. In addition, differences in physical activity intensity and dietary composition between the monitoring and intervention phases will be examined. As it is not the objective of this study to compare these differences between the cohorts, two sets of analyses will be conducted on a per protocol basis -\u2013 one for the lean cohort and one for the overweight\/obese cohort. Both will centre upon a two-way mixed model analysis of variance featuring a factor for diet allocation and a factor for time-point. This will permit an examination of the effect of each diet on the outcomes of interest (i.e. pre vs. post\/monitoring vs. intervention) and whether this effect varied between the three dietary conditions. Pre-existing differences between groups at baseline will be examined using a one-way analysis of variance featuring a factor for diet allocation. Significant differences emerging from these tests will be explored using appropriate post-hoc tests to adjust for multiple comparisons and isolate the source(s) of variance. In addition to these analyses at the group level, individual responses will also be closely scrutinised to examine whether outliers could be affecting the interpretation. Further analysis, such as sub-group analysis, may also be conducted in light of patterns emerging in the final dataset. Baseline characteristics of participants who withdraw during the intervention will also be compared against the final population using t tests. Statistical significance will be accepted at P < 0.05.\nDespite the growing popularity of IMF , research exploring its effects on human metabolism remains scarce. The novel examination of postprandial responses and the components of energy balance being employed in this study will highlight the extent to which IMF regimes can impact human metabolism.

{"question":"Hey, I'm fascinated by archaeological digs happening in Israel. What are they searching for at the Tel Shiloh site and have they found anything interesting so far?","doc_text":"BAR 35:06, Nov\/Dec 2009\nFirst Person: Barred from the City of David\nI have been writing about the City of David for more than 35 years. The major excavations of Yigal Shiloh between 1978 and 1985 were undertaken as a result of a book I wrote. In that sense, I created the site. So it is no small thing to me that General Shuka Dorfman, the current director of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), has instructed Ronny Reich, who codirects the current excavations near the Pool of Siloam with Eli Shukron, to bar me from the site.a Shuka, as everyone calls him, is mad at me. It has something to do with the famous James Ossuary (inscribed \u201cJames, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus\u201d), which was first published in BAR by Sorbonne scholar Andr\u00e9 Lemaire in 2002.b I cannot be more specific about why Shuka is so angry because he won\u2019t tell me. He won\u2019t speak to me. What is clear is that it has nothing to do with the City of David or its excavation. At a meeting of Israel\u2019s Archaeological Council, council members suggested he talk to me, but Shuka rejected their advice; he remains obdurate. After all, he\u2019s a general; he is accustomed to commanding, not taking suggestions."}

{"question":"What makes gophers come into people's yards and gardens in the first place?","doc_text":"In the second overtime, the Wildcats (4-3, 2-2) scored once more, undramatically on Brandon Roberson's 6-yard run, but the Gophers came back to pull within one on a Weber option.\nHere Gophers went for two points and the victory with Weber rolling right and eyeing the end zone as Wildcats linebacker Adam Kadela rolled with him and eyed his running back. Weber was Kadela's responsibility, so when he saw that back blocking, he charged and got a hand on Weber before he slipped off. But by then defensive tackle John Gill had come from the backside and he hit Weber as he threw a pass that nose-dived to the ground near none of his receivers.\n\"My team deserved to win,\" Gophers coach Tim Brewster said. \"That's why I went for it. I felt 100 percent we'd get two.\"\nBut that triumph, implausibly, went instead to the Wildcats, who survived again behind Bacher and with a mettle that proved as unyielding as tempered steel.\nHe completed 41 of 58 passes for 470 yards and four touchdowns with no interceptions. The Wildcats, in turn, ran their overtime record to 7-0 in Big Ten games and 8-1 overall. He also produced when the heat was hottest and converted each of the three fourth-down situations he faced, twice for touchdowns.\n\"We don't really like [close games] until they're over,\" Bacher said. \"We've had a few now that have been fun. But we'd like to play better in the first half and not have to face those situations.\"\nKadela was apologetic.\n\"It is a little stressful,\" he said. \"You know, it's fun to be part of these games.

{"question":"What kind of legacy have the greatest Cincinnati Reds players left behind in terms of retired numbers and hall of fame recognition?","doc_text":"As a sports fan, it\u2019s common practice to say you\u2019re team is THE WORST. But when I said that about the Cincinnati Reds 2016 pitching, I may have been right. Let\u2019s start with FiveThirtyEight.com who pointed out in mid-September that the Reds\u2019 pitching might be the worst of all time:\nBut it\u2019s also symptomatic of a pitching staff that is, by another measure, the worst ever \u2014 and the only one in history that would have been better off being stocked with replacement-level players instead.\nA day later, the Ringer offers Understanding the Plight of Cincinnati\u2019s Historically Awful Starting Pitching Staff:\nEven more troublingly, Reds pitchers have combined for negative 1.1 wins above replacement this season. The 1890 Pittsburgh Alleghenys \u2014 a team that went 23\u2013113, finished 66.5 games out of first place, and featured a veteran pitcher named Phenomenal Smith \u2014 were the last team with a staff below replacement level over a full season.\nThe day after the season ended, FanGraphs proclaims The Reds Actually Did It:\nTo be absolutely clear about what we have here: By our numbers, the Reds just became the first pitching staff in modern history to finish with a negative WAR. It\u2019s only slight, sure, and the difference between them and those 1915 Athletics is less than one win, but that negative symbol is conspicuous. It pushes the digits over to the right, so they can stand out. The Reds, as a collective, featured a major-league pitching staff that was a worse-than-replacement-level pitching staff. That\u2019s almost unfathomable, is what that is.\nYeah, but what would Bill James say?\nI didn\u2019t do this to pick on the 2016 Cincinnati Reds; I was just doing the Reds as I was doing every team. Also, it should be noted that in a hitter\u2019s year, in a hitter\u2019s era, the numbers go up. If you\u2019re 10% worse than league in 1930, that\u2019s more runs than if you\u2019re 10% worse than league in 1968. But the study concluded that the worst pure-pitching stats of all time by far belonged to the 2016 Cincinnati Reds.\nSo there you have it. The 2016 Reds pitching was THE WORST."}
{"question":"What makes leather production better for the environment in developed countries?","doc_text":"The choice of an investment location by a multinational enterprise (MNE) is determined not only by firm\u2010specific variables that define the motive of foreign direct investment (FDI), but is also determined by variables that define locational aspects. The purpose of this paper is to report on the study of the constituents of production and logistics environment of a host country and its effect on FDI decisions of MNEs. The concept is introduced of supply chain capability (SCC) of countries, a long\u2010run variable based on the production and logistics environment, as shaping the FDI of MNEs.\nThe research uses regression analyses on secondary data to test the research hypotheses.\nThe analysis substantiates the basic proposition of SCC of a country being a determinant of FDI, and that its effect varies with the size of the host country's economy. Further, the study suggests a differential impact of SCC on developing and developed countries. The study also confirms that SCC is a determinant of vertical and export\u2010platform FDI but not of horizontal FDI.\nThe study has limitations, in that the unit of analysis is a country. Countries, however, are not homogeneous in their SCC. Thus, regional differences or sectoral differences have not been taken into account.\nBy providing a holistic view, SCC helps MNEs in taking a more integrated view of a location's attractiveness. The study also has relevance and prescriptive value, especially for small developing countries which are seeking to improve their attractiveness as a FDI destination.\nEmerald Group Publishing Limited\nCopyright \u00a9 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited"}
{"question":"What makes reinforced PTFE a better choice than molecularly enhanced PTFE (TFM) for valve seats in temperature-varying systems?","doc_text":"However, with extreme amounts of stretching in either direction, the pore size of such membranes eventually increases as the mass of PTFE nodes is depleted. At this point the bulk material behaves more plastically and further stretching simply elongates the fibrils and increases the distance between nodes until macroscopic holes are produced.\nPTFE dispersion grade resin is approximately 95% crystalline, and has a very high melt viscosity. When heated to temperatures above 327\u00b0 C., the PTFE crystallites deform into an amorphous polymer. When cooled below 327\u00b0 C., some of the liquid structure remains; thereby increasing the amorphous content of melted PTFE in comparison to virgin PTFE. Such heating and subsequent cooling of the polymer is called sintering. The sintering of shaped microporous PTFE structures produces a thermosetting effect upon the polymer, thus enabling shape retention and thermal stability. Microporous PTFE membranes are typically sintered by creating a high temperature zone in the final stages of the tenter frame apparatus.\nIn the prior art process of producing PTFE extrudate, difficulties arise in attempts to produce uniform extrudate having satisfactory molecular orientation to facilitate adequate transverse stretching. The molecular orientation of the extrudate ribbon is highly influenced by the Theological properties of the polymer formulation, the pressure applied to the system, and the design of the die. Various grades of PTFE resin provide distinct Theological conditions during extrusion due to different physical and molecular characteristics, therefore different grades of resin produce different degrees of molecular orientation even under the same extrusion conditions. PTFE extrusion systems are complex and difficult to control. Examples of these difficulties are found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,187,390.\nIn U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,125, there is disclosed a process of producing fibrillated IPNs of PTFE and polyorganosiloxanes. The IPNs are formed by either a sequential method or a simultaneous method. The simultaneous method involves the pre-blending of polysiloxane compositions with the organic lubricant used for extrusion. The siloxane\/lubricant blend is then dispersed into the particulate PTFE resin, which is then extruded under similar conditions as those of the prior art."}

{"question":"Hey, I've heard that some cities are letting regular people decide how to spend their money. Which Finnish city is leading the way in giving citizens control over spending decisions?","doc_text":"The city had its own \"Ken Livingston moment,\" a reference to the Mayor of London's vehicle congestion charge, which for the Romans meant strict restrictions on vehicles entering Rome by day. Despite this density and the immigration that caused it, Rome, like London, was no parasite. Its artisans and shopkeepers added value to their wares, and they had a sense of pride in their city. Jones thoroughly debunks a popular view of Rome as a city of villas, and of citizens bathing in calm repose amid luxury.\nRoman entertainments, roads, buildings, aqueducts, brothels, and food distributions, are the concerns of the second chapter, while the Millennium Dome and the BBC--which the government should \"throw out\" in favor of private initiatives--are his modern targets. Chapter Three tells us how the Roman authorities paid for all this--they focused not on extorting Roman citizens, but rather on bleeding other people dry using the army. Jones' Mediterranean world \"was in a fairly constant state of conflict either for self-protection or in order to extract the wealth\" of others. (45) Inside Rome, the ruling aristocracy used the revenue to create a sense of personal beneficence and of loyalty among the populace. The contrast Jones creates with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs today begins with its spending of our money--not money taken from strangers--in a way that divorces our \"payments\" from any direct benefit to us. One suggestion Jones offers is whether Queen Elizabeth should provide some kind of Res Gestae for the British people--a return to the quid pro quo of personal benefaction found in Rome. Is Jones serious about trying to support the English state by taxing foreigners, and then distributing the spoils by personal largesse? Is it properly ironic to claim that the \"lesson for our government\" is to \"concentrate on wondering how to screw it [taxes] out of someone else. That's the way to stay in power.\"? (50)\nChapter Four shows us how the Romans kept control over this cauldron--the key was to gain and keep the support of the population.

{"question":"I work on natural hazard modeling and I'm wondering about the comparison between submarine and terrestrial landslide processes. What evidence is there of seafloor erosion during the Montserrat debris avalanche emplacement, and how does this compare to slope stability assessments in terrestrial settings?","doc_text":"Hazard assessment, which is a necessary precursor to risk assessment, deals with evaluating the likelihood of occurrence of events, such as earthquakes or floods, that may have serious economic and social impacts.\nMost USGS products currently being produced relate to hazard assessment. However, the customers of USGS hazard assessment products are individuals, government entities, and cooperators who perform risk assessment. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this workshop is to make USGS hazard-assessment products more useful to risk assessors.\nThe term \u201chazard\u201d is used in this report in two separate contexts. In the first context, hazard is a generic term for earthquakes, floods, landslides, and volcanoes. In the second context, which is standard in the technical literature on probabilistic risk assessment, hazard is synonymous with the probability of occurrence. Thus, for example, landslide hazard refers to the probability of occurrence of landslides, which are a particular type of hazard. Clarifying this terminology up front will hopefully avoid confusion on the part of the reader.\nMuch was accomplished from the workshop, and participants should be commended for an impressive effort. However, as expected, 2 days was not nearly enough for the group to explore all the issues involving risk assessment for earthquakes, floods, landslides, and volcanoes, much less recommend a master plan for unifying the disciplines. Future efforts should be made to build on this workshop and further enhance cooperation between the disciplines.\nReturn to Top\nSynopsis of presentations and related discussion\nOverview of panel discussions and recommendations\nDiscussion topic 1--What are the similarities and differences among earthquake-, flood-, landslide-, and volcano-hazard assessments?\nTemporal and spatial distribution of source events\nDiscussion topic 2--Which U.S. Geological Survey products are beneficial for risk assessment, and how can products be improved or new products developed to support risk assessment?\nDiscussion topic 3--Which research topics are most important for the future of earthquake-, flood-, landslide-, and volcano-hazard assessments?\nModeling temporal and spatial dependence of source events\nReducing spatial uncertainty in predicted consequences of source events\nDevelopment of improved short-term hazard prediction capability\nDiscussion topic 4--How can hazard and risk assessments be made more unified among earthquakes, floods, landslides, and volcanoes?"}

{"question":"I want to start a fish tank - what are the basics for keeping fish healthy and making it look nice?","doc_text":"Overall, I would definitely recommend these fish fingers to everybody as they are filled with flavour for a bargain price of 60p, who could say no? Thanks for reading.\nWhenever my son has his friend round for tea, his friend always leaves most of his food. I always make sure that he likes what I am making prior to cooking but it really makes no difference. With this in mind and with my son mentioning that he had eaten fish fingers at his friends the week before I thought I would buy a packet for this weeks feast!\nMost of the fish fingers in the frozen aisle were around the \u00a32 mark, some a little more. Fortunately in the 'specials' freezer at the end of the aisle I spotted the basics fish fingers - normally I have to seek out basics products, it is very rare to find them so readily on display!\nTen fish fingers are sold in a cardboard box. Simply packaged as with all other basics products. Plain white with the trade mark orange basics logo.\nAt 99p, I didn't expect too much from the fish fingers - but as they would be likely to be left on the plate anyway, I wasn't too bothered.\nThe fingers are covered in bread crumbs and and look pretty much the same as any branded fish finger. They are perhaps a little thinner but this is negligible.\nI cooked all ten at once - in the oven on a baking tray. They take 15 minutes to cook from frozen. They can also be grilled for 10-12 minutes, or fried for 5-6 minutes.\nWhat went in to the oven a pale-ish orangey colour, came out a nice warm autumnal brown\/orange.\nThere isn't a horrible fishy smell as they cook, or when they are removed from the oven which is good as I find these smells tend to linger in the kitchen.\nIt would be rude not to try one of the fingers so I did. In the past I have found breaded fingers to be a little crispy for my liking, however long I cook them for. Not so in this case, the fingers are easily cut with a knife, they almost fall apart on cutting. The fish inside is extremely moist and I have to say very tasty. So tasty that my sampling of the product resulted in my consuming 3 of the fingers one after the other! The third with tomato sauce!"}

{"question":"daily minimum cobalamine dosage kidney disease","doc_text":"Kidneys, the pair of bean-shaped organs in the lower abdomen, help remove excess water and waste from the body. Kidney diseases such as kidney infections, kidney stones, renal failure and kidney cancer affect the healthy functioning of these organs. In fact, the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse estimates that more than 10 percent of the American population 20 years or older has chronic kidney disease. Apart from medications and surgery, garlic may also help manage kidney diseases. Talk to your doctor to find out if garlic is right for you.\nGarlic as Medicine\nGarlic, or Allium sativum, is a small, perennial plant native to central Asia. The cloves from the bulbs of the plant are traditionally used as a spice and flavoring agent in many cultures around the world. Garlic contains a chemical compound known as allicin that gives it immense medicinal value. The common cold, infection, heart disease and certain cancers are just some of the conditions that may be treated using fresh garlic or garlic supplements, available in powder, capsule, oil and liquid extract form. Their appropriate form and dose varies, depending on your age and overall health. Talk to your doctor to establish a regimen that is right for you.\nRole in Kidney Health\nThe biologically active components of garlic can inhibit the production of blood pressure-enhancing hormones by the kidneys. They can also lower the reabsorption of salts by the kidneys and increase urine production. All these mechanisms may help reduce high blood pressure, says Dr. James Scala, author of the book \u201cTwenty-Five Natural Ways to Lower Blood Pressure.\u201d A study published in a 2008 issue of the journal \u201cPharmacological Reports\u201d also reveals that garlic can significantly lessen kidney damage associated with mercury chloride exposure in laboratory animals. Mercury chloride -- used in disinfectants, insecticides, batteries, wood preservatives and other products you may come in contact with daily -- is a potential carcinogen, although its effects have not been proven conclusively in humans. Another study in the February 2001 issue of the journal \u201cFood and Chemical Toxicology\u201d points out that low doses of garlic may increase the antioxidant status of kidneys and protect them from free radical-mediated damage. The authors of the study, however, point out that high doses of the herb may have the opposite effect, and thereby emphasize that more research has to be done determine a safe dosage range for garlic."}

{"question":"How much higher is the cancer risk with Lynch syndrome?","doc_text":"Cancer Gene Study Offers to Detect Disposition, Half Ignore ResultsBy Terence Monmaney\nLos Angeles Times\nGiven a chance to learn if they carried a gene that raised their risk of developing breast, ovarian, or prostate cancer, surprisingly few of the 279 women and men in a new study -- only 43 percent -- chose to take such a look at the future.\nThat was a central finding of the largest study yet of how people react when offered a blood test for the so-called breast cancer gene, BRCA1, which boosts the likelihood of developing the disease to 87 percent, about eight times higher than that of women generally. The gene also confers a 40 percent to 60 percent lifetime risk of ovarian cancer and about a 10 percent risk of prostate cancer in men.\nAmong the study subjects, who belonged to families with pronounced histories of breast and ovarian cancer, a major reason for declining the BRCA1 test was fear that a positive result would jeopardize health or life insurance. Another prominent fear was that a faulty test would mistakenly label, and perhaps stigmatize, a noncarrier as positive, prompting much needless anxiety and perhaps even surgery.\nThe issues raised by the study spotlight an emerging dilemma that pits a newly acquired power of science, which literally means \"to know,\" against the foremost of medical ethics, which is to do no harm.\nThe study \"is a very important contribution to understanding ... what possible choices people will make when they face the actual experience,\" said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Center for Human Genome Research at the National Institutes of Health.\n\"Being concerned about insurability and discrimination is very unsettling to people and may dissuade them from seeking testing,\" said Dr. Henry Lynch, a cancer specialist at Creighton University in Omaha and co-author of the study. It appears Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\nTesting negative for the gene also has the potential to spare women unnecessary surgery, the study showed. Before the test was available, women whose family history placed them at high risk of cancer sometimes had their breasts or ovaries surgically removed, the only known way to help prevent the diseases from developing."}

They had the general idea of what the game should look like, but no one had any concept of how to implement the game, or even if it was feasible much less marketable. I started by consulting with the engineers at Rockwell to determine what chip we had that might be modified to implement such a game. We came up with one of the simple handheld LED calculator chips which had 511 bytes of ROM space for a program.

{"question":"How did generational knowledge transfer work in religious versus secular institutions?","doc_text":"In fact, in one of them, it is precisely stated that it shall be State\u2019s responsibility to protect the choice of faith of every individual. This was in third century B.C. Tolerance as State policy was necessary in India not only because of religious diversity. It is necessary also because of the vast array of diversity that exists in terms of language, cultures, traditions etc. A definition of secularism, which is the most appropriate in the Indian context, is, thus, not confined only to the issue of separation of religion from the State and politics. While this is important in itself, secularism in the Indian context also should mean the right of equality and opportunity to all languages, cultures, traditions to co-exist and thrive without the fear of domination of any one by the other.\nLooking at the issue in this manner would immediately suggest that secularism and democracy in India are inseparable. The protection of the rights of minorities of all variety (religious, linguistic etc) is an integral part of democracy. Religious or linguistic intolerance impinges, therefore, upon not only secularism but also democracy.\nHence, any attack on secularism in India is also simultaneously an attack on democracy and democratic institutions. It is, therefore, no coincidence that rabid Hindu communalism that today, albeit temporarily, controls the reins of power, targets not only the secular foundations by spreading the hatred of religious intolerance but also attacks democratic institutions. The efforts to re-write the Indian Constitution, the strident cries for a presidential form of government \u2013 all are part of the larger jigsaw puzzle to facilitate the establishment of a \u201cHindu Rashtra\u201d.\nThe attempts to re-write Indian history and to doctor the educational system on communal lines must also be seen in the same light. Much of Dr. Zakir Husain\u2019s life and work related to this field. He would have been aghast at the travesty of history that is currently being undertaken by the communal forces.\nIt is, indeed, unfortunate that this assault on India\u2019s secular democracy comes in the name of religion. By now, it is clear that religious fundamentalism of all variety, Taliban or Saffron, has very little to do with religion or religiosity. It is purely an attempt to consolidate political power by misusing religion.\nSeeking your indulgence, I think it necessary to digress and put at rest a great deal of controversy that has always existed regarding the Marxist understanding of religion."}

{"question":"nose blockage and yellow mucus not going away with cold medicine what could this mean","doc_text":"Mucus-ridden stools and other symptoms such as stomachache, fever, poor appetite, and general lethargy.\nTake your baby to a doctor if you see these signs or if you suddenly notice mucus in stools. There are various reasons why a baby could have more mucus in the stools.\nWhat Could Cause Excess Mucus In The Baby\u2019s Poop?\nSome conditions cause excessive production of mucus by the mucous membranes:\n- Irritable bowel syndrome: A genetic ailment that causes several symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and the presence of excessive white-colored mucus. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) consistently produce excess mucus (3) (4). At least 25% (1 out of 4) of the time, the stool will contain surplus mucus (5).\n- Intussusception: A condition where a section of the intestine collapses and folds on itself to create a ring-like blockage. It is most common among babies between the ages of five to nine months (6). Intussusception can cause the baby to excrete jelly-like, mucus-ridden stools (7).\n- Ulcerative colitis: It is chronic inflammation of the large intestine. Irritation of the bowel, pain, and stool with mucus are among the symptoms (8). Ulcerative colitis is one of the many inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (9).\n- Cystic fibrosis: A genetic disorder that leads to excess production of mucus. It leads to the accumulation of excessive mucus in the lungs and digestive system (10). Infants with the condition may excrete more mucus than usual.\n- Intestinal infection: Several intestinal pathogens can lead to the passage of more mucus in stools. Examples of some infections are E. coli bacteria infection (11), and infections due to intestinal parasites (12).\n- Bowel polyps: These are small growths emerging from the inner lining of the gastrointestinal tract. They often lead to rectal bleeding and mucus in stools (13). Polyps in infants and toddlers are called juvenile polyps (14).\n- Allergies: An infant with allergies and food intolerance can excrete excessive mucus in their stool. This happens because of the inflammation of the intestine due to ingestion of an allergic food (15)."}

{"question":"I've been reading about ancient religious clothing and was wondering what kind of precious stones were used in the first row of the breastplate that they made?","doc_text":"Paula's monument was Jerome's life-work--his letters, his doctrinal treatises, his commentaries, but above all, his Latin version of the Hebrew Scriptures--the Vulgate. And what a unique monument it is!\nAll the Anglo-Saxon translations, not to speak of others, were made from it, as was also the English version of Wyklif, while its influence in Tyndale's and subsequent English versions was most profound. It was the first book to come from the press of Gutenberg, a copy of which Bible is the most prized volume in the world today. But a still more signal honor awaited it, for it was decreed by the Council of Trent, that \"the old and Vulgate edition,\" approved \"by the usage of so many ages,\" should be the only Latin version used in \"public lectures, disputations, sermons and expositions.\" And so far-reaching has been its influence through the centuries that the religious terminology of the languages of Western Europe has in great part been derived from or colored by the Vulgate.\nNor is this all. As is well known, most of the modern languages of Europe have been formed under the influence of, and as the result of the fecundity of, the ancient Latin. But the Latin from which these languages have been fashioned was not the language of Cicero, or of Virgil, popular as he was during the Middle Ages, but the language of the Church and of the Bible--the language of the Vulgate--which was created by Jerome acting under the inspiration of Paula. It is the Vulgate, which was the first book of which the nascent languages of medieval times essayed a translation, the first book of which an attempt at translation was made in the French of the twelfth century, and in the German of the eighth century. It is the Vulgate, with its admirable narratives, with the fascinating simplicity of Genesis, with its charming pictures of the infancy of the human race that supplied the needed language in which to address the barbarians from the North, when they first came under the beneficent influence of Christian civilization.\nOur fathers were wont to cover the Vulgate with gold and precious stones.

Viet Tan is a frequent critic of the regime, and long before the Amnesty International report, it spoke out against Facebook\u2019s alleged complicity in taking down dissident voices. The Vietnamese government considers Viet Tan a terrorist organization, stemming from its origins as a violent revolutionary organization based in the United States.\nAlthough it is suppressed within the country, Viet Tan continues to serve as an outlet and mouthpiece for dissident voices operating both within and outside of Vietnam, many of whom rely on Facebook and other social media platforms to get their messages out. Facebook\u2019s latest act of cooperation with the government comes at a key moment in the country: the 2021 elections. In January, the Communist Party of Vietnam will hold its the 13th National Congress, and the National Assembly will hold its elections in May. Vietnam holds direct elections for its National Assembly, but the top positions in government are elected by the legislative body, not citizens. Those top four leadership positions, \u201cthe four pillars,\u201d are the party secretary general, the state president, the prime minister, and the chairperson of the national assembly. Vietnam is no stranger to restricting free expression ahead of elections, and so this clampdown of COVID-19 \u201cfake news\u201d appears to be perfectly timed.\nKey to these suppression is the April 15 decree outlawing fake news. In addition to banning COVID-19 related misinformation, it restricts all social media posts that share banned books and publications, documents deemed to be state secrets, or even maps and charts failing to show the Vietnamese claims in the South China Sea. The crackdown on COVID-19 fake news and Vietnam\u2019s use of nationalism to unite the country against the virus have been the primary focus of much of the media attention surrounding this decree.

When searching for store-bought medications, ask the pharmacist about any negative effects they can have.\nRaw or steamed veggies are great. Cooking foods can deplete the Probiotics. Steaming is a way of cooking your food and keeping the Probiotics intact.

{"question":"What causes biological cells to have electrical charges?","doc_text":"This process notably occurs in the formation of myelin sheathes around axons (a part of neurons) which has been shown to play a role in increased efficiency of communication within and between neuronal circuits, which may facilitate the recall of some memories.\nWhat isn\u2019t understood is whether these sheathes form around axons related to some memories more than others. Using a mouse model, Dr. Kheirbek and Dr. Chan are exploring this process, seeking to understand if the axons of neuronal ensembles activated by fearful experiences are preferentially myelinated \u2013 essentially, making traumatic memories easier to recall \u2013 and how this process works and can be manipulated. Preliminary research found that fear conditioning resulted in an increase in cells that are precursors for myelin formation, and that this process was involved in the long-term consolidation of fear memories.\nOne experiment will tag which cells are activated during contextual fear conditioning and observe myelination in those cells; then, the researchers will manipulate the electrical activity of distinct circuits to determine what causes the additional myelination to occur. Additional experiments will observe if mice that have had new myelin formation suppressed exhibit the same fear responses as mice with normal myelin formation. A third experiment will observe the entire process with high-resolution live imaging over a long period. The research could have implications for conditions such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, where traumatic memories and fear response are activated, or memory disorders where recall is disturbed.\nThanos Siapas, Ph.D., Professor of Computation and Neural Systems, Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology\nCircuit Dynamics and Cognitive Consequences of General Anesthesia\nWhile general anesthesia (GA) has been a boon to medicine by allowing surgeries that would be impossible in awake patients, the exact ways GA affects the brain and its long-term effects are poorly understood.

{"question":"I love looking for unusual animals - can you tell me how small a piece you need to cut from a flatworm to make it regenerate into a complete new animal?","doc_text":"Internal parasites are one of the most common problems encountered in animal husbandry, including livestock and household pets. In my experience, worms can quickly become a serious issue \u2013 living in a warm climate unfortunately means that the little worms are practically a year-round nuisance.\nWhether you use contemporary or natural dewormers, prevention and vigilant monitoring of parasites is key. Unfortunately, it\u2019s impossible to get rid of all parasites completely without keeping your animals isolated in a glass bubble. Instead, I\u2019m learning that the ideal goal is to have a farm that maintains only small, easily controlled internal parasites that healthy animals can develop immunity against without suffering any ill effects.\nThe sheer number of different internal parasites, even the ones that only attack the gastrointestinal tracts, is staggering.

The good news is that not all worms are bad, and in fact, many of them are beneficial to some animals\u2019 digestive systems, helping to break down food and prevent other worms from taking over.\nBelow are two of the most common parasitic worm types, which are certainly NOT beneficial in any way:\nFlatworm\/Tapeworm (platyhelminthes): The flat tapeworm can be found in all mammals and less commonly in birds. When passed, they appear to be white, flattened grains of rice. These small \u201cworms\u201d are actually segments of a much larger worm living inside the animal\u2019s intestine. The parasites spread through infested feces and even by swallowing a host flea (cats and dogs often get tapeworms this way). Tapeworms are not usually a problem for grazers such as cattle, but they can compound an existing problem with other parasites, such as the fluke flatworm.\nRoundworm (nematodes): There are many different species of roundworm, which can infest mammals and birds. Roundworms were a real problem in my chicken flock a while back, but these worms are also a common issue for grazers, cats, and dogs.\nA holistic approach towards parasite control with a focus on prevention is a much easier and more effective tactic than using dewormers every time an infestation causes problems. Careful management of hygiene alone can go a long way in preventing a problem before it has a chance to get out of hand. Below are some simple guidelines."}

One should neither be carried away, nor lose focus because of unwanted suggestions, unreasonable expectations and uninvited comments during a rough phase in a relationship. No matter how much noise is created, whether it is the bridge or the relationship, it has to be built.\nThere may be time overrun in constructing a bridge. People would continue to suffer during that extended period. But at the end the bridge turns out to be a boon. Building each relationship too needs different time span. Sometimes it is sooner than expected; sometimes it is just as expected, sometimes longer and sometimes much longer, making the wait unreasonable. No matter how much time it takes, those who are happy in a relationship today are those who forgot their watches and watched the relationship grow with love and understanding.\nA poorly built bridge can harm several lives and a weak relationship can break many hearts. A bridge requires thousands of hands to build, but a relationship requires only two hands. Two hands to hug the other person and express your love and care at all times. Two hands to wipe the tears of agony and to assure that you are always there to comfort and help. Two hands to hold each other and walk the journey of life, irrespective of the ups and downs, good times or challenging moments."}
{"question":"error ellipse vs pca axis meaning difference","doc_text":"We have freedom to choose what these six dimensions are. Based on my description of the problem, it would seem that the most obvious way to choose these dimensions would be exactly what I said \u2014 position and velocity. Together, these bits of information can be represented as two three-dimensional vectors, the orbital position vector and the orbital velocity vector . Together, these are called the orbital state vectors, and they are enough to completely describe an orbit.\nFor practical purposes, however, this is not a very useful way of describing an orbit. Yes, knowing where we are and how we are moving gives us enough information to completely describe what we are doing, but it would be far more useful to find a set of parameters that more directly describes the shape of the orbit. The traditional set is known as the Keplerian orbital elements.\nNamed for Johannes Kepler, who discovered that all of the planets move in elliptical orbits, these orbital elements describe the size, shape, and orientation of the orbit. For a basic two-body problem, such as a spacecraft orbiting a spherical planet, neglecting things like the gravitational influence of other bodies, the orbit will always be a conic section \u2014 a circle, an ellipse, a parabola, or a hyperbola, with the body to be orbited at one of the foci of the section. For our purposes, we will not consider parabolas and hyperbolas, which are for escape trajectories. Instead, we will focus only on circles and ellipses. For simplicity\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say that the planet is located at the point on the diagram below.\nLet\u2019s go through the six parameters now:\nThe first parameter we will look at is eccentricity. Eccentricity is a single number that describes the shape of our ellipse. On the diagram at right, the eccentricity is defined by the ratio of the distance between the foci ( and ) and the major axis (the widest distance across the ellipse \u2014 from to ). An eccentricity of zero makes a perfect circle. As the eccentricity increases towards 1, the ellipse becomes flatter and flatter. Once the eccentricity reaches or surpasses 1, it\u2019s no longer an ellipse \u2014 rather, a parabola or a hyperbola, i.e., an escape trajectory.\nThe next parameter we\u2019ll explore is the semimajor axis. This parameter controls the size of the orbit."}

{"question":"I've been reading about the relationship between attention and driving safety - what have studies discovered about where drivers focus their gaze when navigating curves on the road?","doc_text":"Fleet managers have a lot on their plate when it comes to their fleet operations. This includes daily logistical planning, route planning and driver monitoring tasks. However, fleet managers must also ensure that fleet safety remains their highest priority. Luckily, evidence suggests that an effective fleet telematics policy holds the key to improving fleet safety.\nA leading study published in September of 2020 notes and highlights the relationship between fleet telematics and fleet safety. It also addresses key risk indicators for drivers while out on the road as well as how organisations can use fleet telematics to reduce these.\nThis post condenses and summarises the key factors from the study that fleet managers should know.\nLearn why a modern fleet telematics policy should be a priority.\nThe Most Important Fleet Driving Safety Indicators\nThe study concluded that driving behaviours themselves are a leading driving safety factor. In particular, the following driving behaviours were highlighted as being the biggest safety indicators:\n- Vehicle speed (compared to the respective road speed limit)\n- G-Force factors, namely harsh-braking and vehicle swerving from driving too fast\n- Hard acceleration and aggressive cornering\nFundamentally, the study notes that identifying and analysing these safety indicators are key to improving driver safety. These should be at the forefront of the fleet manager\u2019s safety strategy.\nThe study also points out that fleet managers should focus on a small number of safety indicators when it comes to communicating with and evaluating drivers.\nThis is because a high number of safety indicators can provide too much data to work with and prove confusing. It is also because these above-mentioned indicators were by far the biggest safety factors themselves.\nFurthermore, the study also notes that implementing an effective fleet telematics policy is a great way to address such safety indicators.\nLearn More: Reduce Fleet Driving Risk Factors\nOrganisations\/Fleet Managers Should Assist Drivers\nFleet managers are also responsible for assisting their drivers in promoting safe driving habits. The study notes that inefficient driving on behalf of fleet drivers is unlikely to change by itself. Therefore, a fleet manager\u2019s proactive feedback- and data-based approach is key in affecting driver safety indicators.\nImplementing fleet telematics that specifically focuses on driver behaviour is an efficient way to assist drivers. A good fleet telematics policy promotes safe driver behaviour through data to highlight room for improvement as well as driver behaviour progression."}

{"question":"How do doctors detect serious medical conditions like epilepsy and brain tumors in patients using brain monitoring?","doc_text":"Published on December 25th, 2014 | by News Feed\nColorado Approves Over $8 Million For Medical Marijuana Research\nFor the first time ever, government money will be used to support medical marijuana research. It was a historic moment this week when Colorado granted more than $8 million to further study how marijuana could impact devastating health conditions like brain tumors, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, and Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nWhile it\u2019s still in the early stages, the grants are evidence that we are officially moving into a new frontier for medical marijuana in the United States. The initial studies will likely throw open the floodgates and more researchers will take interest and further studies will follow closely behind.\nDr. Suzanne Sisley, a psychiatrist in Arizona, is thrilled to see government funds going to learn about the positive impacts of weed for patients. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had government money to look at the efficacy of marijuana, not the harms of marijuana,\u201d she explained. Sisley plans to pioneer a new study to investigate how marijuana could help veterans suffering from PTSD.\nDr. Larry Wolk, Colorado\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, said the research is desperately needed because doctors need more specific information to better guide their patients. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else in medicine where we give a patient some seeds and say, \u2018Go grow this and process it and figure out how much you need,\u2019\u201d Wolk said. \u201cWe need research dollars we can answer more questions.\u201d\nMoney for the grants will come from Colorado\u2019s medical marijuana patient fees. The program received 57 applications from interested researchers, but the advisory board chose eight proposals to sponsor for this first round of grants. The studies will cost an estimated $7.6 million, but the board approved grants totaling $8.4 million in case researchers exceeded their budget proposals as is oftentimes the case.\nThere are currently 117,000 people registered in Colorado\u2019s medical marijuana registry. Each individual must pay $15 per year to stay on the state list. By using the money collected from the registry for research, Colorado will move towards better treatment for these patients. Hopefully, this will open the door for other states to begin funding medical marijuana research as well."}
{"question":"How do emperor penguins manage eye adaptation in different environments, and what's unique about their breeding location compared to other birds?","doc_text":"Evolution has taken these birds in different directions, by producing different adaptations for life at sea. This is called divergent evolution.\nThere are nearly 10,000 species of bird in the world and there are probably more than 100 billion individual birds. None is exactly the same as any another. Every species is different, and every individual bird is unique.\nSome families, including parrots, pigeons and hummingbirds have more than 300 species. Others, such as the ostrich, have just one or two. A family evolves as many different species as the environment can support. Each one has a slightly different adaptation.\nThrushes are a good example. The blackbird feeds on worms and berries on lawns and in gardens and woodlands, the song thrush feeds mainly on slugs and snails, the mistle thrush feeds more on fruit and the rare ring ouzel lives on mountainsides. Some thrushes, redwings and fieldfares, migrate to Britain for the winter, while the ring ouzel heads south from its snowy mountains.\nMale or female?\nMale and female birds rarely look quite the same either. In some species the differences are tiny, such as the slightly thicker belly stripe on a male great tit. In others, they are much more obvious \u2013 such as blackbirds, where the female is brown.\nThe differences depend on their behaviour: most male ducks have colourful feathers for courtship display; most female ducks have brown feathers to camouflage them on the nest.\nSize can also differ. A female sparrowhawk is almost one third larger than the male. This means the female can catch birds as big as song thrushes whereas the males can only manage smaller birds such as blue tits. This stops the two of them competing for prey.\nColours for all seasons\nBirds also change their colours at different times of year, by moulting their old worn feathers.\nMany have one breeding plumage and one different non-breeding plumage. For instance, a male wheatear in spring has a handsome pink breast, blue-grey back and black face mask. By autumn, he has become brownish all over \u2013 just like the female.\nEven within one species, each individual bird is slightly different from every other. This is usually hard for us to spot, but in a few birds it\u2019s more obvious. Some birds of prey, such as buzzards, can also vary greatly."}

{"question":"father mychal judge september 11 memorial church location details","doc_text":"The church frequently communicates its views by picketing, often at military funerals. In the more than 20 years that the members of Westboro Baptist have publicized their message, they have picketed nearly 600 funerals.\nMarine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder was killed in Iraq in the line of duty. Lance Corporal Snyder\u2019s father selected the Catholic church in the Snyders\u2019 hometown of Westminster, Maryland, as the site for his son\u2019s funeral. Local newspapers provided notice of the time and location of the service.\nPhelps became aware of Matthew Snyder\u2019s funeral and decided to travel to Maryland with six other Westboro Baptist parishioners (two of his daughters and four of his grandchildren) to picket. On the day of the memorial service, the Westboro congregation members picketed on public land adjacent to public streets near the Maryland State House, the United States Naval Academy, and Matthew Snyder\u2019s funeral. The Westboro picketers carried signs that were largely the same at all three locations. They stated, for instance: \u201cGod Hates the USA\/Thank God for 9\/11,\u201d \u201cAmerica is Doomed,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Pray for the USA,\u201d \u201cThank God for IEDs,\u201d \u201cThank God for Dead Soldiers,\u201d \u201cPope in Hell,\u201d \u201cPriests Rape Boys,\u201d \u201cGod Hates Fags,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re Going to Hell,\u201d and \u201cGod Hates You.\u201d\nThe protest and highly offensive signs distressed Matthew Snyder\u2019s family. They sued Phelps claiming, among other things, intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). For the non-lawyer: the Snyder\u2019s claimed Westboro purposely protested knowing the protest would cause emotional trauma and harm to the Snyder family. A jury awarded Snyder\u2019s family a verdict of $10.9 million against Phelps, the judge lowered this to $5 million. The jury and judge agreed that Phelps had damaged Snyder and his family. The case was appealed and reversed on appeals before making it to the Supreme Court. It should be noted: Phelps never contested whether there was harm at the Supreme Court; emotional trauma was a given. As I mentioned previously, the Supreme Court held 8 \u2013 1 that Westboro\u2019s protest was protected by the First Amendment from tort liability (meaning people could not claim harm by the speech). The Supreme Court ruled the First Amendment was more important to uphold than the harm suffered by the Snyder family. To do otherwise would potentially chill free expression."}

In that case, you can get it down to about $100 per day per person.\nQualifications to Bareboat Charter\nWithout a doubt, you will always be asked to give the yacht charter company your sailing resume. This will contain documentation of your past sailing experience, any sailing instructor on-the-water assessments, and any theory courses you have taken. For the Caribbean, you don\u2019t need a formal license to bareboat charter (captain your own boat). Don\u2019t believe any sailing associations who say you must have one. What you do need, however, is a good sailing resume. Clear your resume with the yacht charter company at the time of making your booking; NOT when you arrive at the base.\nFor the Mediterranean, you will need a sailing license AND an acceptable resume. In general, Mediterranean countries accept your home country license as long as it is a government approved license. The NauticEd SLC\u2122 is an acceptable sailing license.\nFor the resume, a good rule of thumb to go by is that yacht charter companies will require about 50 days of sailing experience, 25 of which as master of the vessel and some of that experience should be on a vessel within 10 feet of your regular experience. You should also have some formal sailing theory knowledge displayed on your resume. Again, the NauticEd SLC will take care of that.\nResponsibility-wise, formal sailing theory knowledge is essential. You should know these (and more):\n- All the rules of giveway for all situations for all vessels you might encounter\n- Colors and shapes of navigation marks including Cardinal marks\n- The IALA-A and IALA-B Lateral Mark system\n- Coastal Navigation\n- Electronic Navigation\n- Anchoring and Mooring techniques\n- Sail trim and reefing\n- Crew overboard retrieval\n- Maneuvering a large boat under power in tight marinas\n- Boat systems, including electricity system and water\/wastewater systems\n- Storm management\n- Weather forecasting\nNauticEd has an extensive Bareboat Charter Master bundle of courses for $175 that covers all this and more."}

{"question":"What are the specific benefits that a developer gains from setting up an upstream branch in their daily coding workflow, and how does this relate to the fundamental concepts of version control?","doc_text":"Many of the cis-regulatory motifs have been successfully identified by phylogenetic footprinting, which makes use of cross-species sequence conservation as a functional signature [2\u20136]. Based on this rationalization, we aimed to test if the complexity of transcriptional regulation depends on gene function, by looking at the sequence conservation at the proximal upstream region. This is the first whole genome study providing statistical evidence of significant conservation in upstream regions of human genes involved in certain biological processes and functions.\nThere have been studies on how gene function is related to degree of conservation and evolutionary rate in the protein-coding region. For example, Clark et al.  detected functional categories that showed accelerated evolution of the protein-coding region in human compared to chimp, based on site-specific dN\/dS ratios. The functional categories include 'olfaction', 'signal transduction', 'cell adhesion', 'transport', 'developmental processes', 'ion channel' and 'extracellular matrix'. In , Dorus et al. reported that the protein coding regions of the genes linked to nervous system development show positive selection in the primate lineage compared to rodents, by using housekeeping genes as a control. Bustamante et al.  compared within-species polymorphism and between-species divergence to detect positively and negatively selected human genes. Functional categories with an excess of positively selected genes included 'sensory perception', 'defence\/immunity protein' and in particular, 'transcription factor'. Some discrepancy exists among studies, since  detected 'ectoderm development', 'extracellular matrix' and 'voltage-gated potassium channel' as categories with an excess of negatively selected genes.\nLittle is known about how the proximal upstream regions evolve in those genes that are detected to be positively selected, even though it is an interesting question whether the noncoding regulatory regions will show a similar pattern as the coding regions. Interestingly, we detected a significantly higher upstream conservation in these adaptive genes, particularly those involved in development, cell communication, signal transduction, transcription factor and neurophysiological functions. One possibility is that there is opposite purifying selection on the upstream regulatory region and the protein-coding region. The other possibility is that a relatively high regulatory complexity exists in these genes and that their dense cis-regulatory elements provide higher promoter conservation. We speculate that the latter explanation is biologically more intuitive. According to , a complex network can rapidly achieve the ability to buffer mutations."}

Once the page is retrieved, the station sends the data back to the satellite so that it can display the desired page. This is a journey of about 140,000 kilometers!\nSuch a distance causes latency between the request and the response, which providers are working hard to reduce. This is where the innovation of the space internet comes in.\nInstead of sending satellites 36,000 km away, we are talking about sending them into low orbit. Smaller devices, and therefore more numerous, allowing to reduce the time of result, but also to cover the whole globe.\nThe satellites in low orbit make it possible to broadcast the Internet much more quickly. These small stellar armies are called constellations (in relation to their resemblance with the formation of real constellations seen from the Earth)."}

{"question":"number indigenous sites artefacts damaged destroyed warragamba dam wall raising","doc_text":"As evident in the Chixoy project, where the selection of the site for the dam was considered a massive state failure due to geological miscalculations, it became obvious that the development promised by the government (the official website for the Xalal\u00e1 project states that one of its goals is to better the quality of life for Guatemalans) will not benefit the indigenous communities in the region. In Chixoy, the dam project already has displaced 3,500 Mayan community members and affected 6,000 other families who lost their land and means of livelihood. The argument that few will benefit at the expense of many apparently matters little to Guatemala City: The proposed dam is scheduled to bring in millions of dollars in taxes and salary revenue and is expected to produce 886 GWh per year.\nThe Indigenous Movement\nSuch disregard for the welfare of a population sector that accounts for a majority of Guatemala\u2019s nationals (although officially the number is said to be 40 percent, other sources put the percentage of the indigenous at close to 60 percent) has motivated a determined call to action by the indigenous. In Guatemala, hostility and racism towards indigenous groups is manifested by political exclusion. The unvoiced consensus among the powerful Europeanized minority remains that although the indigenous population is substantial, its political representation should remain marginalized. President \u00c0lvaro Colom\u2019s blatant disregard for the 2007 community referendums, valid under international law, highlights the Central American state\u2019s need for a more powerful indigenous presence in government.\nIn 1993, with the help of a failed self-coup by former President Jorge Serrano Elias, the Permanent Maya Assembly, representing an early indigenous political movement, asserted its presence and its push for permanence in the Guatemalan political arena by submitting a list with three names for the vice-presidency. Although this move gained national attention at the time, the assembly failed to generate any major breakthroughs. The indigenous movement lay semi-dormant for a number of years, until the recent election of Bolivia\u2019s Evo Morales, the first indigenous leader in Latin America, raised expectations among Guatemala\u2019s underrepresented community. This prompted a 2006 statement by Rigoberta Mench\u00fa Mum, 1992 Nobel Peace Prize winner and an indigenous leader, to announce that she would pursue the presidency in the 2007 election.\nMench\u00fa\u2019s presidential bid that year proved to be a fiasco, as she gained only about 3 percent of the vote."}

The highlight of the event was the presence of the producers, who travelled from Brittany and Northern Portugal to showcase their activities, and engage with participants on sustainable fishing in Europe.\nFrom left to right:\nJean-Baptiste Goulard and his langoustines; Anne Menguy and her trout mousse with Scarlette Le Corre, fisherwoman; Joseph Thaeron and his oysters\nTheir presence was highly appreciated by the Members of the European Parliament who attended, giving them the opportunity to discover first-hand some of the best practices of sustainable fishing in Europe. Indeed, all the seafood products served on Wednesday are examples of what the entire European fishing sector can offer today, and illustrate the three pillars of sustainable development (environmental, social and economic).\nFrom selective fishing of langoustines, to sustainable oyster farming, from the valorisation of \u201cugly\u201d bits of smoked trout, to a seaweed farming activity that ensures a year-long livelihood, all the products showcased are illustrations of what the men and women working in the European fishing sector do best.\nBlue Fish Europe and Renata Briano are proud of the outcome of the event, which gathered more than 150 attendees, and to have brought the reality of sustainable fishing in Europe to Parliament decision-makers. Blue Fish Europe will remain committed to being a catalyst for constructive change and positive engagement between the fishing sector and governments and hopes to make this event an annual gathering in the European Parliament."}
{"question":"What benefits can I expect to see in my daily life if I consistently use the sleep therapy machine as prescribed?","doc_text":"Alternatively, women may decide to reduce or stop using antidepressants if their menopause symptoms improve or go away naturally or through other treatments. It is essential to discuss the potential benefits and risks of continued antidepressant use with one\u2019s healthcare provider before making any significant changes to the medication regimen.\n5. Alternatives to antidepressants for menopause management\nFinally, antidepressants are not the only option for managing menopause symptoms, nor are they suitable or appropriate for all women. There are several alternatives to antidepressants that women may consider, such as lifestyle changes, herbal or natural remedies, hormone therapy or vaginal rejuvenation devices.\nLifestyle changes such as regular exercise, healthy diet, stress reduction, and good sleep hygiene can positively affect menopause symptoms in many women. At the same time, herbal supplements or natural remedies can also provide symptom relief for some women. However, some of these options have not been well studied, and there is little regulation or standardization of their use or manufacture, which can pose problems when it comes to selecting safe and effective products.\nHormone therapy (HT) is another option to consider if a woman\u2019s menopause symptoms are particularly bothersome, affecting their quality of life, mood or sleep. HT can replace the declining hormones, estrogen, and progesterone, with potential benefits in reducing hot flashes, improving mood, bone density, and cardiovascular health. However, HT also carries some risks, such as an increase in breast cancer, stroke, heart attack or blood clots, particularly when used long-term or depending on the type, dose and route of administration.\nMenopause can be a challenging period for many women due to bothersome symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings, and sleep disturbances. While antidepressants have been prescribed as one possible solution, the evidence on their effectiveness, safety, and long-term use remains inconclusive and needs further exploration. Women who are considering antidepressants for menopause should consult with their healthcare provider, weigh the potential benefits and risks, and explore alternative options if appropriate. Ultimately, the decision to use antidepressants for menopause symptoms should be based on an individualized evaluation of the benefits, risks and overall health status of each woman."}
{"question":"How do blazar plasma jets accelerate particles, and what technology detects them at the South Pole?","doc_text":"Dawn of Plasma Age\nIn recent years, there has been a virtual eruption of plasma applications. It seems safe to say that here at the beginning of the 21st century, we are also at the dawn of plasma age.\nPlasma has a number of characteristics which make it useful. Because of its exceedingly high temperatures - 10,000 to 20,000\u00b0C - we may use plasma technology to separate out various gases and liquids which are harmful to humans and the environment.\nThis ability has proved beneficial in the production of optical fibre, an essential new material in modern communications. Optical fibre is produced from refined quartz. Japan, for example, imports this quartz from Brazil. In the refining process there, charcoal is used and carbon monoxide, a deadly poison gas, is a by-product. Hot plasmas, however, can dissipate the carbon monoxide and thus reduce the hazards to those working in or living close to the quartz refineries.\nThe ability of plasma to form new coatings is another very useful property. While the plasma temperature must be high, it is not necessary that the matter to be modified need to be the same temperature - this in contrast to the ordinary chemical processes. In this way, a thin metal coating can be applied to the surface of a plastic lens, say, without melting the plastic. When plasma particles and other gaseous particles come together on the surface of solid materials, many useful reactions occur.\nSince the plasma particles (atoms, molecules, charged ions) are pure energy, they stick on a number of surfaces - metal, ceramics, plastic, glass, fabric, wood. The plasma particles actually penetrate the atoms of the solid target, forming a very strong and hard surface. Some of the typical uses here are for drills and other cutting tools, anticorrosion piping (oil, artificial blood tubes), anti-friction coating, anti-rusting, or even the application of gilt to decorative jewellery items.\nLessen Air Conditioning\nPlasma technology makes a major contribution to energy conservation through its ability to coat window glass and thereby reduce infra-red rays. Air conditioning is a major consumer of electricity in hot climates and during summertimes. Infrared rays normally pass through glass windows and help to warm a room. By using plasma technology to coat windows, infra-red warming can be cut, thus reducing air conditioning needs.\nIt has been found that the cost of such plasma coating is more than justified by the reduction in electricity costs."}
{"question":"What concerns did early political thinkers like Weber and Tocqueville have about bureaucratization in modern mass societies, and what solution did they propose?","doc_text":"Location: New York City\nTitle: Capitalism and the Future of Democracy\nDates: November 10, 2014 \u2013 November 21, 2014\nWhat is the relationship between capitalism and democracy? Does economic liberty serve and strengthen political freedom, or does the pursuit of self-interest undermine the moral qualities necessary for political freedom? Does modern democracy ensure a free and flourishing economy, or do the egalitarian ideals of democratic man require limitations on market competition and an ever-expanding welfare state? In the modern age, capitalism and democracy emerged together as two ideas of how human beings should govern themselves. It is no coincidence of history that Adam Smith\u2019s classic The Wealth of Nations, the foundational text for the modern idea of the free economy, was published in the same year (1776) that a new democracy was founded in America. This vision of the good society was dedicated to protecting the rights of man to choose one\u2019s leaders and to pursue one\u2019s economic interests. The role of government was to ensure that all citizens could exercise these self-evident rights and liberties forever and always.\nFrom the beginning, democratic and capitalist societies have inspired great moral and political opposition. Modern welfare-state democracies have chosen to set significant limits on the free economy and to redistribute wealth in the name of equality. We have also seen many democratic societies whose origins were not capitalist at all\u2014like modern Israel; and we have seen societies attempting to combine the wealth that only capitalism creates with autocratic governments that no friend of liberty could ever condone. This institute aims to explore the fundamental questions of political economy, by drawing upon classic texts of modern economic and democratic thought, and then looking at key modern debates and policy dilemmas now facing the advanced democracies of the world.\nWeek One will be led by Yuval Levin, founding editor of National Affairs and one of the leading public intellectuals in the U.S. Through the study of Aristotle and John Locke, Adam Smith and Karl Marx, we will explore the relationship between the pursuit of wealth and the quest for the virtuous society. Week Two will be led by Christopher DeMuth, former president of the American Enterprise Institute and Distinguished Fellow at the Hudson Institute. Turning to modern thinkers who help us understand the relationship between democratic politics, public policy, and economic prosperity, we will study Hayek, Shumpeter, Irving Kristol, and selections from Thomas Piketty\u2019s Capital in the Twenty-First Century."}
{"question":"I've been analyzing workplace risks and disabilities - how do the physical mobility challenges differ between the recycling collector's work environment and Stephen Hawking's professional career?","doc_text":"I will deal with this question over a couple of separate journals, as there are many issues...\nFirstly, it\u2019s crucial you have one or more health and safety representatives (HSRs) as it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that there are going to be a range of issues which need to be considered and dealt with before workers can safely return to work. Under the obligations of the OHS Act, the employer has a legal duty to consult with any HSRs when identifying and assessing hazards and risks, and when implementing controls to eliminate (or minimise) these hazards and risks. If there are no elected HSRs, then the employer must consult with affected workers \u2013 but this is difficult to do effectively, and is often just not done at all. The duty to consult, which is in s35 of the Act, also requires the employer to consult when proposing changes to (almost) anything, like the workplace, the systems of work, the plant and so on.\nThis is super important \u2013 how things will need to be done, what the workplace might look like, and more will need to change. Specifically, this might mean changes to or consideration of:\n- The physical layout of the workplace \u2013 to ensure physical distancing\n- The hours of work\n- How and how often the workplace needs to be cleaned\n- Evacuation procedures\n- How many visitors\/clients can enter the workplace\n- Interaction between staff and visitors\/clients\n- Leave policies\n- and more\u2026\nThese issues will affect the level of risk to workers of contracting COVID-19.\nThere will be other issues, depending on the workplace and the type of work. For example: workers in the transport sector \u2013 potential overcrowding in buses, trams, trains and platforms; or construction workers \u2013 there have already been employer complaints about the difficulties of maintaining physical distancing. For these reasons it is crucial that workers, through their HSRs have a say. It is unacceptable for employers to not consult \u2013 using the excuse that there has not been time. It is absolutely \u2018practicable\u2019 to ensure that HSRs are involved in the return to work process.\nPlease remember: if you have any OHS related queries, then send them in via our Ask Renata facility on the website.\nWA: Ratepayers bear financial burden of Wittenoom asbestos compensation claims\nWittenoom\u2019s asbestos mining past continues to affect Shire of Ashburton ratepayers who face rising legal costs from compensation claims."}

{"question":"What equipment is needed and why for defensive shooting courses?","doc_text":"Players have to execute different skills in swimming, water-treading, passing, catching, and shooting to score a point. Specifically, they have to find a legal way to get the ball into the net of their opposing team.\nFundamentally, the goal of water polo is to ensure that each participating member will play as a team. They have to work hand-in-hand to score a goal.\nNeedless to say, you have to make sure that your team\u2019s score is higher than the opposition\u2019s. Otherwise, you\u2019ll lose.\nThere\u2019s one thing that I can affirm here: teams always struggle to score high. It is not very unusual for a team to score more than 20 points, which is pretty impressive considering that the game is played while players are submerged in the water.\nThere are two opposing teams in water polo. Their objectives are the following:\nProtect and defend their nets from incoming attacks\nScore as many points as possible before the match is over\nBefore we talk about the equipment needed by water polo, I need to discuss a little bit about the players\u2013specifically the composition of the team.\nA single water polo team has seven members. They have to be deployed at the same time.\nSix of them are on the field, while the remaining one serves as the goalkeeper. Such a setup is pretty similar to soccer and football.\nHowever, unlike other competitive team games where players fulfill a particular role or function, water players are free to do what they want. They can move in different parts of the court; they can change positions, depending on the demands of the game.\nThe positions are categorized into the following:\nOffensive \u2013 It is composed of a center forward and two wings that are positioned on the various flanks of the pool. There\u2019s also a point position, which usually plays in and out of the 5m line.\nDefensive \u2013 There are two basic defensive strategies. Man to Man and Zoning.\nMan to man defense is used for high-pressure situations. The game might be down to a tie and your team is desperate to win. Either way, this type of defense does not allow any room for an offense.\nZoning on the other hand is used for low-key game situations. Each defense player is assigned a zone to defend, and each of these zones corresponds to an offensive position. Whichever offensive players go in and out of your zone, the defensive player is responsible for maintaining good defensive positioning in their respective zones."}

Bull acknowledged what many beekeepers already knew: the pest has been found in hives in Maine, Ontario, and Quebec.\nThe affected colonies required provincial approval to be removed, stated Bull. The imported colonies were to be removed by June 22.\nThe beetle\u2019s larvae is the main cause of damage, devouring pollen, bee larvae, and honey. The pest also defecates in honey, spoiling it.\nCalvin Hicks, president of the New Brunswick Beekeepers Association, isn\u2019t happy. \u201cThe obvious concern is that we\u2019ll end up with a domestic population of Small hive beetle in our hives in New Brunswick,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the Ontario government, SHB first hit Manitoba in 2002, and again in 2006.

{"question":"new mexico acequia irrigation system purpose benefits","doc_text":"What is a smart irrigation system\nA smart irrigation system allows for users to establish a watering schedule. The system works automatically by collecting environmental data or meteorological data. Users can also manually input information to regulate their smart irrigation system. Smart irrigation systems were designed to be convenient and efficient. This article will go over how a smart irrigation system works, the different types of smart irrigation systems and the benefits of installing a smart irrigation system.\nHow it works\nA smart irrigation system adjusts a user\u2019s lawn watering schedule based on a variety of factors. These factors can include soil condition, the weather, plant types and the rate of evaporation. Using any of these measurements allows a smart irrigation system to adjust accordingly to any changes in precipitation or temperature. Most smart irrigation systems can be divided into two categories. There are Weather-based smart irrigation controllers and then there are smart irrigation systems that measure the amount of moisture in the soil. Weather-based smart sprinkler controllers are often called evapotranspiration. The word Evapotranspiration comes from two weather factors, Soil-surface evaporation and transpiration. Transpiration is the process by which water travels through a plant and is evaporated from the plants through its stem, leaves or flowers. To measure soil-surface evaporation and plant transpiration, a smart irrigation system measures humidity, solar radiation, temperature and changes in the wind. This information is normally collected on-site, but this data can also be collected from public meteorological data available on the internet. A soil-based smart controller collects data from sensors buried in on-site soil. If the controller detects enough moisture in the soil it will reschedule the irrigation process.\nWhich system should you use\nThe decision to use a weather-base controller versus a soil base controller depends on user preferences. Weather-base controllers are easier to set up but not considered as accurate as soil base controllers by some experts. Soil-based controllers are considered very accurate because they take measurements directly from the soil. The Potential downside to soil-based controllers is that they have to be adjusted and require wiring or need multiple sensors connected to the controller.\nA good system would be the Rachio 3, which has been reviewed in this article: Techimperatives.com \u2013 Spice up your garden with a smart irrigation controller.\nBut there are also quite a few youtube videos that showcase how it works.\nBenefits of a smart irrigation system\nInstalling a smart irrigation system can benefit users in multiple ways."}

They added 1.31 percentage points to GDP.[iii]\n- US Businesses grew more optimistic about the consumer by increasing inventories and adding 0.74 percentage points to GDP.[iv]\n- The big drag (no surprise) was the massive headwinds created by a huge, strong-dollar-induced trade deficit. Net exports subtracted a whopping 1.25 percentage points from GDP.[v,vi]\nUS GDP was in a similar position last year at this time contracting by 2.1%. In some regards, we are a little better off.[vii]\nOne big difference between today and this same time last year is in corporate earnings.\nWhen you look back at Q1 2014 earnings, you see US companies in much stronger shape than today.[viii,ix]\nWhile both periods had analysts predicting earnings shrinking, actual results vary substantially. We had decent growth in Q1 2014, but now we are facing an earnings drought.\nCertainly more volatility will be in our future and that's observable for most watching their portfolio values.\nWhat's less obvious is how much more earnings, trade, and GDP headwinds we have to face from a continued strong dollar. The dollar is up over 18% since it began its rally in mid-2014.[x] However, when looking at the trade-weighted dollar over longer periods of time, you can see we may have more to go.\nA strong dollar has not been devastating at this point and the consumer is anything but disappointing.

In many ways, this is the natural next step in my forty-year career as a transportation engineering and mapping professional. My experience spans the public and the private sector, and I\u2019ve been honored to contribute to several of Canada\u2019s most important transportation initiatives. From helping to plan the Confederation Bridge in Prince Edward to creating the first turn-by-turn navigation maps of all for Canada, I\u2019ve always dedicated myself to projects that make our country more connected and improve quality of life in our communities.\nWhile the field of Big Data analytics is relatively new to me, I\u2019m thrilled that my next contribution to Canada\u2019s transportation practice will be focused on data. The lack of quality transportation data has been the missing link in so much of my work for the past forty years. I believe StreetLight Data has the right solution to this long-standing problem.\nIt's Time for Better Transportation Data Collection\nAt StreetLight Data, I will be helping public agencies and engineering firms adopt StreetLight InSight\u00ae, the first on-demand web application for customized, real-world transportation analytics. It\u2019s a new solution to transportation data collection that gives planners, modelers, and engineers better information efficiently and cost-effectively.

StreetLight InSight makes that possible.\nWhy I Joined StreetLight Data\nThanks to recent product advancements, StreetLight Data is ready to establish a local sales team in Canada. In last week\u2019s software release, we launched several important new analytics in Canada, including Trip Purpose and Visitor Home-Work Projects, which describe how people travel from home to work.

It is the only way, because we are talking about an historic town, where you cannot take measures to enlarge or modify the streets.\nWe thought about making bike paths on secondary streets, but as you know, those are much narrower than the main streets \u2013 barely 2 cars can fit. Now we are repairing secondary streets and we cannot get more than 3-4 meters wide streets, because the space between buildings is around 5-6 meters.

One brisk fall morning, Teddy and Dick hunted and hunted, but their dogs just didn't strike a trail. Off to the side, they could hear a big fox chase going on with hounds barking and scurrying about.

That\u2019s why Manassas is currently working with the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, Division of Natural Heritage (DNH) to survey bees, butterflies, skippers, and moths in its grasslands. The project titled, \u201cHas diversity increased? An inventory of Lepidoptera and Bees,\u201d is made possible through an agreement with the Chesapeake Watershed Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit.\nBiodiversity Before and After\nThe current survey of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) and bees seeks to document what species are present in the park and identify any rare, threatened, or endangered species (like the federally listed rusty-patched bumble bee: Bombus affinis). New data will be compared to a similar earlier survey from the year 2000, also by the Virginia DNH, that identified 33 species of butterflies and skippers and 25 species of moths in Manassas grasslands.\nResearchers will use sweep nets to capture butterflies and skippers and night-time ultra-violet light traps for moths. Bees will be surveyed by bee bowls\/pan traps, vane traps, and netting while they are on flowers. Researchers hope to complete their survey by the end of 2022. Stay tuned for the results.\nIn addition to the current DNH study, Manassas is also part of a study by the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center entitled, \u201cQuantifying native bee and flowering plant variation across grassland site types at four National Parks in the Mid-Atlantic region, U.S.\u201d and a Smithsonian Museum of Natural History study entitled, \u201cBattlefield biodiversity \u2013 Manassas National Battlefield Park.\u201d\nGrasslands in Virginia, Maryland, and D.C.\nA Grassland Work Group was recently organized by the National Capital Area\u2019s Natural Resource Advisory Team (NAT)."}

{"question":"What different observations require a thorough sputum specimen collection?","doc_text":"We received acceptability questionnaires from 471\/480 study participants (98%). Overall, participants expressed a high level of acceptance of self-sampling as shown in Table 3. Most participants (92%) expressed willingness to self-collect a pharyngeal specimen at home. Given an option between clinician collection and self-collection, 54% of participants expressed no preference, whereas a few more preferred self-collection. The majority of participants agreed or strongly agreed that instructions were easy to follow (89%) and that the specimen was easy to self-collect (80%). A few participants expressed some discomfort with self collection, but the overall level of acceptability remained high (average score = 2.64). Among those who expressed difficulty or self-reported problems with specimen collection in the questionnaire, we found no significant differences in test results by method of specimen collection (data not shown).\nThis study of self-sampling for the detection of pharyngeal NG and CT infection among MSM in San Francisco showed excellent agreement22 between self-collected and clinician-collected specimens using NAATs. Among those who agreed to participate in the study, acceptability was high. Consistent with these findings, previous studies have shown self-sampling to be acceptable and feasible using various noninvasive collection methods, including self-taken vaginal,18 as well as pharyngeal and rectal swabs.21\nAmong asymptomatic MSM in the United Kingdom, Alexander et al. observed high sensitivity but a statistically significant difference in specificity of self-taken compared to nurse-taken pharyngeal specimens.21 Among patients who had a false-positive self-collected pharyngeal specimen, 90.9% (10\/11) had a concurrent NG infection at the urethra and\/or rectum. In our evaluation, we observed a lower but not inconsequential rate of coinfection at a different anatomical site: 38.5% (5\/13) of patients with self-taken NG positive, clinician-negative pharyngeal results had NG infection elsewhere. Our written instructions did not ask patients explicitly to wash their hands before collection, and as such, contamination of collection materials when handling specimens could account for our finding."}

Here's a photo of the board:\nThe next step is to add the board, kits, and parts to our on-line store so that we can begin taking orders for them. We currently have about 20 boards and the rest are expected today or tommorrow. Robin and I are planning on working to build boards all weekend so that we can ship them on Tuesday.\nI should also mention that the firmware currently does not make use of the DRAM, so there is very little buffering, and the drive can not spin down (high capacity NiMH batteries last only about 1 hour with the drive spinning continuously). It will take me some time to merge the DRAM controller with the other FGPA player hardware, but the good news is that when this is ready, anyone who has the board will be able to flash upgrade to get DRAM support. The other issue with not having DRAM is that the hard drive must be defragmented before it is put into the player.\nThere is also a larger copy of the board photo, where some of the chips are more readable.\nAug 28, 2000: Robin and I have been spending quite a bit of time preping components and getting ready to make a bunch of boards. I've made dozens of orders for parts from various distributors, and our living room is filled with boxes and parts.

The new arrangement makes it much easier for Robin to process an order.

But the one-workout-fits-all group mentality of unit PT isn't always beneficial for airmen, he said.\nThe tougher proposed standards include testing airmen twice a year - instead of once - and giving commanders the authority to boot an airman from the service for two consecutive PT test failures.

{"question":"What do recent studies say about how wearing a helmet affects reaction time and risk-taking behavior while skiing?","doc_text":"Air pollution: How it affects your eyes? Helpful tips to protect your vision!\nStudies have also linked high air pollution levels to increased occurrences of dry eye syndrome.\nZee Media Bureau\nNew Delhi: Air pollution, which is a mixture of natural and man-made substances in the air we breathe, can affect humans, plants and animals. Air pollution has been linked to a wide array of health effects. Among them are heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, both chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma.\nThe national capital, Delhi, has been witnessing high levels of air pollution for around two weeks after Diwali celebrations, putting its residents at high health risks, especially the elderly, children and people with respiratory illnesses.\nBut did you also know how air pollution impacts your eyes and vision? Polluted air can increase your risk of eye problems, ranging from simple irritation and burning to severe allergy, cataract and even cancer. The most common ones being redness, itching and burning sensation, watering eye, difficulty in vision, discharge, allergic reaction, including severe itching, eyelid swelling and risk of conjunctivitis.\nStudies have also linked high air pollution levels to increased occurrences of dry eye syndrome. Dry eye syndrome is a chronic condition in which your eyes can\u2019t produce the right amount of tears to stay wet. This lack of moisture makes your eyes feel gritty, scratchy, or itchy, or produces a burning sensation.\nWhile you can\u2019t always prevent dry eye syndrome as acquiring of this condition increases with age, there are many steps you can take to minimise your risk of infections. These include:\n- Wearing sunglasses or goggles while outdoors.\n- Avoiding vigorous eye rubbing in case of irritation.\n- Taking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated - if you don\u2019t have enough water in your body, you won't be able to produce the amount of tears you need for pain-free eyes.\n- Using lubricating eye drops given by eye specialists.\n- Not wearing contact lens and eye makeup if eyes are feeling sore.\n- Not smoking since cigarette smoke quickly dries out your eyes and cause constant eye irritation.\n- Installing a high-quality air filter at home to keep outdoor air pollutants out of your nest.\nBesides following the above guidelines, you can reduce your risk of eye infections by minimising your exposure to outdoor air pollutants and staying indoors as much as possible."}

{"question":"marine animal food chain pollution effects","doc_text":"Read through just about any pet food ingredient list\u2014whether wet or dry\u2014and you\u2019ll find corn. When corn is improperly dried or stored the mold species Aspergillus can grow and develop into the toxin Aflatoxin. Elevated levels of Aflatoxin-contaminated pet food can be deadly if consumed. Although there are ways for farmers and manufacturers to test corn for toxins, too much of it has been able to slip through the cracks, be used as ingredients in pet food distributed by major brands, and find its way into households worldwide. Iams, Marksman, River Run, and Arrow are just a few of the brands recalled because of illness or death as a result of consumed contaminated pet food products in the last decade.\nPet food contamination can also occur after the food leaves the farm. Nearly three years ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the Final Rule on the Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food. It was April of 2016 when the FDA published this new rule\u2014which was one of seven comprising the overarching Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). In response to the flurry of animal food product recalls in recent years, the FDA established this rule to curtail dangerous practices, which put the safety of animal food chain transportation at risk. These risks included improper food protection procedures, substandard vehicle cleanings between stops, and the inability to properly refrigerate food. This rule focused on overall food safety procedures instead of just emphasizing general food quality. Failure to adhere to any of these standards can also lead to illness or death of animals and costly, but preventable product recalls.\nPotential contaminants at the farm and in transit are just two of the reasons animal food chain tracing measures are critical to the safety of pets and animals everywhere. For serious animal lovers and animal food chain managers, it\u2019s not good enough to know the brand of pet foods. It\u2019s imperative to have the ability to trace an animal\u2019s lifecycle from the farm until it reaches your pet or animal\u2019s mouth. This requires a concentrated effort to gather and protect data throughout the global animal food chain to alert the appropriate parties to issues before they escalate to recall situations.\nAnimal Food Chain Traceability\nComplete animal food chain traceability is no small feat, and it\u2019s literally a life or death matter."}
