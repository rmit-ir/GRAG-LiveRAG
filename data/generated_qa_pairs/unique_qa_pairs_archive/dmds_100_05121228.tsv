1	I heard that some materials called MOFs can store a lot of stuff inside them, but they have some problems - is there a way to fix these issues?	Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have very high surface area (~7000 m2/g), well-defined pore sizes, and tailorable structure, but their electrochemical charge storage properties are poor due to low electron conductivity. This limitation can be addressed by creating intimately mixed composites of MOFs with graphene. The combination of MOFs with graphene can potentially generate materials suitable for high energy and high power density super-capacitor applications.	['Translational Graphene Research Program\nOverview of research theme in our group where we combine the synthesis of 2D materials such as graphene with fundamental studies of colloidal phases and flow behaviour to arrive at industrially-adaptable manufacturing and fabrication methods in developing efficient graphene-based platforms for clean energy, chemical separations and micro-/nano-fluidics.\nGraphene-based energy materials and devices program: Most of the research activity centers around exfoliation of graphite in liquid phase predominantly as a highly oxidized and water soluble precursor – graphene oxide (GO). Graphite is a naturally occurring mineral deposit which serves as a cheap source for these advanced materials, thus highlighting a significant value addition to this mineral resource. Graphene-based materials because of their monoatomic thickness possess massive surface area, large electrical conductivity, mechanical flexibility and can be processed easily in the fluid phase. The energy program endeavours to develop novel energy storage materials, architectures and devices in the space of super-capacitors and batteries.\nMiniaturization of energy storage devices: Microarchitecture plays a significant role in enhancing the power and energy density of super-capacitor devices. If two electrodes can be spaced very close to each other with micron-scale resolution and the dimensions of each electrode could be miniaturized, electrode kinetics will be dramatically enhanced and active electrode surface area could be much better utilized. The upshot of miniaturization is that the reduced dimensions not only have very large energy and power densities, but also can be densely packed in a given area. Graphene-oxide (GO), which is essentially an insulator, can be processed into continuous films and conductive pathways in the GO film can be imprinted by different irradiation techniques such by using laser, UV radiation and ion-beams enabling precise pattering methodologies . A significant aspect of the program will focus on the chemical reduction mechanisms, microstructure and carbon structure evolution, and how patterning approaches could be developed based on these fundamentals. The second aspect of the program will focus on measurement of electrochemical properties in wide ranging electrolytes to unearth how carbon structure, electrolytes and microarchitecture affect energy and power density . The third aspect of the program will focus on device construction, integration and proto-typing. The significance of the program is that while the microelectronic industry has made rapid progress in following the Moore’s law, is it possible that the energy storage sector can follow suit if we adapt micro-fabrication strategies in energy storage technologies?\nSkills to be acquired in this project: micro-/nano-fabrication, electrochemistry, system design for energy storage devices\nMOF/Graphene Composites: Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline, open-porous materials consisting of metal ions or metal-oxo units coordinated by electron donating organic ligands and possess very high surface area (~7000 m2/g) well defined pore sizes and tailorable structure. However, their electrochemical charge storage properties are poor because of their poor electron conductivity. The research theme will explore the synthesis of different MOFs and formation of intimately mixed composites with graphene in bulk scale quantities. This will be followed by characterization of the material and investigation of their charge transport, mass transport and electrode kinetics using a variety of electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatic polarization, and spectro-electrochemistry. Given the rich family of MOFs known today and the ability to tailor their structure during synthesis there is potential for generation of extensive fundamental data and applications to be realized for high energy and high power density super-capacitor materials .\nGraphene-based fluidic systems program – from compact micro-/nano-fluidic devices to large area filtration membranes: The fluidics program deals with fundamental aspects of fluid-phase processing of 2D materials. and applied aspect of fluid and mass transport through layered 2D structures in the form of films, granules and micro-/nano-fluidic devices.\nGraphene membrane development and application: GO has rich colloidal phase behaviour because of its large lateral dimension to thickness ratio and exhibits phase transitions from isotropic to nematic liquid crystalline phases  depending upon concentration of GO and pH. GO is also a very flexible molecule with a small persistence length and non-conservatively can be considered as a polymeric fluid. Using techniques such as orientation-mapped polarized light microscopy and rheology we determine how these materials can be processed into macroscopic structures such as films, droplets, granules or fibers by industrially-relevant manufacturing approaches . Based on fundamental understanding between processing and property we have developed scalable roll-to-roll process for the manufacture of multi-layer graphene-based membranes . Graphene based membranes have unique combinations of chemical inertness, fouling resistance, fast water transport in the liquid and vapour phase, nanoscale capillaries, tunable molecular weight cut-off with tremendous potential in nanofiltration and pervaporation that could solve separation problems for e.g. in recovery of precious metals and expensive chemicals in challenging environments and dehydration of organic-water mixtures. Given our demonstrated ability to manufacture these membranes with massive scalability, we will next focus on realizing these applications. Additionally through collaborations with simulation experts we will unravel the fundamental aspects of molecular transport through these membranes structures which has been the subject of intense research in the past few years .\nSkills to be acquired in this project: polarized light microscopic imaging, rheology, membrane fabrication, membrane transport\nEngineered Adsorbents: Emanating from our ability to process the solution-stabilized graphene sheets is our ability to easily form 3D structures such as granules by coating over an existing granular structure such as a sand grains or an adsorbent granule. We have previously demonstrated the utility of these granular structures as filtration materials in column-based filtration . Given that the coating chemistry can be tuned by the functional groups and mass transport controlled by the porosity of the assembled structures, a wide variety of pollutants could be targeted. Among them sequestration of trace organics and mercury from pollution streams will be of immediate significance. It is expected that significant industrial interest can be generated in this research program.\nSkills to be acquired in this project: Graphene chemistry, adsorptive separation technologies\nMicro-/Nano-Fluidics: Graphene-based multilayer thin films are exciting new materials for fluidic systems because these films form ensemble nano-capillaries between each individual graphene sheet of ~ 1nm regardless of the size of the graphene microplates and the size of the continuous films. These films can be positioned directly on a substrate at precise locations with dimensional control of hundreds of microns by simple masking processes, but these films contain assembled nanoscale capillaries which are permselective . The abilities to precisely place these nanocapillaries enables us to integrate nanofluidics with microfluidics, thus opening up a host of possibilities in fundamental understanding of ion-transport behaviour such as electrosmosis, electrophoresis and ion-current rectification , while empowering us to effectively use these nanoscale phenomena in chip-based separations by interfacing with microfluidics and surface functionalization chemistries.\nSkills to be acquired in this project: Microfluidics, nanofluidic transport measurement.\nReferences (published by our research group along with collaborators)\n D.

2	Are city birds bolder than country birds?	Yes, urban birds are bolder than their country counterparts. The documents show that birds in cities are becoming tamer and bolder, outcompeting their country cousins. Urban birds must be bolder than those in natural habitats, which can be seen in how they forage for food near people.	"['That humans and the cities we build affect the ecosystem and even drive some evolutionary change in species\' traits is already known. The signs are small but striking: Spiders in cities are getting bigger and salmon in rivers smaller; birds in urban areas are growing tamer and bolder, outcompeting their country cousins.\nWhat\'s new is that these evolutionary changes are happening much more quickly than previously thought, and have potential impacts on ecosystem function on a contemporary scale. Not in the distant future, that is — but now.\nA new paper by Marina Alberti of the University of Washington College of Built Environments\' Urban Ecology Research Lab published this month in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution suggests that if human-driven evolutionary change affects the functioning of ecosystems — as evidence is showing — it ""may have significant implications for ecological and human well-being.""\nAlberti, a professor of urban design and planning, said that until recently it was assumed that evolutionary change would take too long to affect ecological processes quite so immediately. Such thinking has prevented evidence from coming together ""in a way that can only emerge through a cross-disciplinary lens,"" she said, observing the interactions between humans and natural processes.\n""We now have evidence that there is rapid evolution. These changes may affect the state of the environment now. This is what\'s called eco-evolutionary feedback.\n""Cities are not simply affecting biodiversity by reducing the number and variety of species that live in urban habitats,"" Alberti said. Humans in cities are causing organisms to undergo accelerated evolutionary changes ""that have effects on ecosystem functions such as biodiversity, nutrient cycling, seed dispersal, detoxification, food production and ultimately on human health and well-being.""\nIn the paper, Alberti systematically reviews evidence of ""human signatures,"" or documented examples of human-caused trait changes in fish, birds, mammals and plants, and their effects on ecosystem function.\nIn addition to the growing spiders and shrinking salmon, she cites earthworms with increased tolerance to metals, seeds of some plants dispersing less effectively and a type of urban mouse that is a ""critical host"" for the ticks that carry Lyme disease, leading to spikes in human exposure to the illness.\nSongbirds are becoming tamer and bolder and also are changing their tunes to ensure their acoustic signals are not lost in the noisy urban background. European blackbirds are becoming sedentary and have changed their migratory behavior in response to urbanization.\nHumans in cities cause these changes through a variety of ways, Alberti said. Our urbanization alters and breaks up natural vegetation patterns, introduces toxic pollutants and novel disturbances such as noise and light and increases the temperature. Human presence also changes the availability of resources such as food and water, altering the life cycle of many species.\nAlberti said the emerging evidence prompts serious questions with implications for the focus and design of future studies:\n• Can global rapid urbanization indeed affect the course of Earth\'s evolution?\n• Is urbanization moving the world closer to an environmental tipping point on the scale of the Great Oxidation Event that introduced oxygen into the atmosphere more than 2 billion years ago?\n• Might different patterns of urbanization alter the effect of human action on eco-evolution?\nStill, Alberti said hers is not a ""catastrophic"" perspective, but one that highlights both the challenges and the unique opportunity that humans have in shaping the evolution of planet Earth.\nEcosystems in urban environments are a sort of hybrid, she said: ""It is their hybrid nature that makes them unstable, but also capable of innovating."" She explores the theme further in a book to be published in spring 2016, titled ""Cities as Hybrid Ecosystems.""\n""We can drive urbanizing ecosystems to collapse — or we can consciously steer them toward a resilient and sustainable future,"" Alberti said. ""The question is whether we become aware of the role we are playing.""\nFor more information, contact Alberti at 206-295-7985 or email@example.com.

For humans, cities are expressly designed to put roofs over heads and food within easy reach, but the opposite can be true for many urban birds. They can find food and shelter harder to come by in the concrete jungle – with some notable exceptions.\nFor any species in any habitat, survival is about problem-solving and adapting to the environment. So what street smarts do city birds need? And why do some species, such as lorikeets, crows and ravens, seem to dominate our urban landscapes?\nIn general, urban birds must be bolder than those that remain in natural habitats, as can be seen by the boldness (or “habituation”) with which some species will forage for food with people nearby. But they also need to be able to avoid or retreat from unfamiliar objects or situations if they seem dangerous.\nCity birds also need to withstand exposure to a wide range of pathogens. A study of birds in Barbados found that urban birds have enhanced immune systems relative to their country counterparts.\nWhile we have changed the environment in which some birds live, reducing resources in terms of food and shelter and increasing the number of pathogens that may impact their health, some birds have largely benefited from the new way of life.\nWinners and losers\nWithin the urban ecosystem, there are winners and losers in the bird world. The suburban landscape, for example, now provides more nectar from flowers than native vegetation due to the gardens that people have established. This is a big help to nectar-feeding parrots such as Rainbow Lorikeets.\nA recent study in Sydney found that the lorikeets benefit from the increased abundance of flowers in urban areas, and their numbers were higher in the leafy suburbs than in bushland.\nBut if urban areas are such a rich source of nectar, why are some nectar-feeding species declining?\nThis is partly because widespread clearance of woodland habitat has led to the increase of the aggressive Noisy Miner and Red Wattlebird. These species find it easy to “bully” other birds in open habitats. Noisy Miners have been observed pulling apart Regent Honeyeaters’ nests as they were being built.\nRegent Honeyeaters, in contrast, are less adaptable to changed landscapes, because they are migratory and rely on detailed knowledge of existing food sources. If these resources are changed or removed, they may not have enough interconnected patches of habitat to move safely towards new resources – potentially leaving them vulnerable to cats, foxes and aggression from other birds.\nHabitat loss can threaten some bird species or even leave them at risk of dying out if they do not locate alternative resources. The ability to find new food sources therefore becomes a valuable survival skill.\nWhat’s more useful: flexibility or intelligence?\nFor some bird species, flexibility in finding food is crucial in making a successful switch to urban environments. One example is the Grey-crowned Babbler, which is endangered in Victoria, but my colleagues and I have documented it living in a suburban area in Dubbo, New South Wales.\nThis species usually nests in coniferous woodland and forages in the leaf litter beneath the trees. But in Dubbo, we saw these birds feeding on lawns, in playgrounds and even in leaf litter along a train track at the back of urban housing, sometimes visiting backyards along the way. This suggests that these birds can survive the loss of their woodland habitat by being sufficiently adaptable to life in the suburbs – as long as they can continue to find enough food, disperse between nearby groups and have access to native nesting trees.\nFor other species, such as crows and ravens, intelligence seems to be the key. These species can survive anywhere in the urban sprawl, including places where trees are scarce but rubbish bins are everywhere. Crows and ravens can literally pull food out of a bin and eat it – clearly a learned behaviour that has resulted from problem-solving.\nThese birds are highly opportunistic and social, allowing them to learn new ways of adapting to the almost complete removal of their natural environment.\nSurvive and thrive\nWhat we can deduce from these examples is that some birds, like Rainbow Lorikeets and Grey-crowned Babblers, can adapt successfully to the urban sprawl as long as some characteristics of their habitat still remain. Other species, such as crows, have gone a step further and worked out how to survive purely on urban resources – effectively making a living in an environment that is completely unnatural to them.\nThis suggests that the more we urbanise an area without natural aspects, the less bird diversity we will have – and the more our urban areas will come to be dominated by those few species that are hardy, clever or adaptable enough to thrive.\nLuckily, some councils in Australia and cities throughout the world are bringing the natural aspects of the forest back into the concrete jungle, so that a wider range of birds might survive here. More research is needed to work out exactly what each species will need, but planting more native plants is always a good start.']"	['<urn:uuid:40f95d59-1366-49be-870a-6d3cd0ad685b>', '<urn:uuid:d9712271-c6cd-40bd-a3fa-00d2269328d9>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	7	47	1882
3	indigenous agriculture practices tamil nadu coastal	A study conducted across 12 coastal districts of Tamil Nadu, involving 240 coastal farmers, documented 149 indigenous technical knowledge items related to coastal farming systems. This research emerged from the need to find eco-friendly, cheap, and sustainable production alternatives, as recent years have shown a plateauing of yields despite the success of the 1960s green revolution. Indigenous knowledge, developed through traditional wisdom, was identified as a promising alternative to address these challenges.	"[""India is a global player in coal mining, in order tosustain, it requires developing a Green miningtechnology. All mining operations in India involve continuous use of explosives, thereby generatinghigh noise level, vibration and shock and very highlevel of dust pollution. Today all-overs world minesare facing one of the major problems of dustpollutions which not only affects the health of theminers but also makes the condition quite explosivewhen the mine is degree-II or Degree-III in gassiness,The same concern has also been shown by The President of India in his Inaugural Address at the “19th World Mining Congress & Expo 2003, in New Delhi, India”. According to the Pocket Book of Labour Statistics 2006, Ministry of Labour, Government of India it has been found that number of industrial injuries in coal mines are much more than the total injuries of other mines. It is also observed that the fatalities rate is much higher in underground mines than that of open cast mines. Out of the many factors one of the major causes of the accident is the fire. This book deals with the feasibility study and development of waterjet cutting technology for Indian coal mines.\nIndian banking system has well developed organization in the country. Entrepreneurs and creative thinker were established the most of the banks in India. In the pre –independence era, they provided financial support to the farmers, business community, traders and industrialists in India. At present, largest commercial bank in the country is State Bank of India. . Banking sector in India has seen lots of positive developments in the last decade. The policy makers in India have made lot of efforts to improve the regulation in the banking sector. The banking sector evaluates positive results in growth, profitability, non- performing assets, credit risk and funds management. In this scenario, some of the banks have recognized innovation and growth aspects. Banking industry in India has to strengthen them to support to the Indian economy.\nThe book caters to educators and students of economics in broad and to energy economics in specific. Those interested in understanding the role of energy chain must read this work for assessing the future of natural gas in developing nations like India. Natural gas being relatively clean form of energy never got its due in the developing economies energy literature. The fuel plays a vital role in this transitional era from coal-oil to green energy.\nAn agro-climatic study was conducted to assess the vulnerability of winter rice (boro) production in Bangladesh to potential climate change. Effect of climate change on yield of two varieties of boro rice has been assessed using the DSSAT (v4) modeling system. The yield of BR3 and BR14 boro varieties for the years 2008, 2030, 2050 and 2070 have been simulated for 12 locations of Bangladesh, which were selected from among the major rice growing areas in different regions of Bangladesh. Available data on soil and hydrologic characteristics of these locations, and typical crop management practice for boro rice were used in the simulations. The weather data required for the model (daily maximum and minimum temperatures, daily solar radiation and daily precipitation) were generated for the selected years and for the selected locations using the regional climate model PRECIS. The model predicted significant reduction in yield of both varieties of boro rice due to climate change; yield reductions of over 20% and 50% have been predicted for both rice varieties for the years 2050 and 2070, respectively.\nThe poor quality groundwater may prove a valuable natural resource in arid and semi-arid regions, if used with suitable technologies. This book provides an ample technique and up-to-date references about the response of wheat to organic and inorganic soil amendments under irrigation with high residual sodium carbonate water. This book will be useful to the students and researchers of crop production and environmental sciences as well as to the natural resource planners and managers, especially of developing nations.\nSocial ecology is basically a manifestation of social system funtion comprising of structural characteristics and functional disposition. Tea gardens in India are representing unique social-ecologial behaviour and it has been more conspicuous with the advent of global warming and climate change. This unique social ecology has been a subject to withdrawl of biodiversity, erosion of physical natural bases and relentless anthropogenic activities. The book is a rare academic cultivation in the area of ecological networking by statistically designing the spill and grid effect of intra and inter ecological performances.It is unique to observe that with the change in rainfall pattern, as perceived by different tea garden stakeholders,the pattern of livelihood generation and other economic activities pertaining to this social ecology have been affected.The general social science researches are mainly confined to analysing and estimating socio-economic variables and,on contrary,this book retains a well readable research document on combined effect of socio-economic interaction with the bio-physical counterpart of the same ecological setup.Thus the book is a great creation in Social Ecology.\nOur nature is provided with lot of natural sources which is beneficial to the human kind. Protecting these natural sources is very much important and is also necessary to pass for the next generations.The book covers 147 plant species which are available freely in the surroundings. In the System(s) of medicine, these medicinal plants apart from Ayurveda can be also used in Folk, Siddha, Homeopathy and Unani, as a natural and permanent cure against human diseases. Much research has to be conducted in future such as Isolation of compounds, Medicinal chemistry, Biodiversity, PhytoInformatics, PalynoInformatics, antimicrobial studies, Tissue culture, Design of Markers, DNA fingerprinting, Metabolic studies, Genetics, Genomic and Proteomic studies, Phylogenetic analysis, Formulation of media, Food Science and Technology, Bionanotechnology, Biodiesel and Biofuels, Biofouling, Bioremediation, Biopesticides, Data mining, Quality and resistant food products, etc. These technologies should focus on developing human health and living habits of other living species that can be transformed to the future generations.\nAn Early Neolithic Village in the Jordan Valley Part II, the Fauna of Netiv Hagdud\nAmong the various practices, judicious use of manures and fertilizers as one of the important strategies for increasing production of rice per unit area. The integrated use of organic manures with inorganic fertilizers can help to maintain optimum crop yield and required soil nutrient pool on sustained basis. The contribution of organic manure is to be judged not only in terms of nutrient contribution, but also by their role in building up of nutrient reserves in soil and increasing organic matter level of soil which ultimately improves physical, chemical and biological properties of soil and it is most critical in the context of sustainable agriculture. General acceptance of organic farming is not only due to greater demand for pollution free food but also due to natural advantage of organic farming in supporting the sustainability in agriculture. The essence of practicing organic farming lies in the use of naturally available resources like organic wastes, predators, parasites in conjunction with natural processes like decomposition, biological fixation and resistance to achieve the needs of crop production.\nSix different agro-industrial waste residues (rice straw, rice bran, corn flakes, wheat bran, wheat flakes, and grinded wheat kernel) were procured from the local market. These substrates (10 g) were moistened (1:1) with different moistening agents (distilled water, tap water, mineral salts solution (FeSO4.7H2O 0.02, MgSO4.7H2O 1.0, (NH4)2SO4 4.0, KH2PO4 0.6, K2HPO4 1.4 mg/gds at pH 5), 0.1 N HCl, sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5) and screened for the production of 1,4-?- D-glucan glucohydrolase for 96 hours in static cultures. The substrate and moistening agent that gave maximum enzyme production were selected and their fermentation conditions were further optimized. The levels of selected solid substrate, moistening agent and fermentation conditions such as pH, temperature, time of incubation, inoculum size etc. were optimized by one variable at a time method. Aspergillus oryzae IIB-6 was found to be a good producer of 1,4-?-D-glucan glucohydrolase in wheat bran medium containing mineral salts as an additional trace elements so that it can be used for biotechnological purposes.\nThe Diversity and Distribution of Amphibian fauna in the Albertine Rift in the great lakes region of Africa is Dr. Behangana's attempt to put amphibian diversity on the map. It gives detailed account of amphibian distribution, abundance, endemism and richness in 15 forests for 73 out of 119 species documented in 26 sites of the Albertine Rift for which data has been compiled so far. Some aspects of amphibian ecology such as physical and biotic factors affecting amphibian distribution, habitat requirements and acoustics are also analysed. This book was written to give baseline information to herpetologists and other researchers intending do further research on amphibian fauna of the AR, for managers and other conservationists interested in knowing the current status of amphibians in the Albertine Rift.\nThe success of green revolution of 1960’s had resulted in India achieving self- sufficiency in food production system. Use of high yielding varieties, high analysis fertilizers, soil and water management practices had resulted in achievement of improved production and productivity. However, recent years had sow “plateauing of yield” in the agricultural production scenario. So with a raising population and fastly depleting natural resources, policy planners think of alternative production system which are eco-friendly, cheap, sustainable with improved productivity gains. Indigenous knowledge being evolved as age old treasures with a rich traditional wisdom remains as a best alternative. Keeping this in view a study was conducted to document the indigenous technical knowledge in coastal farming system of Tamil Nadu. The research was conducted in 12 coastal districts of Tamil Nadu. About 240 coastal farmers was selected using random sampling method. Pre-tested interview schedule was used for the data collection process. About 149 indigenous items of coastal areas were collected and rationalised.\nLeaf rust (Puccinia triticina Eriks and Henn.) is one of the most important diseases of wheat in Tigray region. Regular surveying,race analysis and searching resistant genes plays significant role to develop resistant varieties against leaf rust. Hence, this study was carried out to determine the distribution and intensity leaf rust, identify physiologic races and evaluate the reaction of commonly growing wheat varieties to virulent races of leaf rust. During the survey,108 farmers’ wheat fields and experimental plots were assessed in five districts of Southeastern Tigray, of which 95 (88%) of the fields were affected with leaf rust. The overall mean incidence and severity of the disease were 48.4 and 18.2%, respectively. According to the North American system of nomenclature for P.triticina, characterization of 40 mono pustules resulted in the identification of 22 races. The broadest virulence spectrum was recorded from TKTT race, making all Lr genes except Lr9 ineffective. The variety evaluation revealed that, Mekelle-3, Mekelle-4, Picaflor, Dashin and local showed susceptible reaction to TKTT, THTT and PHTT races.\nCredit is the lifeblood of modern economic system, in absence of which no system can survive. It acts as lubricating oil to swiftly move the wheels of economic development. In economic development of India, agriculture still forms the base, which is not away from the need of credit. Farmers need much more capital than they can afford to save. A number of policies have been made to infuse social responsibility in the formal financial institutions to extend credit to rural areas, and succeeded in establishing a vast network of financial institutions. But, quantitative progress at the cost of quality, high cost structure of operations in rural areas and mounting overdues became a threat to the viability of the financial institutions. Consequently, the policy of competitive financial system was adopted from 1991 onwards in the provision of agricultural credit to improve the viability of financial agencies which have positive as well as negative influences on the credit flow to agriculture. In this book an attempt has been made to examine the agricultural credit during pre and post-banking reforms in India.""]"	['<urn:uuid:9c712e32-7e7f-440d-a928-59bfbe16a990>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	6	72	1970
4	differences between walrus social structure and modern agricultural management compare natural vs scientific approaches	Walruses exhibit a highly hierarchical natural social structure, with segregated male and female groups outside breeding season, where dominance is determined by size and tusk length. During breeding, they follow natural patterns with males competing for territory and females choosing mates. In contrast, modern agriculture has evolved beyond purely natural approaches. While organic farming adheres to pre-scientific, natural-only principles from the early 20th century, contemporary conventional agriculture incorporates scientific innovations like precision farming, optimized fertilization, and environmentally beneficial practices based on toxicology and environmental studies. This science-based approach has demonstrated better environmental progress than strictly natural organic methods.	"['For an animal of such size, the walrus feeds on organisms that are relatively low in the food chain, preferring the small invertebrates that inhabit the ocean floor to the highly mobile fish and crustaceans taken by most other pinnipeds (2). By far the greatest proportion of its diet is comprised of bivalve molluscs such as clams, cockles, and mussels, but it will also take various shrimps, crabs, worms, octopuses, sea cucumbers, slow moving fish and, very rarely, seals (1) (2) (5) (7). In order for such a large, bulky animal to sustain itself on a diet dominated by relatively small organisms, it needs to be a highly efficient forager (2). Diving to depths of up to 180 metres for up to 24 minutes at a time, it uses its highly sensitive whiskers and snout to locate food, which it then excavates using the tough edges of its nose, and by squirting jets of water from its mouth (2) (5) (7), and creating water flow with its foreflippers (6).\nMale and female walruses typically spend little time together outside of the breeding season, but being a highly gregarious species, both sexes haul out on land or ice in large numbers. In these largely sexually segregated herds, the animals lie in close physical contact, sometimes piled on top of each other (2) (8). Walrus society is extremely hierarchical, with the largest individual, with the largest tusks, commanding the best positions at the haul out sites. Usually the dominant walrus can displace subordinates with the minimal of posturing, but similar sized/tusked adults may put up a fight, in which case a stabbing duel may ensue, until one aggressor accepts defeat and retreats to less coveted territory (2) (7). Although these fights do take place between both sexes, the most violent encounters occur between bulls during the breeding season (4) (7).\nIn the harsh winter, males and females congregate for the mating season, between January and April (2) (4) (7). Whilst the females haul out on ice floes, the males compete for nearby aquatic territory through a combination of vocalisation, physical displays, and, if necessary, intense fighting (1) (4). The female chooses a mate from the competing males and usually copulates in the water, with the most dominant bulls siring offspring with multiple females (2) (4). After a gestation period that lasts 15 months, including a four to five month period of delayed implantation, the female gives birth to a single calf. The calf is able to swim immediately but is typically only weaned during its second year, and usually remains within the extremely protective care of its mother for several years (2) (5). While most females become sexually mature at 7 years of age, and give birth for the first time at around the age of nine years, most males only become sufficiently physically and socially mature to mate at around 15 years, despite reaching sexual maturity between 7 and 10 years (2) (7).\nThe seasonal movements of the walrus, and in particular of the females, calves and most of the juveniles in the Pacific, are typically governed by the movements of the pack ice. However, in the summer in the Atlantic, walruses of all sexes and ages commonly haul out on land relatively far from the pack ice (1) (4).', 'The guiding principal of organic is to rely exclusively on natural inputs. That was decided early in the 20th century, decades before before the scientific disciplines of toxicology, environmental studies and climate science emerged to inform our understanding of how farming practices impact the environment.\nAs both farming and science have progressed, there are now several cutting edge agricultural practices which are good for the environment, but difficult or impossible for organic farmers to implement within the constraints of their pre-scientific rules.\nThere was one window during which the rules for organic might have been adjusted to reflect a more modern understanding. In 1990 the US Congress charged the USDA with the task of setting a national standard for what products could be legally sold as Organic. That agency was inclined to include more science in a definition of “what is safest for us and for the environment,” but the organic community of that day was adamant that the rule should only reflect the purely natural definition embraced by their existing customer base. Long before the final Organic Standards were published in 2002, it was clear that the industry preference had prevailed and that the rules of organic would still reflect their pre-scientific origins. That is why the following six environmental issues exist for organic farming.\n1. Less Than Optimal Fungicides\nOrganic farmers use pesticides, but only those qualified as sufficiently natural. Thus, copper-based fungicides are among the few options available to an organic grower for the control of fungal plant diseases. These are high-use rate products that require frequent re-application and which are quite toxic to aquatic invertebrates. There are much more effective, and far less toxic, synthetic fungicide options without environmental issues, and which, unlike copper, break down into completely innocuous materials. Organic growers can\'t use those fungicides. Similarly there are many environmentally benign, synthetic insecticides and herbicides which cannot be used.\n2. A Surprisingly High Carbon Footprint for Compost\nThe greatest original contribution of the early organic movement was its focus on building soil health. One of the main ways that organic farmers do this is by physically incorporating tons of organic matter into the soil in the form of composts. Unfortunately, during the process of composting a substantial amount of methane is emitted which means that broad use of this soil-building approach would be problematic from a climate change point of view.\n3. Practical Barriers to Implementing No-till Farming\nThe best approach to building soil quality is minimizing soil disturbance (e.g. no plowing or tilling) combined with the use of cover crops. Such farming systems have multiple environmental advantages, particularly with respect to limiting erosion and nutrient movement into water. Organic growers frequently do plant cover crops, but without effective herbicides, they tend to rely on tillage for weed control. There are efforts underway to find a way to do organic no-till, but they are not really scalable.\n4. Difficulties Implementing Optimized Fertilization\nFertilizers are associated with many of the biggest environmental issues for agriculture because of the challenges in supplying all a crop needs without leading to movement of those nutrients into surface or ground water or to emissions of the highly potent greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide. The best practice is to “spoon feed” the nutrients through the irrigation system at levels designed to closely track the changing demands of the crop throughout the season.\nDrip Irrigated and Fertilized Grapes\nThis requires water-soluble forms of the nutrients and that is very expensive to do for the natural fertilizer sources allowed in organic. Since the plants absorb those nutrients in exactly the same molecular forms regardless of source, this cost barrier is a non-scientific impediment to doing the best thing from an environmental point of view. Organic fertilizers like composts or manures are also much less practical for variable rate application, an environmentally beneficial option for rain-fed crops in which different amounts of fertilizer are applied to different parts of the field based on geo-referenced soil and yield mapping data. Finally, the organic avoidance of ""synthetic fertilizers"" would mean that these growers would not be able to use what appear to be promising small-scale, carbon-neutral, renewable energy-driven systems for making nitrogen fertilizers.\n5. Lower Land-Use-Efficiency\nThe per-acre yields of organic crops are significantly lower than those for conventional. This has been well documented both by meta-analysis of published research comparisons and by public data generated through USDA commercial production surveys.\nThe shortfall is driven by limited pesticide options, difficulties in meeting peak fertilizer demand, and in some cases by not being able to use biotech traits. If organic production were used for a significant proportion of crop production, these lower yields would increase the pressure for new land-use-conversion - a serious environmental issue because of the biodiversity and greenhouse gas ramifications.\n6. Lack of an Economic Model to Move Beyond Niche Status\nFinally, agriculture needs to change in ways that accomplish both productivity and environmental goals. That optimal farming approach must become the dominant system over time. Even if organic had maintained its growth trend from 1995 to 2008, organic acreage in 2050 would still have represented less than 3% of US cropland.\n|Trend line for US organic cropland as of of 2008|\nThen, between 2008 and 2011, USDA survey data showed no net gain in US organic acreage. Environmentally desirable ""conventional"" practices like no-till, cover cropping and a variety of other precision agriculture innovations are already practiced on a much broader scale and have the potential to be economically attractive for farmers without any price premium mechanisms. Innovations in farmland leases could greatly accelerate the conversion process if growers could be guaranteed long-term control of fields so that they could profit from their investments in building soil quality.\nConsumers Who Want To Do The Right Thing\nThere are many consumers who are willing to spend more for organic food because they believe that they are making a positive difference for the environment. While it is commendable that people are willing to do that, the pre-scientific basis for the organic rules means that the environmental superiority of organic cannot be assumed. While “only natural” is appealing as a marketing message, it is not the best guide for how to farm with minimal environmental impact. Between rigorous, science-based regulation, public and private investments in new technology development, and farmer innovation, modern agriculture has been making excellent environmental progress. That trend, not organic, is what we need to encourage.\nYou are encouraged to comment here and/or to email me at email@example.com\nPennsylvania farm image from USDA Images. Vineyard image Agne27.

5	looking for safe student exchange parents want know support system overseas	Rotary Youth Exchange has an international network of qualified volunteers who prioritize student safety and well-being. In each local community, students are connected with a trained Youth Exchange Officer and committee. The program requires rigorous certification every five years and maintains strict student protection policies. Students receive support from their local Rotary Club, have access to private Facebook pages for communication, and can contact District staff for assistance throughout their exchange. Host families provide housing and often include students in travel and recreational activities.	['You and your son or daughter are considering an incredible experience that will expand not only your student’s cultural horizon, but your’s as well. We commend you for taking this step in advancing both their educational experience and their world-view.\nAs you review the information on our website, in addition to the wealth of information you’ll get when you attend our orientations, you’ll come to realize that the volunteers who participate in the Rotary Youth Exchange program both here and abroad are working tirelessly to keep your student safe and secure.\nWhat to Expect\nWhile each and every year abroad is different, your student will be completely immersed in their host country’s culture. He or she will live with one or several host families, attend high school, and make deep international friendships. Our experience is that students return home after their year abroad with a maturity, love and appreciation for not only those who supported them here in the USA, but also for those they leave behind.\nWhy a Study Abroad Experience Shouldn’t Wait for College\nWe hear this a lot … why should I send my high school student on a study abroad when they can go on a semester abroad while they’re in college?\nThe Rotary Youth Exchange study abroad program is a true immersion program, during which your child will become fluent (or very close) in a foreign language and become bi-cultural from having lived in homes and attended school in their host country. While college study abroad programs are also an important part of their education, you may find that it’s more expensive and structured than the high school Rotary program. Many college study abroad programs house their students together and offer excellent tours, but the Rotary Youth Exchange program offers your child the opportunity to live and thrive in their host country on an individualized level that the collegiate programs can’t match. Rotary Youth Exchange really is the difference between actually being and living in a foreign culture and country, and simply visiting it as a tourist.\nRead this article from the May 17, 2017 online Education page of Forbes magazine, written by a 17 year old Italian girl who lived and studied for year in the U.S.A. while in high school:\nMore on Who We Are\nDistrict 6220 has a long history of participation in the Rotary Youth Exchange study abroad program, and has been an integral part of the Central States multi-district since the early 1970s. District 6220 hosted and sent our first students in 1972-73, and in the years since then we are proud to have hosted nearly 900 students from throughout the world, and at the same time we’ve prepared and sent nearly 900 of our local students to Brazil, Russia, Japan, France, Turkey, Thailand, Estonia, Peru, Spain, Bolivia, Croatia, and … well, you get the picture. For a look at the countries we currently exchange with, go here.\nLike all of Rotary International’s programs, we use an all-volunteer staff of dedicated Rotarians all around the world, while we in District 6220 also follow strict U.S. Dept. of State guidelines for training and in the administration of the study abroad program. District 6220 is one of 18 Districts in the Central States Rotary Youth Exchange program, which encompasses an area including Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, Indiana, Illinois, and Ontario.\nDistrict 6220 is the recipient of the coveted “Gold Award” for its program administration from the North American Youth Exchange Network.\nYour Support Network\nThe Rotary Youth Exchange program is administered through a well-developed international network of qualified and knowledgable volunteers, all of whom meet the rigid qualifications of both Rotary International and their individual country. Our absolute Number One priority is the safety and well-being of your student while he or she is involved in the study abroad program.\nIn the USA, your local community Rotary Club is your first point of contact, and your family will be connected with a trained Youth Exchange Officer and, depending on the size of your local club, a youth exchange committee. This format will be a mirror image of what your student can expect in their assigned foreign country.\nOnce you sign up, we have private Facebook pages for students and for parents, for you to celebrate success, ask questions, and express concerns. You will also have free access to our District staff for assistance throughout the process.\nRotary International and the Rotary Youth Exchange program worldwide consider the safety of our students as a top priority, and all Rotary Clubs and Districts participating in Youth Exchange throughout the world must undergo a rigorous certification process every five years. Included in that process is verification and updates to each District’s Student Protection Policy. To see more details on this very important aspect of Rotary Youth Exchange, please go here.\nOutbound Parent Financial Obligation\nThe District 6220 Rotary Youth Exchange program will cost $6,500, as detailed in the Parent Contract. In brief, this payment will cover the expenses involved in getting your child to their host country. Once in-country, your student will receive — at no cost to you — their room and board with host families, schooling (often at private schools), and a monthly allowance (about $100 USD). Host families will often provide travel and recreational opportunities at no cost. Optional in-country or multi-country tours or excursions will be offered at an additional cost. In addition, an emergency fund of about $500 USD will be required, which will be returned to your student upon completion of their exchange year.\nYour contract fee includes the following:\n- Round trip airfare and visa to any country in the world to which your son or daughter is assigned\n- A $1 million health and accident insurance policy, as well as in-country insurance if required\n- Attendance for the student and parent(s) at our two District orientations in October and February (hotel, meals, programming)\n- Attendance for your son or daughter at the Central States Rotary Youth Exchange Summer Conference in Grand Rapids, Michigan in July, including charter bus transportation. (Parent attendance is optional)\n- Rotary blazer, assigned reading material, and other goodies\n- Language camps (if required by your host country)\nWhile your family insurance will remain in force during your student’s year abroad, we’re also providing you with a first-class health and accident insurance policy provided through Central States Rotary Youth Exchange.

6	What are the essential techniques for maintaining proper wrist position and finger movement when playing bowed string instruments like violin and cello?	For proper technique, players should keep the wrist aligned with the forearm without excessive bending in either direction. The left hand should maintain rounded fingers with spaces between them (like a 'milkshake hand' for cellists), and finger pressing power should come from the base of the knuckles. The thumb and second finger should work as 'travel buddies,' with the thumb positioned behind the middle finger on the neck. Players should also keep their elbow up (like a 'chicken wing') to maintain proper hand position, though they should rest when needed to avoid fatigue.	['The beginning of the school year is a time full of many new things: new teachers, classes, friends, and even schools. For music students, it can also be a time of dusting off the instrument, or learning new skills for the first time. Here are some basic tips for setting up new cellists and bassists for success and for refreshing the skills of returning students.\nStarting First-Year Students Right\nBe a Tree\nWithout guidance, many cello and bass students will revert to a slouched posture with casual, crossed feet. Not only does it look unprofessional to sit or stand in such a manner, it also affects the quality of playing. I share with students that they are like strong trees when they are playing their cello or bass: their feet are roots that are spread out and firmly planted in the ground in front of them; their legs and torso are the straight, tall trunk; and their arms are branches.\nCellists should sit on the edge of their chair with their feet placed far apart enough that the corner edges of the lower bout of the cello touch the insides of their legs. Bassists should stand tall and rest the bass on their body so that it can lean on them without falling.\nI have found the videos and writing from Discover Double Bass to be useful when talking about bass setup.\nOnce students have the posture down, it is time to move onto the left hand! The “milkshake hand” is a term I heard from a fellow cello teacher. When students sit behind the cello or bass, have them hold up their left hand is if they are holding a milkshake, soda can, or glass of water (I often ask my student his or her favorite drink and use that as my example). Students should have rounded fingers, including the thumb, and they should have spaces in between each finger. Explain that when playing, this milkshake hand remains that way when placed on their instrument.\nHave the student place his or her hand with rounded, tall fingers on the fingerboard, with their thumb behind the second finger (the middle finger) on the back of the neck. This relationship between second finger and thumb is very important- I tell my students that thumb and second finger are travel buddies– they go everywhere together.\nMake up a game where students make their milkshake hand, put it on the bass or cello, check it, and take it away to do it again. Students may want to play with flat fingers when pressing into the string, so remind them to keep their rounded milkshake shape while using gravity to push into the string with their finger tips.\nThe String Pedagogy Notebook has some great content on the cello left hand.\nOne way a player can keep their tall fingers while playing with their left hand is by keeping their elbow up. I refer to this concept as the “chicken wing” with my students. I ask them to imagine a chicken trying to lift its wings to get airborne. The natural tendency will be to have low elbows (especially in the left arm) when playing the cello or bass, so remind students to keep their chicken wing up. A good way to check is to have students lay their bow across their left hand and arm. If the bow lays flat and touches every part of the hand and arm, the elbow is high enough. If the elbow is too high or low, the bow will not lay flat on every part of the hand and arm. It will take endurance and muscle to keep that elbow up, so allow students to rest their arms when needed.\nThe Flop Bow Hold\nIt may not feel like it when first starting out, but in my opinion, playing the cello and bass uses many natural motions. Emphasize to students that playing their instrument is much like being a ballet dancer- every movement should be relaxed and graceful, using only the muscles necessary.\nAfter having students play pizzicato for a while, it will come time to introduce the bow. The first thing I have students do is “flop” out their hand, which is just a slight shake in front of them. When their hand has stilled and their palm is facing down and their wrist is bent, I show students that their hand tends to naturally have spaces in between the fingers with a slight bend to them. By placing the bow under those bottom knuckles of the hand and bringing the thumb to where the stick meets the frog, you can show students how simple the bow hold is.\nThe trick, though, is maintaining that hold. Students need to feel the stick under the their fingers and push into the bow with the weight of their arm while keeping tall, long fingers. Allow students to practice setting their bow holds up by themselves and playing open strings.\nThe key is to keep them repeating this practice and being aware of when they need to readjust their grip so their muscles remember it correctly.\nHelp More Advanced Students Brush Off the Rust\nEmbrace the Stretches\nEven though playing the bass and cello can feel natural once someone gets the hang of it, it will still feel completely foreign when picking it back up after a long summer. It is always important to approach the instrument with relaxed and warmed up muscles, so stretches become a very important habit for any string player. Have students do shoulder rolls, both with their arms at their side and moving in circles above their head, finger flexes, and any other stretches that will help them get those muscles ready to go. Students should do these stretches before playing and after, if possible.\nFor more examples of stretches, check out this resource from the MusicNotes blog.\nOpen Strings Are Our Friend\nBefore jumping into trying to master the next solo piece or methods book exercise, students should focus on re-learning how to find a beautiful sound with their instrument. Have your cellists and bassists practice the bow hold they learned when they began and play long, open strings. The focus should be on practicing good bow technique while creating a nice, core tone on the instrument with a relaxed opening and closing of the bow arm. The key is to concentrate on using the weight of the shoulder blade to create the sound with the bow, allowing that weight to transfer down the arm and sink into the string- all while keeping an elbow that is higher than the wrist. This way of thinking will avoid unpleasant sounds and injuries related to squeezing the bow into the string in attempts of making a big sound.\nPractice Those Scales\nOnce students have warmed up to their tone, incorporate the left hand by playing a scale, starting off slowly and progressing to playing it faster. The student should choose one scale key to work on each day or week and start by playing whole notes (the quarter note equaling 100-120 is usually what my students do), then half notes, then quarter notes- playing one whole note per bow, then two half notes per bow, and four quarter notes. This allows the cellist or bassist to focus on intonation and coordination between the two hands. Students are encouraged to redo the scale at any point, listening for accuracy.\nIt is not always easy to have students that are at different playing levels in the same ensemble. This is the perfect time, though, to build in peer mentorship. Allow the more advanced students to become teachers to their less experienced peers. As long as those students have a solid foundation for their own technique, they can be a great resource to cello and bass players who are just starting out.\nAfter graduating from DePaul University with a Bachelor of Cello Performance, Ruth Hogle moved to Juneau, Alaska, to earn a Master of Arts in Teaching Music, K-12 degree while working with JAMM (Juneau, Alaska Music Matters), an El Sistema-inspired program.\nRuth recently completed her student teaching at an elementary and high school in Juneau, where she taught general music and Spanish, and conducted her own orchestras.\nShe will be teaching beginning string orchestra to sixth graders in Anchorage, Alaska this coming school year. She is a strong believer in the power of music, which she has witnessed as a teacher in Chicago, Peru, and Alaska.', 'Violin Tutorials – How to Use Your Left Arm and Hand\nWhen learning violin tutorials and lessons on how to use your left arm and hand, you’ll soon discover that there are many important aspects to be performed with the left arm. Your left arm is responsible for pressing down on the fingerboard as well as holding the actual violin itself and this page will show you violin tutorials on how to correctly hold the violin.\nWhen learning violin tutorials, one of the first examples for beginners to consider is how they position the left thumb when holding the violin. You should not be holding the violin with your thumb. The best way to use your left hand thumb is to use it for maintaining a nice balance for when pressure is exerted downwards from your other four fingers on the fingerboard when fingering.\nAs you are holding the violin, ensure that you keep your left wrist aligned with the rest of your forearm. Also, it’s best that you don’t bend the wrist much. When the wrist is bent too much towards you, this can result in the violin or fiddle slipping out too far into the palm of your hand. When the violin is in the palm of your hand, your fingers will become tenser when fingering and exerting downward pressure to each violin string.\nSimilarly, when you bend your wrist in the opposite direction (away from you), you will find it harder to apply the right amount of pressure needed for pressing down on the strings of the fingerboard. Likewise, your fingers will again become tense and they will not manoeuvre as smoothly as they should when pressing down on a string to play tunes.\nTo overcome the mistake of bending your wrist when learning from violin tutorials and lessons, it’s best to imagine that the point from your knuckles all the way up to your elbow, move and flow together as one.\nAs you begin playing the violin and learning from violin tutorials, make sure you keep enough of your attention on your left hand and arm. It is very common that people become distracted by their right arm because the right arm is doing a lot of moving back and forth.\nThis can then result in the left arm being slightly neglected, meaning that it can become stiff and rigid, thereby affecting how you manoeuvre your left fingers and how you play notes on the instrument.\nMany beginner violin tutorials highlight the unhelpful effects that can come from the left elbow and shoulder being rigid. If there is not enough freeness and flexibility in these two body parts, the performance will be affected. Having a rigid left shoulder and elbow can also sometimes result in the other parts of your body (such as the right arm, stance and posture), counteracting the bad usage of your left arm.\nFor correct fingering and use of your fingers on the fingerboard, allow the finger pressing power to come from the base of your knuckles. Imagine that your fingers are the pistons of a machine or engine thumping down on the strings, but with a certain amount of finesse, control and a comfortable sense of ease.\nCheck out the video above to see violin tutorials and tips on how to hold the bow.']	['<urn:uuid:e6b7973c-b8a0-4f2f-ab95-ea47083c00db>', '<urn:uuid:7e6add58-5100-4691-8fe6-eb5893057f18>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	22	93	1972
7	How do marijuana grows damage forest environments?	Marijuana grows cause significant environmental damage in multiple ways. Growers pump water from natural streams, which are often scarce in remote areas. They strip sensitive land, stack brush (creating wildfire risks), and leave trash. The rodenticides used on plants contaminate the water table, and water diversion from wells, ranches, or streams causes ecological problems. According to the DEA, each acre of marijuana grown affects 10 surrounding acres and costs about $20,000 to restore to pristine forest conditions.	['Researchers have found that commercial anti-rodent chemicals present in illegal pot farms are poisoning and killing animals. Among the affected are fishers (animals similar to weasels), which are candidates for the Endangered Species List. Their carcasses have been found near Redwood National Park and Yosemite National Park; 79 percent of them were infected with rodenticides.\nPot farmers use those chemicals to protect their illicit crops, many of which are grown on public lands near the aforementioned parks. The hidden farms overlap with animal habitat, including that of fishers, who pay the price, along with other wildlife including martens, spotted owls, and red foxes.\nThe study was conducted by researchers from the nonprofit Ecology Research Center, UC Davis, UC Berkeley, the U.S. Forest Service, the Wildlife Conservation Study, and several other groups. It was funded by the California Department of Fish and Game.\nScientists believe the animals ingest the rodenticides by proxy when eating smaller prey. It’s also possible they consume the chemical directly, as many used by pot farmers include “flavorizers” added by manufacturers, such as bacon or cheese.\nNinety-six percent of the exposed fishers analyzed by researchers were tainted with brodifacoum, a harmful second-generation rodenticide, which can be lethal after just one ingestion. It can take several days before clinical signs of poisoning appear in the animals.\n“Our findings were very surprising since poisoning from these chemicals is typically seen in wildlife in urban settings,” said Mourad Gabriel, a veterinary scientist and president of the Integral Ecology Research Center. “In California, fishers inhabit mature forests, national parks, and tribal community lands – nowhere near urban areas.”\nPathologist Leslie Woods, of the UC Davis California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System, conducted the fisher necropsies. She remarked, “I am really shocked by the number of fishers that have been exposed to significant levels of multiple second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides,” which can cause blood-clotting and uncontrolled bleeding in the affected animals by inhibiting their abilities to recycle Vitamin K.\nLess than seven miles from one of the study areas, said researchers, law enforcement officials removed 2,000+ marijuana plants, which were surrounded by large amounts of visible rodenticide.\nGabriel added that fishers in particular are probably an “umbrella species,” meaning that their protection ensures the simultaneous protection of other local wildlife, as well. Therefore, “if fishers are at risk, other species are [also] at risk because they share the same prey and the same habitat,” he noted.\nAnd the poisons used on marijuana crops are not the only reason they are harmful – nor are animals the only victims. Pot farms significantly disrupt and damage the environment, as well.\nIn Utah, in order to maintain remote marijuana farms, the Mexican drug cartel is “stealing the land, stealing the water, and growing the plants with total disregard for the environment,” explained Frank Smith of the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n“Last year alone, 61 national forests were affected by outdoor marijuana grows.”\nGrowers are causing damage in various ways, he stated. They use pipes to pump in water from natural streams, which, in many remote areas, are a scarce commodity in the first place. The criminals also strip sensitive land and stack brush (risking creating wildfires in the process), and leave trash around the surrounding area. And then, of course, there’s the rodenticide used on the plants themselves, and that puts people at risk, too.\n“All that [rodenticide] trickles into our water table,” said Smith. “Then they divert the water, either from wells or ranches or streams, which causes all kinds of ecological problems.”\nDiverting water is a problem for forest life in and of itself: It disturbs the natural landscape and deprives animals of an imperative survival resource.\nThe destruction wreaked by these illegal farms really adds up – in a very literal sense.\n“The average acre of marijuana that’s grown affects 10 acres around it and it costs about $20,000 per acre to bring it back to pristine forest,” Smith concluded. “It’s an environmental nightmare.”\nPhoto: A fisher.

A longstanding element of the artist development programs offered by SFFILM Makers, this fellowship is designed to ensure that narrative feature films that tell compelling stories about the worlds of science and technology continue to be made and seen.\nFrom an open call for submissions, SFFILM and the Sloan Foundation have awarded the 2020 Sloan Science in Cinema Filmmaker Fellowships to Kiran Deol to develop her screenplay Tidal Disruption, and to Jon K. Jones for his project Let There Be Light.\nThe review committee consisted of Aneeta Akhurst, Director of Programming at Seeker Media; Brad Balukjian, Ph.D., Director of Natural History & Sustainability Program at Merritt College; Sara Bender, Ph.D., Program Officer of Science at Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Sophie Gunther, Manager of Film Funds at SFFILM; Patrick House, Ph.D., writer and neuroscientist; Lauren McBride, Director of Artist Development at SFFILM; Indre Viskontas, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Psychology at University of San Francisco; and Doron Weber, Vice President and Program Director at Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.\nThe committee noted in a statement: “We are excited to award grants to two projects that not only address fascinating scientific fields, but in their own unique ways tackle the very basis of the scientific approach itself. From a historical account of a previously unsung African American scientist to a modern representation of power dynamics and misogyny in academia, both projects fearlessly portray the faults and boons of scientific culture through the eyes of complex, underrepresented characters. In addition to our grantees, the jury wishes to recognize two projects with Honorable Mentions: Lauren López de Victoria‘s Salt the Fields and Gabriel Wilson‘s After the Wind. While the jury was unable to award fellowships to those filmmakers, both projects showed much promise in their dynamic and achingly human explorations of scientific discovery. SFFILM and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation are thrilled to continue working together to champion important stories, from past to present, that build upon strong narrative foundations to expand the public understanding of science and technology.”\n“We are excited to partner with SFFILM to award two outstanding screenwriters with the 2020 Sloan Science in Cinema Filmmaker Fellowship,” said Doron Weber, Vice President and Program Director at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. “These powerful scripts, about sexual harassment of a female graduate student in astronomy and the real-life story of the pioneering little-known African American scientist Lewis H. Latimer, portray characters as complex and compelling as any in film today.”\n2020 SLOAN SCIENCE IN CINEMA FILMMAKER FELLOWSHIPS\nSloan Science in Cinema Filmmaker Fellowships include a $35,000 cash grant and a two-month virtual residency at FilmHouse, including access to SFFILM Artist Development offerings such as bi-weekly production meetings, virtual events, creative advisory, and more. SFFILM will connect each fellow to a science advisor with expertise in the scientific or technological subjects at the center of their screenplays, as well as leaders in the Bay Area’s science and technology communities.\nKiran Deol, writer/director\nA starry-eyed graduate student desperately struggles to maneuver between her passion for astronomy and her charismatic mentor’s advances in this claustrophobic psychological thriller.\nKiran Deol is a comedian, filmmaker, and actress whose work tackles difficult topics with humor and intimacy. She starred on Mike Schur’s NBC series Sunnyside this past fall opposite Kal Penn, and as the lead in Aline Brosh McKenna’s/Sono Patel’s Pop TV pilot Arranged the year prior.

As a filmmaker, her film Woman Rebel, a documentary about women rebel soldiers, was nominated for an Emmy, shortlisted for an Oscar, and distributed by HBO. She’s a 2020 Sundance Screenwriting Fellow and Sloan Award Recipient for her first feature film, Tidal Disruption. Additionally, Sundance Now released her short film American Haze, about her experience as a first-generation immigrant. She’s a regular host on Crooked Media’s all-female podcast Hysteria and she loves you.\nLet There Be Light\nJon K. Jones, writer/director\nLet There Be Light is based on the true story of African American inventor, draftsman, scientist, poet, and American Civil War veteran Lewis H. Latimer, who struggles to balance love and scientific curiosity amidst the turn of the 20th century in the United States.\nNew York-based writer and director Jon K. Jones earned a Bachelor of Science degree at Brooklyn College with a dual concentration in Screenwriting and Film History and a Master of Fine Arts at Columbia University School of the Arts in pursuit of his passion for story. His personal mission is to bring quality, entertaining, and original stories to life in television, fiction writing, and motion picture by combining socially poignant storytelling with transportive and imaginative aesthetics. In 2020, Jones completed a coveted year-long internship at Saturday Night Live and was the recipient of the Alfred P. Sloan Award for his short screenplay Let There Be Light, a small snapshot of the life of African American inventor Lewis H. Latimer.\nSloan Science in Cinema Filmmaker Fellowships are part of SFFILM and the Sloan Foundation’s year-round Science in Cinema initiative, which is designed to develop and present new feature films and episodic content that portray fully-drawn scientist and technologist characters; immerse audiences in the challenges and rewards of scientific discovery; and sharpen public awareness of the intersection of science, technology, and our daily lives.

9	What temperature settings are needed for different soldering tasks?	Higher temperatures (410C or above) are needed for embedding wire, soldering brass rods into lampshades, and removing excess solder. Lower temperatures (360-310C) should be used for decorative soldering, lead came soldering, and free-form solder art.	"[""Stained Glass Soldering Temperature\nStained glass soldering temperature is something I get asked about a LOT. Here are answers to common questions.\nStained Glass Soldering Temperature Questions\nTemperatures For The Hakko FX-601\nThe temperature you need for soldering a bead with the Hakko FX-601 is normally between 360C and 410C (680-770F).\nI say ‘normally‘ as it depends on a couple of factors including tip size, solder type and how quickly you move the iron along the seam. Those who are quicker have their stained glass soldering temperature set at 410C but if you solder more slowly you need to reduce the temperature to 360C.\n360C is a good temperature for starters as it gives you more time.\nHow Tip Size Affects Stained Glass Soldering Temperature\nSome say the size of the iron tip is more important than either the wattage or the temperature. My feeling is that they work in tandem and all feed into the optimum soldering experience. The most important thing is consistent temperatures and no cold spots.\nThe Hakko FX-601 comes with a small tip – 3/16″ – which is good for decorative soldering and delicate operations but not so good for running a bead. I’d suggest buying 1/4″ and 3/8″ for more control over your beaded seams.\nYou don’t have to worry that the larger tip will cause your solder to spill over. It sounds obvious but the width of the bead depends on the outer edges of the foil joint. The solder is not going spread out onto the glass if you use a wider tip.\nHow To Use The Iron Tip To Control The Temperature\nThe front edge of the tip is the coolest area, next is the side edge, the hottest area is the flat sides. You can control the melting solder by how high off the work you keep the iron.\nIf you want more heat change the angle of the iron tip – hold it flatter so that more of the iron tip is exposed to the solder. Do the reverse for a cooler iron, hold the tip more vertical (giving less of the iron tip to heat the solder) and the process will slow down. When you get super quick and confident you can turn the temperature up. You just have to move faster!\nYou’ll find the optimum temperature for YOU by experimenting. It will depend on your soldering speed and what you’re actually doing with the solder.\nWhat Stained Glass Soldering Temperature To Use For Different Tasks\nDon’t expect to set the heat dial and forget about it. Your soldering iron temperature needs to be tweaked in response to the job in hand. You’ll learn by experience what works for you but here are a few pointers:\nSet the temperature hotter (410C or even above) for these type of stained glass tasks:\nEmbedding wire, soldering brass rods into a lampshade, removing excess solder off a vase cap. Just remember to turn it down again afterwards otherwise melting of lead came could happen!\nIf the solder isn’t flowing and you’re not achieving a nice bead then try turning the iron up. I’d practice on some foiled pieces of scrap first if you’re inexperienced.\nSet the iron temperature lower (360-310C) for the following:\nDecorative soldering and soldering lead came, free-form solder art.\nTemperatures To Use For Different Solder Types\n50/50 can be heated to a higher temperature than 60/40 solder.\nLead-free solder doesn’t flow as nicely as 60/40 or 50/50. It reacts more like 50/50 and takes a lot of heat to make it flow nicely. When running a bead it’s better to work slowly, allowing the solder to heat up a little more. With practice and patience you can run a very nice solder bead with lead-free solder.\nHeat And Soldering Irons\nYou can see from the above pointers that there are various factors feeding into the stained glass soldering temperature question! Soldering irons are the final factor.\nThe good thing about the Hakko FX-601 is that the wide range of temperatures it offers means that it can be used for all sorts, from electronics to stained glass repairs.\nWeller irons achieve temperature control via a magnet in the (replaceable) tip which switches the iron on and off at the preset temperature. Two preset temperatures are available but you need to swap out the tip to change the temperature. These pertain to the number at the end of the tip – 7 = 700F, 8 = 800F.\nHakko uses modern electronics to provide an adjustable temperature. This is very useful as it can be easily adjusted it to suit the type of work you’re doing (copper-foil or lead) and the particular application.\nThe important thing to remember is that one temperature doesn’t work for all scenarios. I frequently adjust the stained glass soldering temperature as I work. The way it “feels” is more important than the actual temperature.\nhttps://everythingstainedglass.com/hakko-fx-601temperature-questionhttps://everythingstainedglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/212530_10-1.jpghttps://everythingstainedglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/212530_10-1-150x150.jpgFAQStained Glass ToolsCornerstone,Soldering Copper Foil,Soldering Lead Came,Soldering ToolsStained glass soldering temperature is something I get asked about a LOT.

10	need sound treatment material which better foam acoustic panels or carbon nomex honeycomb wall panels	Foam acoustic panels are specifically designed for sound treatment and are more suitable for acoustic purposes. Acoustic foam panels of different thicknesses target specific frequency ranges: 1-inch foam is effective above 1 kHz, 2-inch above 500 Hz, and 4-inch above 250 Hz. Adding an air gap of 2-4 inches behind the foam increases its effectiveness at lower frequencies. In contrast, while carbon Nomex honeycomb panels do provide some sound insulation performance, they are primarily designed for structural purposes, offering high strength-to-weight ratios and thermal properties. Their main advantages are mechanical rather than acoustic, such as high shear strength, high rigidity, and damage resistance. For dedicated sound treatment purposes, foam acoustic panels would be the better choice as they are specifically engineered for acoustic control.	['Payment & Shipping Terms:\n|Surface:||Carbon Prepreg In PF||Core:||Commercial Nomex Honeycomb Core|\n|Thickness:||8 Mm||Weight:||40 G/m2|\n|Product Name:||Carbon Nomex Honeycomb Panel||Treatment:||Satin Weave|\nnomex honeycomb panels,\naramid honeycomb core sheet\nCarbon Fiber Prepreg Aramid Honeycomb Panel for Yacht Wall and Ceiling Use With Phenolic Resin\nCarbon Fiber Prepreg Aramid Honeycomb Panel for Yacht Wall and Ceiling Use With Phenolic Resin is a very light weight aramid honeycomb panel comprised of an aramid honeycomb core with two carbon fiber phenolic resin prepreg produced surface plates. The surface plates are produced from carbon fiber prepreg impregnated with Phenolic (PF) resin.\nPhenol formaldehyde resins (PF) are synthetic polymers obtained by the reaction of phenol or substituted phenol with formaldehyde. Phenolic resins are mainly used in the production of circuit boards. They are better known however for the production of molded products including pool balls, laboratory countertops, and as coatings and adhesives. In the form of Bakelite, they are the earliest commercial synthetic resin.\nPhenolic resins are found in myriad industrial products. Phenolic laminates are made by impregnating one or more layers of a base material such as paper, fiberglass or cotton with phenolic resin and laminating the resin-saturated base material under heat and pressure. The resin fully polymerizes (cures) during this process. The base material choice depends on the intended application of the finished product. Paper phenolics are used in manufacturing electrical components such as punch-through boards and household laminates. Glass phenolics are particularly well suited for use in the high speed bearing market. Phenolic micro-balloons are used for density control. Snooker balls as well as balls from many table-based ball games are also made from phenol formaldehyde resin. The binding agent in normal (organic) brake pads, brake shoes and clutch disks are phenolic resin. Synthetic resin bonded paper, made from phenolic resin and paper, is used to make countertops.\nFeatures of Aramid Honeycomb Panel:\n1. high temperature resistance makes the panel can be hot pressed into shape under the temperature more than 200 ℃\n2. Wide range of density from29-160 kg/m3 of the core, if reinforced with carbon prepreg plates, the total area weight can be very low to 30g/m2; therefore it can meet many clients requirement on weight\n3. Extremely high shear strength, especially compared with foam core material, more suitable for use in light structure. It is considered to be a light weight but high strength composite honeycomb core material\n4. High rigidity, high resistance to damage compared with other honeycomb core materials\n5. Flame retardant, low smoke and low toxicity (in line with the most stringent flame retardant and smoking standards of aviation);\n6. Excellent creep and fatigue properties, can be used in strict requirement for long term use\n7. Extremely high wet strength, can be used in high humidity environment. Easy to process with reduced production cost;\n8. corrosion-resistant (not corroded by moisture or other medium or electrochemical reaction with carbon fiber, like a metal honeycomb);\n9. superior heat and sound insulation performance, compared with metal and glass fiber materials, under the same weight with better insulation and sound insulation performance, more comfortable and energy conservation and environmental protection;\n10. Easy forming process, compared with the metal honeycomb, the aramid honeycomb can be curved form, the processing is more convenient, the operation is more convenient.\nMechanical Properties of the Nomex Honeycomb Core\n|Size of honeycomb cell (mm))||\nPlain compressive strength(MPa)\n|Plain shear properties(Mpa)|\n|Pure core material||Sandwich structure||Strength||Modulus|\nMechanical Properties of the Nomex Honeycomb Core 2\n|L Shear Properties(Mpa)||W Shear Properties(Mpa)|\n|Typ||Min Ind||Typ||Min Ind||Typ||Min Ind||Typ||Min Ind||Typ||Min Ind|\nUses includes flooring, radomes, antennas, military shelters, fuel tanks, helicopter rotor blades, basis, indoor decoration panels and navy bulkhead joiner panels.\nHigh strength-to-weight ratios, high thermal and electrical conductivity, high tensile strength, low weight, low thermal expansion and excellent fatigue resistance are shown with the carbon fiber prepreg processed surface plates. Furthermore, the carbon fiber fabrics show many artistic pattern on the surface as the fabrics can be woven into plain, twill, satin and other methods during weaving process. High temperature and high pressing cured process makes the carbon fiber prepreg and the nomex core bond together completely. While the cells of the honeycomb core are free of resin infusion during the controlled production process compared to the other lay-up processes. This effort makes the final products free of no necessary materials but with a perfect light weight.\nLightweight, high strength nomex honeycomb core makes the sandwich composite panels’ higher compressive strength and lower weight, compared to traditional balsa or foam core sandwich panels. The carbon fiber and aramid honeycomb core can be both selected on product specification, weight, layer for customized purpose.', 'Acoustic Treatment for the Home Studio\nMake any room sound like a pro studio with the right acoustic treatment.\nThe missing secret that most home recording studio owners neglect is acoustic treatment.\nIt’s easy to see why.\nAcoustic treatment remains a mystery for so many beginners.\nIt’s often confused with soundproofing, which is stopping sound getting in or out of the room.\n- What are acoustics?\n- Assess your room\n- Early reflections\n- Absorbing bass frequencies\n- Types of acoustic treatment\n- Acoustic foam\n- Acoustic panels\n- How to make an acoustic panel\n- Bass traps\n- How to make a bass trap\n- Furniture as acoustic treatment\n- Where to place acoustic treatment\n- Working with poor acoustics\nThe sound of a room\nEvery room has its own sound. It’s something we’ve become so accustomed to that we barely notice it until there’s a big change.\nIt becomes obvious when you shout down a long tunnel, or sing inside a stone cathedral. Each of these environments shape the sound in their own ways, reflecting it back as a blanket of reverb.\nRooms in houses tend to be on the smaller side. They also have their own sound. But the rectangular shape and parallel walls make their acoustic far from ideal.\nDo acoustics matter?\nAcoustic treatment is vital for two purposes:\nWhen you record a vocalist, the mic picks up the direct sound of the singer, as well as the sound of the room.\nThis is because the singer’s voice bounces off the walls and furniture, arriving at the microphone a few milliseconds after the direct sound.\nThis colours the sound of the voice with the sound of the room you’re recording in. And you’re stuck with that sound.\nWith acoustic treatment, you can minimise the sound of the room, and capture the pure sound of the voice.\nThis signal can be processed with artificial reverb to make it sound like it was recorded anywhere. From Notre Dame to Abbey Road studios.\nWhen you’re listening back to a recording, you’ll hear the direct sound of the monitors, as well as the sound of the room.\nThis is because the speaker’s signal bounces off the walls and furniture, arriving at your ears a few milliseconds after the direct sound.\nThis means its difficult to hear your mix accurately. And if you can’t hear accurately, your mixes will be off when you play them back on another system.\nAssess your room\nWalk around the room and clap your hands.\nListen to the sound.\nThe bigger and emptier the room, the more chance you’ll hear a nice reverb. But for most of us, in small boxy rooms, we’re likely to hear a nasty ringing sound. It’s the sound of the clap bouncing back and forth between parallel walls. This is called flutter echo.\nThe ideal sound of a room\nLet’s assume that you plan to do both recording and mixing in the same room. This is how many home recording studios operate today.\nAim for acoustic treatment which eliminates most of the reflections, but doesn’t leave the room sounding completely dry.\nSo how do you do this?\nBy strategically placing sound absorbing objects in the room. Medium and high frequencies are quite easy to eliminate. But low frequencies are more problematic.\nRoom layout and monitor placement\nBefore acoustic treatment, consider the layout of the room.\nPlace your speakers symmetrically, along the narrowest wall. This will direct the sound along the length of the room.\nThey should be head height, the tweeter (smallest cone) level with your ears. The two monitors should form an equilateral triangle with the listener.\nPicture yourself sitting in a chair, in front of your monitors.\nAs well as directing sound towards you, the speakers are emitting sound in every other direction. The lower the frequency, the less directional the sound.\nMuch of that sound bounces off the walls and ceilings, and back to your ears. It merges with the direct sound from the monitors. If you were in a massive room, you’d hear an echo instead.\nYou can actually map out the path of the sound as it leaves the speaker, reflects off the wall, and reaches your ears. Sit in your listening position, or sweet spot, and ask a friend to hold a mirror flat against the wall. Let them move it around, until you can see one of your monitors. This is the area to place an acoustic panel.\nThe acoustic panel will absorb the sound from the speaker, rather than reflect it towards you.\nAfter playing around with a mirror, you should have an area on both walls to your sides, as well as the ceiling above. Place an acoustic panel in each of these three areas.\nYou can also place acoustic panels behind each speaker, to help absorb the sound coming from the back of the speaker. A lot of that sound will be low frequency, which needs separate consideration.\nAbsorbing bass frequencies\nThis is the area of sound which causes most problems for home recording studios. The lower the sound, the more difficult it is to absorb. Especially in smaller rooms.\nThis is because low frequency sound waves are long. The lowest note on a bass guitar is around 41 hertz (hz). That’s a mega 27 foot long sound wave!\nTo absorb these large sound waves, the acoustic panels need to be really deep. There’s ones made specifically for low frequencies, called bass traps. They’re placed in the corners of rooms, where bass frequencies congregate.\nDifferent types of acoustic treatment\nDifferent forms of acoustic treatment absorb different frequencies. It’s important to get a balance for a natural sounding room.\nThe denser and heavier the treatment, the lower the frequency absorbed. Don’t make the mistake of only using lightweight solutions, such as foam or carpet. This will only absorb the highest frequencies, resulting in a worse sounding room\nMost acoustic treatments use a combination of the following:\nThis is similar to the foam found in furniture.\nIt’s lightweight, and great for absorbing high frequencies. If thick enough, it can also be effective for medium frequencies.\nAcoustic foam comes in tiles of various sizes and thicknesses. The thicker they are, the lower the frequency they can absorb. 4″ foam is good for sound down to around middle C on a piano.\nAdding an air gap behind the foam will massively increase the effectiveness at lower frequencies. Aim for a gap of between 2 and 4 inches.\n|1 inch (25mm) foam||Effective above 1 khz|\n|2 inch (50mm) foam||Effective above 500 hz|\n|4 inch (100mm) foam||Effective above 250 hz|\nFoam tiles can be flat faced, or have ridged or egg box style profiles. A textured surface helps to absorb more frequencies. But it also means less foam, so not quite as effective as at lower frequencies.\nAcoustic panels are soft rectangular panels used for absorbing medium and high frequencies. They’re usually made from fiberglass or mineral wool slab, which are denser than foam.\nYou’ll also find them made with foam, but these work more like the acoustic foam tiles. The thicker the panel, the lower the frequency which can be absorbed.\n|2 inch (50mm) mineral wool||Effective above 200 hz|\n|4 inch (100mm) mineral wool||Effective above 100 hz|\nThe acoustic panels can be placed at the main reflection points. Hang them on the wall, preferably with an air gap of a few inches to increase the bass response.\nI also have some acoustic panels on stands, so I can move them around to change the acoustic when recording.\nI love the look of these full size t.akustik foam panels, finished in oak. They won’t be quite as effective as homemade, mineral wool panels (see below), but should start having an effect at around 350 Hz.\nAs an alternative to acoustic panels, use can use thick acoustic blankets on a rail. Acoustic blankets are heavyweight blankets made with mineral wool. Some blankets come with an absorbent side for sound reduction, and a reflective side for a brighter sound.\nIf you get a clothes rail with wheels, it’s easy to move them about to suite any recording, or monitoring situation.\nHow to make an acoustic panel\nAcoustic panels can be made with basic DIY skills. Mineral wool is available in semi-rigid 2 x 4 foot (or 600 x 1200mm) slabs. Buy a four pack of around 45kg/m3 density, 4 inch (or 100mm) thick.\nThe slabs are actually fully functioning acoustic panels out of the box. But they’re delicate and need a frame around them. And they need covering with material because they’re made of fibers that can irritate your skin.\n1. Build a frame\nBuild a simple wooden frame around the mineral wool slab, using four lengths of 3/8 inch (or 10mm) timber.\nIf you’re using 2 x 4 foot mineral wool slabs, cut 2 x 2 foot 3/4 inch, and\n2 x 4 foot lengths. Screw the frame together with 2 screws per corner.\n2. Seal the mineral wool\nMix up a solution of 1 part PVA glue, 9 parts water. Put it into a sprayer, and spray the mineral wool surfaces. Do this for the front and the back. This will bond any stray fibers.\n3. Cover frame with material\nChoose a porous material which allows sound waves to pass through. You can check this by making sure you can breath through it.\nCover the front of the frame first, pulling the material tight and stapling it into place on the back of the frame.\n4. Cover back of panel\nCut out some more material for the back panel, and staple or glue it into place on the frame.\nBass traps are extra deep acoustic panels. The extended depth helps to absorb the longer sound waves of low frequencies, which build up in the corners of rooms.\nMany bass traps work as broadband absorbers, meaning they absorb everything from low frequencies to the highest.\nThis makes bass traps the priority acoustic treatment for your home recording studio.\nBass traps should be placed in the corners of your room, where low frequencies collect. Avoid the tiny foam traps from Amazon, as they won’t have much effect on the bass. There’s better options, such as these bass traps by t-akustik, which are twice the size. Or take a look at the funky cylindrical Hofa traps, in a range of colours.\nBut for the most effective bass reduction, I recommend making some yourself with mineral wool or fiberglass.\n|8 inch (200mm) mineral wool||Effective above 50 hz|\n|12 inch (300mm) mineral wool||Effective above 25 hz|\nHow to make a bass trap (7 steps)\nFor a simple solution, follow the instructions for making acoustic panels, but make them double the thickness.\nPlace these thick panels in the corners of you room, so there’s a triangular air gap behind them.\nBut for a more permanent, and elegant solution, you can build full height bass traps into the corners of the room. Use mineral wool of around 45kg/m3 density, 4 inch (100mm) thick.\nEach slab can be neatly cut into 4 triangles, which are stacked to fill the corners.\n1. Measure the corner height\nMeasure the distance between the floor and the ceiling. To see how many mineral wool slabs you’ll need per bass trap:\nIn inches: divide the height by 16.\nIn cm: divide the height by 40.\n2. Cut the mineral wool\nUse a hand saw to cut each mineral wool slab into four equal triangles. Stack them neatly into the corner of the room.\n3. Stack the triangles\nKeep stacking the triangular mineral wool pieces until you’ve reached the ceiling.\n4. Seal the mineral wool\nMix up a solution of 1 part PVA glue, 9 parts water. Put it into a sprayer, and spray the mineral wool surfaces. This will bond any stray fibres.\n5. Make a frame\nMake a wooden frame around the corner so you can attach a fabric cover.\nFor the floor and ceiling, use 1 x 1 inch (25mm) batons. For the walls, use 1 inch triangular beading, either store bought, or by cutting the batons in half. Screw these directly onto the wall.\n6. Make a fabric panel\nUse 1 x 1 inch batons to construct a rectangular wooden frame, the same size as the frame on the wall. Make the height 1/4 inch (6mm) smaller – it will be easier to fit.\nStretch breathable fabric over the frame and staple it into place around the back of the frame.\n7. Screw the panel to the frame\nPosition the fabric panel onto the wall frame, and screw into place.\nThe bass trap is ready.\nDiffusers are reflective panels which scatter sound in different directions. They’re good for controlling reflections without making the room sound too dry.\nYou probably won’t need diffusers for your home recording studio, as they’re not that effective in small rooms.\nIn larger rooms, diffusers like this can be placed along the back wall, to scatter late reflections.\nFurniture as acoustic treatment\nEverything piece of furniture contributes to the sound of the room. You can be strategic by arranging the furniture to get the sound you want.\nAn upholstered sofa at the back of the room can work as a sound absorber. The bigger and heavier the sofa, the more effective it will be at lower frequencies. Throw some cushions and a throw over the sofa to increase the absorption.\nHeavy, dense curtains will absorb some medium and high frequencies. Look for a weight of around 1kg per square metre or more. You can double the mass by installing 4 pairs in place of 2.\nRugs and blankets\nThick rugs and heavy wool blankets can soak up high frequency reflections. Bunch them up and hang them from on the wall, with an air gap of a few inches. You can also hang them on a clothes rail and move them around.\nCarpet or rugs on the floor can help tame a reverberant room by absorbing high frequencies.\nDon’t make the mistake of carpeting every surface of your room. This will only absorb high frequencies. You’ll be left with a dull boxy sound.\nDuvet/comforter vocal area\nYou can use 2 thick comforters to make an improvised vocal recording area. Hang them in the corner of a room with a few inches of space in between.\nThe singer stands close to the mic, with their back to the duvet. This stops reflections from the corner of the room coloring the sound.\nPut shelves or a stylish bookcase at the back of the room. Fill them with your cables, equipment and manuals. This will provide a random surface which will act as a diffuser. It will scatter sound waves in different directions.\nWhere to place acoustic treatment\nEvery room is different and will need its own considerations. But there is a general blueprint for home recording studios which is a good place to start.\n- Place an acoustic panel at the reflection points on either side of the listener\n- Place an acoustic panel at the reflection point above your head on the ceiling\n- Place an acoustic panel, or bass trap (if in corner) behind each monitor\n- Place bass traps in all accessible corners. If there’s limited wall to wall corners, fit them in wall to ceiling, or wall to floor corners\nWorking with poor acoustics\nIf you’re working in an area where you can’t make any improvements to the acoustics, follow these tips:\n- Close miking\nSet the microphone up as close as you can to the vocalist or instrument. This will ensure the maximum amount of direct sound to the mic.\n- Use a dynamic mic\nDynamic microphones are less sensitive than condenser or ribbon mics. Use one to minimise the sound of the room in your recordings\n- Choose suitable monitors\nIn a small or untreated room, it makes no sense to have big monitors. Choose smaller monitors with less bass response and a smooth bass roll off. You’ll get a more accurate representation of what you’re listening to.\n- Use headphones\nConsider using a pair of quality open backed headphones for mixing. You’ll completely bypass the sound of the room, and hear a new level of detail.\n- Choose a soft room\nSet up in a room which already has soft furnishings, such as a sofa and curtains. Bring in extra clothes, blankets and duvets from other rooms to help absorb the sound.\nThe bottom line\nHowever much time and money you spend on recording equipment, you’ll always be limited by the room you’re recording in.\nSome basic acoustic treatment, especially in the low frequency range, will result in clearer recordings and accurate mixes.\nAcoustic treatment is the magic ingredient that so many newbies neglect. It really is the missing link for making pro quality recordings.\nThe International Commission for Acoustics (ICA) promotes development and collaboration in all acoustic research, development & education\nAuthor: Daren B\nDaren studied classical piano and composition at Trinity College of Music, at undergraduate and postgraduate level.\nHis music has been performed at the Southbank Centre, Tate Modern, and the Courtauld Institute, and broadcast on BBC Radio 3, Radio 4 and countless TV shows, including The Apprentice, Top Gear and Horizon.\nDaren is a former lecturer on the BA Music Course at Goldsmiths College, University of London.

11	Can a single point be enough to define a plane in three dimensions, or are there multiple possible planes that could go through one point?	A single point is not sufficient to define a plane. There are an infinite number of planes that could go through one point - you can keep rotating different planes around that single point.	"[""Points, lines, & planes\nSpecifying planes in three dimensions\nWe've already been exposed to points and lines. Now let's think about planes. And you can view planes as really a flat surface that exists in three dimensions, that goes off in every direction. So for example, if I have a flat surface like this, and it's not curved, and it just keeps going on and on and on in every direction. Now the question is, how do you specify a plane? Well, you might say, well, let's see. Let's think about it a little bit. Could I specify a plane with a one point, right over here? Let's call that point, A. Would that, alone, be able to specify a plane? Well, there's an infinite number of planes that could go through that point. I could have a plane that goes like this, where that point, A, sits on that plane. I could have a plane like that. Or, I could have a plane like this. I could have a plane like this where point A sits on it, as well. So I could have a plane like that. And I could just keep rotating around A. So one point by itself does not seem to be sufficient to define a plane. Well, what about two points? Let's say I had a point, B, right over here. Well, notice the way I drew this, point A and B, they would define a line. For example, they would define this line right over here. So they would define, they could define, this line right over here. But both of these points and in fact, this entire line, exists on both of these planes that I just drew. And I could keep rotating these planes. I could have a plane that looks like this. I could have a plane that looks like this, that both of these points actually sit on. I'm essentially just rotating around this line that is defined by both of these points. So two points does not seem to be sufficient. Let's try three. So there's no way that I could put-- Well, let's be careful here. So I could put a third point right over here, point C. And C sits on that line, and C sits on all of these planes. So it doesn't seem like just a random third point is sufficient to define, to pick out any one of these planes. But what if we make the constraint that the three points are not all on the same line. Obviously, two points will always define a line. But what if the three points are not collinear. So instead of picking C as a point, what if we pick-- Is there any way to pick a point, D, that is not on this line, that is on more than one of these planes? We'll, no. If I say, well, let's see, the point D-- Let's say point D is right over here. So it sits on this plane right over here, one of the first ones that I drew. So point D sits on that plane. Between point D, A, and B, there's only one plane that all three of those points sit on. So a plane is defined by three non-colinear points. So D, A, and B, you see, do not sit on the same line. A and B can sit on the same line. D and A can sit on the same line. D and B can sit on the same line. But A, B, and D does not sit on-- They are non-colinear. So for example, right over here in this diagram, we have a plane. This plane is labeled, S. But another way that we can specify plane S is we could say, plane-- And we just have to find three non-collinear points on that plane. So we could call this plane AJB. We could call it plane JBW. We could call it plane-- and I could keep going-- plane WJA. But I could not specify this plane, uniquely, by saying plane ABW. And the reason why I can't do this is because ABW are all on the same line. And this line sits on an infinite number of planes. I could keep rotating around the line, just as we did over here. It does not specify only one plane.""]"	['<urn:uuid:f40e7a14-aa68-417a-9782-e8e50f00a981>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	25	34	729
12	How did Parmenides describe true reality in his work 'On Nature'?	In his work, Parmenides stated that true reality 'is ungenerated and indestructible, whole, of one kind and unwavering and complete.' He believed that reality must exist in the strictest sense and that any alteration in it is impossible.	"['At the first sight Heraclitus and Parmenides uphold the opposite principles, with their doctrines being in dramatic contrast, while the former affirms change, becoming and cyclic recurrence of things and the latter denies their existence. For Heraclitus true being is circular and transforms into not-being, life turns into death and the change that occurs is eternal and cyclical, it truly is (Graham). While for Parmenides true being is motionless and static, it does not change behind the appearance of change. Both philosophers indirectly abolished death by stamping becoming with the seal of being (McFarlane).\nBut, actually, Parmenides and Heraclitus asserted the One. They merely applied to different approaches to teach the same things. Heraclitus affirmed that diverse appearances change, therefore opposites exist in interconnection, depend on each other and are in unity. He conceived a unity of opposites and accepted becoming, while Parmenides refuted opposites, accentuated being and claimed: “ Being is ungenerated and indestructible, whole, of one kind and unwavering and complete. Nor was it, nor will it be, since now it is, all together, one, continuous”. Hereby, different appearances of reality do not truly change, because they so not exist. Parmenides considered that change is impossible, as everything is staying the same, being one single static element, but his opponent, Heraclitus, on the contrary, affirmed that everything is in constant flux, it is changing and his statement “ everything flows” and “ you cannot step into one and the same river twice” have become phrases. He argued that one cannot “ step twice into the same river, nor touch mortal substance twice in the same condition. By the speed of change, it scatters, and gathers again”, so the river will be different every time it is regarded (Graham). Claiming that motion is change, Heraclitus became known for his philosophy of universal “ flux and fire” that, according to him, was the basic material of the world, as well as his controversial theory of coinciding opposites. The philosopher is considered to be independent of a definite school, as this heritage is multilayered and comprises elements of material monism and scientific cosmology, metaphysics and rationalism, but he definitely was a revolutionary whose works despite they were profoundly studied remain controversial and challenging to interpret (Graham).\nThe Greek philosopher presents uses the inductive method by means of which he wants the others to understand the world, he habitually presents a simple situation giving a concrete image, hereby he enables readers to educate themselves. To convey his beliefs more fruitfully Heraclitus uses such stylistic devices as chiasmus and alliteration in his speeches in defense of the theory. The philosopher diligently reiterates that his readers will not understand his message, but he promises to try to explain them everything he is able to see to: “ distinguish each thing according to its nature and show how it is” (Graham). The form in which Heraclitus presents his work is essential for understanding its essence, he uses the technique of verbal complexity and syntactical ambiguity, Charles Kahn, for instance, characterizes his style with two words “ linguistic density” and “ resonance”.\nWith his style similar to Hesoid and the Orphics Parmenides is supposed to have written only one work entitled “ On Nature” that is unfortunately preserved only in fragments, though it originally extended to about eight hundred verses. Parmenides broke the prose tradition by writing it in hexameter verse and was widely quoted by the later authors who kept it for the future generations. The philosopher speaks in support of his principles in the Proem that has a number of interpretation variants and is regarded by contemporary scholars in the aspect of the strict monism, logical-dialectics, meta-principle etc. The work deals with the goddess who must reveal the two ways to Parmenides and he should chose the better one. The two ways present his former error and the truth that becomes clear to him. The work consists of two parts, the first one concerns the truth or “ the true reality” and the second deals with the world of illusion, that is the world of senses and opinions. In the fragment 8 the goddess utters the philosopher’s principle of the universal statics by claiming: “ As yet a single tale of a way remains, that it is; and along this path markers are there very many, that What Is is… whole and uniform, and still and perfect …” with the past or the future being meaningless for the reason. Parmenides believed that “ the reality is and must be in the strictest sense” and any alternation in it is not possible.\nRemarkably, in Parmenides’s Proem the goddess criticizes ordinary men for being guided with their senses. Unlike Heraclitus, the thinker judges merely by reason and never trusts the senses. In the human perception the world is nothing but a “ deceitful show” (Palmer). Several other fragments found indicate that Parmenides touched upon the themes of physiology and human thought in his work and claimed that our own selves are deceptive and accentuated subjectivity of individual perception.\nWhile Heraclitus also emphasizing human affairs is supposed to be the first humanist, who proves the blindness of humans in his doctrine. Though he believed that humans are frequently incapable of understanding, let alone wisdom, he does not deny the importance of senses and says: “ The things of which there is sight, hearing, experience, I prefer”. The philosopher connected accumulation of wisdom with senses and memory rather than with knowledge, and the latter does not necessarily teach humans understanding. So, in accordance with Heraclitus, people do not learn by experience, as they cannot process the information they perceive, however, humans still exercise “ self-knowledge and sound thinking”. To comprehend his insights one should catch their complexity and discover the unity of the elements (Graham).\nAccording to Guthrie, for Parmenides there was no cosmology, as he presented the proofs of the impossibility of the opposites’ existence. Conceiving the plurality of normal beliefs, the philosopher, however, makes mention of cosmology principles in the fragments 8 and 9 where he discusses light and night, as well as the stars, sun, moon and the earth itself. Commenting on his cosmology, Guthrie remarked that for he philosophy it remains just “ a dialectical device” used for viewing the picture of the physical and sensible world (Palmer). The evidence of that is found in the goddess’s words when she characterizes cosmology as: “ the beliefs of mortals”.\nContrary to Parmenides, Heraclitus being a cosmologist mentions in his texts the kosmos “ order” describing the world around us, that he identifies with fire. Fire is described in his doctrine as the origin of all, all things are merely manifestations of fire and it is a symbol of change because it is never the same, without change, according to him, there will be no world. The elements are in cosmic balance and undergo the eternal transformations with no single element gaining predominance (Graham). Heraclitus says in his work: “ The turnings of fire: first sea, and of sea half is earth, half fireburst”. Unlike Parmenides, who proved the impossibility of the existence of opposites in his doctrine, Heraclitus entails the coincidence of opposites and discusses their interconnection, saying: “ Sea is the purest and most polluted water: for fish drinkable and healthy, for men undrinkable and harmful”. According to Herclitus, contrary qualities are included into “ the same thing”, he reasons that the same thing is living and dead at the same time, it is waking and sleeping, young and old (Graham). However, the philosopher accentuates that though the opposites are correlative, they are never identical to each other. But the coincidence of opposites results in contradictions that cannot be avoided by the philosopher. Barnes, for instance, blames the scholar for violating the principles of logic and making knowledge an impossible thing (Graham). Analyzing the philosopher’s beliefs as those advocating the radical change, we see that Heraclitus’ flux is a case of the unity of opposites described in his doctrine. But contemporary analysts claim, he cannot be both a believer in radical flux and a monist, so he is definitely a pluralist who urges self-control and moderation and regards the soul as the moral center of human existence (Graham). Despising passion, he admires the power received through self-mastery and self-purification: “ It is not good for men to get all that they wish to get. Whatever our desire wishes to get, it purchases at the cost of soul”.\nParmenides also discusses the behavior of the humans, is interested in the human thought and reasoning, though his discourse on that matter concerns cosmology. The interconnection becomes clearer as he discusses a wide range of natural phenomena. Being a rigid monist, Heraclitus believed in war, he even praised it calling it “ a guiding force in the world” and claiming: “ War is father of all and king of all; without the conflict we would have only lifeless uniformity”. The philosopher as well as Parmenides speaks of God, however, Hercalitus means neither the Greek Gods nor a personal entity. He considers that God exists in every soul and in every single thing in the world. Due to his “ fire and flux theory” he explains the presence of God in everything on earth. While Parmenides suggests that What Is is a god, and what must be “ must be or exist and must be what it is, not only temporally but also spatially” (Palmer).\nThough one thinks that the universe is static, eternal and motionless, denies change and becoming, another one affirms them and opens new perspectives for the Greek though by introducing his theory of “ flux and fire”, both have influenced the philosophic tradition and challenged the naÃ¯ve theories of their predecessors by developing more sophisticated ones. Parmenides, being a metaphysical monist, and Heraclitus, rather independent of any ancient theories, a material monist, a scientific cosmologist and a rationalist, have much more in common than it used to be generally recognized. Moreover, Heraclitus is supposed to inspire Parmenides for developing a contrasting theory, so that they could be seen as representatives advocating constant flux and universal stasis.\nThis work, titled ""Comparison of parmenides and heraclitus philosophy essay"" was written and willingly shared by a fellow student.

13	hardshell construction vs in mold helmet construction differences durability protection snow sports longboarding	Hardshell construction and in-mold construction differ in how their components are bonded together. In hardshell construction, the outer shell and inner EPS shell are glued at various contact points, which can potentially come apart over time due to wear. In contrast, in-mold construction involves foaming the EPS directly into the outer shell, creating a more stable bond that doesn't depend on glue strength. For snow sports, in-mold helmets are typically lighter, while injection-molded (hardshell) helmets are usually more durable. Both construction types are used in longboarding and skiing/snowboarding, and both must meet specific safety certifications like ASTM or CE EN1077 to ensure proper protection.	"['The right equipment is essential when you\'re hitting the slopes. And yet many skiers and snowboarders skip one of the most important pieces of gear before hopping on the lifts. Choosing the right snow helmet is essential for winter sport enthusiasts, though helmets continue to face staunch opposition from skiers all over the world.\nMany naysayers believe that helmets will have negative effects on your reaction time and peripheral vision, or create a false sense of invincibility and lead to more rash behavior. While these arguments make sense to many people, the facts don\'t support them. In truth, there are just far more benefits to wearing a helmet while skiing or snowboarding than there are negative side effects.\nBenefits of Ski and Snowboard Helmets\nAnyone who has fallen hard on the piste and wound up with a nasty cut and knot on their head, can attest to the fact that helmets may not be a terrible idea. Anyone who has walked away from a collision with a tree will tell you that a helmet can save you significant pain. Helmets are an unquestioned necessity in bike gear, and mountain biking is no more dangerous than skiing advanced runs. So why are snow sport fans so hesitant to adopt the helmet?\nMany say that snowboard helmets limit the peripheral vision and reaction time. But a recent study by the Wilderness Medical Society shows that reaction time does not suffer while wearing a helmet. Others say that helmets will encourage skiers and snowboarders to take more risks on the slopes. But a study from the University of Innsbruck showed that risk taking on the slopes has a significantly stronger correlation to personality than it does to helmet-wearing.\nAnd wearing a snowboard helmet is not a sign of being inexperienced or scared of the slope. Quite the opposite, in fact. Large surveys have shown that the people most likely to wear snow helmets were those with the most hours clocked on piste. Experience, it seems, is the best tutor after all.\nChoosing a Ski Helmet That Fits\nSo you\'ve decided to join the ever-increasing ranks of skiers and snowboarders who are taking the proper precautions before going out on the mountain. Now it\'s time to pick out the right fit ski helmet for head protection. A proper fitting snow helmet should sit snugly against your head, so that it does not move around when you shake your head. The bottom lip of the helmet should alight evenly with the top of your goggles, approximately one inch above the brow. Make sure the chinstrap fits ""back"" on the throat so that it does not slip off going down the mountain.\nIt\'s also important to determine whether you want an in-mold helmet or an injection-molded helmet. Typically, in-mold helmets, consisting of only one discernible layer, are significantly lighter. The bulkier injection-molded helmets, where one layer of impact-soaking foam is glued onto a hard outer shell layer, are usually the more durable option.\nSome helmets even come with lineups of features, from Bluetooth compatibility and speakers for music to vents you can open and close without taking off the helmet. These features are great and should be taken into consideration, but they should not constitute the main reason for choosing one helmet over another. Being able to chat via Bluetooth will do precious little to protect against a concussion, after all.\nOne of the most important factors in choosing a helmet that is best for you is making sure that your helmet passes all the regulations to be certified. There are two main certification standards in the snow helmet world. The European standard certification is the CE EN1077. This certification is common for European-manufactured helmets designed for alpine skiing.\nThe other school of certification is the ASTM F2040. This American certification is standard for most internationally marketed helmets, and ASTM helmets typically fulfill the requirements for CE EN1077 as well.\nMaking sure that your helmet is certified is a no-brainer (no pun intended). The certification standards were created to ensure that your gear works properly and protects you as designed. Luckily, the vast majority of helmets are certified, and many exceed the standards set out in these certifications.\nThe next time you go to the slopes, make sure you bring along a proper, certified helmet. These helmets are great additions to your snow gear, and can really save you from some serious pain down the road. And in some cases, like the now-infamous accident involving F1 driver Michael Schumacher, it can save your life.\nIf you\'re not looking to leave for the Alps any time soon and would rather stay closer to home, the cyclists out there can explore the ten toughest climbing routes in the UK. Just remember that, like with skiing and snowboarding, helmets are an essential part of your bike gear.\nThis item was posted by a community contributor.', 'Longboarding is all fun and games until you crack your head open like a watermelon on hard asphalt. Many have learned this the hard way but there’s no need for you to join the club.\nWhether you’re going to only cruise on a longboard or if you’re planning to skate downhill, you have to consider that sooner or later you will fall and slam your head. The right longboard helmet will help you walk away without having serious head injuries or even save your life.\nIn this post, you will learn what kind of helmet is the best for longboarding, which ones aren’t good and how to choose the best longboard helmet for your needs.\nFor a summarised version, check out the table below:\n|Half Shell||Freestyle and cruising, entry level helmet||Weighs 0.8 lbs\nCertified Multi-Impact (ASTM) and High Impact (CPSC)\n14 sizes available\n|Half Shell||Freestyle and cruising, entry level helmet||Sweat saver liner\nUnder 1 lbs\n|Full Face||Downhill and Freeride- Advanced riders||Certified Multi-Impact (ASTM) and High Impact (CPSC)\nHand-laid fiberglass shell & Shatter-resistant flip-up visor\nEPS foam liner with velvet lining\nFox Head Rampage Comp Imperial Helmet\n|Full Face||Downhill and Freeride- Advanced riders||Channeled EPS allows air to pass through\nMade of fiberglass\nPoured PU Chinbar construction for added protection\nThere are two main types of longboard helmets you should consider depending on what skateboarding discipline you (plan to) practice:\n- FULL FACE and\n- HALF SHELL helmets.\nHalf shell helmets are best for cruising, dancing, slalom, and freestyle. They generally offer less protection compared to full face helmets. Full face helmets provide more protection and are best for fast downhill skateboarding and freeride.\nFull face helmets are more expensive than half shell helmets, so it’s very common practice for beginners to start with a half shell helmet and then buy an additional full face helmet later when they start skating down hills.\n1. HALF SHELL longboard skateboard helmet\nAs a standard helmet in skateboarding, a half shell helmet (also known as “bucket”) offers basic protection suitable for cruising, longboard dancing, freestyle, slalom, street skateboarding and similar activities like roller skating or cycling.\nHowever, a half shell helmet is not the best option for downhill skateboarding or longboarding. The classic bucket shape protects the top and back of your head, as well as the forehead, but it doesn’t protect your face, eyes, ears or jaw.\nHard-shell vs Soft-shell helmets\nMost half shell longboard skateboard helmets have a “hard-shell”, which means that they are made of an outer ABS molded shell that cradles the inner lightweight EPS foam liner designed to disperse and minimize the impact. Definitely, avoid “soft-shell” helmets as they have a more flexible external layer and a softer multi-density foam liner which doesn’t provide the same level of protection as hard shell helmets with EPS do.\nAnother somewhat less popular shape of half shell helmet is a retro full cut which covers your ears as well. In addition to the safety aspect of it, a full cut helmet will also keep your ears warm when skating during wintertime. What doesn’t fall into the full cut category are half-shell helmets with removable ear pads you most often see in snowboarding or skiing.\nTwo types of Hard-shell helmet construction\nThere are two construction types of hard-shell helmets if we look at how the EPS liner is bonded with the outer shell: these are called a hardshell construction and an in-mold construction.\nA Hardshell Construction means that the outer shell and the inside EPS shell are not directly bonded together but rather glued on various contact points. If you’ve ever had a skateboard helmet wherein both pieces came apart due to longterm wear, this is the reason why.\nAn In-Mold construction means that the EPS is foamed directly into the outer shell. This results in an extremely stable bond between the components that are not dependent on the glue strength otherwise used in the hardshell construction.\nMulti-impact vs Single-impact helmets\nWhen a helmet receives an impact, the EPS foam liner gets deformed or cracks in order to disperse the energy of the blow but with this, it becomes structurally compromised. Some helmets can take more than others…\nHelmets can be multi or single-impact which indicates how many impacts they can withstand before they should be replaced with a new one. As the name suggests, the single-impact helmets should be replaced after they’ve received a single hit while the multi-impact helmets can withstand multiple impacts.\nHowever, it’s also important to understand that multi-impact helmets are made to withstand a single high impact hit and/or multiple low impact hits before they need to be replaced. This means that if you’ve used your helmet for a longer time period, it’s more likely it received multiple small impacts due to handling and transport, potentially resulting in loss of protective properties.\nCompared to the half shell helmets, the full face longboard helmets provide more protection as they cover the entire head and protect your eyes, face, jaw, and ears.\nAlso read: Best Full Face helmets for longboarding\nMost of the full face helmets come with a removable visor in different tints that protects your eyes from dust and bugs, as well as sun rays blinding you while you skate. They are built pretty much the same way as all other hard shell helmets; with an outer ABS molded shell, an inner EPS foam liner and additional foam padding for a better fit.\nAlso, a full face helmet is required at almost all downhill skateboarding/longboard events, so if you want to participate at racing or freeride events, you will have to have it.\nDesigned to be as aerodynamic as possible, full-face helmets don’t have many vents but it all comes down to what’s the safest for you.\nUnfortunately, full face helmet manufacturers share very little information about how big of an impact or the number of impacts their helmets can withstand. To make sure that you’re getting the best level of protection with your helmet, you should also check for certification marks the helmet might have (more information below).\nLongboard helmet certification marks\nWhen buying a longboard skateboard helmet it is extremely important to choose one that obtained the right certification marks. This ensures that the helmet was properly tested and that it met the required safety standards for this sport.\nAn example are the Icaro helmets used in DH some years ago…well the brand had to warn customers that that’s not really what they were made for…\nWarning: There are shops out there that are selling paragliding helmets like Icaro SkyRunner and claiming that these are “ideal for downhill skateboarding”. That is not correct. Do not use Icaro helmets for downhill skateboarding or longboarding because they have EN 966 certification for free flight and microlight sports, not for skateboarding. You’ve been warned and the folks at Icaro are saying the same thing:\nAnyone selling a helmet has to ensure that it is certified for the sport in which it will be used. Selling an uncertified helmet is an offence liable to criminal prosecution! Source\nHere are the certification marks that your longboard skateboard helmet should have…\nASTM – American Society for Testing and Materials (USA)\nASTM is an international standards organization that develops technical standards for different kinds of materials, products, systems, and services.\nWhen you want to buy a half shell helmet for cruising, dancing, and freestyle riding, you should look for an ASTM F1492 certified helmet. This is a standard specification for helmets used in skateboarding and trick roller skating. Helmets that comply with this standard are designed to protect your head for more than one moderate impact, but for a limited number of hits.\nAnother mark you may find is the ASTM 1447 for use by recreational bicyclists or roller skaters. These helmets, however, provide less protection than those with an ASTM F1492 mark.\nIf you want to buy a full face helmet for downhill and freeriding look for ASTM F1952; this is a standard for helmets used in downhill mountain bicycle racing, which also provides performance criteria for chin bars on full-face helmets.\nCSPS U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (USA)\nAs an American government standard, a CSPS certification means a helmet is safe for bicycle use. Currently, the CSPS does not have a standard specific for skateboarding helmets, but they are tested and marked with the CPSC 1203 certification for bicycle helmets.\nCE certification mark (EU)\nIf you’re buying a helmet in Europe, it should have a CE certification, which means it meets the health, safety and environmental protection requirements of the European Economic Area (EEA). For longboard or skateboard helmets the most common is the CE EN 1078 certification.\nThis standard specifies the requirements to withstand a single high impact and a few puncture impacts for bicycling, skateboarding or in-line skating.\nWarning: Pay attention to the CE mark if you’re buying a cheap skateboard helmet from China. Chinese manufacturers apply a logo similar to the CE mark, which actually means China Export and has nothing to do with the CE certificate.\nAS/NZS 2063:2008 (Australia)\nLongboard skateboard helmets which have this certification mark meet the current Australian Standards certification to withstand a single high impact in non-motorised recreational bicycling.\nSo that’s it…\nWhen buying a longboard skateboard helmet make sure that it’s a hard shell helmet with an EPS liner and that it’s certified. If you hit it hard, replace it to keep skating safely 🙂\nHow often should you change your longboard helmet?\nDepending on what kind of certification your helmet has, a single or multiple impact, you should replace it if you went through a hard slam or a serious crash.\nEven multi-impact certified helmets that went through numerous hits don’t offer the same amount of protection as when they did when they were new. With each slam, even these helmets provide less and less protection. If you don’t know if the helmet still offers good protection, you should replace it.\nIf you’ve been wearing your helmet for a few years now and never experienced a crash, you might also want to consider replacing it. The materials of the helmet can age and lose their protective properties more rapidly when exposed to sweat and heat, meaning they will not offer the same protection. Because of this, it is advised to replace a helmet after 3 years, even if you never exposed it to a fall or a crash.\nAre other helmets like cycling or motorcycling helmets also good for longboarding?\nAny helmet is better than no helmet but to maximize your safety it’s best to wear a helmet that is certified for the sport you’ll be practicing.\nIf you can’t get your hands on a skateboarding helmet, use whatever you have but be aware of the following downsides; Cycling helmets don’t offer enough protection, motorcycling helmets are too heavy and paragliding helmets (like Icaro SkyRunner) are not really made to be smashed against the asphalt and do not have certificates required for skating.\nThe best alternative to a longboard full-face helmet would be a mountain biking helmet. An example is the POC Coron Air Carbon SPIN mountain bike helmet on the photo which includes all of the certification mentioned above.\nHowever, these are bulkier, feature lots of vents which means that they aren’t as aerodynamic as you want them to be. The downside is also that they don’t come with a visor, so you would probably have to make one yourself.\nDo you really need a longboard helmet?\nYou may have heard about skateboarders not being fans of helmets and that they take away the freedom. In case you need convincing, especially after seeing many street skateboarders hatin’, you should know that the stats are not on your side.\nCheck out these results from the research done in 2014:\nLongboarders suffered twice as many injuries to their heads and necks (23.3% vs. 13.1%, p < 0.000) and twice as many severe neurological traumas (8.6 vs. 3.7%, p < 0.000) while skateboarders suffered more injuries to their lower extremities (33.7% vs. 24.7%, p < 0.002).

14	natural light windows design psychological effects importance	Natural light through windows serves dual architectural and psychological purposes. In building design, as demonstrated at Andrew's Glen, full-height windows with low sills allow light to penetrate deep into units, creating unique experiences by tracing the sun's daily path and making a significant difference during long, dark months. From an environmental psychology perspective, proper daylight exposure at the right time of day and natural views are crucial for mental and physical health, though the benefits depend on proper implementation - even well-designed windows lose their positive effects if occupants block them with heavy curtains. Additionally, dynamic elements like seeing leaf shadows moving on walls can potentially enhance occupant wellbeing.	"[""Location10415 Main St, Bellevue, WA 98004, USA\nProject TeamJohn Woodworth, Paul Hanson, Scott Starr, Leah Ericksen\nStructural And Civil EngineersCoughlin Porter Lundeen\nContractorWG Clark Construction\nText description provided by the architects. At Andrew's Glen, SMR Architects partnered with Imagine Housing to provide 40 units of transitional housing to an Eastside community deeply in need. St. Margaret's Episcopal Church initiated the project, with a vision to help struggling individuals get back on their feet in a tangible way -- and whose large, central site was a perfect fit. The team collaborated over the course of two years to create the right program and the right building to suit the need and the site. Today, twenty units and support services are dedicated to the needs of a formerly homeless, and largely disabled, population of Veterans, while an additional twenty units help stabilize the community in providing for formerly homeless individuals and families.\nThe site is designed to continue a campus feel for the three established uses: Church, Housing, and Thrift Store. The new apartments definethe street edge, and establish both the pedestrian and vehicular connections to all three uses. Pedestrian activity is now focused on an active community space in between the church and the apartments, central to the site, and directly connected to public transportation. This spine gathers uses -- meeting spaces, laundry, and play areas, both indoors and out -- while embracing the steep hillside across the site.\nThe exterior is simple and modest, respectful of the larger community in massing, color and materials. The richly mottled concrete common room walls, flanking the bright, welcoming doorway, define the entry. An open parking garage fronts the remaining two-thirds of the street and maintains the existing on site parking. A mesh screen teases as it reveals and masks the parking garage beyond, while opaque panels break the rhythm of the garage columns, and of the units above. An opportunity for delight is formed from what might have been a long, bleak wall.\nUnits include many universal design features to increase their accessibility to a variety of tenant needs. This includes a soothing and contrasting interiors color pallet to help the visually impaired; full turning circles and removable vanity cabinets in most bathrooms; and providing accessible appliances, fixtures and hardware everywhere.\nFull-height windows make for a unique experience, designed in proportion with the human body. This additional height allows light to penetrate deep into the unit, while the low sills expand and frame the territorial views. The sun connects to the floor immediately, and traces its daily path -- natural light makes such a big difference in our lives through the long, dark months of the year.\nInterior common rooms look out onto covered exterior spaces, which in turn lead to areas open to the sky. In our climate it is wonderful to be able to choose the space that suits you need as the weather changes: spaces that are cozy and warm; spaces that focus and embrace the sun; spaces that let you experience the cold, crisp air, while sheltered from the rain."", 'When it comes to putting people at the core of building design, one can no longer rely on “hard” sciences alone. Human and social sciences — including environmental psychology — are key. To understand this fascinating discipline and how it can help create better spaces for their occupants, we called on Femke Beute, owner of LightGreen Health and Postdoctoral Researcher at Jönköping University.\nWhat is environmental psychology about? When was it born and why?\nFemke Beute (F.B.): Environmental psychology is about the dual interaction between the person and the environment. It is based on the recognition that the environment influences us but we also influence our environment. It is a relatively recent field within psychology that has received less attention than clinical and social psychology for instance, although it is growing in size and number of researchers working in this field. Indeed, psychology historically started with a focus limited to the individual, and was then broadened to the physical and social environment with the work of Egon Brunswick, Kurt Lewin and Roger Barker about one century ago.\nThere are two focal points within environmental psychology. The first, which I am involved in, looks at the influence of the environment on the individual as human behavior, cognition, affect, physiology, etc. Examples include restoration (mood improvement, stress reduction), or way-finding (how people find their way in an unknown building or city), or place attachment (what are the physical characteristics that make people get attached to a certain place). The second is conservation psychology and focuses on the relationships between people and the natural world and on how to support more environmentally friendly behaviors to conserve this natural world.\nIt is today not (yet) established and taught as a discipline like social psychology, and there are in fact only a few environmental psychology sub-departments in the world. Most people working in this field are scattered across many different disciplines, like occupational or clinical psychology, architecture, epidemiology, medical science. This raises some challenges but also gives it its strength.\nWhat are the links between environmental psychology and architecture?\nF.B.: I would say that they are two separate disciplines looking at the same thing, interested in the same topic. However, they use a different language and sometimes have different goals. Also, generally speaking if we look at practical implications, research is very slow. As an architect, you have an assignment, and you can’t delay the process too much by doing research. And as researchers, we want to be very careful about the statements we make. And then the challenge is to translate the findings of our studies into an architectural design. For example, the effects of a window on people’s well-being found in a laboratory may be different than when placed in the real world, potentially because of the shape and dimensions of the room, the ceiling height, the color of the walls, etc.\nBut I believe that they are growing towards each other. When I was a student in architecture, I was really interested in understanding how buildings influence people, and how I could use my designs to help people feel better. However, this type of research was not really understood within the architectural department where I was studying at that time. That’s why I started to look around and came upon the program “Human Technology Interaction” where they did look at those kinds of questions, and eventually switched programs at that point.\nToday, when we look at very similar architectural departments, more and more research on humans is going on. Architecture departments are starting to take the tools and research methods developed within environmental psychology. And I expect that this will become more and more. But we could still benefit from a communication in both directions. Researchers are indeed much into the numbers and controlling everything, while architects are more into design orientations, and translating a strong concept into materials. Environmental psychology could really learn from architects’ intuitions and design challenges. As I said, it is a very big step from implementing the micro scale manipulations that researchers do in the laboratory to the complex real world.\nWhat benefits could we get from a closer collaboration between environmental psychology and design?\nF.B.: The ultimate goal is to understand how our physical environment influences us, and to eventually implement that understanding so that buildings are good and healthy for the people who live in there, so that buildings are more than a shelter to keep us safe from the rain. This is not an easy task since it is always a combination of factors that makes a space. But this will become more and more important, as people are living more and more in cities and in built environments. And the current Covid-19 crisis has demonstrated how important it is to live in pleasant places and have access to the outdoors. Design needs the research knowledge and the inputs, and research needs to understand the design intuitions. We need both parts, as a common language, to translate the findings into the real world.\nDo you have examples of how environmental psychology is applied in practice to create healthier buildings?\nF.B.: There are a number of areas where you can see fruitful cross fertilization. Healing environments are a good illustration, where knowledge from restorative environments and what makes people relieve stress has started to be implemented. Having said that, pre/post occupancy studies could be used to support further implementation of environmental psychology in real buildings, through surveys in particular, so that we could learn by doing. We also have some developments within research methodologies that we could use to test things more out in the field, and help bridging the gap between design and research.\nFor instance, the use of ambulatory sensing — with smartphones and sensors ― provides more details on what people are doing and how they are using their environment. In the old days, the first technologies used within environmental psychology were physical tracers to see where people walked, how they were using the building. Today combined with modern age technology and sensors, that would help us to understand much more how the built environment influences us. We may even combine those with big data sets, combining all the physical characteristics of the environment and the human behavior in that environment ― what people feel, their activity level, their heart rate, etc. So the technology is there, the research method is there, but we need to implement it in a smart way, and people that are willing to do it at a larger scale and to pay for it.\nHow does your research and teaching impact your insights on daylight and views?\nF.B.: Of course when we learn about how important it is to get the right amount of daylight at the right time of day, to have a natural view, or to live in a natural environment, it certainly does impact you. I have moved to a place with more nature where my daughter can grow up in a more natural environment because I know it is very important for her. I also try to get enough daylight, sit close to windows as possible. And when I teach students on this topic, there are always people that come to me saying that this has changed some aspects in their lives. Simple interventions in your life can indeed have a large impact.\nBut if I talk to people in my environment not working in this area, there are a lot of things they are not aware of. There is still a big gain to get by educating, translating the research outcomes to knowledge. Take the example of hospitals. As the focus is on medical outcomes, and the benefits of nature and daylight are mostly related to mental and physical health, it is logical that this knowledge has been picked up first there, and applied as an intervention. But certain elements could also be applied to other types of environments such as homes and offices. Also, we could work with architects to design the most optimum building, but the actual effects would depend on how the users use it. For example, you can have a nice window opening, but if the occupant decides that there needs to be a very thick curtain in front of it the entire day, you lose the benefits.\nWhat are the main challenges and research gaps — in particular with regards to windows ― that environmental psychology should investigate in the future?\nF.B.: While there are still lots of aspects to be looked at, relatively speaking windows have received quite a bit of attention. Now we would also need to look at for instance where windows need to be placed in a room, and what other aspects of the room are also important — choice of materials, dimensions and shape of the room, etc. Views to the outside can be restorative, but the way the building is designed by itself can also be restorative. We need to take a more comprehensive look at nature, by including daylight in our perception of the natural environment, and not separating view types from daylight, because daylight is part of nature. We need to look more substantially at weather changes, weather dynamics in daylight and how that impacts occupants in buildings, and how we can capture that inside architectural design and use it to create restorative experiences. If we could see the shades of the leaves on the wall moving in the wind, or disappearing when there is a cloud in front of the sun, this could potentially make occupants feel better.\nNatural environments are restorative: when we go outside, we feel better and we can perform better. How in this increasingly urbanized world can we keep this connection with nature and daylight that is good for us, and how can make sure that even in cities people meet their minimum needs? This is the biggest design challenge.\nFemke Beute is an Environmental Psychologist, investigating the beneficial effects of our physical environment on humans. She specifically focuses on the effects of our natural and built environment and exposure to daylight on health and wellbeing. In addition, she is also keen to complement research conducted in the psychological laboratory with field research aimed at gaining a better understanding of the complex interplay between humans and their environment in everyday life by using ambulatory sensing and smartphone technology. She holds a Bachelor in Architecture and a Master in Human Technology Interaction. Her PhD project focused on the beneficial effects of exposure to nature and daylight on mental health. In 2018, she founded her own Research Consultancy Agency ‘LightGreen Health’ with the aim to deepen the scientific understanding of the beneficial effects of our physical environment on health and wellbeing and, importantly, to inform people outside of academia on these scientific outcomes as well as to support the application of potential restorative interventions in design and planning. She combines her consultancy work with an Academic position in lighting research at Jönköping University.\nEloïse Sok is Concept Creator in the SageGlass Europe & Middle-East Team.

15	As a cycling enthusiast interested in historical engineering, I'd love to know more about the construction innovations that made the Canal du Midi possible in the 17th century. What were some of the groundbreaking features?	The Canal du Midi featured several major engineering innovations for its time. The most notable was the improvement and development of pound locks, which were previously unknown in the region. The dam on the reservoir at St-Férréol was revolutionary, being the first of its type in Europe. The canal also included the Malpas Tunnel, which was the first canal tunnel ever built and was remarkably completed in just eight days. Additionally, various aqueducts were constructed along the canal's length, with some being extraordinary engineering achievements. These innovations were necessary to realize Pierre Paul Riquet's dream of connecting the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, which required up to 12,000 workers to complete.	"[""Declan Lyons, author of Cicerone's guide to cycling the Canal du Midi, shares his personal relationship with the route, as well as discussing the history of the canal, what it's like to cycle, route planning tips and the local culture.\nThe Canal du Midi surprised me: I wasn’t looking for it and was barely aware of its existence when it cast its spell on me.\nCycling the canal is now a consuming passion: I’ve spent years enjoying and exploring it – finding out its secrets and discovering its quiet charms. It opened up the surrounding countryside for me and introduced me to the joys and wonders of the region: this is just part of the magic of the Occitan.\nIt all started when I was lying looking out of a small skylight in a holiday chalet in the south of France. It was 0600 on a bright mid-May morning, the sky a deep blue. Suddenly five large birds – flying in a cruciform formation – partially blocked out my view of the blue sky for a second. I was up quickly and into my cycling gear, peddling in the direction that the birds were travelling. I followed a tarmac cycle path to a canal and then along it, between the canal and an extensive marsh. I was greeted by the sight of a large flock of flamingos, gathered in the centre of a wide shallow lagoon.\nMy wife, son and I were staying in the campsite while we looked for a house in the nearby village of Portiragnes. The flamingos and the other wildlife I saw in the few days cycling around the area convinced me that this was the right place to buy, and we did so that week. I’m still convinced 17 years later.\nI had come upon the Canal du Midi before, mainly while cycling the Languedoc region of France. I had crossed and re-crossed it while out for a spin but had never taken too much notice of it. Owning a home close to it gave me the chance to explore it in much greater detail.\nThe area’s wildlife, as the above suggests, was the first thing to grab my attention. I had studied zoology and botany, which has been the foundation for a lifelong passion. The canal and its environs gave scope for further study. The plane trees give it a special flavour: their shade shapes the canal’s ecology and delineates it from that of the surrounding towns and countryside. Most of all, the shade made cycling so much more pleasant than on the open, sun-scorched roads around.\nI gradually became familiar with the canal’s fascinating history and that of the countryside it travels through. The canal represented one of the great engineering achievements of the 17th century, and Pierre Paul Riquet, an interesting character, was the man responsible for its construction. He was neither an engineer nor an architect, but a tax collector who became obsessed with the dream of linking the Atlantic to the Mediterranean.\nThe Garonne River allowed boats to travel from Bordeaux and the Atlantic to Toulouse, but getting from there to the Mediterranean was difficult and involved arduous journeys along mud roads using horses and carts. The idea for the canal wasn’t new – far from it: the Romans, among others, had recognised the desirability of some link between the two seas, and a canal would save having to sail the whole of the Iberian coast before entering the Mediterranean.\nA reliable water supply was the main obstacle to building it. Riquet, while crisscrossing the countryside collecting taxes, finally worked out how to supply sufficient water to allow for a workable canal, and got permission to set about building it. He had to introduce major innovations to convert the dream to reality. For example, although they had been around for some time elsewhere, pound locks were unknown in the region. He improved and developed them well beyond what had been known up until then. The dam on the reservoir at St-Férréol was the first of its type in Europe. There are aqueducts along the canal’s length, and some of the major ones are extraordinary engineering feats.\nRiquet had up to 12,000 men and women working flat out to complete the canal. One of the major feats was the completion of the Malpas Tunnel – the first canal tunnel ever built – in just eight days. The towns and villages along the route have deep and multi-faceted histories reflecting the invasions, wars, crusades, businesses and agriculture along its length.\nCycling the canal\nCycling, however, makes the canal special for me. I always been an advocate of slow cycling, setting a pace that allows me take in the life around me as I pedal along. The canal is perfect for this. It offers a variety of terrain and difficulty for what, at its core, is a flat route.\nThe towpath surfaces varies from tarmac to badly rutted dirt track. Cycling the latter requires care and attention, but it does open up beautiful countryside. Most of the towpath, however, is pleasant and easy to cycle.\nToulouse and the towns and villages along the route all add interest. Chateaus, castles and churches feature along the length of the canal. Toulouse, ‘the rose city’, is well worth spending several days in. Carcassonne, with it restored medieval walled Cité, is certainly worth a long stop. Béziers’ historic centre was the scene of the worst atrocity of the crusade against the Cathars. Sète is a mini-Venice on this stretch of Mediterranean coastline.\nThe canal meanders as it finds its way between hills and hollows. The forces that determine a canal’s route are water supply and the need to avoid climbing or descending, using locks or aqueducts where necessary. The stretch of the canal from Argens-Minervois to the nine locks at Béziers is lock-free for 54kms. This is one of my favourite sections, passing villages such as Paraza, where Pierre Paul Riquet lived for a time. Le Somail is one of my favourite villages on the canal, dating from the 17th century, when it was built to support canal traffic. It has a small port with a narrow cobbled bridge linking the two quays. Le Somail features on the cover of this latest edition of my Guide. Some of the most important works on the canal are also on this stretch. The crossing of the Cesse river is dramatic, particularly in winter, when the river is in flood: the bridge carrying the canal was built between 1689 and 1690. Immediately afterwards is the junction with the canal that leads to Narbonne. Closer to Béziers you come to the Malpas Tunnel, mentioned earlier. Finally, the path comes to the nine locks at Béziers, one of the canal’s most visited sites.\nThe canal can be cycled in stages, or you can take a short day trip, depending on your interests. Those looking for short, relatively straightforward cycles should try the tarmac stretch from Toulouse to Port Lauragais, which glides gently from the city into the countryside. There are train stations relatively close to the route, and a combination of train and cycling allows you to plan a day trip of the length that suits you best. Other tarmac stretches are from Béziers to Portiragnes Plage and Marseillan to Sète.\nThe canal offers a launchpad for excursions into the surrounding countryside. The trip to Minerve from Homps is among my favourites, climbing through the fertile plain flanking the canal to the dramatic gorges of the Cess river. Minerve was a Cathar stronghold perched precariously above the Cesse gorge. Aigne is a village with an unusual old centre, known as l’Escargot (the snail), laid out in a spiral shape around the church, St Martin.\nAnother favourite excursion follows the towpath along the canal that branches to Narbonne and then on to the Mediterranean at Porte la Nouvelle. This visits the Roman town of Narbonne, once the crossroads of two Roman roads, the Via Domitia and the Via Aquitania: this made it strategically important for the Roman Empire. The town developed and expanded, becoming an administrative centre, and today it’s hard to believe that this landlocked town was once a thriving port: it gradually silted up so that it’s now 15km from the sea. The canal itself carries on to the sea, exposed to wind and sun, passing lagoons, an island and beaches.\nThere’s a lot more to the canal than cycling. Your stops give you an opportunity to taste some local food and wine. Restaurants dot the quays in towns along the towpath. Local producers sell their produce through markets and small shops, often in farm buildings or from temporary stalls. Summer brings festivals and outdoor events to the smallest towns and villages, ranging from classical music to jazz. Toulouse and Carcassonne host international programmes, while small towns and villages have their own local events. Bull running is common through the streets of villages around Béziers: the whole community gets involved, giving you an opportunity to meet locals and understand the local culture.\nPlane trees under threat\nThe new edition of my Guide includes the changes that have occurred along the canal over the past eight years. One of the negative changes is the continued spread of the fungal disease Ceratocystis platani, which is killing the plane trees that line the canal. The disease was introduced to the region during the Second World War, when infected wooden boxes carrying munitions were brought from the US. It first appeared on the canal near Carcassonne in 2006, and has spread rapidly since then. The canal company have been forced to fell more and more trees in an attempt to stop the spread of the infection, but admit that there is little chance of saving the 42,000 plane trees that shade the canal’s towpath.\nThe canal company has a programme to fell infected trees during the winter, so that that there are now stretches of the canal denuded of trees. So far these are mainly on the lower stretches, from Carcassonne to Agde. But the disease is spreading. The company is planting disease-resistant plane trees and a mix of other species that in time will grow to replace the absent shade.""]"	['<urn:uuid:d89534ff-6870-4e88-aeff-f857f4fac262>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	35	110	1706

Slightly is going a ways – the flavors of the spices are boosted within the warmth, too, so including an excessive amount of directly can result in a very potent drink.\n- Warmth the wine gently. That is what makes the gradual cooker best for mulled wine. You don’t need crimson wine to overheat or keep at a prime temperature for lengthy sessions of time, because the flavors will flip syrupy.\n- Use the “stay heat” atmosphere at the gradual cooker to stay the mulled wine heat. Simply understand that some cookers run warmer than others, so inspect the pot once in a while to verify the wine isn’t overheating.\n- White wine. Sure, you’ll be able to make mulled wine with white wine and even rosé. Use a dry white wine, like Sauvignon Blanc or Chardonnay.\n- Spices. Exchange up the spices to present this recipe an entire other taste profile. Take a look at cardamom pods, megastar anise, nutmeg, and juniper berries.\n- Garnishes. For a festive twist, have some cranberries bobbing within the pot when serving.\n- Tea luggage. A handy guide a rough shortcut to spicing it up is to make use of a chai tea bag or two.\n- With out liquor. You’ll be able to completely make this recipe with out brandy or bourbon. Upload a dash of orange juice as a substitute should you’d like.\n- Mulled wine is historically loved heat. After all, if yours has cooled down, you’ll be able to additionally sip it chilly. It simply received’t be relatively as comfortable.\nWhat To Serve With Mulled Wine\nThis conventional spiced wine has transform synonymous with Christmas, with its heat flavors and wintry weather spices. I make a large batch of this on on the subject of each and every instance during the festive season, and it’s best to revel in prior to or after a meal. Listed below are some tasty concepts for serving:\nEasy methods to Retailer and Reheat Leftovers\n- Refrigerator: I like to recommend straining out the spices prior to storing leftover mulled wine, to stop overextraction. Retailer the mulled wine hermetic within the refrigerator for as much as 3 days.\n- Reheat: Gently heat the leftovers at the stovetop or within the crock pot over low warmth.\n- To freeze: You’ll be able to retailer leftover mulled wine within the freezer with out impacting the flavors. Ensure it’s cooled totally and retailer it in an hermetic, freezer-safe container for as much as 2 months. Defrost within the refrigerator or at room temperature prior to reheating.\nExtra Vacation Drink Recipes\n- 750 ml crimson wine, I exploit Merlot\n- zest of one orange\n- 1 complete orange, peeled, segmented\n- 6 complete cloves\n- 3 cinnamon sticks\n- 1 inch piece of clean ginger root, thinly sliced\n- ½ cup Maker’s Mark Bourbon\n- ¼ cup honey, or to style, not obligatory\n- contemporary orange slices, rosemary sprigs, cinnamon sticks, for garnish, not obligatory\nSluggish Cooker Means\nMix all elements in a three to 4-quart gradual cooker pot.\nStir and canopy with a lid.\nCook dinner on LOW for 1 to two hours.\nTake away the lid and stir. Style and regulate with the sweetener, if wanted.\nLadle the mulled wine into mugs with out the spices. Garnish with a slice of orange, rosemary sprig, and/or cinnamon sticks, and serve.\nAfter you take away the lid, depart the gradual cooker at the Heat atmosphere whilst serving.\nMix the elements in a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed cooking pot and set it over medium warmth.\nWhen the wine involves a simmer, flip the warmth right down to as little as it’ll move.\nDuvet, and let the wine simmer for no less than quarter-hour or as much as an hour.\nThe usage of a advantageous mesh strainer, take away and discard the orange slices and spices. Give the mulled wine a style, and stir in further sweetener if wanted.\nServe it heat in heatproof glasses or mugs and most sensible with garnishes.\n- Wine Alternatives: Mulled wine is continuously easiest to make with inexpensive, full-bodied crimson wine because the spices will considerably regulate the wine’s authentic taste. You’ll be able to check out it with a Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, or Zinfandel.\n- Scale: Regulate the recipe simply for extra servings, however keep away from overfilling the gradual cooker.\n- Scorching Liquid Mugs: Serve in mugs or glasses that may deal with the warmth to keep away from cracking.\n- Be sparing with spices; their flavors accentuate with the warmth, so just a little is lots.\n- Use the gradual cooker for mild heating to keep away from turning the wine syrupy.\n- Make the most of the “stay heat” atmosphere to handle temperature, and test once in a while to stop overheating.\nEnergy: 205 kcal | Carbohydrates: 17 g | Protein: 0.3 g | Fats: 0.2 g | Saturated Fats: 0.05 g | Polyunsaturated Fats: 0.1 g | Monounsaturated Fats: 0.02 g | Trans Fats: 0.003 g | Sodium: 9 mg | Potassium: 192 mg | Fiber: 1 g | Sugar: 12 g | Nutrition A: 10 IU | Nutrition C: 0.3 mg | Calcium: 35 mg | Iron: 1 mg | Web Carbs: 16 g\nDietary information is an estimate and equipped as courtesy.

17	difference between ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 masks	FFP1, FFP2, and FFP3 masks offer different levels of protection. FFP1 masks are basic, filtering up to 80% of particles with maximum 25% leakage, suitable for light DIY tasks. FFP2 masks are more robust, filtering 94% of particles with maximum 11% leakage, commonly used in mining and metal industries. FFP3 masks offer the highest protection, filtering 99% of particles with maximum 5% leakage, suitable for chemical industry and protection against pathogens.	['Regardless of whether you’re a DIY enthusiast or a trade professional, there’s no doubting the fact that you’ll have worn respiratory protection before. From disposable dust masks to full-face respirators, there are dozens of products on the market to protect your lungs.\nThey’re vital too, protecting our lungs from dangerous chemicals, fibres, smoke and more – all of which can cause serious, irrevocable damage to the body. It’s why we wear them.\nThe most commonly worn masks are called filtering facepieces (FFP) and their abilities range, with some protecting only respirable dust, whilst others covering smoke and aqueous fog (aerosols), but do not offer protection from vapour or gas.\nEach conforms to EU norm EN 149, but where the confusion begins in their classification. They’re split into three categories: FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3. But what do these classifications mean? Join us as we explain the difference.\nThe FFP1 classification is reserved for the most basic of filtering facepieces, containing up to 80% of particles measuring up to 0.6 μm. The classification standards demands:\n- Protection from ‘atoxic and non-fibrogenic’ kinds of dust.\n- Inhaling may cause the development of health conditions and can irritate the respiratory system and cause unpleasant odours.\n- Leakage may amount to a maximum of 25%.\n- The mask can be used in an environment which is at most 4-times higher than the occupational exposure limit value (OEL).\nFFP1 respirators are typically used in light DIY tasks like painting, sanding, and light construction. They’re typically used for keeping dust out of the mouth and lungs and are often disposable. You can view our full range of FFP1 respirators here.\nWith significantly more robust levels of protection, FFP2 filtering facepieces contain at least 94% of particles measuring up to 0.6 μm. The classification demands:\n- Protection from firm and fluid deleterious forms of dust, smoke and aerosols.\n- Particles may be fibrogenic, which can irritate the respiratory system in the short term and result in the reduction of elasticity in the pulmonary tissue in the longer term.\n- Total leakage may only amount to a maximum of 11%.\n- The mask can be used in environments with OEL levels 10-times higher than the normal limit.\nAs a result of their increased levels of protection, FFP2 masks are often worn in industries like mining and metal, where exposure to aerosols, fog and smoke is common. You can view our entire range of FFP2 masks here.\nThe highest level of protection offered by a fitted facepiece, FFP3 respirator masks offer exceptional levels of protection from air pollution with a total leakage maximum of 5% and 99% of all particles measuring up to 0.6 μm filtered. The classification demands:\n- Protection from poisonous and deleterious types of dust, smoke and aerosols.\n- Filtration for oncogenic and radioactive substances or pathogens like bacteria, viruses and fungal spores.\n- Total leakage may amount to a maximum of 5%.\n- Suitable for environments with OEL transgression to the thirtyfold value.\nBecause of their advanced and specialised protection, FFP3 respiratory masks are often used in the chemistry industry. View our entire FFP3 range here.\nAnother important factor is fit. We recently took a closer look at Face Fit Testing for protective masks.']	['<urn:uuid:0c96a9b7-556f-4075-8be1-5c99a214d784>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	6	71	538
18	If one server fails, do connections get messed up?	When a traffic manager fails, the failed traffic share is redistributed evenly between the remaining traffic managers, while ensuring the remaining traffic managers don't need to rebalance their own shares. This is done in a stable fashion without requiring any per-connection synchronization or inter-cluster negotiation.	"[""Multi-hosted IP addresses allow the same traffic IP to be hosted on multiple traffic managers at the same time. This can provide benefits to traffic distribution and reduce the number of IPs needed to run a service.\nFor a background on Traffic Manager's Fault Tolerance and Clustering approach, please refer to the document Feature Brief: Clustering and Fault Tolerance in Traffic Manager.\nMulti-hosted IPs make use of multicast MAC addresses. When Traffic Manager observes an ARP for the target traffic IP address, it responds with a multicast MAC address that is calculated based on the value of the multicast IP address used for clustered communications:\nThe upstream switch will relay packets destined to the traffic IP address to that MAC address; because it's a multicast MAC, the switch will learn which nodes are using that MAC address and forward the traffic to each (problems with switches learning the location of MAC address - check out this solution: Why can't users connect to my multi-hosted IPs?).\nThe zcluster kernel module ( Kernel Modules for Linux Software) implements a filter in the hosts TCP stack that partitions the traffic to that traffic IP address and discards all but the host's share of the traffic. The method used to determine the shares that each host takes is stable and guarantees statistically-perfect distribution of traffic. It handles failover gracefully, redistributing the failed traffic share evenly between the remaining traffic managers, while ensuring that the remaining traffic managers don't need to rebalance their own shares to preserve the statistically-perfect distribution, and it does so in a stable fashion that does not require any per-connection synchronization or inter-cluster negotiation.\nSuppose you have 4 traffic managers in a cluster, all listening on the same user-specified IP address. These traffic managers all ARP the same multicast MAC address so the switch forwards all incoming traffic to that IP to all traffic managers.\nThe zcluster kernel module will:\nThis means that every connection is handled by just one traffic manager and connections are evenly distributed (on a statistical basis) between traffic managers.\nIf one or more traffic managers fail, then the distribution method makes three guarantees:\nThis means that the only ‘synchronization’ is the shared view of the health of the cluster (i.e. for the method to be stable, each running traffic manager has the same view as to which traffic managers are running and which are failed). Traffic Manager's health broadcasts ensure that this is the case (apart from possible momentary differences when one or more traffic managers fail or recover).\nSuppose you have four traffic managers, A, B, C and D. They each get 1/4 of the hash space.\nMulti-hosted Traffic IP addresses are useful when you want to ensure even distribution of traffic across a cluster (for example, to spread SSL processing load) or when you have a very limited number of public IP addresses at your disposal.\nThey do replicate ingress traffic across multiple ports in the internal network. The implication of this is that each Traffic Manager needs the same ingress bandwidth as the upstream switch; this is rarely a significant problem.\nThere is a built-in limit of 8 - the maximum number of traffic managers that can be present in a multi-cast traffic IP group.\nUsing Multi-Hosted traffic IP groups with IP transparency to your back-end servers is challenging. You need to configure appropriate source-based routing on each back-end server so that it directs the egress traffic to the correct node in the cluster.""]"	['<urn:uuid:376d490b-e27a-41d7-9fbb-2ea8ab2bba58>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	9	45	581
19	I've noticed my lawn has brown patches despite regular watering - could my sprinkler system be the culprit?	Yes, brown spots are often caused by problems with the sprinkler system. These issues can include improperly spaced sprinkler heads, sunken or tilted heads, or unmatched heads that apply differing amounts of water. Correcting these physical problems with irrigation systems can decrease water waste, reduce water bills, and improve lawn health. Additionally, overwatering with shallow, frequent sprinkling can actually harm the lawn by predisposing turf to diseases and retarding deep root growth. For best results, lawns should be irrigated deeply and not more than twice a week.	['Following good cultural practices is the primary method for managing insect damage to lawns. Growing appropriate grass species for a particular climatic region and providing lawns with proper care are especially important. Practices such as irrigating and fertilizing have a major impact on lawn health. Practices such as thatch removal, choice of mowing height and frequency, and providing grass with more light by pruning tree branches are also important in certain situations. Naturally occurring biological control agents, such as predators and parasites, may limit some insect pests. Most home lawns in California do not need to be treated with pesticides if proper cultural practices are followed. Pesticides should never be applied unless a pest has been identified, is present at damaging levels, and is present in a susceptible life stage. If pesticide applications are necessary, choose IPM-compatible materials (Table 2) that have minimum impacts on beneficial organisms and the environment.\nThe best way to prevent damage from lawn pests is to keep grass healthy. Healthy lawns require few, if any, pesticide applications. Also, if the turfgrass is under stress and a pesticide is applied, it stands a greater chance of suffering phytotoxic damage from the pesticide itself. The UC Guide to Healthy Lawns on the UC IPM web site and the publications on managing your lawn listed in References give detailed information on how to grow a healthy lawn. Table 1 lists cultural practices important for preventing specific problems.\nThere are a number of grasses available for planting in California. These grasses are often referred to as either cool-season grasses (examples include bentgrass, fine fescue, Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass, and tall fescue) or warm-season grasses (bermudagrass, kikuyugrass, St. Augustinegrass, seashore paspalum, zoysiagrass, and buffalograss). Warm-season grasses produce most of their growth during summer and usually have a dormant period when they turn brown during winter. Cool-season grasses are green year-round, but they produce most of their growth in spring and fall. The type of grass and the varieties within each type vary in their shade tolerance, salinity tolerance, water needs, disease resistance, and cultural needs. A formerly thriving lawn variety may decline with changes in light, such as more or less shade caused by growth or removal of nearby trees. These factors are outlined in Turfgrass Selection for the Home Landscape. Selection of the appropriate grass species and variety will allow you to grow a hardy lawn with minimal maintenance inputs.\nInappropriate irrigation is the most common cause of lawn damage. Overwatering (shallow, frequent sprinkling) predisposes turf to diseases, retards deep root growth, and increases lawn susceptibility to stress. Poorly maintained sprinklers can apply too much water in certain spots while underwatering other areas. Brown spots from uneven water applications occur frequently and are often caused by improperly spaced sprinkler heads, sunken or tilted heads, or unmatched heads that apply differing amounts of water. Correcting these physical problems with irrigation systems can decrease water waste significantly, decrease water bills, and, most importantly, improve the health of your lawn. Lawns should be irrigated deeply and not more than twice a week.\nAppropriate fertilization encourages a dense, thick lawn that allows grass to tolerate some insect feeding. The appropriate timing and amount of fertilizer (primarily nitrogen) varies depending on factors including season, grass species, and local growing conditions. In general, most California grasses used for lawns require from 2 to 4 pounds of actual nitrogen over a 1,000 square foot area annually during their active growing season. Some native grasses and drought tolerant species like buffalograss and fine leaf fescue may require less. If grasscycling is practiced (leaving lawn clippings on the lawn after mowing, instead of removing), then the lower rate of nitrogen application may be used.\nKeep the blades on your lawn mower sharp and cut your turf at a mowing height appropriate for that type of lawn grass so as to minimize depletion of food reserves needed to outgrow insect injury. Mowing frequency and height depend on grass species, season, and the particular use of that lawn. Cool-season lawns have suggested mowing heights of 1 1/2 to 3 inches, while warm-season lawns should be mowed to a height of 3/4 to 1 inch. No more than 1/3 of the grass height should be removed at one time.\nLawns also benefit from aeration. To increase water penetration and reduce soil compaction, periodically remove soil plugs using hollow tines. In bluegrass and bermudagrass lawns, thatch (the layer of undecomposed organic material on the soil surface) can build up and result in poor water, fertilizer, and air penetration, as well as provide a protected home for many unwanted pests and pathogens. Presently, most California lawns are planted with tall fescue, which is not as susceptible to thatch buildup as other species. Thatch that is greater than 1/2 inch thick encourages caterpillar and chinch bug populations. Thatch also reduces insecticide efficacy because insecticides cannot penetrate to reach root-feeding insects. Prevent thatch by avoiding excess nitrogen application, irrigating deeply and infrequently, and minimizing the use of broad-spectrum lawn pesticides that can reduce populations of microorganisms responsible for decomposing the thatch. If more than 1/2 inch thick, physically remove thatch with a mechanical dethatcher, vertical mower, or power rake. Other methods (although not as effective in reducing thatch) include topdressing lawns by adding a thin layer (1/8–1/4 inch) of soil and raking or sweeping it into the thatch to encourage decomposer microorganisms. Core aerification also mixes soil into thatch, speeding decomposition.']	['<urn:uuid:7d454374-9e20-4517-8da3-5d1ba6ae751b>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	18	87	906
20	why need home inspection new construction	Home inspections are necessary even for new construction because multiple trade services (including masons, electricians, plumbers, carpenters, roofers) typically work on site briefly before moving to their next job, sometimes compromising quality for speed. Without proper inspection, issues like missing roof tiles, improper electrical work, or mold can go undetected. Professional home inspectors examine the house thoroughly, checking structural components, systems functionality, and potential damages. While builders may discourage inspections and new homes come with warranties, many serious problems often remain undiscovered until it's too late, making inspection a crucial step in protecting the investment.	"[""RSE, residential structural engineer, the difference between a structural engineering report and an unlicensed contractor's evaluation is expertise. Through years of study and licensure, a professional engineer can help identify, evaluate and provide recommendations to homeowners in need of structure or foundation repair.\nIf you’re buying a new home, one of the most important first steps is to have a thorough and accurate inspection of its structural integrity. Many homes appear structurally sound at the exterior but have severe underlying problems that are not detectable to the untrained eye. During the first phase of an inspection, a structural engineer will come to the property to assess the overall condition of the home and its foundation.\nThe engineer will look for spacing between beams and joists to be sure it is of load-bearing capacity. He or she will also look for problems like foundation settling. The engineer will check all load-bearing components in the home to make sure they are constructed and attached properly.\nAfterwards, the professional will generate a report of any existing damage and create a repair plan if necessary. Structural inspections are far more in depth than regular home inspections. Home inspectors merely look at the condition, whereas structural engineers thoroughly examine the foundation, floors, walls, roof, columns, and more. This is an important step you will need before buying your home. Your home is an investment and it’s imperative to know you will be safe there for years to come and that your investment is sound.\nDo I Need an Inspection?\nMany first-time homebuyers do not think of having a structural engineer perform their home inspections. Home inspection is a necessary part of the home buying process, but often people just go with the home inspector recommended to them through the real estate company. Home inspectors usually do not get into the true structure of the home. Instead, these inspectors just do an overall inspection of the workings of the home, like plumbing, electrical wiring, basement flood protection, and other areas.\nMany homebuyers are interested in buying foreclosed homes in today’s market. After all, foreclosed homes can sometimes be a great deal on a home that would otherwise be out of budget. However, foreclosed homes are almost always neglected. When the bank takes over a home, it is not interested in doing any repairs to get it back into shape. Foreclosed houses can sometimes sit on the market for years without any repairs or inspections. During this time, any number of problems can develop and worsen, and the home can rapidly deteriorate.\nWhen the bank tries to sell the home, it usually does not disclose these types of problems, leaving homeowners on their own when things crop up. A structural inspection will tell you the true state of your potential home, so you can be prepared to make necessary repairs, or in severe cases, walk away from the offer.\nThere are a number of different companies that are providing trade services for the builder: site work, masons, electricians, plumbers, carpenters, sheet rockers, roofers, painters etc. These trades people are usually on site for only a few days before moving on to the next work site. They are focused on getting the job done and moving on.... often at the expense of compromising quality.\nUnless you walk the roof, crawl through the attic, pull the breaker panel and know what you are looking for there is a good likelihood that missing roof tile, piggy backed breakers, and black mold will be overlooked. All of these and many more problems have been detected by inspectors of newly constructed homes.\nYes, you should be able to rely on a new home and its warranty, but the fact of the matter is most big problems go undetected.... until it's too late!\nThe builder will make a big case for you not needing an inspection.... now really, why do you think this is?\nPlay it safe and have an inspection or you can always roll the dice!"", 'What do Home Inspectors Do?\nOne of the common contingencies to real estate purchase agreements is a home inspection. Hired by the buyer, an inspector examines the house thoroughly for non-functioning systems, damages, and repairs that may be needed. His detailed report forms the basis for continuing with the purchase, renegotiating the sale price, allowing the seller to make repairs, or for pulling out of the sale. A home inspection is recommended on purchases of new construction as well as re-sales and is a critical component of an escrow timeline.\nStructural Components A home inspector climbs onto the roof, pokes at the foundation, and crawls into attic space looking for water condensation or penetration. On homes in hurricane zones, he’ll examine roof trusses to be sure they’re connected to the frame as per code. Walls are examined for leakage or mold. Floor cracks are noted, as is separation from the baseboards. The ceilings, especially around electrical fixtures, must be clear of any signs of water leakage.\nExterior Faults Close inspection of the exterior may reveal where additional caulking is needed to prevent water seepage. Broken seals on glass, deteriorating tread steps, decking and settlement cracks are a few of the items that require professional repair. Even the garage door is tested whether it’s electronic or manual.\nRoofing The roof is examined closely for loose shingles or tiles, and the flashing is tested for tightness. Tree limbs touching the house provide a passageway for rodents and also can threaten the house during violent storms. Gutter debris is noted, and all drains are tested for a tight connection to the house. Skylights and chimneys also are examined for proper sealants.\nPlumbing All piping is tested, including drains, vents and waste systems. Water ingress and egress is examined, as are the interior fuel and water distributors and the sump pump, if present. All drains are examined for signs of leakage, mineral deposits and the fitting of proper filtering apparatus. Inspectors may test the water for bacteria.\nElectrical All the electrical components are examined to ensure they fit and are operating safely. Conductors, grounding equipment and distribution panels are tested for efficient operation. The location of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors also is noted in the inspection report.\nHeating/Air Conditioning The entire heating and air conditioning system is tested to verify it’s in working condition, and the appropriate filters are examined for accumulation. Supply pipes are examined for corrosion. Chimneys must be clear of bird nests, and the chimney frame, whether it’s brick or made of other components, is to be sound.\nInsulation/Ventilation Attic crawl space insulation and vapor retarders are noted on the inspection report. All venting fans that aren’t working also are included. Under-floor insulation, if accessible through the basement, also is examined for deterioration.\nInteriors/Appliances Doors, floors, stairways, counters, cabinetry, and the number of windows are all cited on the inspection report along with notes on any items that don’t function as they should. This also includes testing of all interior appliances that are built-in or included in the purchase contract.\nTerry Roberts, Broker/Owner']"	['<urn:uuid:24c1c03e-3beb-4852-9ce8-9f6a4d0ea178>', '<urn:uuid:9c49d9b7-b23b-463e-aec1-49bd96d7d8ad>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	6	95	1178
21	how memorial activities differ russia usa war remembrance ceremonies customs	War remembrance ceremonies and customs differ significantly between Russia and the USA. In Russia, commemoration is highly organized and pervasive, featuring eternal flames in most cities with military cadets standing guard year-round, massive military parades in Moscow's Red Square, and widespread ceremonies in every town and village. A notable tradition is the 'Immortal Regiment' movement where people march holding portraits of their ancestors who fought in WWII. In the United States, Memorial Day observances are more decentralized and traditionally involved decorating military graves with flowers, a practice that began after the Civil War. While some Americans maintain these traditional observances, many now treat the day primarily as a leisure holiday, leading to concerns from veterans' groups about the diminishing focus on remembrance.	['Feeling history, 70 years on\nA review of Kriegsgedenken als Event. Der 9. Mai 2015 im postsozialistischen Europa (War memory as an event. May 9th 2015 in post-socialist Europe). Edited by: Mischa Gabowitsch, Cordula Gdaniec, and Ekaterina Makhotina. Publisher: Ferdinand Schöningh, Paderborn, Germany, 2017.\nOn May 9th 1945 the Soviet leader Josef Stalin announced: “Comrades! The Great Patriotic War has ended in our complete victory. The period of war in Europe is over. The period of peaceful development has begun. I congratulate you upon victory, my dear men and women compatriots!” During the late evening of May 8th the German authorities had ratified unconditional surrender and thus sealed the end of the Second World War in Europe. Due to the time difference, it was already May 9th in Moscow, and that date became the official date of Victory Day in the Soviet Union.\nNo other country has ever had so many people involved in military action as the Soviet Union during the Second World War. Today the so-called Great Patriotic War remains one of the main pillars of post-Soviet identity – a symbol used to emphasise the importance of the co-operation between the former Socialist states and to commemorate the deeds of the Red Army. In today’s Russia the cult of the Great Patriotic War and the defeat of Nazi Germany remain omnipresent in society. New publications and movie productions aim to keep this myth alive, while the line between fact and fiction becomes more blurred.\nMay 9th marks the zenith of this memory, and since 1965 it has become the most important national holiday in Russia and in several other post-Soviet states. Today it is the ultimate celebration of the historical significance of the Soviet Union and the Red Army. Military parades – especially the Moscow parade – civil marches and memorial commemorations in schools are an indispensable part of this holiday in Russia and abroad. What seems to be primarily a demonstration of power is an essential, if not the most essential, subject of the post-Soviet politics of memory, which people from different states can identify. For others, it is simply a day to get together for drinks and food, while remembering the legendary actions of their ancestors. In other words, May 9th and its symbolism has become an occasion for the young and old and something that has developed its own spirit beyond the state organised celebrations.\nIn 2012 a new movement called “The Immortal Regiment” emerged and has become an inherent part of the Victory Day Celebrations. Participants in this march hold up portraits and photos of their ancestors who fought in the Second World War. It helps bring their personal history to the symbolic meaning behind the day. During the 70th anniversary of Victory Day in Russia, Vladimir Putin joined the march with a portrait of his father. This collective remembrance has so far been established in 15 other countries. It is evidence of how grassroots memorial practices and state-led events overlap during the May 9th celebrations.\nHow has May 9th and its meaning shaped public spaces around Europe? What are the main differences between the celebrations in different countries? To what extent are the they controlled by state authorities? A recent book published in Germany, Kriegsgedenken als Event (War memory as an event), tries to answer these questions. It is based on research carried out during the 70th anniversary of Victory Day in Belarus, Germany, Estonia, Russia and Ukraine. On May 9th 2015 the authors and field researchers conducted around 500 interviews and collected more than 2,000 press articles. The observations are supported by photos and maps. In contrast to earlier research, the focus of the book is performative memory and the practical realisation of the festivities in each of the countries.\nThe real value of the book, however, lies in its depiction of the Soviet heritage and the way different post-socialists states are dealing with it. It notes the particularities of the five chosen countries and provides a deeper understanding of their present situation. Especially interesting in this regard are the observations from Ukraine, which offers a detailed insight into a society that is affected by war.\nDivided and disrupted\nThe interviews reveal the deep cut and inner conflict of the nation. Moreover, observations from different places throughout Ukraine show a variety of public engagements in historical memory, but also document its changing dynamics in politically tense times. The festivities in Donetsk, for instance, resemble the ones in Russia, while the celebrations in Kyiv are much more based on Ukrainian national symbols. The book gives a background on how the government under President Petro Poroshenko has tried to shift the focus of the celebrations away from its Soviet-shaped meaning and adapt it to the country’s current national and European orientation. In Odesa, on the other hand, the authors face a completely divided population. One visitor, wearing the black and orange St. George Ribbon, is quoted saying: “This is a symbol of victory that has always existed. It expresses honour, victory and heroism. This is a symbol that you cannot just abandon. This is not possible.”\nThe book also shows a photo of a girl in Simferopol, in Crimea, holding up a self-made sign saying: “Thank you, grandpa, for victory! Thank you, Putin, for Crimea!” The observations from Ukraine highlight the difficult future the country faces and the difficulty of finding the right balance between a return to its national, independent roots and the incorporation of its Soviet past. Furthermore, the interviews reveal how strongly people in Ukraine relate their visit of the occasion to the current war in the region. For many, the fact that they experience the reality of war makes this day even more sacred.\nThe May 9th celebrations in Russia are portrayed as a cult that is more like a civil religion of the whole country than a state-organised event. Moreover, they depict a place in which regional initiatives do not necessarily compete, but rather complement each other. Oftentimes these impulses come from small towns and villages that contribute in their own, personal way. One man in Smolensk, for instance, explains why there are no flags during the March of the Immortal Regiment: “The day of victory should be free from politics and party ideology. This day should unite society, not divide it.”\nHowever, contrary to the assumption of this man, the book shows that in almost all of the five countries the occasion is clearly used for political purposes. This is particularly evident in Belarus, where the celebrations are probably the most state-controlled of the five researched countries. According to observations, there is no mix of official and non-official events. Instead, the symbol of the Great Patriotic War is used for political mobilisation and consolidation of loyalty towards Soviet tradition.\nInterpretation and entertainment\nWhile the research in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine focuses more on the practical realisation of remembrance, the research from Estonia and Germany takes a closer look at who is taking part. This question of identity-building seems to be more interesting in regards to the fact that in both cases Russian-speaking groups are a minority – even if a large one, as in the case of Estonia. The authors argue that in both cases specific communities of shared memory have emerged that create their own collective identity and May 9th marks an important event to express this shared identity. Moreover, the book analyses the relations between the post-Soviet and European historical interpretation and the question of sovereignty of interpretation – a topic that is extremely relevant, especially when looking at the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\nThe May 9th commemorations, 70 years after the end of the Second World War, are as important as ever. War memory as an event illustrates that the significance of the celebration lies in the occasion itself. Despite the different historical interpretations between the different post-socialist states, May 9th is also a day for fun and entertainment. In all the five countries, people present their personal relation to the day and create a space for experiencing history. Hence, the experience itself, rather than the actual historical reality of the events, is the focus.\nWar memory as an event presents these different dynamics in a detailed and vivid way. The interviews with participants and photos present a great insight into each country’s relation to May 9th and its Soviet past. In the end, the reader is left wondering about the consequences of an “eventisation” of history that is more about feeling history than dispassionately scrutinising it.\nPaul Toetzke is a freelance journalist and Masters student of East European Studies at the Freie University in Berlin.\nThis review originally appeared in issue 5/2017.

The observance of holidays, and more specifically the importance placed on some celebrations by the community and society as a whole, is just one of the interesting comparisons you can make after having traveled abroad.\nMonday was Memorial Day in the United States. Its a holiday that has been observed on the last Monday in May since 1968 and honors the sacrifice of fallen soldiers. Memorial Day started out in the 1860’s as Decoration Day, a day where family, friends and sympathetic citizens adorned the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers who died in the Civil War with flowers. The tradition was later extended to honor all Americans who died serving in the military and it was officially recognized in Federal law as Memorial Day in1967. While great pride is taken by many to honor the sacrifice made by American soldiers on Memorial Day, there is some controversy surrounding the holiday.\nIn 1968, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act which moved Memorial Day, previously observed on May 30th, and three other Federal holidays from their originally observed dates to specified Mondays in order to create three day weekends. According to some veteran’s groups, in recent years Memorial Day has become more of a holiday than a day of remembrance. Many people appear to have become more occupied with planning camping trips, organizing barbeques and ensuring there is enough ice in the cooler to keep all of the beer cold than actually taking time to stop and remember the sacrifices made by veterans. In 2002, one veteran’s group chided the decision to move Memorial Day stating that:\n“Changing the date merely to create three-day weekends has undermined the very meaning of the day. No doubt, this has contributed a lot to the general public’s nonchalant observance of Memorial Day.”\nThe American media also frequently refers to Memorial Day as the official kickoff of the summer holiday and travel season.\nThe United States isn’t the only country to dedicate a day to remember their fallen heroes. In Russia, May 9th is День Победы or Victory Day, and it commemorates the victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War. This is a massively important day in Russia. National programming is dedicated to honoring the sacrifice of Soviet troops in World War II and sharing stories of their heroism. Nearly every motorist has the signature orange and black victory day ribbon tied to their antennae or hanging from rear view mirror of their vehicle. A massive military parade rolls through Red Square in Moscow and hundreds of thousands of people line the route to catch a glimpse of tanks, rocket launchers and troops marching in perfect unison. Smaller ceremonies take place in every city, town and village throughout Russia, and monuments to fallen heroes, which seem to stand prominently in every square, park and open space, are adorned with extravagant floral bouquets.\nThe importance placed on this day is easily felt and observed. Victory Day is not a day for partying or celebrating the fact that you have the day off work… it is a day of reflection, honor and respect… for everyone. Remembering military sacrifice in Russia is not just a one day event either… in most Russian cities and towns, there is a central monument containing an eternal flame and in some cases, military cadets stand guard over this flame year round.\nI suppose one explanation for the heightened sense of significance I felt watching the Victory Day ceremonies in Russia is the fact that the battles between Soviet and Nazi troops actually took place on Russian soil. These battles took place in the next province, in the next town, just down the street, and in people’s own back yard, so everyone has some connection to and some memory of just how bad the war was and just how significant the sacrifices made by their soldiers were. Human losses in the Soviet Union during WWII were staggering, amounting to nearly 14 percent of the population… an estimated 20-27 million people, of which 9-14 million were soldiers. The chances of a contemporary Russian citizen being related to someone who died in WWII, either civilian or military, are high, so the sense of gratitude and debt on Victory Day is equally high.\nBy comparison, US fatalities in WWII were about 500,000 (less than 0.4 percent of the population), the vast majority were soldiers, but aside from Pearl Harbor, the fighting never really reached US soil, and with the exception of the Civil War, it never really has. As a result, to a large percentage of Americans, WWII may feel distant or even seem insignificant, and there may not be any direct connection or relation to anyone who served in the military or someone who died serving in the military. The same can probably be said for other foreign wars like Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. But just because the battles US troops have engaged in took place on the other side of the world, in places most people have never heard of, it does not mean their sacrifices were any less significant. Witnessing Victory Day in Russia helped me to see that more clearly than I ever had in the past. Maybe for the sake or our fallen troops, it is time we moved Memorial Day back to May 30th so it is not confused with fishing trips, pool parties and Tuesday hangovers.']	['<urn:uuid:32a17844-12b8-46d1-a350-0ec36fdd26ee>', '<urn:uuid:44586864-9abc-456c-8c1f-85b46ac80d78>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	10	122	2391
22	what research shows cognitive benefits exercise older adults memory brain structure compared alcohol effects	Research shows that exercise provides significant cognitive benefits for older adults, while alcohol has more complex effects. Greater cardiorespiratory fitness and regular exercise training are associated with better cognitive function, especially in tasks involving information processing and executive control. Exercise helps preserve brain volume, particularly in the hippocampus, and promotes enhanced neural activation during cognitive tasks. In contrast, while alcohol can temporarily reduce social anxiety by suppressing prefrontal and limbic circuits, it can lead to undesirable effects including increased aggression and impaired judgment. Exercise induces positive changes through mechanisms like neurogenesis and angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels), particularly benefiting memory and cognitive performance in older adults.	"[""The dark side of the 'love hormone'; research points to striking similarities with the effects of alcohol\nResearchers at the University of Birmingham have highlighted significant similarities between the behavioural effects of oxytocin and alcohol.\nThe research, published today in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, draws on existing studies into the two compounds and details the similarities between the effects of alcohol and the ‘love hormone’, oxytocin, on our actions. The team warn that the oft-used nickname hides the darker side of oxytocin, and claim that it bears more semblances with the effects of alcohol than previously thought.\nOxytocin is a neuropeptide hormone produced in the hypothalamus and secreted by the posterior pituitary gland. It has long been established as playing a significant role in childbirth and maternal bonding. More recently it has been identified as a brain chemical with a key role in determining our social interactions and our reactions to romantic partners – hence its nickname of ‘the love hormone’.\nOxytocin increases prosocial behaviours such as altruism, generosity and empathy; while making us more willing to trust others. The socio-cognitive effects come about by suppressing the action of prefrontal and limbic cortical circuits – removing the brakes on social inhibitors such as fear, anxiety and stress.\nDr Ian Mitchell, from the School of Psychology at the University of Birmingham, explained, “We thought it was an area worth exploring, so we pooled existing research into the effects of both oxytocin and alcohol and were struck by the incredible similarities between the two compounds.”\n“They appear to target different receptors within the brain, but cause common actions on GABA transmission in the prefrontal cortex and the limbic structures. These neural circuits control how we perceive stress or anxiety, especially in social situations such as interviews, or perhaps even plucking up the courage to ask somebody on a date. Taking compounds such as oxytocin and alcohol can make these situations seem less daunting.”\nThe team acknowledge that the ability to inhibit anxieties could explain the temptation to summon a little ‘Dutch courage’ – particularly in the context of social situations such a first date. Dr Steven Gillespie said, “The idea of ‘Dutch courage’ – having a drink to overcome nerves – is used to battle those immediate obstacles of fear and anxiety. Oxytocin appears to mirror these effects in the lab.”\nWhen administered nasally, oxytocin appears to closely mirror the well-established effects of alcohol consumption. However the researchers warn against self-medicating with either the hormone or a swift drink to provide a little more confidence in difficult moments.\nAlongside the health concerns that accompany frequent alcohol consumption, there are less desirable socio-cognitive effects that both alcohol and oxytocin can facilitate. People can become more aggressive, more boastful, envious of those they consider to be their competitors, and favour their in-group at the expense of others. The compounds can affect our sense of fear which normally acts to protect us from getting into trouble and we often hear of people taking risks that they otherwise wouldn’t.\nA dose of either compound can further influence how we deal with others by enhancing our perception of trustworthiness, which would further increase the danger of taking unnecessary risks.\nDr Gillespie added, “I don’t think we’ll see a time when oxytocin is used socially as an alternative to alcohol. But it is a fascinating neurochemical and, away from matters of the heart, has a possible use in treatment of psychological and psychiatric conditions. Understanding exactly how it suppresses certain modes of action and alters our behaviour could provide real benefits for a lot of people. Hopefully this research might shed some new light on it and open up avenues we hadn’t yet considered.”\nNotes to editors\nFor interview requests or for more information, please contact Luke Harrison, Media Relations Manager, University of Birmingham on +44 (0)121 414 5134.\nFor out of hours media enquiries, please call: +44 (0) 7789 921 165"", 'In the fields of neuroscience and cognitive science, human cognition is broadly defined as a component of brain function that includes information processing, memory, attention, perception, language, and executive function related to decision making (DM) and the initiation or inhibition of behavior. In the context of sport and exercise psychology, researchers have been interested in the possible benefits of increased leisure-time physical activity (PA) and the performance of acute and chronic exercise on various aspects of cognitive function, from infants to older adults. The focus of this entry is human older adult cognitive function. The effects of exercise training and leisure-time PA on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) derived measures of brain structure and function related to cognitive performance among healthy older adults and those who are at increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia are also discussed.\nAcute and Chronic Exercise in Healthy Adults\nThe performance of a single session of exercise results in improved cognitive performance in healthy younger adults. However, the type, duration, and intensity of the exercise are important, as well as the timing of the cognitive performance during the exercise and after the exercise has ended. In addition, some types of cognitive function improve more than others. During exercise, impairments in cognitive function can occur for complex cognitive tasks, especially during exercise that also may be more cognitively demanding, for example, running compared to stationary cycling. However, evidence for cognitive improvement during exercise may occur for simple tasks that involve rapid DM or require a fast reaction time (RT), and in tasks that are very well learned and, thus, can be performed without much thought or planning. After exercise has ended, improvements in cognitive performance, especially tasks that involve information processing, memory encoding, and memory retrieval, occur over the first 15 minutes and then dissipate thereafter. It is presumed that the heightened physiological arousal during the recovery period contributes to these effects. It is unknown if these effects of acute exercise also occur in healthy older adults or those with cognitive impairments.\nExercise, Physical Activity, and Older Adult Cognition\nAmong healthy older adults, greater levels of cardiorespiratory fitness and periods of exercise training (other than acute bouts) are associated with better cognitive function. These effects are largest for cognitive tasks that involve information processing and executive control, such as attention and performance during a dual task, efficient switching between different types of tasks, DM, and response inhibition.\nThere is some evidence that beneficial effects of exercise on cognitive function are stronger in those who are at genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) allele status is related to risk for Alzheimer’s disease (as well as cardiovascular disease) through its handling of cholesterol. Possession of one or two copies of the apolipoprotein-epsilon4 (APOE-e4) allele increases the risk of future cognitive decline up to 10 times compared to noncarriers of the APOE-e4 allele. However, engaging in moderate levels of leisure time PA substantially reduces the risk of future cognitive decline in APOE-e4 allele carriers, equal to the risk for noncarriers (the other variants being the most common e3 allele, and the protective and less common e2 allele).\nVery little information exists regarding whether these beneficial effects extend to those with existing cognitive impairment. Individuals diagnosed with a very early stage of Alzheimer’s disease, termed mild cognitive impairment, may benefit from exercise training in their ability to perform a semantic fluency task on a day they did not exercise (e.g., naming as many animals or fruits as possible in 30 seconds) but not in tasks that involve episodic memory (e.g., learning a list of words and then being able to later, after doing other tasks, recall that list without any reminders). However, these effects have not been replicated or shown in large samples.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging to Measure Brain Function and Brain Structure\nMRI is a tool that can be used in research to assess brain function and brain structure. There are multiple modalities of MRI that can be used (termed multimodal MR imaging) to assess differences between groups of individuals or the effects of interventions, such as exercise, on brain function. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the most commonly used modality and depends on the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal—derived from differences in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin presumed to reflect oxidative metabolism in nerve cells. The BOLD signal is an indirect, but validated, estimate of relative neuronal activation. The absolute rate of cerebral blood flow can be measured using a MRI technique called arterial spin labeling, and using radioactive contrast agents (e.g., gadolinium) cerebral blood volume can be estimated. Structural information about the brain, such as the volume of gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid compartments of the cerebrum, can also be obtained using MRI. The structural integrity of brain white matter fiber tracts can be measured using a MRI technique called diffusion tensor imaging (also diffusion-weighted imaging), which assesses the diffusion characteristics of water molecules, which in a healthy person are constrained to diffuse along the boundaries of the intact myelinated white matter fiber bundle. Finally, MR spectroscopy can be used to measure the concentrations of certain metabolites or markers of neurotransmitter function in a single voxel (small three-dimensional cubes of brain tissue). The use of MRI in the context of sport and exercise psychology is appealing; however, caution is warranted as very little is known about the physiological effects of exercise on fundamental MRI signals that may occur independently from, but could appear as, alterations in neuronal firing or cerebral blood flow.\nEffects of Physical Activity and Exercise on Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging Outcomes\nAfter robust growth in synaptic connections and brain volume during maturational development, the volume of the brain gradually decreases from roughly the age of 30 years until death. This decline in brain volume contributes to normal age-related cognitive decline, but brain atrophy is accelerated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. There is accumulating evidence that modifiable lifestyle behaviors, such as PA, may help to preserve brain tissue and promote a neural or cognitive reserve, and perhaps the maintenance of cognitive abilities, into old age.\nUsing MRI to examine the structural volume of the brain, several studies have demonstrated the benefits of PA and cardiorespiratory fitness as a method to preserve brain volume. The greatest effects of exercise on brain volume have been shown in the hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe brain region critical to all learning and memory processes; a region that is an early first target of Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology. People who self-report being more physically active, as well as people who possess greater cardiorespiratory fitness, tend to have greater brain volume in several additional brain regions, including the parietal, frontal, prefrontal, and subgenual cortices. Importantly, exercise training may result in an increase in the volume of the hippocampus in healthy older adults. This exercise training effect appears to be stronger in the anterior portion of the hippocampus, which is known to show more severe atrophy in Alzheimer’s disease. Among healthy, cognitively intact, older adults who are at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, greater levels of self-reported PA reduces the risk of future cognitive decline and helps to preserve (but not increase) hippocampal volume over 18 months. However, it is not known if leisure time PA will lead to reduced rates of Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis. In patients previously diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer’s disease, greater cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with greater brain volume. However, it is currently unknown if exercise training will help preserve brain tissue volume over time in older adults diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, or if these effects translate into a slowing of disease progression.\nEvidence from fMRI experiments suggests that PA and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with enhanced patterns of neural activation during executive control and semantic memory tasks. For example, in one study, healthy older adults completed a flanker task during the scan, which consisted of indicating the direction a central target arrow was pointed among flanking arrows that were congruent (>>>>>) or incongruent (>><>>) with the direction of the target. This task involves attention and visual information processing as well as inhibition of motor responses during the more difficult incongruent condition. Older adults who had greater cardiorespiratory fitness and others who had completed a 6-month walking exercise intervention (compared to the less fit and the stretching exercise controls groups, respectively) showed greater activation in areas involved in executive control, including the right middle frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule, and lesser activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region activated in response to unexpected conflict and adaptations to attentional control processes. In another study, older adults completed a famous name discrimination task. In this task, the participant makes a right index finger button press to indicate the name is famous (e.g., Frank Sinatra) and a right middle finger button press to indicate the name is not famous (e.g., Rebecca Hall). Older adults, even those with cognitive impairment, perform the task very well with about 90% accuracy. Only correct trials are included in the analysis in order to remove activation related to errors in memory performance. In the analysis of the brain activation response, a “famous” minus “unfamiliar” metric is calculated in order to remove brain activation related to the common sensory and motor aspects of the two name conditions, thus providing a measure of activation related to semantic memory retrieval. Greater levels of self-reported PA were associated with a greater spatial extent and a greater intensity of neural activation in several brain regions involved in semantic memory. Furthermore, these effects were much greater in the more physically active participants who possessed a genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease with the APOE-e4 allele. Larger effects of PA on brain amyloid levels, measured using positron emission tomography, have also been reported in APOE-e4 allele carriers. Accumulation of amyloid plaque in the brain is a hallmark feature of Alzheimer’s disease, and the early accumulation of brain amyloid is greater in APOE-e4 allele carriers, even prior to any symptoms of memory loss. Physically active APOE-e4 allele carriers showed substantially lower brain amyloid than those who were less physically active, levels that were similar to those who did not possess the genetic risk factor. Thus, exercise and PA may help preserve brain volume in regions involved in memory and executive function and may help preserve the ability to activate these regions to perform cognitive tasks. These effects are hypothesized to provide a cognitive or neural reserve that may provide protection against potential neural insults or neuropathological processes. Despite a genetic disposition to develop Alzheimer’s disease in APOE-e4 allele carriers, PA may promote cognitive resilience and the ability to maintain intact cognitive function and functional independence with age.\nExercise-Induced Angiogenesis and Neurogenesis\nThe possible neurophysiological mechanism(s) for the effects of PA on brain function have been well characterized using animal models. The most well-known finding is that exercise induces neurogenesis, the birth and growth of new nerve cells, in the hippocampus. Exercise in rodents produces increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and BDNF messenger RNA in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. These exercise-induced neurotrophic effects in the hippocampus are hypothesized to contribute to the mnemonic benefits of exercise on memory. An important concomitant of neurogenesis is angiogenesis, the birth and growth of new blood vessels or capillaries, and exercise has been shown to induce angiogenesis in rodent motor cortex. The neurogenic and angiogenic effects of exercise are coupled and likely combine to affect cognitive function. In younger healthy adults, exercise training led increased cerebral blood volume in the dentate gyrus, an effect also observed in mice along with markers of hippocampal neurogenesis. Importantly, these effects are related to improved memory performance.\n- Colcombe, S. J., Kramer, A. F., Erickson, K. I., Scalf, P., McAuley, E., Cohen, N. J., et al. (2004).

23	how does china reduce air pollution and what renewable energy solutions can reduce environmental impact like cryptocurrency mining	China has implemented several measures to reduce air pollution. Since 2013, they've established carbon markets, replaced coal power plants with natural gas plants, and aimed to cap coal use at 62% of total energy consumption by 2020. They've also developed technological solutions like the Smog Free Tower in Beijing, which filters 30,000 cubic meters of air per hour using ion technology, and the Breathe Brick system that captures up to 100% of large air particles. Regarding renewable energy solutions, using solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can significantly reduce environmental impact. Some cryptocurrency mining companies are already transitioning to renewable energy sources, with companies like Square committing to carbon neutrality by 2030. Additionally, implementing proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms instead of traditional mining can substantially reduce energy consumption in cryptocurrency operations.	['As many cities and countries around the world grow and develop, many turn towards mass industrialization, hoping that in following the footsteps of the ‘world superpowers’, they too can become a strong nation. The cause for this mass industrialization is strongly tied to a deeply rooted misconception that development is synonymous to rapid economic growth; and since rapid economic growth can most easily be achieved by mass production, many rising and developing countries have turned towards industrialization.\nOne such country is China.\nIn 1978, Deng Xiaoping enacted the new Open Door Policy in an attempt to provide a catalyst for China’s economic growth. And it worked – due to a combination of low labor costs and loose industrial regulations, foreign companies flocked to China to greatly increase their credit margin; and as the factories went up, so did the power plants to fuel them; and as a developing country referencing the industrial histories of modern superpowers, what cheaper, quicker, and dirtier of a power source to turn to than coal.\nThrough the next few decades, we see that China’s economy has more than quadrupled. Since the 1950s, China has more than doubled its population from 600, to over 1350 million despite the one-child policy.\nFollowing western history, China also grew a large automotive industry, and car ownership soared. Paired together with years of building under-regulated factories and cheap coal plants, China is dealing with heavy fallout to do with extreme air pollution. This pollution has been estimated to cause between 1.2 and 1.6 million deaths a year, as small particles in the air are known to cause cancer, pulmonary issues, and cardiac problems. In the past years, the pollution and smog has become such a big issue that schools are closed down and planes remain grounded.\n01_China’s “Airpocalypse” of 2013\nWith most of China powered by coal and its streets dominated by motor vehicles, heavy smog settled on China’s capital of Beijing in January 2013. When measured on the globally standardized Air Quality Index (AQI), Beijing measured in at almost 800 on a scale where 100 is deemed unhealthy and 400 extremely hazardous. What made this pollution even worse was that it was comprised of relatively high concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 particles, irritants and particles so small they can easily be inhaled and are known to cause a plethora of terminal illnesses. The concentration of these particles was measured at 900μg per m3, 40x the level the World Health Organization (WHO) deems safe.\nIt is important to note that this was by no means an isolated incident. Building up to and after this incident, many cities in China (Beijing included) have had ‘red alert’ days, days where the smog is so bad that schools are cancelled and students and young adults are encouraged to stay indoors. In 2014, Beijing was over-polluted 175 days in the year; in Tianjin, 197 days; Shenyang, 152 days; Shijiazhuang, 264 days… the list goes on.\nIt is unfair however, to say that China has done nothing to ameliorate the issue. Since 2013, total reported Carbon Dioxide emissions for China has been on the decline. From establishing its first carbon market shortly after the “airpocalypse” was internationally publicized in 2013, to phasing out the four main coal power plants in Beijing and replacing them with NG plants, China has definitely shown at least some willingness to make changes in their economy to curb their ever-worsening environmental issues.\nHowever it is also valid to question the true intents of the country. Although having halted the construction of various coal power and heating plants throughout the Hubei provinces, China began to build a series of coal plants in order to accommodate for a large influx of heavy industry, primarily to meet the international demand of steel. This perhaps goes to show that China still plans to push and strongly back its economic agenda, sacrificing the environment to do so. As such, it is important to note that the pollution issue in Beijing has yet to be resolved.\n|A Diagram showing the number and location of Coal Fired Power Plants in and around China|\nIn China’s energy plans published at the end of 2014, it plans to cap coal use to 62% of its total primary energy consumption (66% in 2012) by 2020. The country also plans on increasing its Natural Gas use by 5% up to 10% in the same time frame. In addition, the country’s plans forward aim to raise non-fossil-fuel energy consumption to 15% (compared to its 2012 ~10%). Is this going to be enough?\nLooking at China’s behavior, it is apparent that the country does not intend to sacrifice economic growth for environmental protection. As such, we have used a polynomial curve to approximate the energy consumption of China in the year 2020. This value would be around 7000TWh. So the question is… if 10% of that was generated by NGCC and 62% by coal, how many Tonnes of carbon dioxide would China produce in 2020?\nNGCC (2.52 x 1012MJ):\nEfficiency = 40%+60%(35%) ≈ 60% efficient\nif burning 1MJ of NG creates 15g(C),\nthen it creates 15 x (44/12) g(CO2)/MJ≈ 55 g(CO2)/MJ\n[55 g(CO2)/MJ] /60% x (2.52 x 1012MJ) ≈ 2.31 x 1011kg(CO2)\nCoal (1.56 x 1013MJ):\nEfficiency = 35%\nif burning 1MJ of Coal produces 25g(C),\nthen it creates 25 x (44/12) g(CO2)/MJ ≈ 92 g(CO2)/MJ\n[92 g(CO2)/MJ] /35% x (1.56 x 1013 MJ) ≈ 4.10×1012 kg(CO2)\nTotal CO2 = 4.33 x 1012 kg = 4.33 Gt\nAlthough its a significant improvement from its current emissions, this is still a significant amount of Carbon Dioxide, especially when you take into account that in most modern economies, less than 50% of Carbon Dioxide emissions originate from electricity generation (for China it is probably even less due to its industrial-focused economy).\nMoreover, whatever is done to moderate the amount of Carbon Dioxide emitted in future years fails to address the current most pressing issue: the amount of Carbon Dioxide already existing in areas all over China, which poses as both social issues and health concerns.\nPopulation of China: 1.38 billion\nLife Expectancy: 74 (Male, 2013), 77 (Female, 2013)\nInfant mortality rate: 9.5/1000\nOfficial Language: mandarin\nThe population pyramid (shown left) is reflects the unique age distribution of China. Due to its one-child policy enacted in 1979, there is currently a sizable working class, though the next generation will be lacking in comparison. This issue is further affected by the fact that due to the high amount of pollutants in the air, many children die or are affected by respiratory illnesses, possibly inhibiting their ability to work in the future. As such, it is quite reasonable to say perhaps that due to all the pollutants int he air, China is sacrificing its economy of the future for rapid economic development in the current time frame.\n|Beijing on a ‘red pollution warning day’ vs. ‘good day’|\nAs explained above, high levels of pollution brings with it a plethora of economic, societal, and environmental detriments, including various illnesses leading to a decrease in numbers in the working class, possibly harming a country’s economy and production. Although since China seems adamant to continue its economic growth through strong industrial means, the issue must be solved on three fronts:\n- Future Management through Policy: cutting down Carbon Dioxide emissions at the source, investing more into renewable sources or strengthening regulations so fossil fuel plants and factories emit less Carbon Dioxide into the air. This process has been started by the government, as explained above, though whether they are doing enough is a good question.\n- Fixing the Present: As explained above, China has already polluted strongly many areas all over the nation, concentrated in the north due to clumps of industry. Alleviating air pollution issues by cleaning and filtering polluted air will create a better living environment, preventing illnesses from developing.\n- A More Sustainable Future: Assuming China will continue to grow and expand its economy (especially with the phasing out of the One Child Policy), future developments, cities, and industrial zones should be developed with sustainability in mind, minimizing the amount of indirect and direct carbon missions through good design: minimizing energy use on the home scale, and providing natural environments to sequester carbon on the city and regional scales.\nThrough research, we’ve come up with various solutions to each of these issues, developing better living environments for those living in China.\na) Carmen Trudell’s Breathe Brick\n|Different methods in which air can be drawn into a building with a breathe-brick wall.|\n|Modular Design: how breathe bricks can efficiently stack to form an insinuative load bearing wall.|\nThe product would be easy to construct and without without electricity for developing countries to use as part of their building strategies. The Breath Brick is inspired by vacuum cleaners that spin air through a vortex to separate particles. It is basically a cyclone inside a wall that allows for particles to settle in before air is pushed into the building envelope and supply it to the HVAC system or into the building directly. Cal Poly engineering students constructed a test wall of the Breathe brick and blasted cornstarch and flower against the prototype. The units captured 30% of the fine particles (2.5 microns or smaller) and 100% of the course particles (10 microns and larger).\nb) Daan Roosegaarde’s Smog Free Tower\n|The Smog Tower – currently being tested in Beijing. It uses Ionic charges to filter carbon and small particulate matter out of the air.|\nAnother technological invention to clean air is Daan Roosegaarde’s smog free tower, which has been implemented in Beijing and supported by China’s ministry for Environmental Protection. The Tower uses ion technology to filter out smog. It cleans 30,000 cubic meters of air per hour and runs on green wind energy, using only around 1170 Watts. Additionally, limited edition rings made of the particulates filtered, are sold to spread public awareness of the importance of clean air. Though the invention has minuscule physical impact on overall air quality in China, it makes a statement that demands for political change and regulations that could be implemented to regulate emissions.\nc) Zero Energy Buildings\n|Environmental Design Strategies – Designing a net zero building|\nBuilding with the amount of energy used is equal to the amount of renewable energy produced onsite. As shown in the diagram above, this issue is often tackled on two fronts: firstly minimizing the amount of operational energy required to run the building, then producing energy on site through use of small wind turbines, Photo Voltaic panels, etc. This lowers the load on fossil fuel power plants, minimizing the amount of coal they have to burn and thus the amount of carbon dioxide they emit.\nd) Governmental Responses\nThough these building technologies are helpful in mediating poor air quality, bigger change must come from societal responses. This means direct change from governmental regulation of business’ CO2 emissions. China must become stricter with fining businesses for releasing harmful chemicals into the air and creating a cap amount of total CO2 emissions allowed per businesses. Additionally, businesses must filter our particulate matter from the emission source for maximum efficiency. Regulations must enforce factories to filter exhaust air and maintain a standard for how clean that exhaust air has to be. Tackling the problem from the root source is the most efficient way in permanently stopping air pollution.\nSarah Pagan is a third year architecture major and sustainable environments minor. She is interested in net positive and living buildings. She is originally from San Jose, California, but will be studying abroad in Florence for ten months next year.\nHelen Hoang is a third year architecture student and is from San Jose, California. She is interested in alternative energy sources to fossil fuels. Her hobbies include gardening, art, and cooking.\nCharles Lam is a third year architecture student pursuing an architectural engineering minor. Being from Hong Kong, a huge metropolitan hub on the South-eastern coast of China, he is extremely interested in how cities can develop and grow without creating a polluting environment. His studies in architecture have brought him closer to understanding net-zero, or even ‘negative energy buildings’, which produces far more than they consume. Charles has strong interests in all things design, and is currently extremely interested in green cities, walkable cities, and city planning concepts in general.\nDerek Klein is a 5th year general engineering major concentrating in alternative energy. He is interested in wind energy. From San Diego California he likes to play tennis, basketball, and piano in his free time.\nAverage sulfate, carbon monoxide and black carbon concentrations went down by 0.3% to 0.9% when looking at population-weighted averages. But this all comes at a cost: In the western United States and populous Chinese regions, air quality went down.\nBlack carbon has been linked to asthma as well as diseases such as cancer, emphysema, and heart and lung disease. Rain doesn’t easily clear it from the atmosphere, so it hangs around and travels far.\nResearchers found that 36% of anthropogenic sulfur dioxide, 27% of nitrogen oxides, 22% of carbon monoxide and 17% of black carbon from Chinese emissions were linked to producing goods for export.\nAbout 21% of export-related emissions from China, for each of these pollutants, came from exports that went from China to the United States.\nHowever these pollutants emitted by china, although unlikely to cause disease in the United States, will add to the issue of global warming, affecting all who inhabit our earth.\nXX_ Sources Referenced', 'As the world becomes more conscious of sustainability, the environmental impact of industries and businesses is under the microscope. Cryptocurrency is one of the newer and rapidly evolving industries that has been called out for its high energy consumption and carbon footprint. However, the cryptocurrency sector is also built on innovation, decentralization, and financial democratization. The challenge is to balance these two seemingly opposing goals – sustainability and innovation. In this article, we will explore the environmental concerns of cryptocurrency and ways to mitigate its impact while continuing to promote its benefits.\nRead more: Silvergate Collapse Dragging Down Bitcoin Volume\nCryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses encryption techniques to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds. It is decentralized and operates on a peer-to-peer network that enables secure, fast, and anonymous transactions. Cryptocurrency has gained popularity in recent years, with bitcoin being the most well-known example. However, the process of generating cryptocurrency, known as mining, requires significant computational power, which consumes a massive amount of energy.\nThe amount of energy consumed by cryptocurrency mining has sparked concerns about its environmental impact. According to a 2021 report by the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the annual energy consumption of bitcoin mining alone is estimated to be around 128.84 TWh, which is more than the energy consumption of Argentina. The high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, as the majority of the energy used comes from non-renewable sources like coal and natural gas.\nThe Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency\nCryptocurrency mining is a highly energy-intensive process that requires specialized computer equipment and software. The process involves solving complex mathematical problems to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The first miner to solve the puzzle is rewarded with a certain amount of cryptocurrency.\nTo mine cryptocurrency, miners need to use powerful computers, which consume a considerable amount of energy. The energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is a function of the computing power used and the time it takes to solve the problem. As the difficulty of the problem increases, more computing power is required, which leads to a higher energy consumption.\nThe high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has a significant impact on the environment. Most of the energy used to power cryptocurrency mining comes from non-renewable sources like coal and natural gas. The combustion of fossil fuels leads to the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming and climate change. The increase in greenhouse gas emissions from cryptocurrency mining is a concern as it undermines global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.\nMitigating the Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency\nThe environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining can be mitigated by adopting sustainable practices. Some of the ways to reduce the energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining are:\nUsing renewable energy sources: One of the most effective ways to reduce the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining is to use renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Some cryptocurrency mining companies are already using renewable energy to power their operations. For example, the cryptocurrency mining company, Square, has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030.\nDeveloping energy-efficient mining equipment: Cryptocurrency mining companies can reduce their energy consumption by developing energy-efficient mining equipment. For example, some companies are developing ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that are designed to consume less energy than traditional computer processors.\nImplementing proof-of-stake consensus mechanism: Another way to reduce the energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is to implement the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Proof-of-stake is an alternative to proof-of-work, which is the current consensus mechanism used by most cryptocurrencies. Proof-of-stake does not require miners to solve complex mathematical problems to verify transactions. Instead, it relies on a random selection process to choose a validator who is responsible for verifying transactions. Validators are required to hold a certain amount of cryptocurrency, which acts as a stake. If a validator acts maliciously, their stake is forfeited. The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is less energy-intensive than proof-of-work, making it a more sustainable alternative.\nCarbon offsetting: Cryptocurrency mining companies can offset their carbon emissions by investing in renewable energy projects or purchasing carbon credits. Carbon offsetting is a way to neutralize the carbon emissions associated with cryptocurrency mining by investing in sustainable projects that reduce carbon emissions.\nBalancing Sustainability and Innovation\nCryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry by providing financial democratization and decentralization. However, this cannot come at the expense of the environment. The challenge is to balance sustainability with innovation. The cryptocurrency industry needs to take responsibility for its environmental impact and take steps to mitigate its carbon footprint. It is essential to recognize that sustainability and innovation are not mutually exclusive goals, but rather complementary.\nSustainability is a key factor in the long-term success of cryptocurrency. As the world becomes more conscious of the environment, consumers are looking for sustainable products and services. The cryptocurrency industry needs to recognize this trend and take steps to reduce its carbon footprint. By adopting sustainable practices, the cryptocurrency industry can attract a more environmentally conscious audience.\nCryptocurrency has the potential to transform the financial industry by providing financial democratization and decentralization. However, the high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has sparked concerns about its environmental impact. To balance sustainability and innovation, the cryptocurrency industry needs to take responsibility for its carbon footprint and adopt sustainable practices. By using renewable energy sources, developing energy-efficient mining equipment, implementing proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and carbon offsetting, the cryptocurrency industry can mitigate its environmental impact. Sustainability is not a trade-off for innovation, but rather a complementary goal that is essential for the long-term success of the cryptocurrency industry.']	['<urn:uuid:ad472306-8fa9-4f04-9241-63a81ba84e22>', '<urn:uuid:16d423b7-32cb-493a-822d-c068233478c4>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	18	128	3202
24	What happens if servers fail and how is traffic managed?	When servers fail, load balancers detect the problem and automatically divert requests to other working servers, reducing error responses that clients might see. For traffic management, incoming requests can be distributed with different weights favoring certain connections over others. Additionally, session persistence ensures that a client's requests go to the same server, which is important for applications that store state information. The system can be made flexible and scalable since clients only see the reverse proxy's IP address, allowing infrastructure changes without affecting users.	['This article presents a straightforward approach to Dual WAN Load Balancing and Failover with Linux (using multiple independent internet connections on one system). While the examples provided are for multiple ethernet connections, they could easily apply to a mixed ethernet/wireless system with some minor changes.\nNote: Load balancing doesn’t increase connection speed for a single connection. Its benefits are realized over multiple connections like in an office environment. The benefits of fail-over are however realized even in a single user environment.\nFor fail over the best approach is to use a user space script to monitor connections and dynamically change routing information.\nIn this example, I have a 5Mbps Cable connection via ROL on eth0, and a 2Mbps ADSL2 connection via Dhiraagu on eth1. And my local Connection On eth2\n- eth1 – IP 172.16.0.100 / Gateway 172.16.0.1\n- eth2 – IP 10.1.0.100 / Gateway 10.1.0.1\n- eth2 – IP 192.168.0.1\nFirst, we need to add two lines to /etc/iproute2/rt_tables\nAnd then set up the routing for those tables.\nip route add 172.16.0.0/24 dev eth0 src 172.16.0.100 table ROL\nip route add default via 172.16.0.1 table ROL\nip route add 10.1.0.0/24 dev eth1 src 10.1.0.100 table DHIRAAGU\nip route add default via 10.1.0.1 table DHIRAAGU\nip rule add from 172.16.0.100 table ROL\nip rule add from 10.1.0.100 table DHIRAAGU\nTraffic evenly Divided upon both interfaces.\nip route add default scope global nexthop via 172.16.0.1 dev eth0 weight 1 nexthop via 10.1.0.1 dev eth1 weight 1\nIn addition to the normal setup here, we can weight the interfaces differently, to favour one over the other (useful in my case cause in my scenario ROL bandwidth is higher then Dhiraagu ).\nip route add default scope global nexthop via\ndev eth1 weight 2 nexthop via\ndev eth2 weight 3\nIn the case of IP-bound services (Site’s Like Bankofmaldives , which does not allow simultaneous connections from different IPs), a static route is simple to configure:\nip route add 220.127.116.11 via 172.16.0.1\nIf one of your ISP blocks DNS queries from non-subscribers, then you will need to make sure that your primary DNS server is ISP-agnostic. Google Public DNS is a great solution for this. Add the following entries to /etc/resolv.conf:\nTo setup fail-over\nDownload the script which checks for and provides fail-over over dual Wan connections and save it to /usr/sbin directory (or any other directory which is mounted available while loading the OS).\nChange the file permissions to 755:\nchmod 755 /usr/sbin/gwping\nChange the flowing\nIP Address or domain name to ping. The script relies on the domain being pingable and always available\nPing timeout in seconds\nIP address of external interfaces. This is not the gateway address.\nGateway IP addresses. This is the first (hop) gateway, could be your router IP\naddress if it has been configured as the gateway\n# Relative weights of routes.\nBroadband providers name; use your own names here.\nNo of repeats of success or failure before changing status of connection\nAdd the following line to the end of /etc/rc.local file:', 'Load balancers and reverse proxy servers are elements in a server-client computing architecture. They act as intermediary in communication between the servers and clients, executing functions that boost efficiency.\nHow Are They Defined?\nA Load Balancer allocates incoming client requests among a server group, reverting the response from the server to the client.\nOn the other hand, a reverse proxy recieves client request, forwarding it to server for fulfillment, and returning the reply to the client.\nBoth of these may sound similar in a way they function, being an application between client and server. Let us see for what purpose they are used at a website.\nWhen a website needs a number of servers, given the volume of request being too high for an individual server to leverage, load balancers are commonly used. One point of failure is also eliminated by deploying multiple servers, and the main purpose of load balancer is to allocate the work load in a manner that makes the best possible use of server’s capacity, preventing overload on a server and resulting in quick response to client.\nA load balancer can significantly improve the experience of an end-user by reducing error responses that a client can see. This is done by sensing when the servers go down, and the request is diverted to other servers. In a simple implementation, load balancer does the job of detecting the health of the server by diverting error responses.\nSession persistence is one another valuable function of load balancers. It means sending requests from a client to a server. Several applications must be storing their state information to offer core functionality, however, they can possibly falter in a load-balancing environment, if the balancer allocates requests to different servers.\nWith just application server or web server, you can deploy a reverse proxy. It is a public face of the website, and it sits at the network’s edge for accepting requests from apps and browsers for the resources hosted at the site. Reverse proxies have two-fold benefits:\n- Increased Flexibility And Scalability: You can change the configuration of your infrastructure, since the clients can only see the IP address of the reverse proxy. This is quite valuable in a load-balancing environment, where you can scale the servers to match volume fluctuations.\n- Enhanced Security: No details about backend server is detectible outside internal network, so suspicious clients can’t access them to exploit vulnerabilities. Many servers incorporate features that assist in protecting backend servers from DDoS outbreaks, for instance by confining the number of connections received from clients and rejecting traffic from particular IP addresses.\n- Web Acceleration: Deployment of a reverse proxy also reduces time to generate response and return it to client. One of the techniques include caching, in which the reverse proxy stores a local copy, before returning the response of the backend server to the client. So, in place of forwarding the request to backend server, the reverse proxy can offer the response itself from the cache. It reduces the load on backend server and decreases client response time.']	['<urn:uuid:b1a45a27-8283-43a9-9e7d-d0973cc23757>', '<urn:uuid:591d8daa-54f2-4afe-bb7d-e21157f09b0f>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	10	84	1015

26	as researcher studying brain signals comparison biomotion point light displays versus local field potential electrode measurements which more effective detecting motion patterns	Both methods are effective but serve different purposes. Point-light displays are used to study visual perception of biological motion, allowing observers to recognize gender, age, emotions from just a few moving dots on joints. Local field potential (LFP) electrode measurements, on the other hand, directly measure electrical activity in the brain, with electrodes able to detect signals from nerve cells within about 0.3 millimeters when cells fire randomly, or from a wider range when cells fire in sync. While point-light displays focus on external motion observation, LFP measurements provide detailed internal brain activity data that can be used for diagnosing conditions and potentially controlling prosthetic devices.	"['Gender. Age. Weight. Emotion. Personality.\nAll of these factors affect how we move.\nDr. Nikolaus Troje has spent large parts of his career studying biological motion and how little visual information we actually need to recognize activity.\n“Biological motion is fascinating,” says Troje, a professor in the Department of Biology and the Centre for Vision Research at York University.\n“There’s an ease by which the visual human system fills in information and recognizes whether they’re male or female, young or old, happy or sad. The changes are very, very minute and yet your visual system picks them up with precision and interprets them with expertise.”\nThe applications for Troje’s research are varied and can be applied in fields that include computer animation, neurological diseases, psychological therapy and safety.\nCan you tell me a little about yourself?\nI am just in the process of moving my lab, students and office to York University in Toronto. I spent the past 15 years at Queen’s University and it was very good.\nBut this new position at York’s Centre for Vision Research provides a more interesting research environment, and it comes with a reduced teaching and administrative load. I’m looking forward to the change. Change is good for us, I think.\nWhat is biomotion?\nIt was originally called biological motion when the concept was first introduced in the mid-70s. Back then, you would put people in a dark room with dark clothing. When filming them, the only thing you could see were small point lights attached to 10 or 15 points. In a still frame you would see just a random array of dots, but the moment the movie is set into motion you can’t help seeing a person in action. You can even recognize gender, age, emotions and personality traits from these point-light displays. Biomotion is a powerful example of how little visual input we need in order to see a lot.\nHow did you become interested in biomotion?\nThe main question for me is how come – given that the sensory information that reaches our brain is noisy and riddled with messy physiology – that the world that we experience feels so predictable, solid and, therefore, “real.” Biomotion is a very, very good example to demonstrate and study how the brain, and specifically how our visual system, organizes this flow of sparse, incomplete incoming information and turns it into something rich and real that we can work with.\nWhat have been your contributions?\nI entered the field in 1999. There wasn’t much interest in biological motion research at that time. I started using a new technology called motion capture. You see it everywhere today, but it was brand new at that time.\nMy lab was the first to systematically collect motion data to investigate walking behaviour and to study the differences in walking style that characterize individual people. We then developed methods that would allow us to identify and quantify the subtle variations in walking behaviour that are characteristic for biological attributes, emotions and personality traits.\nIn designing perceptual studies, we often use so called point-light displays: In these displays we represent a human in motion just by a few dots that move as if they were attached to the main joints of the body.\nOne study that is particular interesting for the safety industry showed that people derive intention and a sense of animacy from these point-light displays even if the moving dots are randomly scrambled up. An observer wouldn’t be able to make out the human shape, but can still derive the direction in which someone is oriented. Observers also have the clear perception of seeing something that is alive.\nHow does that look?\nYou can see a demonstration on my lab’s website, using a human or cat or pigeon. The dots are on the main joints of people and allow you to reconstruct the form.\nPeople are very good in sensing the direction of the person or the pigeon even after clicking the “scramble” button, which will randomize the location of the moving dots. Now, the interesting observation is that this clear sense of animacy and the ability to see intended walking direction is no longer visible when the display is turned upside down.\nIt turned out that the critical information that conveys animacy and implied direction is in the motion of the feet: As long they show signs of gravitational acceleration then an automatic detection system kicks into place which tells your brain you might be dealing with something that is alive. We therefore called this neural mechanism the brain’s “life detector.”\nHow do we learn about the life detector?\nIt’s an inborn, hereditary trait. Experiments have shown that newborn babies respond already.\nThe feet grab your attention, the degree to which you respond is genetically determined. It speaks to the evolutionary nature of how people respond to the way a moving animal (or other human, for that matter) responds to gravity when moving efficiently.\nThe life detector sets an alarm which tells us that something interesting is going on in our visual environment that requires further inspection. It works in our visual periphery, too, and guides our attention.\nHow does your work apply in the safety area?\nThis interests people who work in safety as it informs engineers where to put reflective materials when designing safety clothing. Doing it right means to utilize our old, innate ability to respond to the gravitational acceleration of the feet.\nWhat would be your No. 1 piece of advice for safety officers?\nFor pedestrians, the most important place to put safety tape is on the feet or the ankles.\nWhat about for vehicles?\nPlacing markers on a wheel of a car or bicycle generates visual motion which is always good, but it wouldn’t trigger the very efficient life detector system because the motion is not affected by gravitational acceleration.\nI think there might be ways to bring that back into the game but that would require detailed knowledge about what the most adequate stimulus is that triggers the life detector.\nAre there real-life examples?\nHunters will tell you that it’s your foot fall that scares away animals. Some will still recommend wearing long coats that disguise the motion of legs and feet. If you want to see wildlife you can get much closer in a canoe or on a bicycle or in a car. The minute you put your feet on the ground and move them under conditions in which gravitational acceleration plays out, animals will run away or fly away. The fact that animals as well as humans respond to these visual invariants means that it is based on an evolutionarily old mechanism.\nStalking behaviour in animals is also characterized by avoiding accelerated foot fall. Feet are lowered gently, not just to avoid sound, but mainly to avoid triggering the life detection system.\nHow does biomotion work with computer animation?\nWhen computer animation meant to make aliens, monsters and cartoon characters, getting the details of motion right wasn’t a big issue. Today, we find many applications in which computer animation replaces a real actor in a stunt. The intention is to get it real enough so that the audience doesn’t even notice that an animation replaces the real person.\nIn order to fool the human visual system into believing that it sees a real person, we have to understand what it knows about real motion. An interesting area into which I am currently moving my research addresses the question how the details of human motion depend on body shape and the way weight is distributed over the body.\nIf you take the motion from one person and apply it to another it doesn’t necessarily look right. We’re working now to find out what the relationships are between body motion and body shape, what the human visual system knows about these relations, and where it tolerates deviations from such relations.\nWhat about in the neurology field?\nMany neurological diseases go along with changes in the way you move. An experienced neurologist can tell whether a person is developing Parkinson’s disease from the way they walk. Our techniques can be used to develop tools for the early diagnosis of neurological disorders.\nWhat applications are there in mental health?\nThere are therapeutic uses — when you’re depressed you walk differently. We measure that quantitatively and describe what those changes are.\nThere are relations between your mental state and the way you move. The interesting finding is that causal relationships go both ways. If we induce a person to walk as if they are more happy, they start feeling more happy.\nWhat is next for you?\nWe are moving away from point-light displays and looking at not just motion but body shape. We’ll be looking at other sources of visual information used for people perception, which includes body shape and how body motion interacts with body shape.\nWe’re also starting to use a lot of virtual reality for research and using the head-mounted displays to see people in front of you and around you. VR works very well on applied work; when and how you see people in the dark, for example.\nThe eighth annual Davey Protective Clothing Systems for Safety seminar will be held Nov. 5 – 6 in Edmonton. Full information at www.daveyseminar.com\nBarb Wilkinson is a freelance writer and editor based in Edmonton', 'Tapping the brain orchestra\nJülich, Norge, 19 December 2011 - Researchers at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (UMB) and Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany have developed a new method for detailed analyses of electrical activity in the brain. The method, recently published in Neuron, can help doctors and researchers to better interpret brain cell signals. In turn, this may lead to considerable steps forward in terms of interpreting for example EEG measurements, making diagnoses and treatment of various brain illnesses.\nResearchers and doctors have been measuring and interpreting electrical activity generated by brain cells since 1875. Doctors have over the years acquired considerable practical skills in relating signal shapes to different brain illnesses such as epilepsy. However, doctors have so far had little knowledge on how these signals are formed in the network of nerve cells.\n""Based on methods from physics, mathematics and informatics, as well as computational power from the Stallo supercomputer in Tromsø, we have developed detailed mathematical models revealing the connection between nerve cell activity and the electrical signal recorded by an electrode,"" says Professor Gaute Einevoll at the Department of Mathematical Sciences and Technology (IMT) at UMB.\nMicrophone in a crowd\nThe problem of interpreting electrical signals measured by electrodes in the brain is similar to that of interpreting sound signals measures by a microphone in a crowd of people. Just like people sometimes all talk at once, nerve cells are also sending signals ""on top of each other"".\nThe electrode records the sounds from the whole orchestra of nerve cells surrounding it and there are numerous contributors. One cubic millimetre can contain as many as 100,000 nerve cells.\nTreble and bass\nSimilar to bass and treble in a soundtrack, high and low frequency electrical signals are distinguished in the brain.\n""This project has focused on the bass - the low frequency signals called ""local field potential"" or simply LFP. We have found that if nerve cells are babbling randomly on top of each other and out of sync, the electrode\'s reach is narrow so that it can only receive signals from nerve cells less than about 0.3 millimetres away. However, when nerve cells are speaking simultaneously and in sync, the range can be much wider,"" Einevoll says.\nLarge treatment potential\nBetter understanding of the electrical brain signals may directly influence diagnosing and treatment of illnesses such as epilepsy.\n""Electrodes are already being used to measure brain cell activity related to seizures in epilepsy patients, as well as planning surgical procedures. In the future, LFP signals measured by implanted electrodes could detect an impending epilepsy seizure and stop it by injecting a suitable electrical current,"" Einevoll says.\n""A similar technique is being used on many Parkinson\'s patients, who have had electrodes surgically implanted to prevent trembling,"" Researcher Klas Pettersen at UMB adds.\nEinevoll and Pettersen also outline treatment of patients paralysed by spinal cord fracture as another potential area where the method can be used.\n""When a patient is paralysed, nerve cells in the cerebral cortex continue to send out signals, but the signals do not reach the muscles, and the patient is thus unable to move arms or legs. By monitoring the right nerve cells and forwarding these signals to for example a robot arm, the patient may be able to steer by his or her thoughts alone,"" Einevoll says.\nThe Computational Neuroscience Group at UMB has already established contacts with clinical research groups in the USA and Europe for further research on using the approach in patient treatment.\nThe research team recently published the article ""Modeling the spatial reach of the LFP"" in Neuron. Researchers at Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany, the site of one of Europe\'s largest supercomputing centers, contributed the detailed simulation of a piece of brain tissue comprising about 100,000 neurons and 1 billion synapses to provide the LFP model of the Norwegian group with brain activity similar to a living animal.\nThe international interest in this field of study is highlighted by the mobility of the crew. First author Henrik Lindén recently joined the prestigious KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. Tom Tetzlaff, the second author and Research Fellow of Professor Gaute Einevoll, moved to the partner institute to join Professors Sonja Grün and Markus Diesmann in Juelich.\nThe project is mainly financed by the Research Council of Norway\'s eScience programme and is an example of the increased importance of computational neuroscience in modern brain research.\nEinevoll was recently appointed one of four new directors of Organization for Computational Neurosciences, and is also co-leader of the Norwegian national node of INCF (International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility).\nBoth organisations work to promote the use of methods from informatics, mathematics and physics in brain research.\nModeling the Spatial Reach of the LFP\nHenrik Lindén, Tom Tetzlaff, Tobias C.

27	retail business owner compare clothing line boutique customer relationships marketing strategy impact promotional discounts	Clothing lines and boutiques differ significantly in customer relationships and marketing approaches. Boutiques typically maintain more personal relationships with customers, creating stronger community engagement and loyalty, while clothing lines have limited customer relationships due to their corporate nature. Regarding promotional discounts, boutiques can offer customized services and personalized fittings, which justifies their higher pricing. However, the effectiveness of promotional discounts varies - while they can temporarily maximize sales and revenue, using them too frequently can train consumers to wait for sales and damage overall profitability. For both types of businesses, strategic use of seasonal discounts and loyalty rewards can be effective, but excessive discounting risks starting a downward pricing spiral that may eventually harm the ability to sell at full price and maintain customer loyalty.	['When it comes to fashion retail, the terms “clothing line” and “boutique” are often used interchangeably. However, there are distinct differences between the two.\nA clothing line refers to a brand or label that produces and sells a collection of clothing items under a specific name or logo. On the other hand, a boutique is a small retail store that sells a curated selection of clothing items from various brands.\nUnderstanding the differences between a clothing line and a boutique can help consumers make informed decisions about where to shop and what to expect from each type of retailer.\nWhether you’re looking for a specific brand or a unique shopping experience, knowing the distinctions between these two types of fashion retail can help you find what you’re looking for.\nUnderstanding a Clothing Line and Boutique\nWhen it comes to the fashion industry, there are two main ways to sell clothing: through a clothing line or a boutique. While both involve selling clothing, there are some key differences between the two.\nA clothing line is a collection of clothing items created by a designer or company. Clothing lines are typically sold through retail stores, online, or through their own physical stores. The focus of a clothing line is on the design and production of the clothing items themselves, rather than the selling process.\nOn the other hand, a boutique is a small retail store that typically sells a curated selection of clothing items from various designers and brands. Boutiques often have a specific style or aesthetic that they cater to, which sets them apart from larger retail stores. The focus of a boutique is on the selling process and providing a unique shopping experience for customers.\nWhile clothing lines and boutiques have different focuses, they both play important roles in the fashion industry. Clothing lines often create new and innovative designs, while boutiques provide a platform to showcase and sell these designs to customers.\nAt the end of the day, whether you prefer shopping from a clothing line or a boutique comes down to personal preference. Clothing lines offer a wider variety of designs, while boutiques provide a more personalized shopping experience.\nUltimately, both options contribute to the diverse and ever-evolving world of fashion.\nDifferences between a Clothing Line and a Boutique\nProduct Variety and Availability\nWhen it comes to product variety and availability, there are significant differences between clothing lines and boutiques.\nClothing lines typically offer a wider range of products, including different styles, sizes, and categories of clothing. They often have a large inventory of mass-produced items, which allows them to cater to a broader target market. Clothing lines are usually designed and manufactured by a single company, which means that the brand name is the primary selling point.\nOn the other hand, boutiques tend to offer a more limited amount of goods, with a focus on specialized clothing and unique pieces. They often carry a higher-end inventory, with a deep assortment of category specialists and customized, niche-style clothing. Boutiques may also offer custom-made services, which allows customers to have a more personal touch in their clothing choices.\nPricing and Target Market\nPricing is another significant difference between clothing lines and boutiques.\nClothing lines often have a lower price point, as they typically manufacture their products in large quantities and sell them through retail stores or online. This allows them to offer their products at a lower price point, which makes them more accessible to a wider target audience.\nBoutiques, on the other hand, tend to have a higher price point, as they often carry higher-end and more unique clothing items. They may also offer specialized services, such as customizations or personalized fittings, which can increase the cost of their products.\nBoutiques typically cater to a more affluent target market, who are willing to pay a premium for the quality and unique style of their clothing. Boutique clothes are expensive.\nCommunity Impact and Preference\nClothing lines refer to larger, corporate retailers, which may not have the same level of community engagement as privately owned boutiques. Boutiques often have a more personal relationship with their customers, which can create a stronger sense of community and loyalty.\nIn terms of preference, some customers prefer the convenience and variety of clothing lines, while others prefer the personalized touch and unique style of boutiques. It ultimately comes down to individual preferences and priorities, with some customers valuing affordability and accessibility, while others prioritize quality and exclusivity.\n|Definition||A collection of clothing produced and sold under a specific brand name.||A small retail shop that sells clothes, fashion accessories, etc.|\n|Primary Focus||Designing and manufacturing clothes.||They focus on retailing various brands or lines.|\n|Products||A wide variety of products.||Limited range of products|\n|Custom Made Service||Not available||Made to measure service is available|\n|Relationship with Customers||No or Limited Relationship||More Personal Relationship|\n|Target Audience||Mass Market||Niche Market|\n|Startup Capital||Significant Investment||Lower startup capital|\nCase Study: Zara and H&M\nZara: A Clothing Line Example\nWhen we look at Zara, we see a clothing line that has become a global brand. Zara is famous for its fast fashion and trendy designs that are affordable for the masses. The company has a centralized production system that allows it to quickly respond to changing fashion trends and get new products to market quickly.\nOne of Zara’s strengths is its ability to anticipate and respond to consumer demand. The company uses data analytics and customer feedback to determine what products are selling well and what trends are emerging. This allows Zara to produce new products quickly and get them to market before competitors.\nH&M: A Boutique Example\nH&M is a Swedish fashion retailer that operates in over 60 countries. While H&M is often referred to as a boutique, it is actually a clothing line. H&M produces its own clothing and accessories and sells them in its stores and online.\nH&M is popular for its fast fashion and trendy designs, similar to Zara. However, H&M’s prices are generally lower than Zara’s, which makes it more accessible to a wider audience. H&M also has a strong focus on sustainability and ethical production, which is an important consideration for many consumers.\nIn terms of product offerings, H&M has a wide range of clothing and accessories for men, women, and children. The company also has a focus on basics, such as t-shirts and jeans, which are staples in many people’s wardrobes.\nOverall, both Zara and H&M are clothing lines that offer fast fashion and trendy designs at affordable prices. While Zara has a more centralized production system and focuses on anticipating and responding to consumer demand, H&M has a wider range of products and a focus on sustainability and ethical production.\nIn summary, while both clothing lines and boutiques offer clothing and apparel, there are significant differences in their product variety, pricing, target market, and community impact. Customers should consider their individual preferences and priorities when deciding where to shop for their clothing needs.', 'Pricing strategy is an important element of a product marketing campaign. More than any other element, pricing strategy directly impacts the amount of profit you make. Choose a pricing strategy that helps you meet your sales objectives, enhances your reputation and provides the best profit point for the market demand. A discount pricing strategy is useful for driving traffic and sales short term. Used as a long-term strategy, discount pricing has some negative effects on market position and brand loyalty.\nA business develops the pricing strategy for a product after performing a marketing analysis. Product distribution, positioning and promotional decisions are made and demand is estimated. A pricing strategy is formulated taking into consideration factors of cost, competitors and profit objectives.\nPossible pricing strategies include a full price strategy, competitive pricing, discount pricing or a mix of these. A full price, or skim pricing strategy is appropriate for specialty products and exclusive markets. A full price strategy usually results in fewer sales at a higher profit margin. Competitive pricing is appropriate for high-quality products sold in a retail setting. It requires constant monitoring to ensure that the pricing is comparable to similar products in the market.\nDiscount Pricing Strategy\nBusinesses use discount pricing to sell low-priced products in high quantities. With this strategy, it is important to cut costs and stay competitive. Large retailers are able to demand price discounts from suppliers and make a discount pricing strategy effective. It is usually impossible to compete with these retailers based solely on a discount pricing strategy.\nUse discounts off the list wisely and sparingly. Occasional discounts and discounts that reward loyal customers are effective. Discounts used too often begin a downward pricing spiral that may eventually damage your ability to sell the product at full price.\nTypes of Discounts\nIt is normal to offer quantity discounts to customers who purchase in large quantities. These discounts can be cumulative, such as discounts given to customers who place multiple small orders or loyalty cards that give a free item after a certain number are purchased. These discounts reward customer loyalty.\nSeasonal discounts are appropriate to reward customers who purchase during off-peak times. They often serve to increase sales at the beginning of peak seasons. Promotional discounts are short-term, to drive sales. Using promotional discounts too often trains consumers to wait for the sale and may damage the overall profitability of the product.\nLoss leaders are discounted items designed to bring customers into the store, where they will hopefully purchase more profitable products as well. Loss leaders should be recognized brands that are used frequently. Loss leader items change regularly to keep customers coming back.\nAdvantages of Discount Pricing\nDiscounts to reward volume customers, repeat customers and employees build customer loyalty. Loss leaders are effective for retailers who need to increase traffic in the store. Promotional discounts, used sparingly, offer temporary advantages including maximizing sales, revenue and profit. During a short-term discount period, more units are sold, allowing the company to decrease inventory and temporarily raise revenues.\nDisadvantages of Discount Pricing\nConsider product positioning before choosing a discount pricing strategy. Consumers associate low price with low quality, particularly when the brand name is not familiar. Pursuing a discount pricing strategy increases the chance that your product will be perceived as lower in quality. While you may gain customers who make decisions on price alone, other customers may choose competitor products because of perceived quality.\nLow prices may drive sales for a limited time, but do not build customer loyalty. When a lower priced alternative comes along, you may lose your hard-earned market share. Competitors can simply match your prices, or beat them. When prices have been driven down to absolute low prices, it is difficult to raise prices again, especially if your product is perceived as being lower in quality.\n- sale 70% off sign. all sale sign. free.cheap price image by L.

28	I'm a surveillance expert - how can rooftop markings be seen at night?	Currently, conventional roof markings on police vehicles are not detectable by thermal InfraRed (IRT) imagers at night or in poor visibility due to their low reflectivity. A new approach uses visibly black films with high IRT reflectivity combined with conventional sign-writing vinyl appliques. The high IRT reflectivity shows as black (cold) while conventional material shows as white (warm), creating contrast by making the background appear significantly cooler than surrounding surfaces when viewed by IRT imagers.	['A new family of marking materials allows unambiguous identification of military, police, and other emergency service vehicles by surveillance aircraft.\nCivilian law enforcement officials consider airborne surveillance a highly effective tool for preventing and detecting crime, as well as for supplying evidence to support criminal investigations. Most police forces have their own dedicated aircraft fitted with a combination of visual and thermal InfraRed (IRT) imaging equipment to give them day and night-time surveillance capabilities. Police ground vehicles have visible alpha-numeric and symbol roof markings, but these are not detectable by the IRT imagers that are used on police aircraft at night or in poor visibility. This is because the materials currently used for roof markings have low reflectivity to IRT and so they do not produce the high contrast needed to produce clear IRT images. Consequently, police cars are indistinguishable from each other or from similar civilian vehicles in these situations.\nThe present-day practice is to request that police vehicles identify themselves to the air surveillance platform: by opening the vehicle windows and waving, for example. Our approach is to create visibly black films with high IRT reflectivity, to be used in combination with conventional sign-writing vinyl appliques. When placed on the top of a vehicle, the high IRT reflectivity shows as black (cold), while the conventional material shows as white (warm). The technique relies on making the background of a marked area of the vehicle roof appear significantly cooler to an IRT imager than the surrounding vehicle surfaces, foreground symbols, and environment. Since the IRT apparent temperature of the sky is usually significantly lower than the environment below, we use cold-sky reflection to form a high-contrast area onto which symbols can be placed.\nDeveloping the approach\nThe simple Stefan-Boltzmann law gives the radiant energy (E) of a body as E = εσT,4 (where ε is emissivity, σ is Boltz-mann’s constant, and T is absolute temperature), and Kirchoff’s law teaches that for an opaque body ρ = 1 −ε, (where ρ is reflectance). Hence, a high-IRT-reflective surface facing the sky and viewed from above will appear cold because of the reduced thermal radiance of the surface and the reflection of the‘cold sky.’\nConventional vinyl sign-writing films have low IRT reflectivity and, when placed on a vehicle roof, appear warm. Their self-radiance is high and there is little cold-sky reflection. Symbols can be cut from vinyl films and applied on top of the high-IRT-reflectivity film to form unique IRT vehicle markings, an example of which is shown in Figure 1. Symbols also can be cut directly from the high-IRT-reflectivity film and placed on white-painted roofs to make a black-on-white IRT marking.\nTo maximise IRT contrast (and thus the readability range) and to achieve compatibility with the current visible markings, a visibly black (with reflectivity between 400 and 780nm less than 10%), IRT reflective (reflectivity between 3-5 and 8-12μm greater than 80%) material is desirable. We have explored several approaches that trade properties such as reflectivity spectrum, durability, weight, cost, etc., to form a family of marking materials. Figure 2 presents a composite reflectance spectrum of one of the materials developed for this application.\nTo optimize the appearance of the markings (character fonts, contrast, and dimensions) for different situations (such as classes of vehicles, operational altitudes, look-down angles, and imager types), a series of experiments was conducted in collaboration with police surveillance units in the United Kingdom.4 Figure 3 shows ground-to-ground imagery of a heavy goods vehicle prepared for experimentation. Note that, in this case, high IRT letters have been applied onto a conventional white vinyl marking film. The low IRT black marking film was also applied to the shoulders of a high-visibility jacket. Figure 4 presents IRT images of two subjects, one with the film and one without.\nThe cold sky reflection technique and the materials described here provide an effective technique for unambiguously monitoring military, police, and other emergency service vehicles from the air by using visible and IRT imagers. They are effective on personnel, as well as vehicles carrying high value cargoes.']	['<urn:uuid:ccc68600-c75a-4fe3-9f01-b29821127f36>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	13	75	673
29	alternative liquid substitutes available fermented bread cheese recipe cooking	There are several liquid substitutions possible in this cheese bread recipe. You can use beer (light or dark) instead of water, which adds subtle flavors that complement the cheese. Additionally, potato water (leftover from boiling potatoes) can be used instead of water or beer to make the dough softer. For the milk component, you can use buttermilk or any other type of milk, though if you prefer a leaner bread, you can replace the milk with an equal amount of water or potato water.	"[""Soft Cheese Bread\nMAKES 2 LARGE LOAVES OR MANY ROLLS\nYou can use any kind of beer in this recipe, as both light and dark brews add subtle flavors that will complement the cheese.\n6 1/4 cups (28 oz / 794 g) unbleached bread flour\n2 teaspoons (0.5 oz / 14 g) salt, or 1 tablespoon coarse kosher salt\n5 tablespoons (2.25 oz / 64 g) granulated or brown sugar, or 3 1/2 tablespoons honey or agave nectar\n1 cup (8 oz / 227 g) lukewarm water or beer (about 95°F or 35°C)\n1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (9 oz / 255 g) lukewarm buttermilk or any other milk (about 95°F or 35°C)\n1 1/2 tablespoons (0.5 oz / 14 g) instant yeast\n1/4 cup (2 oz / 56.5 g) melted unsalted butter or vegetable oil\n1 3/4 cups (7 oz / 198 g) diced onion (about 1 medium onion) or 1 small bunch of fresh chives (1 oz / 28.5 g), minced (optional)\n2 1/2 cups (12 oz / 340 g) grated, shredded, or cubed cheese\nIn a mixing bowl, whisk the flour, salt, and sugar together (if using honey or agave nectar, dissolve it in the lukewarm water instead). Separately, combine the water and buttermilk, whisk in the yeast until dissolved, then pour the mixture and the melted butter into the dry ingredients. If using a mixer, use the paddle attachment and mix on the lowest speed for 2 minutes. If mixing by hand, use a large spoon and stir for about 2 minutes. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes.\nSwitch to the dough hook and mix on medium-low speed, or continue mixing by hand, for 3 minutes, adjusting with flour or liquid as needed. The dough should be soft, supple, and tacky but not sticky. Add the onions and mix on the lowest speed or continue mixing by hand for 1 minute, until the onions are evenly distributed.\nTransfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for 1 or 2 minutes to make any final adjustments, then form the dough into a ball.\nPlace the dough in a clean, lightly oiled bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and immediately refrigerate overnight or for up to 4 days. (If you plan to bake the dough in batches over different days, you can portion the dough and place it into two or more oiled bowls at this stage.) The dough should double in size in the refrigerator. If you want to bake the bread the same day you mix the dough, don't refrigerate the final dough; just let it rest at room temperature for 60 to 90 minutes, until it doubles in size. Then proceed to shaping and baking as described below.\nON BAKING DAY\nRemove the dough from the refrigerator about 2 hours before you plan to bake. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and divide it into 2 equal pieces, each weighing about 2 pounds (907 g). Dust each piece with flour, then use a rolling pin to roll them into rectangles about 8 inches wide and 12 inches high. Spread half of the cheese over the surface of one rectangle and roll the dough up like a rug, from the bottom to the top, to form a log. If any cheese falls out, tuck it back in or save it for the second loaf. Seal the seam with your fingertips. For a sandwich loaf, proof in a greased 4 1/2 by 8-inch loaf pan (or a 5 by 9-inch pan if using onions, which increase the volume of the dough). For a freestanding bâtard or rolls (see page 21), proof on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Another option is to cut the log into 1 1/2-inch slices to make spiral rolls; place spiral rolls about 1 inch apart in greased round pans or on a parchment-lined sheet pan. Mist the shaped dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap, then let the dough rise at room temperature for about 90 minutes, until increased to about 1 1/2 times its original size. In loaf pans, the dough should dome about 1 inch above the rim.\nAbout 15 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C), or 300°F (149°C) for a convection oven. Because of the cheese, there may be air pockets or tunnels in the risen dough that could cause it to separate in the spirals (cubed cheese creates fewer air pockets than grated or shredded cheese). To minimize this, poke through the top crust in a few spots with a skewer or toothpick. The dough may fall a bit, but it will recover in the oven.\nBake loaves for 20 minutes, then rotate the pans; rotate rolls after 10 minutes. The total baking time is about 50 minutes for loaves, and only 20 to 25 minutes for rolls. The bread is done when it's a deep golden brown and the internal temperature is above 185°F (85°C) in the center.\nRemove from the pans and cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes for rolls and about 1 hour for loaves before slicing or serving.\nYou can substitute potato water (leftover from boiling potatoes) for the water or beer, which will make the dough even softer. The milk provides some tenderness and color, but if you prefer a leaner bread you can replace it with an equal amount of water or potato water.\nFeel free to replace some of the bread flour with an equivalent amount (by weight) of whole wheat flour or rye flour. If you do so, increase the amount of water by about 1 tablespoon (0.5 oz / 14 g) for every 7 tablespoons (1 oz / 28.5 g) of whole grain flour you use.\nIf you would like to avoid the air pockets caused by the melting cheese, you can knead cubed cheese into the dough after the overnight rise, just before shaping, rather than rolling it up in the dough. This will create little cheese bursts throughout the loaf instead of a spiral.""]"	['<urn:uuid:f687fb06-567b-4f95-b86f-e974b59f24fd>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	9	84	1020
30	Could you describe the peak congestion times at the Louvre?	The Louvre experiences its highest visitor traffic between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. To avoid crowds, it's better to visit in the morning, or take advantage of extended hours on Wednesdays and Fridays when the museum stays open late.	['The Louvre Museum, widely regarded as the most stunning museum in the world, receives an average of 8 million visitors annually, making it the most popular. Its galleries cover at least 72,000 square meters, and 35,000 works of art are on display. There is no need to remind you that you must be prepared before entering the museum since if you had to spend 10 seconds studying each item, it would take you 96 hours to see the entire collection. This comprehensive reference to the Louvre Museum includes information on how to get there, how much it costs, how to navigate the museum, and how to have the best possible experience there. In the event that you are taking the Louvre Museum tour, make sure that you go through this guide to have the best time possible. Here goes:\nWhere is the Louvre located?\nOn the right side of the Seine, between the Rue de Rivoli and the Seine, in the first district of Paris, is where you’ll find the Louvre Museum. The huge glass pyramid in the middle of the main courtyard (cour Napoléon) makes it simple to identify. The commencement of the Axe Historique (historical axis), which runs through the Champs-Elysées, the Place de la Concorde, the Tuileries Garden, and the Arc de Triomphe, connects the Louvre Palace to the Grande Arche de la Défense. The equestrian statue of King Louis XIV is positioned close to the entrance.\nThe Louvre Museum is conveniently located. You can take line 1 or line 7 to the Palais Royal/Musée du Louvre stop on the metro to get there. By passing via the Carrousel du Louvre’s underground shopping mall, you can access the glass pyramid directly from this station. You can also use the metro, line 14, and exit at the Pyramids stop.\nBus lines 21, 24, 27, 39, 48, 67, 68, 69, 72, 81, 85, and 95 can be used to travel to the Louvre. Near the Louvre, they all halt.\nSchedule and Costs\nExcept on Tuesdays, the Louvre Museum is open daily from 9 am to 6 pm. Additionally, there are evening hours on Wednesdays and Fridays until 9.45 p.m. On nights when doors are opened, rooms close between 5.30 and 9.30 p.m.\nExcept for the firsts of January, May 1 and 8, and December 25, the Louvre is open on holidays. A museum admission ticket costs €15, or €17 if you purchase it online.\nWhen to Visit\nEvery season can be used to visit the Louvre, however, summer often draws the most people. But there are usually a lot of tourists because it is the most visited museum in the world. The busiest times are from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., therefore it is preferable to visit in the morning, on a Wednesday, or on a Friday when the store is open late.\nWhat to See\nMona Lisa: It is a well-known artwork that was created in the 16th century and is considered a great masterpiece. According to estimates, half of Louvre tourists solely visit the museum to view this Leonardo da Vinci painting. It must be acknowledged that its fabled half-smile and unparalleled beauty are masters at deceiving the masses.\nThe Venus de Milo: This well-known sculpture, which was created approximately 100 BC, was found on the island of Milos in 1820, from which it derives its name. It symbolizes Venus, or Aphrodite in Roman mythology, the goddess of love. One of the top three works of art in the museum.\nNapoleon’s Coronation, by Jacques-Louis David: Napoleon is shown in this artwork at his ordination and Empress Josephine’s coronation in the Cathedral of Notre Dame. It was created between 1806 and 1807. The Palace of Versailles houses a replica.\nAuthor Theodore Gericault’s The Raft of the Medusa: Not for the weak of the heart is this piece of art. This work of art depicts the shipwreck of the Medusa, which took place in 1816, and is incredibly realistic.\nVeronese’s The Wedding Feast at Cana: Having dimensions of 6.66 meters in height and 9.90 meters in length, this painting is the largest piece of art in the museum. It depicts the biblical account of the Cana Wedding Feast, where Christ performed his first miracle by turning water into wine, and was painted between 1562 and 1563.\nThe Tanis Great Sphinx: This sculpture, which dates to circa 2600 BC, shows a sphinx, a chimaera with a lion’s body and a human head. Sphinx guarded the tombs of the Pharaohs and served as symbols of their authority. We can interpret inscriptions on this sphinx that mention Ammenemes II, Merneptah, and Shoshenq I.\nIn the event that you are taking the Louvre Museum tour anytime soon, make sure to get the tickets booked well in advance to beat the rush.

31	I keep hearing about connected devices at home - what security risks do they create, and how can I protect my personal information when using them?	Connected home devices pose risks like remote access by malicious users who could control your home systems (e.g., electricity, locks). Without proper security, hackers can easily access device passwords using tools like nmap. To protect personal information, you should: clear cookies periodically to prevent creation of detailed user profiles, ensure devices use encrypted communications (HTTPS protocol), avoid default passwords, and use end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms like WhatsApp or Signal when discussing sensitive information through these devices.	['How to protect your privacy online\nElizabeth Barber delves into online privacy – sharing some helpful tips to remain incognito on the internet.\nAt a time where many companies’ business models are built around collecting as much of our data as possible, it can feel overwhelming to try and control who has access to our information. It often feels as though we are powerless to do anything about this. No one wants to read privacy policies that often run to thousands of pages, and it is not realistic for the majority of people to completely quit social media (but if you can – good for you!).\nHowever, there are steps you can take to increase your privacy online. Often these are quick fixes, such as changing a preference in your phone settings or selecting ‘opt out’ when asked if you want to share your data. Here are 3 tangible steps you can take to help protect your online privacy.\nClear your cookies\nCookies, which you often need to consent to before accessing any website, are files created by websites you visit and which save browsing information. Persistent cookies do not expire when you quit your browser. They may be removed after a few days or may be coded to automatically delete only after a few thousand years! This information can be used to create a digital persona to show you targeted ads.\nSee details here on how to clear cookies for different browsers. Doing so periodically will make it harder for companies to create a detailed persona with your data.\nReview the apps that have access to your location\nYou might be surprised by how many apps have requested access to your location data. Do they need access to your location at all?\nIf apps have access to your location, do they always need to know it, or just when you’re using the app? Do they need your precise location, or is it enough to have your approximate location?\nTo review these on\n- iPhone: Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services.\n- Android: Settings → Location → App Permissions.\nConsider the messaging platforms you’re using\nFacebook messenger and Twitter or Instagram DMs may not be the place to discuss anything sensitive or private – while Meta offers end-to-end encryption, it isn’t the default setting. Without end-to-end encryption, these companies, outside parties including hackers, internet service providers and governments could access your data. This isn’t conjecture – in Nebraska, Facebook turned over the messages of a mother and her daughter to police after they were served with a warrant as part of an investigation into an illegal abortion.\nUsing iMessage, Whatsapp and Signal mean that your messages are all end-to-end encrypted as a default – no one can access the messages except the sender and receiver.\nHegemonic companies will continue to use our data for their purposes, commercial and otherwise unless there are adequately-enforced restrictions that force them to stop. While we are a long way off from meaningful legislation until then we can all take small steps to empower ourselves to exercise some degree of control over the privacy of our data.', 'The world is increasingly interconnected through the internet. More and more “smart” devices and appliances are now online 24 hours a day. But what are the real implications of the development of IoT and home automation? Are users really safe? What is the level of protection for their data? And what are the biggest risks to privacy?\nDuring Codemotion Milan 2018, Guy Rombaut, CTO at OneFit, spoke to us in depth about these issues.\nThere are now many low-cost devices always connected and already installed in the workplace and home. Exposing these devices to the internet without precautions and without sensitising the users to their implications is a big risk. In addition to the possible violations of individual privacy, there is also a more relevant aspect concerning security.\nIn the absence of the necessary countermeasures, malicious users could take possession of our “smart” car, or turn off the electricity of a home remotely, or lock us out of the house. This is the potential downside of the domotics and IoT devices.\nThe well-known Ransomware WannaCry is a striking example of how cybersecurity is a topic too often ignored today. Although there is a lot of work being done in schools to make students aware of cybersecurity, very often the most basic security rules are not applied as much by individual users as by companies. So can a secure smart system be implemented? Obviously, yes. Just follow some basic rules that should be applied by all manufacturers on the market:\nAlways employ staff specialised in web security during development. Working with developers already accustomed to the use of normal security protocols will improve the security of your project and your service. This is because having a good knowledge of the rules of cybersecurity will mean you implement them during the early stages of development. Present the project in production, already prepared for the implementation of the right security protocols.\nPrioritize security and security features of the device before sending it to production. This will protect not only the end user but also the company itself from possible future security problems. Another important factor in ensuring the security of an IoT system is to ensure constant updates, for the entire lifecycle of the device. Moreover, it’s very important to ensure that the device updates automatically without requiring user intervention. Eliminating the need for manual intervention for the update allows you to not only improve the user experience but also to prevent the user from postponing the update.\nSecurity obviously goes through cryptographic algorithms. Use data encryption algorithms during communications to and from the device and to store passwords; it’s key to ensuring that user data is kept and stored in a stable and secure manner. For example, you can create web apps for your IoT device which always use the HTTPS protocol, so as to protect its users with an SSL or TLS certificate.\nAlthough it is possible to implement a vast array of protocols, one of the main security risks remains the user themselves. That’s why you have to oblige the user to set a strong password, to change it at least once a year and to activate the two-factor verification. The development team will also have to implement and use smart methods to recover login credentials.\nOnce you get to the stable version of the software, it is good to perform, as well as during the whole life cycle of the device, various penetration tests to ensure that the implementing security protocols work well.\nIn addition, a company that makes IoT devices should never use a “default” password in the factory settings. This is because users often do not change the password if not forced. Leaving a standard password on the device is like leaving the door open at home day and night. Another fatal mistake that a development team can make is to implement secret and undocumented remote access methods such as backdoors. This hidden remote access does nothing but make the attack platform wider and, if discovered by a hacker, can lead to intrusions against which you can not defend.\nAt the end of his talk, Guy Rombaut showed us how easy it is to get the password of a device that has not been designed with the right security protocols. He looked for a simple target like a public webcam and, after finding the public IP, he used logic and an open source tool, nmap, to understand the username and password to access the webcam control panel.\nNmap can be used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus building a “map” of the network. To accomplish its goal, Nmap sends specially crafted packets to the target host(s) and then analyses the responses. For example, Rombaut scans the network in this way:\nnmap -T4 -A -v 192.168.0.0/24 -p 21, 75-100,443, 554, 22222, 3322,3333, 5000, 5550, 8080, 8081, 100002\nNow imagine that this system is not a simple public webcam but for your car or the door of your home. Can you comprehend how great the risks of an IoT ecosystem without security standards are?\nSo a truly safe IoT system should always have three characteristics:confidentiality, integrity and availability, also known as the CIA triad, is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organisation. The model is also sometimes referred to as the AIC triad (availability, integrity and confidentiality) to avoid confusion with the Central Intelligence Agency. The elements of the triad are considered the three most crucial components of security.\nIn this context, confidentiality is a set of rules that limits access to information, integrity is the assurance that the information is trustworthy and accurate, and availability is a guarantee of reliable access to the information by authorised people.\nIn addition, our devices should always be able to be controlled by something that can be directly associated with us, such as another device or biometric values (fingerprints or face ID).\nIn conclusion, Guy Rombaut hopes that all developers and users will start to become more aware of the risks of the IoT world and put pressure on companies to implement ever better security systems.']	['<urn:uuid:238359c2-f89a-40e0-8211-e88b4f96753c>', '<urn:uuid:a5e90dd6-352d-44ad-98ab-56f1729b20ee>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	26	76	1547
32	total trees planted during environmental renovation marston vale region	Over the last 2 decades, the Forest of Marston Vale has planted over 2 million trees.	['Regeneration and the Forest of Marston Vale\nOur guest blogger, Jo Roberts, Community Engagement Officer at the Forest of Marston Vale, tells us about a local success story.\nThe Forest of Marston Vale is a regeneration success story, and the idea of revitalising and restoring landscape continues to be a big part of the work we do.\nNearly 30 years ago, the government at the time established a pilot project to demonstrate the benefit of environmental improvement to economic and social regeneration, and deliver lasting change – ‘England’s Community Forests’ were born, and have been transforming the landscapes and communities in and around our towns and cities ever since.\nThe aim of the Community Forests was to regenerate areas that had been hit hard by heavy industry and landscape degradation. In Bedfordshire this meant first the brick making industry, and then the landfill sites (some of the largest in Europe) that followed. Since their creation, Community Forests have become a mainstay of environmentally-led regeneration and sustainability.\nWhen the Forest of Marston Vale was designated, just under 5%, of the 61 square-mile Forest area had tree cover. Our work over the last 2 decades has seen this increase to over 15%, as we’ve created new woodlands throughout the Forest and planted over 2 million trees – our aim is to reach an impressive 30%!\nPlanting trees and creating woodlands continues to be recognised – by experts and the government alike – as the most effective way of regenerating landscapes, and for so many good reasons. Woodlands provide habitats for huge numbers of species: mammals to invertebrates; trees to fungi and everything in between. Hedgerows regenerate wildlife corridors, providing shelter for animals moving between habitats, and are an important landscape feature with a lot of wildlife value. And the value of woodlands to people is hard to overestimate – they give us cleaner air, places to get closer to nature, havens to escape to when we’re stressed, and places to improve our physical health and mental wellbeing.\nTrees are able to provide so many more benefits too. Their regenerative effects on our air quality are incredible – not only do they remove particles of pollution from the air and store them in their tissues, but they also provide cooling shade. As our climate warms, this is something that we will come to appreciate more and more, especially in urban areas where the cooling qualities of trees can help to combat the ‘Urban Heat Island’ effect. Trees and hedgerows also have an important role to play in regenerating our watercourses, again removing pollution and preventing erosion of soils into streams and rivers by binding soils with their roots.\nSome of the woodlands we create stand surrounded by arable fields, but where possible we look to regenerate and safeguard our local semi-natural ancient woodlands too. Our ancient woodlands are under threat from fragmentation, climate change, and pests and diseases – in a recent study by the Woodland Trust, only 7% of our native woodlands were found to be in a ‘good’ condition. Creating new woodlands adjacent to these ancient ones should make them more resilient to the challenges they face, increasing the area in which species can move. At the Forest of Marston Vale we plant a combination of native species including oak, hornbeam, wild cherry and alder – all grown and sourced within the UK, and chosen for their ability to tolerate and address climate change and increasing temperatures, safeguarding our Community Woodlands and this habitat for the future.\nAnd finally trees and woodlands can have a regenerative effect on how we feel about where we live and work. Green and leafy areas are seen as places to be proud of. New jobs have been created in the woodland industry, managing woodlands and using the raw materials we get from them. In short, the power of trees and woodlands to give new life to damaged and scarred landscapes is second to none.']	['<urn:uuid:598e867b-64a6-44cd-ba4b-ee99b5760f8e>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	9	16	659
33	Do both IBD and beta-glucan treatments affect dog weight?	Yes, but in different ways. IBD can cause weight loss as one of its primary symptoms, even in cases where appetite remains normal. In contrast, beta-glucans, such as those found in PRALISUR, are supplements that support immune function and can help address underlying inflammatory conditions, but do not directly cause weight changes. When treating IBD, dietary therapy is often recommended, particularly low-fat gastrointestinal diets in cases of protein losing enteropathy.	['PRALISUR is a natural* ingredient that contains more than 50% beta-1,3-glucans derived from dried algae. Beta-glucans are glucose polysaccharides naturally occurring in the cells of plants, cereals, and fungi. The beta-1,3-glucan sourced from algae has been shown to stimulate and activate the immune systems of animals.\nResearch on beta-glucan dates to the 1940s, and its efficacy and mechanism on the immune system has been well documented in a significant number of peer-reviewed studies. Beta-glucans have been used in livestock and aquaculture applications for many years, and can be found in a wide variety of human food and nutraceutical products for immune support.\nIn dogs, it has been shown that beta-1,3-glucan can:\nOther potential functional benefits of beta-glucan in dogs have been demonstrated in various research publications as a supportive approach for atopic dermatitis,3 for inflammatory bowel disease4 and for steoarthritis.5\nWhy choose PRALISUR over other sources of beta-glucan?\nAlgae-sourced beta-glucans are unique in how they can support a dog’s natural defense system at the cellular level, in comparison to beta-glucan from other sources.6\nStructural differences impact the function of beta-glucans in the body, as different sources have unique molecular structures. Among the various sources of beta-glucan, PRALISUR contains one of the highest concentrations of linear beta-1,3-glucan. PRALISUR is activated during the digestion process, which easily breaks down the protein-rich skin of algae to release (1,3) algae beta-glucans. After digestion, beta-1,3-glucans are absorbed in the small intestines, where they can support a healthy immune response.\nThe table below provides an overview on beta-glucan sources and their functions in the body.7-10\nThe Kemin Technical Service and Customer Laboratory Service (CLS) teams are your partners throughout the entire petfood manufacturing process.

Although the exact cause is poorly understood, many believe genetic factors, interactions of dietary antigens and microflora in the intestine with the local immune immune system may affect the lining of GI tract.\nIBD is categorized on the cellular level by the type of inflammation present. This based on the result of biopsies. Categories of IBD include lymphoplasmacytic (most common), eosinophilic, and granulomatous.\nSymptoms Canine and Feline Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)\nClinical signs if Inflammatory Bowel Disease in dogs and cats may include:\n- Lack of appetite (anorexia)\n- Weight loss\n- In cats, an increased appetite with weight loss has been reported\nDiagnosis of Canine and Feline Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)\nDiagnosis of IBD in dogs and cats will be based on a combination of history, clinical signs and test results. Your veterinarian will ask you lots of questions about your dog or cat including information about the diet, medications and any possible exposure to parasites.\nThere are a variety of approaches to the diagnosis of IBD. Depending on the severity of your pet’s sign, your veterinarian may recommend these options prior to additional diagnostic tests.\n- Food trials. In stable patients with a normal albumin protein levels in the blood and without weight loss, a food trial using a hypoallergenic diet (novel or hydrolyzed protein diets) may be recommended. Clinical studies report that 40 – 60% of dogs and cats with chronic enteropathies respond to an elimination or hydrolyzed diet, which supports the value of a food trial in the treatment of IBD.\n- Empirical deworming with a dewormer medication such as fenbendazole and a course antibiotics such as with metronidazole or tylosin may be considered before pursuing further diagnostics.\nVarious diagnostics tests are considered when evaluating patients with IBD include:\n- Routine bloodwork including a Complete Blood Count (CBC) and biochemical profile (chemistry profile)\n- Fecal examination to look for parasites\n- Cobalamin (Vitamin B12 levels) and folate (Vitamin B9) levels\n- Serum Trypsin-Like Immunoreactivity (TLI) to evaluate for pancreatic disease\n- Pancreatic Lipase Immunoreactivity (PLI)cto evaluate for pancreatic disease\n- Fecal alpha-protease inhibitor to evaluate for intestinal protein loss\n- Abdominal ultrasound\n- Histopathology is the gold standard for the diagnosis of IBD. Endoscopy is the most practical and least invasive method of obtaining biopsies for histopathology. Full thickness biopsies by laparotomy or laparoscopy are useful in differentiating IBD from lymphosarcoma.\n- Recently, introduction of new diagnostic tests, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, T-cell clonality assay and PARR (PCR antigen receptor rearrangement) which can be performed on endoscopic biopsy are also helpful in differentiating IBD from the cancer lymphosarcoma. Standards for describing and grading endoscopic biopsies for IBD have recently been developed by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association Gastrointestinal Standardization Group.\nYour veterinarian will want to evaluate for obstructive, metabolic, infectious, and neoplastic disease of the gastrointestinal system when evaluating patients with chronic vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss.\nTreatment of Canine and Feline Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)\nTherapy for IBD in dogs and cats may include:\n- Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of treatment of dogs and cats with IBD. The dosage and duration of therapy is based on severity of clinical signs, the type and severity of inflammation, clinical response, and drug tolerance. The dose is tapered based on response over 6-12 weeks. Budesonide is an orally administered corticosteroid with high topical activity in the gut with low systemic activity.\n- Dietary therapy. In dogs with a protein losing enteropathy and lymphangectasia, a low fat gastrointestinal diet is recommended.\n- Cobalamin (Vitamin B12) is important in many metabolic processes and low levels may result in a delayed or lack of response to appropriate therapy. Cobalamin is supplemented once a week for 6 weeks then on an as needed basis.\n- When a poor response to corticosteroids, elimination diet, and antibiotics is seen, additional immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, chlorambucil, and sulfasalazine (colitis) are indicated.\nPrognosis with Canine and Feline Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)\nSome dogs and cats with IBD require either dietary management or medical therapy throughout their lives. Although IBD cannot be cured, the goal of treatment is to control the clinical signs with the lowest dose of medications possible. If reoccurrence of clinical signs is seen, re-institution or adjustments of medical therapy may be needed. Only a small number of dogs and cats with IBD are non-responsive to therapy.']	['<urn:uuid:fda8f304-c532-45ac-8f96-40ec5044b506>', '<urn:uuid:5e38f1ca-3345-4f58-9e03-e9753556776c>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	9	70	1383
34	parent child relationship taxonomy vs ontology	In taxonomies, parent-child relationships are primarily hierarchical classifications where subtypes inherit constraints from supertypes (like 'car' being a subtype of 'vehicle'). In contrast, ontological relationships, as shown in the Agronomy Ontology, are more complex and diverse, including not just hierarchical relationships but also other types of connections like 'has participant' (linking tillage process to soil and tractor) or 'has role' (connecting animal manure to organic fertilizer). Ontologies thus provide a richer framework for representing relationships between concepts compared to traditional taxonomic hierarchies.	"['Taxonomy is the practice and science of classification. The word comes from the Greek τάξις, taxis, \'order\' + νόμος, nomos, \'law\' or \'science\'. Taxonomies, or taxonomic schemes, are composed of taxonomic units known as taxa (singular taxon), or kinds of things that are arranged frequently in a hierarchical structure, typically related by subtype-supertype relationships, also called parent-child relationships. In such a subtype-supertype relationship the subtype kind of thing has by definition the same constraints as the supertype kind of thing plus one or more additional constraints. For example, car is a subtype of vehicle. So any car is also a vehicle, but not every vehicle is a car. So, a thing needs to satisfy more constraints to be a car than to be a vehicle.\nOriginally the term taxonomy referred to the classifying of living organisms (now known as alpha taxonomy); however, the term is now applied in a wider, more general sense and now may refer to a classification of things, as well as to the principles underlying such a classification.\nAlmost anything — animate objects, inanimate objects, places, concepts, events, properties, and relationships — may be classified according to some taxonomic scheme.\nThe term taxonomy may also apply to relationship schemes other than parent-child hierarchies, such as network structures with other types of relationships. taxonomies may include single children with multi-parents, for example, ""Car"" might appear with both parents ""Vehicle"" and ""Steel Mechanisms""; to some however, this merely means that \'car\' is a part of several different taxonomies.\nA taxonomy might also be a simple organization of kinds of things into groups, or even an alphabetical list. However, the term vocabulary is more appropriate for such a list. In current usage within ""Knowledge Management"", taxonomies are seen as less broad than ontologies as ontologies apply a larger variety of relation types.\nMathematically, a hierarchical taxonomy is a tree structure of classifications for a given set of objects. It is also named Containment hierarchy. At the top of this structure is a single classification, the root node, that applies to all objects. Nodes below this root are more specific classifications that apply to subsets of the total set of classified objects. So for instance, in common schemes of scientific classification of organisms, the root is called ""Organism"" followed by nodes for the taxonomic ranks: Domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc.\nTaxonomy and mental classification\nSome have argued that the human mind naturally organizes its knowledge of the world into such systems. This view is often based on the epistemology of Immanuel Kant. Anthropologists have observed that taxonomies are generally embedded in local cultural and social systems, and serve various social functions. Perhaps the most well-known and influential study of folk taxonomies is Émile Durkheim\'s The Elementary Forms of Religious Life.\nIn phylogenetic taxonomy (or cladistic taxonomy), organisms can be classified by clades, which are based on evolutionary grouping by ancestral traits. By using clades as the criteria for separation, cladistic taxonomy, using cladograms, can categorize taxa into unranked groups.\nOther taxonomies, such as those analyzed by Durkheim and Lévi-Strauss, are sometimes called folk taxonomies to distinguish them from scientific taxonomies that claim to be disembedded from social relations and thus objective and universal.\nThe neologism folksonomy should not be confused with ""folk taxonomy"" (though it is obviously a contraction of the two words). Those who support scientific taxonomies have recently criticized folksonomies by dubbing them ""fauxonomies"" (French word ""faux"" means ""false"").\nThe phrase ""enterprise taxonomy"" is used in business to describe a very limited form of taxonomy used only within one organization. An example would be a certain method of classifying trees as ""Type A"", ""Type B"" and ""Type C"" used only by a certain lumber company for categorising log shipments.\n- Bloom\'s Taxonomy\n- Carolus Linnaeus, the father of systematics\n- Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Recognition, a fictional Chinese encyclopedia with an ""impossible"" taxonomic scheme.\n- Cladistics, the most prominent of several forms of phylogenetic systematics\n- Gellish English dictionary / Taxonomy, in which the concepts are arranged as a subtype-supertype hierarchy.\n- History of plant systematics\n- Jean-Baptiste Lamarck\n- Knowledge representation\n- Linnaean taxonomy\n- Phylogenetic Carl Woese demonstrates a new Taxon method to show evolution via chromosomal methods.\n- Scientific classification\n- SOLO Taxonomy\n- Species problem\n- Utter freedom via tagging and social constructs\n- Wikispecies Main Page\n- Integrated Taxonomic Information System\n- Taxonomy Browser of National Center for Biotechnology Information\n- Library of Taxonomy Resources\n- Metadata?

Ontologies provide a common language for different kinds of data to be easily interpretable and interoperable allowing easier aggregation and analysis.\nThe Agronomy Ontology (AgrO) provides terms from the agronomy domain that are semantically organized and can facilitate the collection, storage and use of agronomic data, enabling easy interpretation and reuse of the data by humans and machines alike.\nTo fully understand the implications of varying practices within cropping systems and derive insights, it is often necessary to pull together information from data in different disciplinary domains. For example, data on field management, soil, weather and crop phenotypes may need to be aggregated to assess performance of particular crop under different management interventions.\nHowever, agronomic data are often collected, described, and stored in inconsistent ways, impeding data comparison, mining, interpretation reuse. The use of standards for metadata and data annotation play a key role in addressing these challenges. While the CG Core Metadata Schema provides a metadata standard to describe agricultural datasets, the Agronomy Ontology enables the description of agronomic data variables using standard terms.\nAgrO is being built from traits and parameters identified by agronomists, the ICASA Data Dictionary, and other existing ontologies such as the Environment Ontology, the Unit Ontology, and the Phenotype and Trait Ontology and enriched with the support of several scientists who bring their domain knowledge.\nConsultant – IFPRI\nAlliance Bioversity International-CIAT\nScientist | Email\nAlliance Bioversity International-CIAT\nSenior research fellow | Module lead Big Data Platform\nProject Lead | Senior Research Fellow - IFPRI, Module Lead - CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture\nProject Co-Lead | Scientist - Alliance Bioversity International-CIAT\nOntology Expert and AgrO Developer | Associate Scientist - Alliance Bioversity International-CIAT\nPier Luigi Buttigieg\nData Scientist - Alfred Wegener Institute\nResearch assistant - Bioversity International (2015-2016)\nCoordinator, Computer Applications – University of Florida\nDepartment Head, Molecular Ecosystems Biology, Berkeley Lab\nRegional Deployment Manager, Latin America - IBP\nA key use case for AgrO is the Agronomy Field Information Management System (AgroFIMS). AgroFIMS enables digital collection of agronomic data that is semantically described a priori with agronomic terms from AgrO.\nIt consists of a web application used to design data collection templates for agricultural experiments by selecting variables annotated with AgrO and other relevant ontologies. These variables are sorted into a series of modules representing the typical cycle of operations in agronomic trial management, such as land preparation, irrigation, weeding, soil fertility, weather and soil parameters, and more. The field book application allows the creation of data collection sheets enabling standardization in data collection and description and linkages with breeding and other related data. In addition, AgroFIMS promotes digital collection of data to reduce error and ease data collection via the mobile apps: KDSMart, ODK, and Field Book.\nThe Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP)\nAgrO is being used by the University of Florida (UF), and researchers associated with the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) and IFPRI as a standard reference terminology to enable the generation and reuse of model-ready data.\nThe goal of this effort is to facilitate data queries in GARDIAN that include a measure of the appropriateness of each dataset for use in quantitative analyses. Each dataset will include metadata that fully describe the terminology used in that dataset with links to AgrO definitions and units.\nThe backbone of AgrO is based on formal categories from the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) shared by the ontologies of the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry family.\nThe mission of the OBO Foundry is to develop a family of interoperable ontologies that are both logically well-formed and scientifically accurate. Therefore, some terms in the AgrO ontology tree are generic, but necessarily so for AgrO to be interoperable with other ontologies. In further efforts towards such interoperability, AgrO reuses and builds on existing terms from other ontologies, thus minimizing term proliferation and duplication across multiple ontologies (c.f. table). This means that some terms in the AgrO ontology tree may be generic, but this is necessary for AgrO to be interoperable with other ontologies.\nTable: Ontologies used in AgrO\n|Ontology acronym||Ontology full name||Ontology content used in AgrO||Example of terms|\n|BFO||Basic Formal Ontology||Foundation of the ontology||entity, continuant, occurrent|\n|ChEBI||Chemical Entities of Biological Interest||Chemical entities along with their biochemical role||role fertilizer, chemical entity|\n|ENVO||Environment Ontology||Environments and entities||animal manure, soil, field|\n|IAO||Information Artifact Ontology||Information entities.

35	highest elevation mount hood stulser falls	Mount Hood in Oregon reaches an elevation of 11,239 feet (3,425m), while the Stulser waterfalls in Passeier Valley has a total height of 342 meters, making it the third highest waterfall in Europe.	['|Area||Passeier Valley, South Tyrol, Italy|\n|Start||St. Leonhard in Passeier|\n|End||Moos in Passeier (Return by public bus)|\n|Length||7 km||Duration||3 hours|\n|Ascent||420 meters||Descent||70 meters|\n|Easy Spring Summer Fall|\nIn 2015, a new hiking trail was opened up in the Passerschlucht gorge between St. Leonhard and Moos in Passeier. Spectacular metal walkways lead over river rapids and deep abysses and past waterfalls and steep slopes.\nThe hiking trail begins at the parking lot at the sports center in St. Leonhard in Passeier. Those arriving by public transport go to the bus station in the town center of St. Leonhard, or to the stop “Passeirerhof”, and then continue to the sports arena on foot.\nFrom the sports arena, you first go along the street on the right side of the Passer river up to a small bridge. There you cross to the other side of the river, and this is where the actual hiking trail begins.\nThe first half of the route is mainly on forest paths and over meadows. There are only two short sections with metal walkways.\nOn the way we pass the new “Psairer Genussomat” (basically “Passeier Enjoy-O-Mat” in English). A farmer from the region regularly refills it with products from his own farm shop and bottled drinks. Not a bad business idea;)\nEspecially in spring and after prolonged rain, water gushes out of every crack in the Passeier Valley. Usually it’s only small rivulets, but in some places full-blown waterfalls rush down the slope.\nThe Gomion-Langwies power plant\nIt’s no wonder that hydropower has been used here for quite some time. The old Gomion-Langwies power plant was built in 1955 in a simple wooden shack using a second-hand turbine built in 1928. 60 meters of descent produced an impressive 30 kilowatts of electrical power, which were used to operate both a mill and a sawmill.\nToday the power plant is a protected historical building and can be visited for free. Public toilets and picnic tables are also available.\nThe new power plant was built in 1983 on the opposite side of the Passer. It draws its water from the Salderenbach, a tributary river of the Passer, and can produce up to 770 kilowatts from a descent of 330 meters – more than 20 times as much as its predecessor.\nWater and steel\nFrom here the valley becomes significantly narrower and from now on the path goes much more often over the new steel walkways installed in 2015. These walkways do not just simplify the ascent in many places, but also enable completely new perspectives on the river.\nThe Stulser waterfalls\nIt’s worth keeping an eye on the other side of the valley and lifting your head every now and then. Especially at the point where the Stuller waterfalls plunge down the slope a whopping 342 meters in three stages. Taken together, the three stages form the third highest waterfall in Europe. There even is a via ferrata next to the waterfall!\nHigher and higher the steel walkways continue along the spectacular slope, while the Passer river loudly rushes downstream deep down in the valley.\nColors deep down\nFinally we are getting closer to the river again. The clear water shines in shades of blue and turquoise, and on the red and blue colored rocks the mosses, lichens and plants grow in bright green and yellow. What a blaze of colors!\nWith so much water, of course, toads and frogs in all of their variations are never far away. These friends here were just thawing in the sunlight and staid still long enough for a show 🙂\nThe viewing platform\nShortly before the end of the path there is a small viewing platform from which one has a particularly good view of the gorge.\nAt this point you can also, after some climbing, take a look at the only relic from the times before the ultra-modern steel walkways. How long might this old wooden bridge have been rotting away? The last bits of wood will probably not be able to hold up much longer …\nThe imposing barrier at the end of the gorge also marks the end of the hiking trail. It holds back large material such as boulders and tree trunks, which would otherwise be washed into the gorge after the snowmelt and prolonged rainfall.\nAs you can see, this is sorely needed …\nThe last steel walkway crosses over the barrier. Here you can change sides one last time and reach Moos in Passeier, the final destination of our hike.\nMoos in Passeier\nThe paths separate at the small Holy-Cross-Chapel: those who want to take the public bus back to St. Leonhard follow the short climb to the bus stop in the town center. A return to St. Leonhard via the Grafeilweg path is also possible, but not particularly recommended.\nOtherwise, you can also reach the aforementioned via ferrata at the Stulser waterfalls from here.\nA visit to the “Mooseum” bunker museum is highly recommended. It was built in an unfinished bunker of the Alpine Wall built in the 1930s, and houses exhibitions on the history of the Passeier Valley and the Texel Group Nature Park.', 'You are watching: Relative location of portland, oregon\nAs it was observed on the map, the Pacific Ocean coastline of the state is occupied by the rugged hills (some over 1,000 ft. High), moist rainforests, and also fertile valleys. In the southerly part, the soil rises into the seaside Mountain variety and the Klamath Mountains. Both that these hill ranges space a series of relatively low and heavily-forested peaks, that are in turn punctuated by numerous small lakes.\nSituated directly to the eastern of these mountains is the Willamette Lowlands – the stretch south, around 175 miles from the Portland area. This productive strip of land is dissected through the Willamette flow which rises in the Cascades and then flows phibìc draining right into the Columbia River.\nTo the eastern of the Willamette Lowlands stand the majestic Cascades Range. This chain of volcano peaks has several forested hill ranges such as Mt. Jefferson, Mt. McLoughlin, and the 3 Sisters. Significant on the map by one upright yellow triangle is mountain Hood – the state’s highest possible point, i m sorry rises to an key of 11,239ft (3,425m).\nLocated in the south-central part of Oregon is Crater Lake – the deepest lake in the unified States, that has actually a depth the 1,949ft (594m).\nThe Columbia Plateau extends southern from Washington and also covers much of eastern Oregon. The plateau has been formed by ancient lava flows and also is a landscape of deep, broad valleys and rugged mountains, which likewise includes the Blue and also Wallowa hills in the northeastern part of the state.\nThe most significant rivers that the state room the Columbia and also Snake rivers. The Columbia river rises in the Canadian province of brother Columbia and also then flows south through the state the Washington into Oregon, forming most that the organic northern border between the two states. The Snake river rises in the grand Tetons that Wyoming and also flows come the Columbia river in Washington State. Other major rivers the the state incorporate the Deschutes, john Day, Owyhee, Rogue, and also Willamette rivers. The waters of the Snake river dissect the Hells Canyon - the deepest canyon in America, located on the Idaho-Oregon border, in ~ a preferably depth the 7,993ft (2,463m).\nLocated in the southeastern component of Oregon is the Harney basin – i m sorry is a part of the larger good Basin an ar of the western joined States. The container encompasses an area of 3,859 sq. Km and also is an arid and flat large of soil that has actually no natural outlet to the sea. The major features that the basin include the freshwater Malheur Lake, the saline Harney Lake, and also the Steens Mountains.

36	thai reading website anowl why created	AnOwl was created to fill the gap left by the closure of many fiction magazines in Thailand. It serves as an online meeting point for writers and readers, providing a platform where authors can present their work under professional editorial supervision. The website functions as a weekly magazine with novels as its main content, offering free access to carefully selected literary works from both established and emerging writers.	['A NEW Thai-language website full of literary fiction debuted last Monday – and immediately crashed because fan interest overloaded its server. The founders got the technical glitch resolved and more than 4,000 people could resume reading. It’s a number that’s bound to rise much further.\nThe key founders of AnOwl are three novelists who were already popular under the pennames Piyaporn Sakkasem, Pongsakorn and Kingchat.\nPiyaporn – real name Nantaporn Sarntigasem – is the author of such hit titles as “Tawan Tor Saeng”, “Sai See Plueng” and “Rak Nakara”. The many fiction-friendly magazines that have folded in recent years left writers and readers without a “meeting point”, she says.\n“The magazines provided a stage for writers to present their work under the care of professional editors. The readership hasn’t declined, but the consumer’s media-consumption behaviour changed. We want to fill the empty hole with an online community for readers and writers.”\nAnOwl aims to fill the folded magazines’ role as meeting points for authors and readers.\nThey needed a name for the site that was meaningful in both Thai and English. AnOwl fits the bill because the owl in Western culture symbolises wisdom, and AnOwl resembles the Thai for “reading for (a specific purpose)”.\nAnOwl is billed as a weekly magazine with novels forming the backbone of the free content. Piyaporn, Kingchat (Parichat Salicupt) and Pongsakorn (Dr Pongsakorn Chindawatana) share the editorial duties. Another five founding members have worked in the publishing business for many years.\n“In these days of digital news, more and more people are turning to social media, resulting in a constant decline in readership for conventional newspapers and magazines,” says Kingchat, whose best sellers include “Pornprom Onlawaeng”, “Sera Daran”, “Buag Hong” and “Sood Saneh Ha”.\n“The time has come for us to adapt to the interactive digital platform, but we need to retain the high quality of a good magazine. We’ll try to keep our content free as long as possible because we don’t want to burden our readers.”\nThe inaugural content is 10 novels, free for the reading.\nThe initial content is 10 novels that have never been published – by both celebrated and emerging writers. More will be added later.\nOn the computer or phone screen, the pages look like those of a magazine, and there’s a cover and preface as with hard-copy books. There are also articles – trade news, reviews and other items of interest.\n“When magazines were flourishing, any author who got his work published earned an automatic guarantee regarding his writing ability,” says Pongsakorn, who has garnered acclaim for the novels “Roi Mai”, “Sab Phusa” and “Kol Kimono”. All three were adapted for television.\nThree noted authors are among the site’s founders – by their pennames from left, Pongsakorn, Kingchat and Piyaporn Sakkasem.\n“The three of us rose to fame thanks to the editors at the magazines who coached us about suitable content and proper timing,” he says. “From our experience working with them, we can now carefully select the novels and articles appearing at AnOwl. The readers won’t feel that they’re jumping into a sea of content.”\nCurrently on the site is Pongsakorn’s new novel, “Irrawaddy Kliew Krasip”, inspired by the Burmese sacking of Ayutthaya in 1767, when thousands of citizens were carried off into slavery.\nPiyaporn’s latest novel, “Duangjai Rabai See”, is also there, comparing the characters of three men living in New York, Giverny and Auvers-sur-Oise to the colours of red, yellow and blue, based on paintings by Toulouse-Lautrec, Monet and Van Gogh.\nAnd Kingchat continues her series about the mythical Himmapan Forest in “Nin Nakin”, this time using a fresh penname, Alina.\nSoi Hong Saeng by Mala Kamchan\nPongsakorn says it’s “an honour” to be publishing the new work “Soi Hong Saeng” by SEA Write Award winner Mala Kamchan. “He was writing the novel for Khwan Ruen magazine, but it shut down before he was finished.”\nTo keep the content free for as long as possible, none of the contributors are asking for remuneration.\n“There are many fiction sites open to rookie writers and it’s hard for any one writer to stand out,” says Piyaporn. “One site might be bombarded with 50,000 submissions, so the readers also have difficulty picking one that meets their preferences.\n“So, since we were born from magazines like Sakulthai and Khwan Ruen, we want our site to be a platform for emerging writers and we carefully select works that are interesting and touching.”\nAmong the new faces is the pen-named Parb, whose detective fiction “Kahon Mahorlatueg” was adapted for a TV drama that’s currently airing on One Channel. His new work, “Ling Padkorn”, is a murder mystery.\nAlso new on the scene is Karn, whose favourite authors are Agatha Christie and Stephen King. His debut novel is “The Never-ending (Love) Story”.\nNew fiction website AnOwl.co is a digital magazine of carefully selected novels by both celebrated and emerging authors. For now, at least, it’s all free.\nPongsakorn says his personal favourite at the moment is the writer using the penname Nak Hayra, whose work is normally found online. “She graduated in history and has spent more than a decade in South Korea. Her style is very interesting. Her new work with us, ‘Phusa Haeng Racha’, is about the Japanese occupation of Korea during the war.”\nApatsaphorn Supapa, who writes as Pasrasaa, presents her new mystery story at AnOwl, “Game Archa”, with an equestrian theme.\nApatsaphorn, 35, says she’s “a loyal fan” of the site’s founding authors and didn’t hesitate to contribute when they invited her.\n“I wasn’t even born during the heyday of magazines, so usually I publish at sites like Dek-d and Fictionlog. There are a lot of fiction websites today, but AnOwl stands out because the works are so well screened.”\nEven with so many channels available to writers, says Apatsaphorn – who’s written more than 40 works of fiction in the past 15 years – it’s still not easy to get recognised.\n“Older writers had the magazines, but my generation relies mainly on word of mouth. To become famous, we have to be disciplined and determined and write about what we’re really interested in.”\nThe founders say readership hasn’t declined, but rather consumer behaviour has changed.\nAn article on AnOwl pays tribute to the late beloved editor Suphat Sawasdirak of Sakulthai weekly magazine, which recently closed after more than 60 years. Sakulthai was the foremost magazine for novelists and gave many noted authors their start, such as Tomyantee and Krisna Asoksin.\nAlso planned is a series of videos with authors helping chefs prepare dishes mentioned in their books. Ready for posting are demonstrations of how to make the souffle that Kingchat featured in “Sood Saneh Ha” and the oily cooked rice Pongsakorn dreamed up for “Irrawaddy Kliew Krasip”.\nReaders will soon find a podcast as well, and an audio series about what’s happening in publishing circles.\nIncome will be raised through workshops that are being organised on writing fiction, together with the field trips tracking the footsteps of characters in novels.\n“I was groomed by Suphat Sawasdirak – such a talented editor,” says Piyaporn. “She once compared a magazine to a meal of dishes cooked with different techniques – boiling, stir-frying, sauteeing, currying, frying, plus desserts and fruit – that satisfies every taste. We want AnOwl to be like that too.”\nHOMES ON THE NET\nKeep up to date at www.AnOwl.co and follow the “anowldotco” page on Facebook.']	['<urn:uuid:b6f5bb11-b0f6-4462-8339-9cc081946414>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	6	68	1240
37	role human reason divine guidance moral choices describe relationship influence	Human reason and divine guidance work together in moral decision-making. Through reason, humans can discover natural moral codes and understand what is right, as supported by both classical and Christian traditions. According to Natural Law theory, God gave humans the ability to use reason and experience to understand moral truths, making moral life one lived according to reason. However, from the Christian perspective, this process is enhanced by the Holy Spirit's gifts, which enable proper discernment and comprehension of revealed truth. The Holy Spirit provides sanctifying grace and infused virtues that empower people to act morally. This creates a system where human reason works in conjunction with divine guidance through the four levels of law: eternal, divine, natural, and human law, all working together to help humans achieve their purpose of fellowship with God.	"['Piety the Just Gift\nby Mary Lanser\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, among others, teaches that the gift of piety perfects the virtue of justice. This synergistic relationship between piety and justice comes down to us through the ages from both classical ethics and Christian morality, although the interaction is distinctly different in each system respectively.Share\nSocrates, in his dialogue with Euthyphro, turns his entire argument on the virtue of piety in itself. The discussion of piety in itself, as opposed to pious things, finally helps us to realize that there is indeed a middle ground between relativistic justice, and justice as a rigid universal moral virtue with respect to one\'s duty to the gods and family and state. [Plato] There is a natural balance in a good life that is pleasing to the gods and that keeps man, his family and his community from tearing apart from the stresses of polarized extremes.\nSo we can say that justice as an acquired or natural virtue often concerns keeping the passions in check so that we do not allow baser instincts to blind us to what is right and what is true in any situation requiring that we choose or discriminate among various thoughts, words or deeds. In this way piety, as a known duty to ones gods, family and country, encourages or promotes just words and deeds.\nSt. Peter of Damaskos cites St. Dionysios the Areopagite, in The Divine Names as saying that God is praised through justice. [The Divine Names VIII, 7, P.G.iii, 893D] And St. Peter says that this is indeed true because “...justice is sometimes called discrimination: it establishes the just mean in every undertaking, so that there will be no falling short...or excess.” [Philokalia, Vol. 3, p.258] In this understanding of justice, it also appears that balance is a desirous outcome for the two virtues of piety and justice.\nHowever we must remember that Plato\'s gods warred among themselves, and visited evil upon mankind, and unjustly abused mankind, as often as they bestowed goodness. In Plato\'s world the gods were the source of both good and evil. In the world of classical Greek and Rome, a balanced life hopes to mark out a path between most unforgiving extremes of good and evil, justice and injustice, piety and impiety.\nHowever, for St. Dionysios, as it is for all Christians, God is the source of all goodness. God is never seen as the source of evil at all, in any form or fashion. Balance is not at all the desired outcome of leading a virtuous life in Christian terms. The desired outcome for a Christian life quite simply put is the beatific vision. So that all that we do and all that we are must be directed toward that end, by faith, in the hope that we may be granted the grace of union with the divine and the beatific vision.\nIn The Divine Names, St. Dionysios said:Again the title Righteousness is given to God because he assigns what is appropriate to all things; He distributes their due proportion, beauty, rank, arrangement, their proper and fitting place and order according to a most just and righteous determination. He is the cause of their individual activity. It is the righteousness of God which orders everything...it gives the appropriate and deserved qualities to everything and that it preserves the nature of each being in its due order and power. [The Divine Names, VIII, 7]Rather than seeking a life in balance, the Christian seeks to discover the right order in Creation, by the power of the Holy Spirit, through the guidance of Scripture and life in the Body of Christ, the Church. It is the Holy Spirit and the gifts of the Holy Spirit in our lives that makes it possible for us to be able to discern rightly, to comprehend revealed truth, and to live lives of self-discipline and self-control. It is in this way that the fathers and the tradition of the Church can teach that “piety perfects justice.” Without the divine grace to obtain perfect justice or what is also called infused justice, then we would never be able to even begin to see Creation as God see is. We would never begin to be able to have a creatures share in the divine life.\n""God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, \'Abba! Father!\'"" (Gal 4:6). ""All who are led by the Spirit are children of God... It is that very Spirit bearing witness to our spirit that we are children of God"" (Rm 8:14, 16). The words of the Apostle Paul remind us that the fundamental gift of the Spirit is sanctifying grace (gratia gratum faciens), with which we receive the theological virtues—faith, hope and charity—and all the infused virtues (virtutes infusae), which enable us to act under the influence of the Holy Spirit. Unlike the charisms, which are bestowed for the service of others, these gifts are offered to all, because they are intended to lead the person to sanctity and perfection. [JPII, ""Letter to Priests, For Holy Thursday"" 1998]\nPiety does not merely influence or prompt justice or set a balanced path between two extremes. Piety perfects justice in that it divinely empowers us to discern what God intends as the right order of all Creation. The ability to turn our will to the rightly ordered divine will is the hoped for result of the perfection of justice. It is the purpose of the divine gift of piety or reverence that we have the necessary spiritual tools that will enable us to know the mind of God, for as we read in the book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:20 ""Woe to those who call evil good, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.""\nTo quote from Luke 18 (Douay-Rheims 1899 American Edition):2...There was a judge in a certain city, who feared not God, nor regarded man. 3 And there was a certain widow in that city, and she came to him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary. 4 And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God, nor regard man,5 Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me. 6 And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith. 7 And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night: and will he have patience in their regard? 8 I say to you, that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?It is by the power of the Holy Spirit that it is possible for any of us at all to have faith. God, the Just Judge, has given us all that we need to attain the ultimate end of every soul in everlasting life, a share in the divine life in the presence of the beatific vision. Such a sublime justice!! Glory to God for all things!', ""Aristotle's Influence on Natural Law\nAquinas studied Aristotle’s work at the University of Naples at the age of 14 and he was greatly influenced by what he read. Aquinas agreed with Aristotle that the ability to reason was a key element of human existence. Aquinas also used many of Aristotle’s terms in his Natural Law theory. He supported Aristotle’s idea of being efficient and final causes. Aquinas agreed with Aristotle that everything in the world had a purpose.\nAquinas Natural Law\nEverything in the world, including humans, was designed for a good purpose. Through reason, humans can discover a natural moral code or natural law to follow in order to achieve their purpose which isfellowship with God.\nDefinition of Natural Law\nNatural Law is an ethical theory based on the concept of a final cause or purpose which determines everything’s proper or natural use.\nAristotle and Aquinas believed that the highest good, the fellowship with God, for which we must aim, could be discovered through using human reason. The human nature given to human beings by God enables them to use their reason and experience to understand what is right. Moral life is a life lived according to reason. Reason leads a person to arrive at the right course of action when faced with a moral dilemma.\nAquinas adopted Aristotle’s thinking that everything in the natural world has a purpose. Aquinas agreed that in fulfilling its final cause something can be called good. Aquinas believed that the order and purpose he observed in the world reflected Gods will. Aquinas said that an object achieves its final cause (purpose) and is good when it does what God intended it to do. Like everything else in creation, humans achieve their final cause (purpose) when they do what God intended them to do. The purpose of humans, being made in the image of God, is fellowship of God.\nAbsolutist and Deontological Theory\nAbsolutism- The view that there are universal moral norms which apply in all situations and at all times to all people; the view that certain actions are always good or evil, regardless of the context or situation in which the act is performed.\nDeontological- A type of ethical theory which states that actions are right or wrong in themselves regardless of the consequences. This approach proposes that there are certain rules or principles that inform or guide people as to which actions are right or wrong.\nFour levels of Law\nEternal Law is the belief that God made an controls the universe and which only God knows completely. Humans often notice reflections of the law through science/ natural world.\nDivine law is the law of god revealed to people through the bible and the teachings of Jesus and the church. It reflects the eternal law of god and this reflection can only be seen by those who believed in God.\nNatural law is the moral law of God. Everyone has a natural sense that good is to be done and evil avoided. Everyone, whether theist or atheist, can use reason to determine the right action.\nHuman law is everyday rules which govern our lives from the legal system.\nAquinas believed in order for humans to survive and fulfil their purpose, they had to live in a civilised society. This means that there must be a rule to follow where good is to be done and evil is to be avoided. Aquinas set 5 primary precepts (laws/rules) that he thought a society should follow:\nProtect and preserve the innocent\nSecondary precpts are rulings about things we should or shouldn't do because they uphold, or fail the primary precepts.""]"	['<urn:uuid:06c28262-c217-4e40-83cf-72b21bffe7dc>', '<urn:uuid:ab8236c8-f5b6-4367-8912-6ad7780728e9>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	10	134	1791
38	When looking at data analysis patterns, what's the key difference between cup and handle pattern's requirements for interpolation and standard aggregation functions' requirements for interpolation?	The cup and handle pattern requires no interpolation - it must be formed by actual price action with a proper U-shaped cup (not too steep or flat) and a handle consolidation period. In contrast, standard aggregation functions perform interpolation under specific conditions: when at least one other input time series reports a real data value at the same moment, and when the time series has actual reported values on either side of the interpolation point.	"[""Trading the Cup and Handle Pattern\nWilliam O'Neal gave us the cup and handle patterns in his 1988 book titled “How to Make Money in Stocks”. Even though this chart pattern was initially developed for the stock market, the forex market can also be traded with chart patterns and so the cup and handle pattern has been successfully applied to the technical analysis of the forex market.\nThe cup and handle pattern is a bullish continuation pattern, made up of two parts: the cup and the handle. The cup and handle pattern indicates a period of price advance following an initial bullish period and a period of consolidation. The initial bullishness is formed after a rounding bottom occurs. This rounding bottom is what forms the cup. Then follows a period of price consolidation (the handle), and at the completion of this handle, the price breaks out and resumes the bullish trend.\nTracing the Cup and Handle Pattern\nThe cup and handle pattern is a complex pattern and it is imperative that the trader is able to trace it correctly in order not to make mistakes. What forms the “cup” part of this pattern is actually a rounding bottom pattern, which has been discussed here.\nThe trader should first start from the correct trace of the cup. A cup whose curve is too steep as to form a “V” rather than a lightly curved “U” will not produce a good cup. A good cup should be deep enough but not too flat as to resemble a saucer. The depth of the cup should be equivalent to a 1/3 to 1/2 retracement from the high of the initial trend.\nThe brim of the cup should be formed by a resistance line that cuts across two points on the price action, directly above the cup.\nFollowing this is the handle, which is actually a period of consolidation. A handle may resemble a pennant or a flag. Here the price will oscillate between the upper and lower trendline that forms the handle.\nOnce the cup and handle have been identified as the price action of the currency pair evolves, the trader should prepare for a bullish breakout by observing a period when the candlesticks close above the upper trend line of the handle. When this happens, the breakout will occur to the upside. The cup and handle pattern is a bullish pattern, so the only trade possible here is a long trade.\nThe only point at which a BUY should be initiated should be at the break of the upper trend line of the handle aspect of this pattern. Take a look at the chart below for the fine details of the cup and handle pattern:\nThe exit strategy for this pattern should be to use the pip distance between the brim and the lowest part of the cup, and extrapolate this to the distance between the candle break and the upside. After the first target is reached, the trader can close half the position and apply a trailing stop to chase the price action to its logical conclusion."", ""You can combine points from multiple time series using an aggregation function such as\npercentile() etc. An aggregation function returns a series of points whose values are calculated from corresponding points in two or more input time series. Tanzu Observability by Wavefront supports aggregation with interpolation or without interpolation:\n- Standard aggregation functions (e.g.\nmax()) first interpolate the points of the underlying set of series, and then apply the aggregation function to the interpolated series. These functions aggregate multiple series down, usually to a single series.\n- Raw aggregation functions (e.g.\nrawavg()) do not interpolate the underlying series before aggregation.\n- Moving window functions (e.g.\nmmax()aggregate series horizontally across a chart by time. They take each individual series and aggregate its own prior behavior across the timeWindow. For example, you can get the maximum value for each series in the specified time window.\nIn the following video, Wavefront co-founder Clement Pang explains how interpolation works:\nAggregating Data Points That Line Up\nThe easiest way to see the results of an aggregation function is when all of the input series report their data points at exactly the same time. This causes the points at any given timestamp to all line up. The aggregation function operates on the values in each lineup of points, and returns each result in a point at the corresponding timestamp.\nFor example, consider the two time series in the following chart. The reporting interval for these series is 1 minute, and the points in these series “line up” at each 1-minute mark on the x-axis. We use a point plot to reveal the correspondences between reported points.\nNow we use the\nsum() function to aggregate these two time series. Each blue point produced by\nsum() is the result of adding the data values reported by the input series at the same minute.\nAggregating When Data Points Do Not Line Up\nIn many cases, the set of time series you specify to an aggregation function will have data points that do not “line up” at corresponding moments in time. For example:\n- All input series might report data points regularly, but some might report at a longer or shorter interval than the others.\n- One input series might report at irregular times that don’t match the reporting times of any other input series.\n- One otherwise regular input series might have gaps due to reporting interruptions (e.g., intermittent server or network downtime) which are not experienced by the other input series.\nThe query engine provides two kinds of aggregation functions for handling this situation:\n- Standard aggregation functions fill in the gaps in each input series by interpolating values, and therefore operate on interpolated values as well as actual reported data points.\n- Raw aggregation functions do not interpolate the underlying series before aggregation, but rather operate only on actual reported data points.\nStandard Aggregation Functions (Interpolation)\nStandard aggregation functions fill in the gaps in each input series by interpolating values.\nFor example, let’s start with a pair of series with reporting intervals that do not line up. In the following chart,\nseries 1 reports once a minute. We can use\nalign() to have\nseries 2 report only every 150 seconds (2.5 minutes). Both series have data points aligned at the 5 minute marks, but the points in between are not aligned.\nNow we use the\nsum() function (a standard aggregation function) to aggregate these two time series. In the following chart, we see that\nsum() produces a result for every moment in time that a data point is reported by at least one input series. Whenever both series report a data point at the same time (at each 5 minute mark),\nsum() returns a data point whose value is the sum of both reported points.\nThe result at 6:43 is more interesting. At this moment in time, only series 1 reports a point, but\nsum() returns the value 284.00.\nsum() produces the return value by adding the actual value of series 1 to an interpolated value from\nseries 2. Interpolation inserts an implicit point into\nseries 2 at 6:43, and assigns an estimated value to that point based on the values of the actual, reported points.\nsum() uses the estimated value (in this case, 139) to calculate the value returned at 6:43.\nRequirements for Interpolation\nThe query engine interpolates a value into an input time series only under the following circumstances:\nWhen at least one other input time series reports a real data value at the same moment in time. In our example, no values are interpolated at, say, 4:26:30, because neither input series reports a point at that time.\nWhen the time series has an actual reported value on either side of it. Sometimes this cannot occur, for example, when a new data point has not been reported yet at the right edge of a live-view chart. In this case, the query engine inserts implicit points wherever needed, and assigns the last known reported value in the time series to those implicit points. (The last known reported value must be reported within the last 15% of the query time in the chart window.)\nRaw Aggregation Functions (No Interpolation)\nYou can use raw aggregation functions instead of standard aggregation functions if you want the results to be based on actual reported values, without any interpolated values. For example, you might use raw aggregation results as a way of detecting when one or more input time series fail to report a value.\nLet’s see how the raw aggregation function\nrawsum() treats the two sample time series from the previous section. The following chart shows that\nsum(), produces a result for every moment in time that a data point is reported by at least one input series.\nrawsum() produces its results by adding up just the actual values at each reporting moment. At 4:26, for example,\nrawsum() returns 164.00, which is the only value reported at this time. No values from\nseries 2 are present at that time, and none are interpolated.\nWhenever both series report a data point at the same time (for example, 4:25),\nrawsum() returns a data point whose value is the sum of both reported points (169.05 + 162 = 331.05).\nFiltering the Aggregation Input\nYou use an expression to describe the set of time series to be aggregated. When using a ts() expression, you can include filters to narrow the set. For example, if multiple sources are reporting the metric\nsum(ts(~sample.cpu.loadavg.1m))shows the sum of the values reported for the metric from all sources.\nsum(ts(~sample.cpu.loadavg.1m, source=app-1*))shows the sum of the values reported for the metric, but only from sources that match\nsum(ts(~sample.cpu.loadavg.1m, source=app-1*, env=prod))further filters the input series to those with the point tag\nGrouping the Aggregation Results\nEach aggregation function accepts a ‘group by’ parameter that allows you to subdivide the input time series into groups, and request separate aggregates for each group.\nFor grouping, we support:\n- The implicit ‘group by’ parameter after a comma, discussed here.\n- An explicit\n- An explicit\nA chart displays a separate line for each group when you use a ‘group by’ parameter with an aggregation function. For example, assume your environment uses an\naz point tag to group by availability zone. You call:\nThe call groups the result of the call to\nsum() into two time series, one for each availability zone.\n|'Group By' Parameter||Description||Example|\n|metrics||Group the series with the same metric name.||\n|sources||Group the series that are reported from the same source.||\n|sourceTags||Group the series that are reported from sources with the same source tag names. A source tag is valid only if it is explicitly specified in the ts() expression.||\n|pointTags||Group the series by all available point tag keys.||\n|<pointTagKey>||Group the series with common values for a particular point tag key. Specify the point tag key by name, such as\nYou can the following grouping keywords in a query:\nbykeyword has the same result as the comma in a query. The following two queries are equivalent:\nsum(ts(~sample.cpu.loadavg.1m), az, sources) sum(ts(~sample.cpu.loadavg.1m) by (az, sources))\nwithoutkeyword allows you to group all possible group parameters except for those listed. The following example groups all available grouping parameters except for sources and source tags. In this case, that means grouping by the two point tag keys\nA Closer Look at Grouping with\nsourceTags parameter behaves a little differently from the other grouping parameters.\nsourceTags produces a subgroup that corresponds to each source tag that is explicitly specified in the ts() expression. No other source tags are taken into account.\nFor example, suppose you added 3 source tags (\nhighPriority) to the metric\ncpu.loadavg.1m, and now you want to use the\nsourceTags parameter with\nsum() to return subtotals based on the source tags.\nThe following query returns only 2 subtotals - one for the group with the source tag\nprodand one for the group with the source tag\nsum(ts(cpu.loadavg.1m, tag=prod or tag=db),sourceTags)\nThe following query returns 3 subtotals, one for each source tag:\nsum(ts(cpu.loadavg.1m, tag=prod or tag=db or tag=highPriority),sourceTags)\nIn contrast, a ‘group by’ parameter like\npointTags produces a separate aggregate corresponding to every point tag that is associated with the specified time series, even if the ts() expression does not explicitly specify any point tags as filters.\nThe chart below represents 3 unique series reporting latency data. The sections with dashed lines represent gaps where no data is reported.\nThe series report data like this:\n- Two of the reporting series have gaps of missing data between 9:15a and 9:21a.\n- All three reporting series have gaps of missing data between 9:27a and 9:30a\n- One reporting series has a gap of missing data between 9:36a and 9:42a.\nThe following chart shows what happens when we apply\nsum() (orange line) and\nrawsum() (blue line) to the three time series.\nThe lines are different because interpolation occurs with the standard aggregation function (\nsum()), but not with the raw aggregation function (\nExample: Standard Aggregation Function\nWhen there is at least 1 true data value reported at a given interval, standard aggregation functions interpolate data values before executing the aggregation.\nThe data values in the charts above are typically reported once a minute. In the chart that shows the 3 time series, we see that:\n- Between 9:15a and 9:21a, the orange series reports once a minute, on the minute, while the other two series do not. Because the orange series reports at least 1 true data value during this time, the query engine interpolates the values for the blue and green series before calculating the\n- Between 9:36a and 9:42a the green and orange series report data values every minute, but the blue series does not. The query engine does interpolation before aggregation.\nExample: Raw Aggregation Function\nRaw aggregation functions on the other hand calculate aggregates based on actual reported values (no interpolation).\n- Between 9:15a and 9:21a, the\nrawsum()values are approximately 1/3 of the\nsum()values (1 of 3 series reported values)\n- Between 9:36a and 9:42a, the\nrawsum()values are approximately 2/3 of the\nsum()value (2 of 3 series reported values).\nNote that the gap between 9:27a and 9:30a is exactly the same regardless of which aggregation function type we use. None of the series included in the aggregation reported a data value during this time. As a result, the standard aggregation function does not apply interpolated values during this gap, and the result of aggregation looks the same for\nThe behavior differences between standard and raw apply to all aggregation functions (sum, avg, min, max, count, variance, percentile).\nAggregation Best Practice – When to Use Raw or Aggregated Data\nYour use case and data shape determines whether running queries over raw data or over aggregated data makes more sense.\n- Use aggregated data if you want quick and precise results for all points in time in which at least one time series reported.\n- Use raw data if you aggregate over a large search space (many time series, long time). When the system has to perform interpolation (see above) over a large search space, query performance can suffer.\n- As a compromise, consider calling\nalign()before applying raw aggregation functions, for example,\nHere are some details:\nWhat’s Your Data Shape?\nInterpolation requires additional resources. Using a non-raw aggregation function on several thousand time series might affect query performance – and if you’re looking at several weeks or months of data, you’ll need even more resources. For those cases, consider using raw aggregation, which comes at the cost of slightly less precision.\nAre Skipped Values Common in the Data You’re Analyzing?\nConsider whether your time series have natural gaps and what you want to do for those cases. For example, suppose you want to aggregate the number of errors reported across multiple time series. Does the time series report 0 at regular intervals when no errors occur or skip the reporting interval?\n- If the time series reports 0 when there’s no value, you don’t need interpolation and can safely use the raw aggregation function.\n- If the time series skips the reporting interval, consider whether you want interpolation, that is, “pretend” there is a value even though there is no value – or possibly change the data sources to report 0 is a solution.\nAre Reporting Intervals Staggered?\nIf reporting intervals are staggered, non-raw aggregation (and interpolation) can give you quick value.\nFor example, suppose you’re evaluating 10 time series over a 1 hour window. Each time series reports once per minute, but they don’t report at the same time (align). By using a non-raw aggregation function you can get interpolation and a fast result.\nIf, in that same scenario, you’re evaluating 1000 time series over a 1 week time window, a large data set results and interpolation might impact performance. For that case, you can use\nalign() together with a raw aggregation function to get the benefit of aligned data without the performance hit of interpolation, for example:\nThe KB article When to use raw vs. non-raw aggregation gives additional detail.""]"	['<urn:uuid:5ed5d5ac-4ddb-4efa-88e7-823d568035b0>', '<urn:uuid:fa16ac7f-29b4-4d39-8c13-bfdd73efe19c>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	25	75	2849
39	how many copies spillane book kiss me deadly	The Signet paperback edition of Mickey Spillane's novel sold approximately 20 million copies.	['The screening of brand new black-and-white prints at the World 3-D Film Expo in September 2003 in Hollywood provided an opportunity to reevaluate three films noir of the 1950s and to consider their effectiveness as stereoscopic narratives within the genre. The shimmering new prints were given optimum presentation and it’s quite possible these 3-D films didn’t even look this good on their first presentation in the 1950s.\nThe term “film noir,” literally “black film,” was first coined by French film critic Nino Frank when an exhibition of post-World War II American movies was held in Paris in August 1946 which included The Maltese Falcon (1941), Laura (1944), Murder, My Sweet (1944), and Double Indemnity (1944). Films noir were dark, visually and thematically, and featured characters such as con men, crooked cops, bookies and very deadly femmes fatal. The overriding mood of film noir was one of paranoia, cynicism and fatalism with stories largely set in night time urban environments. Sex and violence were also inextricably linked in film noir, twin threads entangling the protagonist in his inevitable downfall.\nEdmond O’Brien was a recurring Everyman in films noir. In the 1950 (2-D) release D.O.A., directed by Rudolph Mate, O’Brien portrayed Frank Bigelow, a small-town certified accountant who, on a vacation to San Francisco, is accidentally poisoned and finds that he has less than 48 hours to live. The story is told in flashback and the film opens with narration by Bigelow who is dead as the story begins.\nAfter the success of Bwana Devil (which had opened November 26, 1952), Columbia Studios hurriedly put together their first 3-D motion picture, Man in the Dark, which opened April 8,1953 as the second 3-D feature film to be released, one day before House of Wax. Edmond O’Brien was the perfect choice to portray Steve Rawley, a gangster who undergoes brain surgery to eliminate his criminal tendencies. When the film opens, Rawley is an amnesiac in a hospital who can’t remember his former life.\nThe effect of the stereoscopic imaging in the opening scenes gives the narrative an immediacy in which the audience can readily identify with the baffled Rawley. This same spatial and temporal presence pulls the viewer into the story as Rawley’s former gangster associates kidnap him to find the $130,000 he had hidden away before the operation.\nWhen Rawley meets up with Peg Benedict (Audrey Totter), his former girlfriend, memory starts to return. He escapes and, with Benedict’s assistance, finds the hidden money. Periodically, an insurance investigator shows up, on the trail of the sequestered cash. Stereoscopic images of Rawley experiencing a dream on an amusement pier, in which his memory fully returns, are highly effective.\nFlat rear-screen projection is combined with stereoscopic foreground imagery for a climax on a roller coaster in which Rawley exchanges gunfire with the gangsters. Man in the Dark was shot in just 11 days using a twin camera rig assembled by Columbia Studios engineer Gerald Rackett and camera department head Emil Oster. The 3-D unit used two Mitchell cameras shooting straight on without any prisms or mirrors and produced pairs of stereo negatives that did not require subsequent reversal or optical treatment. The two Mitchell cameras were mounted side-by-side with one inverted to bring the lenses closer together. The film magazines for both cameras were mounted on top.\n“In designing this camera, the importance of good 3-D close-ups was considered of paramount importance,” stated Racket in a May 1953 article in American Cinematographer magazine. “As a result we can make individual head closeups—chin to forehead—with ease and without any distortion.”\nDirector Lew Landers, working with cameraman Floyd Crosby, shot exteriors for Man in the Dark right on the Columbia lot using gangplanks and stairways to good 3-D effect. In thematically working through a mood of paranoia and fatalism to one of moral self-control, Man in the Dark is the narrative inverse of D.O.A. Rawley is redeemed, not doomed, at the end and the stereoscopic imagery underscores both the darkness and nature of this narrative progression.\nJack Arnold was the 3-D director of choice at Universal-International and when Kathleen Hughes was cast in a very brief part in his It Came From Outer Space, released May 26, 1953, her few minutes of onscreen time were so torrid that she was subsequently cast as Paula Ranier in the 3-D noir mystery The Glass Web which the studio released on October 6, 1953 in a 2:1 cropped format they called “Wide-Vision.”\n“Paula was bad, beautiful and bold as sin,” intoned the studio publicity, “and born to be murdered.” Paula is a starlet involved with three different men who work on a true crime reality TV show. Scenes taking place on the TV sound stage provide a nice picture of television production circa 1953. Good use of the stereoscopic effects was made in these scenes with a few well-placed microphones and camera movement through the TV sound stage. It’s paradoxical to see a 3-D movie about television, which by 1953 had decidedly diminished the motion picture audience and was the most compelling reason why the studios had decided to make 3-D films in the first place.\nWhen Paula turns up dead, her amorous involvement with the three men, Don Newell (John Forsythe), Dave Markson (Richard Denning) and Henry Hayes (Edward G. Robinson) becomes apparent. Newell, after a brief fling with Paula, is pulled into an ominous situation and attempts to hide his involvement with Paula from his wife Louise (Marcia Henderson). In a clever reflexive twist, the show does a segment on Paula’s unsolved murder. The real antagonist, with his obsession for detail on the TV program, slips up and reveals himself.\nMore a straight forward murder mystery than a noir, The Glass Web uses 3-D that does not call attention to itself except for one long segment in which Newell walks the city streets, narrowly missing getting hit by a truck, or struck by falling and sliding objects that protrude dramatically off the screen. It’s almost as if Jack Arnold attempted to dispense with all the 3-D gimmicks in this one extended passage to be able to concentrate on the exposition of the third act denouement in his mystery drama.\nThe Universal-International 3-D camera rig, like that of Columbia studios, used two Mitchell cameras mounted side-by-side with one camera inverted to provide appropriate interocular distance. A selsyn motor drove linked focus controls with no mirrors or prisms. Two different rigs were used on the set, one for medium and long shots, and the other for close-ups.\nClifford Stine, who had filmed It Came From Outer Space, David Horsley, Fred Campbell and Eugene Polito assisted director of photography Maury Gertsman in producing fine stereoscopic cinematography.\nI, the Jury, released by United Artists July 24, 1953, fits neatly into the film noir canon. It was based on the hard-boiled novel by Mickey Spillane which, in its Signet paperback edition (with a sexy cover), sold something like 20 million copies. Spillane’s hard-hitting private investigator Mike Hammer, portrayed in the film by Biff Elliott, was a loose cannon in a trench coat, and a somewhat caricatural throwback to the protagonists of the original hard-boiled writers of Black Mask magazine which included Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain, and Cornell Woolrich, all of whose works formed the basis for the original films noir.\nWhat really makes I, the Jury a significant work of film noir is its 3- D cinematography by John Alton, the undisputed master of light and shadow who, with films such as T-Men (1948) and The Big Combo (1955), forever defined the chiaroscuro look of film noir. In his pioneering 1949 book Painting with Light, a poetic textbook on motion picture lighting, Alton wrote about creating photographic depth using light.\n“The illusion of three dimensions—photographic depth—is created by a geometric design of placing people and props, breaking up the set into several planes, and the proper distribution of lights and shadows,” wrote Alton. Later in the book, with a chapter titled “Visual Music,” Alton again addresses the third dimension. “In real life, the pleasure of visual music is enhanced by the third dimension. Fortunes have been and still are being spent to put third dimension in professional motion picture photography: but to my knowledge, the closest we have come to it is an illusion of depth accomplished by the proper distribution of densities.”\nFour years later, with I, the Jury, Alton had an opportunity to render space stereoscopically and with light and shadow at the same time. From the opening scenes, in which we see a killing take place in the shadows from the point of view of the murderer, to the final scene, in which we witness Hammer’s revenge slaying of one of the most complicated femmes fatale in all of film noir, Alton made the most of it. Pitch black on the screen is latent with the malign. A two-fisted assailant may suddenly leap out of it. Throughout the film, Hammer moves through a stereoscopic visual space that is dynamically joined to light and shadow, a mirror of moral progression or decay.\nI, the Jury was filmed with a side-by-side dual-camera unit built by Producer’s Service of Burbank which used variable interaxial from 1.9 inches to a maximum of 4.5 inches. Built by Jack Kiel and Gordon Pollock, 3-D consultant on I, the Jury, the twin camera unit allowed for convergence settings and featured interlocked f-stops and focus so that follow focus shots during filming were very precise.\n3-D fans could take special delight with one scene in I, the Jury where Hammer is made to look through a hand-held stereo viewer by a winsome blonde. The audience then views the pastoral scene in stereo at the same time as the private investigator.\nIn another scene Hammer walks past a newsstand where copies of Spillane’s Signet paperback, Kiss Me Deadly, is prominently displayed. Director Robert Aldrich subsequently adapted this book into one of the greatest of all black-and-white films noir in 1955 with Ralph Meeker as the tough detective. Mickey Spillane himself was never happy with the casting of his hero so he essayed the role himself in 1963 in The Girl Hunters.\nAs John Alton has shown us, film noir can be eminently suitable for stereoscopic storytelling. Shadow recedes. Light projects. And there is a gray scale universe of moral ambiguity in between.\nAuthored by Ray Zone.']	['<urn:uuid:30cfbc88-995b-4950-96fd-a8f3c0b671a0>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	8	13	1731
40	I sell goods within my state. Which GST applies to me?	For intra-state supply (sales within the same state), both CGST and SGST apply. These are collected equally - meaning if the total GST rate is 18%, 9% will be CGST and 9% will be SGST.	['In this article you will learn:\nWhat is SGST?\nSGST is one of the components of GST in India. SGST is an indirect tax levied and collected by a State Government on the intra-state supplies. Such supplies do not include alcoholic liquor for human consumption. Furthermore, this tax levy is governed by the State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) Act , 2017. And such a tax is levied on the transaction value of the goods or services supplied as per section 15 of the SGST Act. The transaction value is the price actually paid or payable for the said supply of goods or services.\nAlso, the liability to pay SGST shall arise at the time of supply of goods or services as specified in sections 12 and 13 of the SGST Act. In addition to this, along with SGST, CGST will also be levied on the same intra-state supply of goods. But CGST will be governed by the CGST Act, 2017.\nSGST Full Form\nThe full form of SGST is State Goods and Services Tax. It is one of the four indirect taxes levied under GST. These include:\n(i) Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST)\n(ii) State Goods and Services Tax (SGST)\n(iii) Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST)\n(iv) Union Territory Goods and Services Tax (UTGST)\nFeatures of SGST\n- SGST is levied and collected by the states on all goods and services supplied for a consideration.\n- State GST is deposited to the accounts of the respective state\n- Each state has its own SGST act. However, the basic features of the GST law like chargeability, valuation, taxable event, measure, classification etc would remain uniform across the respective act of each state\n- SGST, however, is not applicable on the exempted goods and services as they are kept out of the purview of GST. Furthermore, SGST is also not applicable where aggregate annual turnover is less than the prescribed limit.\nApplicability of SGST\nThe applicability of SGST/UTGST and other tax components like IGST and CGST under GST depends on the nature of supply in a given transaction. There can be two types of supply: (i) Intra-State Supply and (ii) Inter-State Supply.\nIntra-State Supply refers to any supply where the location of the supplier and the place of supply are in the same State or Union Territory. In case of such a supply of goods and services, a seller has to collect both CGST and SGST. After collecting both the taxes, the CGST part gets deposited with the Central Government. And the SGST portion gets deposited with the respective State Government.\nSay, for example, Omkar Enterprises, a manufacturer in Punjab, supplies goods to Vipul Traders, a dealer in Punjab. Goods worth Rs 1,00,000 are supplied by Omkar Enterprises after adding GST @ 18%. Since it is an intra-state supply, GST gets deposited to both Central and State Governments. But the total GST amounting to Rs 18,000 gets deposited equally into separate heads. This means Rs 9,000 gets deposited into the CGST account. And another Rs 9,000 gets deposited into SGST head.\nInter-State Supply refers to any supply where the location of the supplier and the place of supply are in:\n- Two different States\n- 2 Different Union Territories\n- A-State and a Union Territory\nAdditionally, any supply in a taxable territory, that is not an Intra-State supply is deemed to be an Inter-State supply. The following supplies are also treated as Inter-State supplies:\n- Supplies to or by Special Economic Zones (SEZs)\n- Goods or services imported to India\n- Services or goods exported outside India\n- Supply of goods or services to international tourists\nThus, on the Inter-State supply of goods or services, only IGST is levied and collected by the Central Government.\nFor instance, Prakash Ltd, a manufacturer in Punjab, supplies goods to Verma Traders, a dealer in Maharashtra. Goods worth Rs 1,00,000 are supplied by Prakash Ltd after adding GST @ 18%. Since it is an inter-state supply, GST gets deposited only to the Central Government. Therefore, total GST amounting Rs 18,000 gets deposited into CGST head only.\nDifference Between SGST, CGST and IGST\n|Criteria of Distinction||SGST||CCGST||IGST|\n|Full Form||SGST stands for State Goods and Services Tax||CGST stands for Central Goods and Services Tax||IGST stands for Integrated Goods and Services Tax.|\n|Meaning||SGST is one of the components of GST levied and collected by the respective state government on intra-state supplies. Such a tax is governed by State Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017.||CGST is another component of GST levied and collected by central government on intra-state supplies. Such a tax levy is governed by the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017.||IGST is the third component of GST levied and collected by only central government on inter-state supply of goods or services. The tax so collected is then apportioned between Central government and respective State Government where goods are consumed. Such a tax levy is governed by Integrated Goods and Services tax Act, 2017.|\n|Applicability||SGST is applicable in case of intra-state supplies where the location of the supplier and place of supply are in the same state or UT.||CGST is also applicable in case of intra-state supply where the location of the supplier and place of supply are in the same state or UT.||IGST is applicable in case of inter-state supply where the location of the supplier and place of supply are in: (i) two different states (ii) two different UTs and (iii) a state and UT.|\n|Taxes Replaced||SGST replaces:||CGST replaces:|\n|Who Collects the Tax||SGST is collected by the respective state government.||CGST is collected by the Central government.||IGST is collected by the Central government.|\n|Claim of ITC||The claim of SGST credit is available only against SGST and IGST in the same order.||The claim of CGST is available only against CGST and IGST in the same order.||The claim of IGST is available against IGST, CGST and SGST in the same order.|\n|Applicability of Composition Scheme||A registered taxpayer can apply for the Composition Scheme if his aggregate annual turnover is upto Rs.1.5 crores||A registered taxpayer can apply for the Composition Scheme if his aggregate annual turnover is upto Rs.1.5 crores||Composition scheme is not applicable in case of inter-state supplies|\n|Registration Limit||Taxpayer is not required to register under GST if his aggregate annual turnover is up to Rs. 40 lakhs in case of supply of goods, 20 lakhs in case of supply of services and 20 lakhs in case of supply of both goods and services in special category states||Taxpayer is not required to register under GST if his aggregate annual turnover is up to Rs. 40 lakhs in case of supply of goods, 20 lakhs in case of supply of services and 20 lakhs in case of supply of both goods and services in special category states||Registration under GST is mandatory in case on inter-state supplies|\nITC Utilization Under GST\nInitially, the ITC could be utilized in the following manner:\n|CGST Liability||SGST Liability||IGST Liability|\n|First, ITC on account of CGST is utilized||First, ITC on account of SGST is utilized||First, ITC on account of IGST is utilized|\n|Then, ITC on account of IGST is utilized||Then, ITC on account of IGST is utilized||Then, ITC on account of CGST is utilized|\n|Finally, ITC on account of SGST is utilized|\nThere was no rule that the ITC on account of IGST had to be completely exhausted first even before utilizing ITC on account of CGST and SGST.\nAs per Circular No. 98/17/2019-GST issued on April 23rd, 2019, the government clarified the utilization of input tax credit of integrated tax in a particular order. Section 49(A) and 49(B) were inserted via an amendment. As per section 49(A), ITC of Integrated Tax has to be utilized completely before ITC of Central Tax and State Tax can be used to discharge any tax liability.\nFurthermore, as per section 49 of the CGST Act, 2017, the ITC of Integrated Tax has to be utilized first for the payment of IGST, then Central Tax and then State Tax in this order necessarily. This lead to a scenario where a taxpayer had to discharge his tax liability with regards to one kind of tax, say for instance state tax through electronic cash ledger. However, ITC with regards to other type of tax, say central tax, remained unutilized in electronic credit ledger.\nTo overcome such a challenge, rule 88 (A) was inserted in CGST rules, 2017. As per this rule, ITC of Integrated Tax can be utilized to pay output tax liability towards central and state tax in any order. However, this rule was subject to a condition that the entire ITC with regards to IGST must be first completely exhausted befoe utilizing the ITC with regards to Central tax or state tax.\nThe following table shows the order of utilization of ITC as per this circular:\n|Input tax Credit on account of||Output liability on account of Integrated tax||Output liability on account of Central tax||Output liability on account of State tax / Union Territory tax|\n|Integrated tax||(I)||(II) – In any order and in any proportion|\n|(III) Input tax Credit on account of Integrated tax to be completely exhausted mandatorily|\n|Central tax||(V)||(IV)||Not permitted|\n|State tax / Union Territory tax||(VII)||Not permitted||(VI)|\nCalculation of CGST, SGST and IGST\nSay for instance, Raman a manufacturer in Punjab Supplies goods to Venkatesh, a wholesaler in Punjab for Rs 1 Lakh @18% GST. Venkatesh further supplies these goods to Dhiraj, a retailer in Maharashtra, for Rs 1.75 Lakhs @18% GST. Finally, Dhiraj sells the goods to Karthik, a consumer in Maharashtra for Rs 3 Lakhs, again @ 18% GST.\nSince Raman is selling the goods to Venkatesh in Punjab itself, it is an intra-state supply. And for intra-state supplies, both CGST and SGST are levied. Therefore, GST @ 18% is split between CGST and SGST equally. Where CGST levied is 9% and SGST is also 9%.\nThen, Venkatesh after adding some value sells the goods to Dhiraj in Maharashtra for Rs 1.75 Lakhs @ 18% GST. Since this is an inter-state supply, only IGST is levied and collected by the Central Government. Therefore, the entire 18% GST is levied as IGST and gets deposited with the Central Government.\nBut how are CGST, SGST and IGST collected?\n|Point At Supply Chain||Value of Sales||Calculation of Tax||Punjab Govt.||Calculation of Tax||Maharashtra Govt.||Calculation of Tax||Central Govt.|\n|Raman to Venkatesh||Rs 1,00,000||(18% * 1,00,000)/2||Rs 9,000||–||–||(18% * 1,00,000)/2||Rs 9,000|\n|Venkatesh To Dhiraj||Rs 1,75,000||–||–||–||–||(IGST 18% * 1,75,000)|\n(-) CGST Credit\n(-) SGST Credit\n|Dhiraj To Karthik||Rs 3,00,000||–||–||(18% * 3,00,000)/2|\n(-) IGST Credit Balance\n|(18% * 3,00,000)/2|\n(-) IGST Credit\n|Total GST Collected||–||–||Rs 9,000||–||Rs 22,500||–||Rs 22,500|\n|Adjustment||(Rs 9,000)||Rs 4,500||Rs 4,500|\n|Final Amount of GST||0||Rs 27,000||Rs 27,000|\nAt the point of the supply chain where Dhiraj supplies goods to Karthik, ITC Utilization rules for IGST apply. As per the rule, IGST liability is extinguished by first using ITC standing under IGST. Then ITC standing under CGST and SGST are used in the same sequence to set off balance output IGST liability.\nAdditionally, since GST is a consumption-based tax, the state where the goods were consumed will receive GST. Therefore, going by this rule, Punjab will not receive any taxes since goods were sold and not consumed there. Ideally, Maharashtra should receive the entire amount of GST.\nTherefore, in the last section of the above table, an adjustment is made to adhere to the above rule. Accordingly, the Punjab government will have to transfer to the Centre Rs 9,000 GST amount received on account of sales made. In turn, the Central Government will transfer Rs 4,500 to Maharashtra Government’s account. Such an adjustment is done to adhere to the ‘consumption-based tax’ rule. Since the final consumption is done in Maharashtra, hence the Maharashtra government will receive the entire amount of GST.']	['<urn:uuid:eca8b075-e717-41b7-a393-fabceed10a9e>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	11	35	1954

They counsel clients on when to sell properties and convert proceeds into other investments. The manager provides guidance on making improvements to the properties as a means of positioning the client to ultimately earn more benefit from those real estate holdings.	['Learn something new every day\nMore Info... by email\nAsset managers are individuals who are responsible for overseeing the performance of the financial assets of their clients. This often includes the management of any stock holdings, bond issues, real estate, or other assets that the client possesses. An asset manager will seek to find the ideal balance between incurring risk and earning returns from investments, thus increasing the value of the client’s portfolio. Managers of this type may work for brokerage firms or function as independent managers who work for private clients.\nThe typical asset manager focuses on the process of investment management. This involves monitoring the performance of any stocks, bonds, or other securities that a client has in his or her financial portfolio. As part of the management process, the asset manager will make recommendations regarding which investments to hold on to over the long term, which ones should be sold within a given period of time, and which new stock or bond offerings should be acquired for the portfolio. The goal is to maximize the return on all assets contained in the portfolio, while keeping the level of risk associated with the investment process within the limits determined by the client.\nAlong with managing investments like stocks and bonds, an asset manager may be called upon to manage real estate holdings that are owned by the client. This can involve making sure the properties remain profitable and advising the client when to sell those assets and convert the proceeds into other forms of investments. The manager will often counsel the client when to make improvements to the properties, as a means of positioning the client to ultimately earn more benefit from those real estate holdings.\nDepending on the relationship between the asset manager and the client, the manager may be granted limited authorization to engage in buying and selling on behalf of the client. This is often the case when the business relationship has been established for some time, and the client has come to trust both the expertise and the integrity of the manager. However, it is important to understand that the client always has the ability to override the suggestions of the manager, and take an alternate course of action, if he or she desires.\nIn order to function as an asset manager, it is necessary to have an eye for detail, since the tasks associated with the work focus on keeping an ongoing accounting of the assets of the client. The manager must also be well-versed in understanding how various investment markets work, and be able to identify upcoming trends that will have an impact on the value of the client’s investment portfolio. It is also important that the asset manager understand all laws and regulations currently in place that relate to investing and trading options. This helps to ensure that the client always complies with those standards when executing any type of financial transaction that involves the assets placed in the care of the manager.']	['<urn:uuid:25a5760b-5da5-4b62-a57a-0035109e1a9f>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	6	64	502
42	As someone with experience in corporate strategy, I'm curious about the key components that make up a comprehensive business plan for seeking investment. Could you walk me through the essential elements?	A comprehensive business plan typically includes several key components: an Executive Summary that sells your business to the reader, a Business Overview providing a general summary, Market & Competitive Analysis explaining your competitive environment, Marketing & Sales Strategy showing how you'll succeed in your market, Organization Plan detailing your structure, Financial Projections showing current status and future outlook, Funding Sought (if required), Key Milestones outlining specific and achievable goals, and Critical Risks addressing major concerns. When seeking funding, the plan must demonstrate ability to repay loans with required return on investment within the specified timeframe.	['Whether you are a veteran business owner, have recently begun your own venture, or are still in the dreaming stages, you have invariably spent many hours thinking about and envisioning your organization. While it is always exciting to try to realize your dream in your mind and to project that image into your future, the realization that barriers, stumbling blocks, and necessary “to-do’s” exist. These subjects range from broad to very specific, and can include questions such as:\nWho is my ideal client?\nWhat would be a good name for my organization?\nWhat is my unique selling proposition (USP)?\nHow will I balance my work life with my personal life?\nHow big do I want this business to be?\nDo I have the necessary resources? If not, where can I get them? If so, how do I most effectively utilize them?\nThe list goes on for pages and pages; indeed, there are numerous resources that outline these very details, and putting some time into exploring these ideas is always a smart move. For some specific ideas, check out some of the free articles on offer by MEG Enterprises.\nThe reasoning behind developing a business plan for businesses of all sizes can vary, but business plans are most often created for two primary reasons: as a management & planning tool, and to acquire funding for operational business needs.\nManagement & Planning Tool\nIf you are like many other small business owners, you are not only the owner of the company, you are likely also actively involved in the day-to-day operations as the President/CEO, the marketing department, the IT department, the HR department…the list goes on and on! One of the most important things to remember in trying to bring all of this together into a cohesive and efficient package is that planning is vital!\nMany small businesses take a “fly by the seat of your pants” approach to operating their businesses. For example, let’s say that an excellent business opportunity arose for you, an opportunity that would net your business $5,000 over the next 3 months. However, in order to take advantage of this opportunity, you need an initial cash outlay of $1,000. Do you have the resources necessary to take advantage of this opportunity? If your answer is no, you may have been able to easily accomplish this goal by planning for such expenses in advance through a business plan. Even if having cash at the ready is not a viable alternative for you, you may have planned to have a line of credit available for such opportunities, knowing that in your field these opportunities do arise from time to time.\nIn a more broad sense, business planning helps businesses of all sizes to deal with the day-to-day needs of the organization by forcing the owner to weed through the operations of a typical work day. Business planning will assist you in understanding how to effectively market your business, how to understand and plan for financial stability both now and in the future, how to carry out your daily operations with a necessary level of routine, and so forth. Moreover, while unpredictable issues will certainly always arise, effective business planning will not only help you to navigate the predictable operations, but will also take these unpredictable situations into account. This will help you to deal with these issues with a level of comfort and ease, knowing that you have thought through and planned for such events.\nIn essence, here is a great way to think of superior business planning. Imagine you are taking a road trip from California to New York. No planning (“flying by the seat of your pants”) would involve you getting in the car and driving “East” on every freeway you come across. Adequate planning would involve mapping out your course, planning where to stay overnight, where to eat, sights to see, and so forth. This is a much better plan indeed. However, a superior plan would take all of these ideas to the next level by planning for “what if”: what will I do if I get a flat tire, if I run out of gas, if someone gets sick, or if I lose my wallet? You can see how the superior plan is clearly the best in most situations in that it allows for flexibility, plans for the expected and the unexpected, and allows you to spend more time enjoying the trip, knowing that you have all of your bases covered.\nHELP…I Need Cash! (AKA Creating a Business Plan to Acquire Funding)\nAnother reason to create a business plan is to acquire funding. In today’s struggling economy, having access to cash as a small business is vital. In developing plans for this reason, a much more specific approach is taken. Here, the plan is created with a specific reader in mind: the lender. Whether seeking funds from a bank, an angel investor, or so forth, knowing your audience is vital.\nHow do you create an effective business plan in this situation? Well, simply stated, place yourself in the shoes of the person lending the money. What would you as the lender want to read in a plan? First and foremost, these individuals want to see that you have demonstrated the ability to repay the loan with the required level of return on investment (ROI) and within the required time frame.\nThese areas require that you present a strong case for your proposed financial expectations, grounded firmly in the supporting information of your plan, including marketing, market analysis, business operations, and so forth. Having confidence in your business and in yourself will assist you in demonstrating the potential for your company and in being able to deliver what your investor is looking for. Doing your due diligence and knowing the facts surrounding your business and your market will prove to be of great benefit when selling your business case, both in writing and verbally, to the lender you are seeking funding from.\nSo, How Do I Create A Business Plan? What Does It All Come Down To?\nAlthough the term “business plan” conjures many negative images in the eyes of some business owners, taking a step-by-step approach will prove that creating a business plan is much less daunting than one might imagine. Although no two plans are exactly the same (the necessary details of the plan can vary between companies), the contents of a typical business plan include the following topics:\nExecutive Summary – Sell your business to your reader!\nBusiness Overview – Giving a general summary of the business.\nMarket & Competitive Analysis – What environment are you competing in?\nMarketing & Sales Strategy – How will you “win” in your market?\nOrganization Plan – How is your organization structured?\nFinancial Projections – Current status and future outlook.\nFunding Sought (if required)\nKey Milestones – What are your specific & achievable goals?\nCritical Risks – What keeps you awake at night?\nDoes this look like a lot to you? Well, believe me, as you truly delve into the details of the plan and your business, you will be wondering why there isn’t more room for details!\nThe most important aspect of business planning (the “What does it all come down to?” part), however, is spending the time to do your research (“due diligence”) and critically thinking about these various aspects of your business. Of course, it is impossible to anticipate every detail simply by spending time thinking and writing; it is for this reason that plans are referred to and viewed as “dynamic”. However, the more issues and scenarios you are able to come up with ahead of time, the more prepared you will be to handle these as they arise.\nSo, in the end, I encourage you to realign whatever preconceived notions you may have of the business planning process and view it not as a daunting task or a necessary evil of running a successful business. Instead, view it as yet another opportunity, the chance to help make your dreams into a reality by mapping out the needs of your business, your customers, your employees, your suppliers, your community…and yourself!']	['<urn:uuid:1e7011c0-e939-43d9-9bf0-fb32220a004d>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	31	95	1357
43	As an experienced gardener, what spacing should I leave between hydrangea seedlings?	You should leave approximately three to ten feet between hydrangea seedlings, as mature hydrangeas become large shrubs.	['Hydrangeas are popular shrubs that produce colorful flowers throughout the summer and fall seasons. There are dozens of hydrangea flower species in the market and they come in a variety of colors that include light and deep red, pale green, among other colors. Learning the basic principles of how to plant a flower hydrangea can increase the flower’s chance of blooming successfully after it has grown.\nBest Conditions for Planting Hydrangeas\nSeason: The best time for planting hydrangeas is during the spring or fall season. Individuals who are interested in planting hydrangea during fall should ensure that they plant the flowers before the first fall frost based on their local calendars and weather patterns.\nPlace: The best place to plant hydrangeas is under a shade and away from buildings. Planting hydrangeas next to other trees will ensure that it gets adequate shade.\nFertile Soil: Hydrangea should be planted in fertile and well-draining soils. A person can add compost to the soil to enrich it or a flowering shrub fertilizer.\nSpacing: When planting hydrangeas one should leave approximately three to ten feet in between the seedlings because mature hydrangeas become large shrubs.\nProcess of Planting Hydrangea Flowers\n- Dig a hole that is as deep as the root ball of the plant and ensure that hole is at least two to three times wider than the root ball. This ensures that as the plant begins to grow the delicate roots will have adequate space to spread out and attach themselves to the ground.\n- Set the plant inside the hole and fill the hole halfway with soil.\n- Water the plant and give it a few minutes to absorb the water before filling the rest of the space with soil. This technique ensures that the water reaches the roots.\n- Water the plant thoroughly. A soaker hose can be used for deep watering.\n- The care of the plant should involve watering it generously three times a week to ensure that the roots get the moisture that they need to grow.\n- Add organic mulch under the hydrangea plant to keep the soil moist. Mulch is also important in improving the nutrient content of the soil.\n- Maintaining a good watering schedule either in the morning or during the evenings will promote the growth of the hydrangea.\nConsideration When Growing Hydrangea Plants\nSeasons and Temperature\nHydrangeas do not like extremely cold temperatures. During the winter, they might require protection from the cold weather if the temperatures fall below zero degrees. Wrapping the hydrangea during extremely cold seasons can increase their likelihood of surviving.\nHydrangeas do not like excessive heat. Hydrangeas are likely to die during a heat-wave or summers characterized by high temperatures. Even a consistent watering regimen might not be effective in protecting hydrangea from extremely hot temperatures. Planting hydrangeas under a shade of far from heat magnets like dark-colored walls can increase their chances of survival.\nHydrangeas are generally low maintenance flowers. Adhering to these simple planting and maintenance guidelines will ensure that the plant develops a healthy root system and matures to produce beautiful hydrangea flowers.']	['<urn:uuid:a03b6b98-ed6b-4bbc-ac9f-9b553f312257>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	12	17	518
44	worker eye safety rules risks	Workers can face various eye hazards including chemical splashes, projectiles, radiation, and blood-borne infections. OSHA requires employers to provide appropriate eye protection and conduct training in a language workers understand about workplace hazards and prevention methods. Companies must ensure proper fit and task-specific protection. Construction workers are particularly at risk, with strict regulations enforced by agencies like OSHA and BLS. Failure to comply with safety standards can result in citations and fines during unexpected OSHA inspections of facilities.	"[""- About Us\n- Media Release\n- Our Clients\n- Media Mentions\n- Subscription Model\n- Contact Us\nThe Global Safety Eyewear Market size is expected to reach $4.8 billion by 2028, rising at a market growth of 4.5% CAGR during the forecast period.\nSafety eyewear includes eyeglasses or goggles that offer defense against a variety of hazards that are constantly present in some hazardous work environments. Safety eyewear should not be confused with everyday glasses. While prescription eyewear can help correct eyesight, safety eyewear is, as its name suggests, primarily intended to keep the wearer safe.\nSafety-related eyewear can include both prescription and non-prescription lenses and frames. An eyewear must meet an extremely high standard of impact resistance, frequently making them impenetrable, in order to be qualified for use while being worn in dangerous situations. Additionally, their form and design have to be such that they provide the worker wearing them with the most amount of protection while also being comfortable.\nIn order for workers to perform their duties completely and efficiently, safety eyewear must also guarantee that they have the proper vision. The use of safety eyewear is crucial for every work, where, there is a risk or danger to the eyes. Workers' eyes are clearly at risk at places of employment including factories, industries, and research labs. When dangerous chemicals, grease, oil splashes, or vapors come in contact with the eye, some of these risks are categorized as chemical hazards.\nThere is occasionally a chance that dust, concrete, wood, metal, or other projectiles will get in the worker’s eye. The eye requires protection from radiation as well, including lasers, infrared light, visible light, and ultraviolet light. More recently, there have been discovered dangers known as blood borne infections, which can be lethal if accidentally ingested. Therefore, safety eyewear is required in all of these locations.\nGlobally, there is a huge need for protective eyewear as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic due to increased worries about virus transmission. Touching the eyes, nose, or mouth after coming into contact with an infected surface was one of the ways the virus was spread. The need for protective eyewear throughout the nation, particularly in the medical industry, increased dramatically as a result of the virus's spread. Human eyes are shielded from solid particles, dangerous chemicals and gases, radiation, and other harmful substances with safety eyewear. It is intended to safeguard employees from harm and fatalities caused by hazardous working circumstances. As a result, the market has benefited due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nWorldwide productivity losses due to eye impairment are expected to cost US$411 billion annually, placing a significant financial burden on the entire world. Uncorrected refractive errors as well as cataracts are the main causes of vision loss and blindness. At least 2.2 billion people worldwide suffer from a near- or distance-vision impairment. Nearly half of these cases, or at least 1 billion, involved vision damage that either might have been avoided or is still unaddressed.\nThe health of people is seriously impacted as air pollution increases. In addition to the regular urban pollution and smoke from forest fires, these pollutants have an impact on ground-level ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, dioxide, lead, and carbon monoxide. The effects of common air pollution on the eyes might range from minor to severe. According to several researches, conjunctivitis cases are rising along with overall air pollution levels. Particularly nitrogen dioxide can irritate the eyes.\nMaking sure safety eyewear provides sufficient protection is vital from a moral, financial, and legal standpoint. Sales and demand for safety eyewear are suffering dramatically as a result of the market's abundance of inexpensive and inferior substitutes. There are many alternatives with lower prices and worse effectiveness due to the strong demand and limited supply of effective eye wears.\nBased on product, the safety eyewear market is segmented into prescription and non-prescription. In 2021, the non-prescription segment dominated the safety eyewear market with the maximum revenue share. This is due to the fact the bulk of safety eyewear is purchased for the labor force to protect the eyes from debris and dangerous substances. Non-prescription eyewear is typically used by people who can no longer see small text.\nOn the basis of application, the safety eyewear market is fragmented into oil & gas, construction, mining, industrial manufacturing, military and others. In 2021, construction segment covered a substantial revenue share in the safety eyewear market in 2021.Working with large machinery, scaling huge buildings, and handling hazardous materials puts the lives of construction workers in danger.

It pays to be prepared, not only to avoid citations and fines but to keep your workers as safe as possible.\nWe’ve compiled a list of OSHA’s top 9 violations and the steps you can take to ensure your facility passes its next inspection.\n1. Inadequate Fall Protection\nOne of the most common risks cited in OSHA’s summary is the danger of inadequate fall protection. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), there were 366 fatal falls to a lower level out of 971 construction fatalities in 2017. Employees can fall from elevated platforms or work stations, uncovered holes in the floor, or even a spill.\nTo prevent a fall in your facility, OHSA recommends:\n- Using guard rails and toe boards: These should be employed around holes in the floor, on elevated open-sided platforms, or around dangerous equipment or machinery.\n- Employing personal protective equipment: This can include safety harnesses to prevent falls where necessary.\n- Maintaining a clean facility: Keeping the floor and other facility spaces clean and dry can prevent or at least limit slips and falls.\n2. Poor Hazard Communication\nAccording to OSHA guidelines, workers have the right to “receive information and training (in a language and vocabulary the worker understands) about workplace hazards, methods to prevent them, and the OSHA standards that apply to their workplace.” Information about the identities and hazards of the chemicals present in your workplace must be made available and understandable to workers.\nTo comply with OSHA’s requirements, be sure to inform your employees of:\n- Hazard classifications: Each hazard should be easily identifiable and classifiable, meaning workers should be able to identify the chemical and result of chemical mixtures and their associated health and physical hazards.\n- Labels: Chemical manufacturers, importers, and handlers need to provide a precautionary label that includes a harmonized signal word, pictogram, and hazard statement for each hazard class and category. It is also important to note the native language of your employees so that they will be able to understand the communication measures being taken.\n- Safety data sheets: Employers should be providing safety data sheets that follow the 16-section format listed on OSHA’s website.\n- Information and training: Employers are required to update and continuously train workers on any changing or added labels being provided in their workplace. They should be familiar with safe chemical handling processes.\n3. Dangerous Scaffolding\nIf you have any scaffolding present in your workplace, you can be sure an OSHA inspector will examine it; unsafe scaffolds are the third most frequently cited violation. Every year, 4,500 injuries and over 60 deaths result just from scaffolding injuries, losing American employers about $90 million in lost workdays. In a recent BLS study, 72% of workers injured in scaffold accidents said it was from either planking or support giving out, or the employee slipping or being struck by a falling object.\nAll of these accidents can be prevented or better controlled by compliance with OSHA standards, including remembering to:\n- Routinely check all scaffolding: Scaffolds used during construction or in day-to-day operations must comply with OHSA’s standards to prevent falls, including using construction-grade lumber capable of supporting up to 1,500 lbs.\n4. Unsafe Ladders\nAs with scaffolding, ladders used during construction or in day-to-day operations must comply with OHSA’s standards to prevent falls. Employees must also be properly educated on procedures for the safe use of ladders, like not holding heavy items and only using a ladder for shorter periods of time. Without using these regulations, workers are put at major risk of injury. According to BLS, ladder-related incidents led to more than 150 worker fatalities and more than 20,000 nonfatal injuries in 2015.\nTo avoid these risks:\n- Routinely check all ladders: Ladders used regularly must also comply with OSHA’s standards to ensure safety.\n5. Insufficient Respiratory Protection\nHarmful gases, dust, fog, smokes, mists, vapors, or sprays can put your workers at risk of lung impairment, lung cancer, and death – yet these risks are easily avoidable with the proper use of respiratory equipment. While it isn’t always comfortable to wear, it is absolutely vital for worker safety. Not only should employers ensure respiratory protection is provided, but they should also ensure:\n- Correct fit: Respiratory equipment should fit the face securely to ensure effective usage.\n- Applicability: The equipment should be properly suited for the task and hazard.\n6. Insufficient Eye and Face Protection\nEye and face injuries account for an estimated $300 million annually in medical bills, compensation, and time off; these injuries also make up nearly 45% of all head injuries that lead to missed workdays. Workers can be blinded by chemical, environmental, radiological, or mechanical irritants and hazards.\nAs with respiratory protection, eye and face protection should be appropriate for the task and hazard at hand and may range from basic safety goggles to a welding helmet. Regulations can encompass details like the size of protection to the tint of eyewear, so be sure to review all requirements to confirm adherence within your facility.\n- Provide proper protection: Make sure all employees have consistent access to face and eye protection while on the job.\n- Eye or face injury training: Regularly remind employees not just about proper eye and face safety but also about how to handle situations if injuries do arise, such as the proper use of eyewash stations.\n7. Poor Control of Hazardous Energy\nThe unexpected release of stored energy (electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, chemical, thermal or other sources) in machines and equipment can result in injury or death. Employees who service or maintain machinery and other equipment are at the greatest risk from the unexpected release of hazardous energy, such as a steam valve being turned on while a worker is repairing a connection in the piping. Injuries may include electrocution, burns, crushing, laceration, or more serious injuries.\nCompliance with lockout/tagout standards prevents an estimated 120 fatalities and 50,000 injuries each year.\n- Follow Lockout/Tagout Practices: Be sure to follow all lockout/tagout guidelines to prevent accidental stored energy releases while employees are engaging or otherwise working with the machinery.\n8. Unsafe Forklifts or Powered Industrial Trucks\nMore commonly known as forklifts, powered industrial trucks present many hazards including falling load accidents, pedestrian safety, and trucks being driven off loading docks. In addition to adhering to OSHA’s requirements, also make sure to enforce:\n- Age restrictions: No one under 18 years of age operates a forklift.\n- Training requirements: Operators over 18 years of age are trained, certified, and fully aware of all forklift-related hazards.\n9. Inadequate Machine Guarding\nAny machine with moving parts is potentially hazardous to workers and can cause crushed fingers, amputations, burns, blindness, and other injuries. The type of safeguarding depends very much on the machine but may include railing to safeguard by safe distance, warning signs, enclosures, screening, grating, and other methods. OSHA notes that when accidental contact and accidents occur, the hazard must be eliminated or controlled to prevent further injury.\n- Routinely check machine guards: Guard machines should be properly installed and maintained. Check around your facility regularly to ensure the guards are in place and being used correctly by various team members.']"	['<urn:uuid:34a125dc-a372-40fc-9560-121dae4bfbd6>', '<urn:uuid:944ef203-8957-4da8-9ed2-7162b7f05be9>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	5	78	2374
45	I'm really interested in how ancient Greek art depicted mythological creatures - can you explain how the Sirens were represented in classical Greek artwork and vases?	In Greek art, Sirens were depicted in two main ways: either as birds with human faces of maidens, or as young women with wings and feet of birds. When shown in more human form, they were typically depicted holding musical instruments. This is evidenced in ancient Greek vases, and artists like Flaxman later interpreted them as beautiful young women seated on the strand while singing.	"['Fictitious and Symbolic Creatures in Art, by John Vinycomb, , at sacred-texts.com\nThe Sirens (Greek, entanglers) enticed seamen by the sweetness of their song to such a degree that the listeners forgot everything and died of hunger. Their names were, Parthenope, Ligea, and Leucosia.\nParthenope, the ancient name of Neapolis (Naples)\nwas derived from one of the sirens, whose tomb was shown in Strabo\'s time. Poetic legend states that she threw herself into the sea out of love for Ulysses, and was cast up on the Bay of Naples.\nThe celebrated Parthenon at Athens, the beautiful temple of Pallas Athenæ, so richly adorned with sculptures, likewise derives its name from this source.\nDante interviews the siren in ""Purgatorio,"" xix. 7–33.\nFlaxman, in his designs illustrating the ""Odyssey,"" represents the sirens as beautiful young women seated on the strand and singing.\nIn the illustration from an ancient Greek vase\ngives a Grecian rendering of the story, and represents the Sirens as birds with heads of maidens.\nThe Sirens are best known from the story that Odysseus succeeded in passing them with his companions without being seduced by their song. He had the prudence to stop the ears of his companions with wax and to have himself bound to the mast. Only two are mentioned in Homer, but three or four are mentioned in later times and introduced into various legends. Demeter (Ceres)\nis said to have changed their bodies into those of birds, because they refused to go to the help of their companion, Persephone, when she was carried off by Pluto. ""They are represented in Greek art like the harpies, as young women with the wings and feet of birds. Sometimes they appear altogether like birds, only with human faces; at other times with the bodies of women, in which case they generally hold instruments of music in their hands. As their songs are death to those subdued by them they are often depicted on tombs as spirits of death.""\nBy the fables of the Sirens is represented the ensnaring nature of vain and deceitful pleasures, which sing and soothe to sleep, and never fail to destroy those who succumb to their beguiling influence.\nSpenser, in the ""Faerie Queen,"" describes a place ""where many mermaids haunt, making false melodies,"" by which the knight Guyon makes a somewhat ""perilous passage."" There were five sisters that had been fair ladies, till too confident in their skill in music they had ventured to contend with the Muses, when they were transformed in their lower extremities to fish:\nShakespeare charmingly pictures Oberon in the moonlight, fascinated by the graceful form and the\nmelodious strains of the mermaid half reclining on the back of the dolphin:\nCommentators of Shakespeare find in this passage (and subsequent parts) certain references to Mary Queen of Scots, which they consider beyond dispute. She was frequently referred to in the poetry of the time under this title. She was married to the Dauphin (or Dolphin) of France. The rude sea means the Scotch rebels, and the shooting stars referred to were the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, who, with others of lesser note, forgot their allegiance to Elizabeth out of love to Mary.\n""Few eyes,"" says Sir Thomas Browne, ""have escaped the picture of a mermaid with a woman\'s head above and a fish\'s extremity below."" In those old days when reading and writing were rare accomplishments, pictured signboards served to give ""a local habitation and a name"" to hostelries and other places of business and resort. Among the most celebrated of the old London taverns bearing this sign, * that in Bread Street stands foremost.\nWe find this ""Mermayde"" mentioned as early as 1464. In 1603 Sir Walter Raleigh established a literary club in this house, and here Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and the choice intellectual spirits of the time used to meet, and there took place those wit combats which Beaumont has commemorated and Fuller described. It is frequently alluded to by Beaumont and Fletcher in their comedies, but best known is that quotation from a letter of Beaumont to Ben Jonson:\n252:* The sign was also used by printers: John Rastall, brother-in-law to Sir Thomas More, ""emprynted in the p. 253 Cheapesyde at the Sygne of the Mermayde; next to Powlsgate in 1572."" Henry Binnemann, the Queen\'s printer, dedicated a work to Sir Thomas Gresham, in 1576, at the sign of the Mermaid, Knightrider Street.

46	marble stain prevention removal methods	Natural marble consists of calcium carbonate and requires protective measures against stains. To prevent staining, use coasters for glassware and avoid placing hot items directly on marble surfaces. For removing stains, you can use mild soap and water for light stains, baking soda paste for moderate stains, or commercial marble cleaners for stubborn marks. The stone's natural variations in veining and color make each piece unique, but also make it sensitive to harsh chemicals, requiring gentle cleaning approaches.	['Have you ever looked over your natural stone tiles and wondered why you see variations in color, shading, veining, or pitting?\nYou are not alone. As natural stone aficionados, we are often asked about the variances in this nature-made material.\nBecause of its organic composition, no two pieces of natural stone are entirely alike, even though they may appear similar at first glance. That individuality is part of the beauty of natural stone!\nToday, we are going to review several natural stone idiosyncrasies so you can better understand the unique characteristics of natural stone that give it its one-of-a-kind charm.\nLet’s get started!\nNatural Stone Aesthetic Variations\nAs we mentioned above, the true beauty of natural stone lies in the fact that no two pieces of stone are identical.\nWhen stone is formed, heat and pressure fuse together a myriad of different organic materials and minerals.\nOver time, these materials eventually settle and form the stone that you see today. However, during this process, not all the materials settle in the same way, which leads to an array of shading, veining, and pitting throughout the stone.\nIt is important to remember that these variations are aesthetic—they have no bearing on the structural integrity of the stone. Rather, they are just an outward manifestation of the multitudes and beauty contained within nature.\nTo start things off, let’s take a look at one of the more common variations—veining.\nHave you ever worked with marble?\nYou may have noticed that the soft white stone has shots of grey, or veining, running throughout it.\nThis veining represents the different minerals that settled together long ago to form the marble and can range from soft to dramatic in appearance.\nAt StoneImpressions, we offer a honed Carrara marble tile body for our unique art designs. While other varieties of Carrara marble feature dramatic or contrasting veining, our honed Carrara tiles feature veining that is subdued and sophisticated.\nBelow is an example of how veining can vary from piece to piece in our tiles:\nSometimes, especially when an artwork design is applied to the marble, veining can be mistaken for ink smudging or smearing. Rest assured that this is most certainly not the case, but rather a reflection of the marble’s unique and complex history.\nColor variation is another common characteristic of natural stone.\nOne stone type that has a variety of colors is Limestone. The most typical style of limestone usually displays an airy mix of white, beige, and cream shades and is perfect for creating elevated interiors. From piece to piece, however, some shades may be more prominent than others.\nFor example, take our tumbled Perle Blanc, a luxurious variant of Limestone, shown below:\nAgain, the aesthetic variations that you observe are simply a byproduct of the exceptional, natural circumstances that led to the formation of this stone.\nNext up, we have pitting variation.\nPitting refers to the small indentations and holes in natural stone. These markings reflect how other elements, like water, interact with the stone over time and the specific mix of minerals that comprise the stone.\nOur tumbled Light Travertine decorative tiles, shown below, offer an attractive, rustic appearance, reminiscent of Old World elegance.\nWith this variety of natural stone, every piece tells its own story. Tumbled Light Travertine, like many other natural stones, offers your interior added dimension, visual interest, and individual character.\nNatural Stone Sensitivities\nWhile natural stone might be solid as a rock, it is sensitive to certain things.\nFor example, when going through manmade manufacturing processes natural stone tiles may end up with small chips, usually seen on the back of the tile.\nContrary to what you may think, these tiny notches are totally normal and a regular occurrence when this type of organic material goes through production.\nAs mentioned earlier, these small chips do not compromise the integrity and strength of the stone and will be filled in or supported by the adhesive during installation.\nMaintenance and Care\nNatural stone also requires special care and maintenance to preserve its distinctive beauty.\nBecause stone is a natural product, it is sensitive to harsh abrasive cleaners or abrasive cleaning tools.\nWhen you need to clean your natural stone tiles use a soft cloth, warm water, and pH neutral cleaner or non-acidic soap. Never use an electric scrubber or buffer!\nAnd always adhere to the sealer maintenance schedule recommended by your sealant manufacturer.\nIf you are ever in doubt as to how to properly care for your stone tiles, review our Frequently Asked Questions.\nThe next time you see natural stone, we hope you will be able to identify and understand some of the variations you may see between pieces.\nAnd remember the age-old adage: Don’t judge a book by its cover. These differences are aesthetic and reflect the remarkable beauty of stone.\nCurious to learn more about natural stone? Discover the importance of nominal sizes for natural stone tiles today!', 'If you’re like me, you’re probably constantly wondering how to get rid of those pesky glass rings on your marble countertops. Well, wonder no more! Here are a few easy tips to keep your counters looking sparkling clean.\nHow to remove glass rings from marble\nMarble is a natural stone that consists of calcium carbonate.

Wipe in a circular motion until the rings are gone.\nIf neither of these methods works, you may need to call in a professional marble restorer.\nHow to clean marble showers\nCleaning a marble shower is not difficult, but it does require taking special care of the stone. Because marble is a soft stone, it can be etched and scratched easily. In addition, marble is a porous material, which means it can absorb water and stains if not properly sealed.\nTo clean a marble shower, you will need:\n-A mild soap or detergent\n-A soft cloth or sponge\n-A cup of distilled white vinegar\n-A cup of baking soda\n-A clean cloth or towel\nBegin by mixing equal parts vinegar and water in a bowl. Dip your cloth or sponge into the mixture and use it to wipe down the shower walls. Be sure to rinse the area well with clean water when you are finished.\nNext, make a paste out of baking soda and water. Apply the paste to any stains or marks on the marble and let it sit for several minutes before scrubbing softly with a clean cloth or sponge. Rinse away the paste with clean water when you are finished.\nFor tougher stains, you may need to use a mild soap or detergent. Wet your cloth or sponge with soapy water and gently scrub the affected area. Rinse away the soap with clean water when you are finished. You should avoid using harsh chemicals on Marble, as they can damage the surface.\nAfter cleaning, use your squeegee to remove any remaining water from the shower walls. This will help prevent soap scum buildup and keep your shower looking its best. Dry the area with a clean towel or cloth when you are finished.\nHow to clean outdoor marble\nOutdoor marble can be a beautiful and elegant addition to your home, but it can also be difficult to keep clean.

47	stereo speakers setup distance effect bass	The distance of stereo speakers from walls affects bass response in two ways: placing them closer to the front wall increases bass output but may reduce spaciousness and sonic depth. Additionally, due to modal coupling, moving speakers away from or towards corners can decrease or increase bass response respectively. When a speaker is placed in a corner, it moves the first cancellation notch to higher frequencies.	"['How To Get The Most Out Of Your Speakers\nLet\'s get right to the point: For home theater, a good audio system is just as important as a good video display. Sure, large-screen LCD, plasma, and DLP TVs and video projectors look spectacular. But if you don\'t have a high-quality audio system to complement the image, you\'re literally missing out on half of the home-entertainment experience - especially with today\'s high resolution audio formats like Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio, and the launch of the newly available Dolby Pro Logic IIz. This might be the best investment advice you\'ll get all year: Don\'t skimp on the audio system when you buy that big-screen TV!\nYou don\'t have to be a rocket scientist to set up a superb-sounding speaker system that\'ll immerse you in the onscreen action and transport you right onto the bridge of the Enterprise or into the middle of a football game. Also, some of you might already have a high-quality speaker system but feel that you can coax even better performance from it.\nIn a stereo setup, the left and right speakers should be placed equidistant from the listening position. Ideally, they will also be placed equidistant from the side and rear walls, but not all rooms allow for this. (You don\'t need a subwoofer for stereo listening as long as the left and right speakers are reasonably full-range.)\nStarting With Stereo\nWhile it\'s great to have multichannel surround sound, it\'s not mandatory. Many rooms can\'t accommodate a multichannel speaker setup, and some listeners simply want to stick with stereo. The fact is, even a modest pair of bookshelf speakers can provide a spacious soundstage and a surprising amount of volume and bass. But smaller speakers sound best in a 2.1-channel setup where you have a left and right speaker and a subwoofer. A few stereo receivers have a subwoofer output to accommodate this configuration.\nThe main difference between a correctly and a haphazardly set up speaker system is that a proper one can immerse listeners in a sense of three dimensional space, while a poorly set up system will seem to have the vocalists and instruments plastered fl at against the speaker grilles.\nBefore getting into speaker placement, I have to emphasize a crucial fact: The interaction between the speakers and your room is just as important as the room itself. While every speaker has its own sonic voice or ""signature,"" how it actually sounds is inseparable both from the room and from its position in that room. All rooms have areas of bass cancellation, where a speaker\'s audible output is reduced, and of bass reinforcement, where the same speaker will produce more bass. Cancellation and reinforcement areas can be close together - sometimes moving a speaker a foot or less in any direction can have a major impact on bass performance. The same is true of your listening position - try moving your chair or couch closer to or farther from the front speakers and see if you get an improvement.\nMany of the fundamentals of stereo speaker placement also apply to a multichannel speaker setup. First and foremost is the principle of symmetry. Stereo and multichannel speakers won\'t image properly - that is, they won\'t place the singers, instruments, and sound effects consistently within the sound field, each contributing to the overall mix from a specific distance and direction - unless they\'re set up as symmetrically as possible. The left and right speakers should be equidistant from the listening position and the rear walls - and, if possible, from the side walls as well (although this isn\'t always practical). Don\'t eyeball this - take out your tape measure, since differences of less than a half inch can be audible, especially with highend speakers and systems.\nStereo speakers, and front left/right speakers in a multichannel setup, should be positioned like mirror images of each other - either facing straight out or angled equally in toward the listening position.\nPlacing the speakers too far from each other will create a ""hole in the middle"" effect, while placing them too close together causes stereo imaging to suffer. A good rule of thumb is to divide the wall behind the speakers into thirds and place the speakers at the one-third and two-thirds points, and then move them out an equal distance into the room. Placing the speakers closer to the front wall will increase bass, but possibly at the expense of spaciousness and front-to-back sonic depth. You\'ll also have to avoid areas of bass cancellation and reinforcement. Experiment with all placement factors including toe-in and even angling the speakers back slightly, until you get to the point where tonal balance, dynamic response, imaging, and sound staging all ""lock in"" as best as possible. Don\'t be discouraged if it takes time or more than one listening session. Also, compromises might have to be made to accommodate your room.\nWhile the subject of room acoustics is an article (or a book) in itself, in brief, you need to consider the room\'s surfaces and furnishings. If one speaker is next to a bare wall and the other is next to heavy drapes, the differences in how those materials reflect and absorb sound waves will cause the two speakers to sound different and make accurate stereo imaging impossible. Consider adjusting the room furnishings if necessary or possible.Check out our 2009 Holiday Gift Guide: Filled with 60 Products that will crank up the fidelity on your shopping list.', ""Sound Diffusion : Diffusion is the scattering of sound in all directions so that discrete reflections are not heard. The intensity and flow of the sonic energy is equal in every location of the room. Although walls and ceilings in any space can produce discrete reflections, the problem is usually noticed in small rooms with loud sources such as loudspeakers or music practice rooms. The reflections from the room interfere with the ability to properly hear.\nThe solution is to add diffuser panels to the walls and ceilings of the room. These panels don’t absorb sound but rather reflect it in many directions. Diffused sound is the spatial and temporal reflection pattern of mid and late arriving reflections to the listening area.\nA room that has sufficient diffusion will eliminate interfering reflections and maintain a natural ambience, It adds warmth and produces sonic images with more spaciousness (i.e.; more width, depth, and height and uniformly distributes the sound throughout the room). Diffusing surfaces have been used since antiquity in the form of statuary, coffered ceilings, columns and surface ornamentation.\nSound Diffraction: Diffraction is the act of changing the direction of a sound wave as it passes through an opening or around an object in its path. The amount of diffraction is determined by the sharpness of the bending of the sound wave. It increases with increasing wavelength and decreases with decreasing wavelength. When the wavelength of the waves are smaller than the obstacle no noticeable diffraction occurs. This is where diffusion takes over, by redirecting the waves. Our panels do both, depending on the frequency.\nComb Filtering : Comb filtering is the constructive and destructive interference between the direct sound and early reflections. Reflections cause time delays. This is because the reflected path length between the listener and source is longer than the direct sound path. Thus, when the direct sound is combined with the reflected sound, the listener experiences notches and peaks referred to as comb filtering. Using absorption panels will deal with comb filtering by removing energy from the room. It also deadens the room. Diffusion distributes the reflection over time, without absorption and thereby eliminates the comb filtering.\nRoom Modes: Sound waves consistently interfere as they reflect back and forth between hard walls. This interference results in tone quality at frequencies determined by the geometry of the room. This is particularly problematic at lower frequencies. That is because the step, or distance, between the next step is significantly greater than for higher frequencies. As the frequency goes up, the steps blend into a continuum, which no longer causes a sonic inconsistency. There are three types of room modes: Axial (two parallel surfaces), Tangential (4 surfaces), and Oblique (6 surfaces).\nFor most practical purposes calculating the axial modes for four room modes, the length, the width, the height and the diagonals of the room will give a good indication of which frequencies need special attention. Normally the first order, second order and third order waves are evaluated. As an example, if a room is 15’ wide, 9’ long and 7.5’ high the axial mode between two opposite walls is calculated by c/2X where c = the speed of sound (1,130 ft/sec) X = the distance between two walls. So, a 15’ wall to wall dimension results in a first order fundamental room mode of 37.6 Hz. The second order mode is 75.2 Hz and the third is 112.9 Hz. As the frequency increases, room modes are still present, but their number and density increase, so they are not perceived as a problem.\nModal Coupling : Modal Coupling is the acoustical joining of the loudspeakers and listener with the room’s modal pressure variations or room modes. Since conventional closed or ported dynamic loudspeakers are pressure sources, they will couple most efficiently when placed at a high-pressure region of the modal (or standing wave) pressure point. The loudspeaker placement will accentuate or diminish the coupling with the modal pressure variations at each of the modal frequencies. This is why in a non-linear room things sound so much different depending where you stand or sit in a room. This is also why one can increase or decrease the amount of bass by moving a loudspeaker. If you want to decrease the bass, move the speaker into the corner of the room, as close as you can. This moves the first cancellation notch to higher frequencies, where it can be reduced with porous absorption. Move the speaker away from the corner and the bass will increase.\nSpeaker Boundary Interference: (another term for modal coupling) Speaker Boundary Interference is the coherent interaction between the direct sound and the omni-directional early reflections of sound from the room’s adjacent boundaries. Since conventional closed or ported dynamic loudspeakers are pressure sources, they will couple most efficiently when placed at a high-pressure region of the modal (or standing wave) pressure point.\nThe loudspeaker placement will accentuate or diminish the coupling with the modal pressure variations at each of the modal frequencies. This is why in a non-linear room things sound so much different depending where you stand or sit in a room. To minimize the modal coupling effect it is very important to never place a speaker (especially a woofer) equidistant from the floor and two surrounding walls.\nSlap Echo: A quick repetition of the original sound after the original sound has ceased. Flutter Echo: Short echoes in small reverberant spaces that produce a clicking, ringing or hissing sound after the original sound source has ceased.\nSpecular Reflections: Specular Reflections occur when sound is reflected in one direction, like from the loudspeaker off a nearby a wall. In other words, wherever the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, it is typically called a specular reflection. This is a common flat wall reflection. A specular reflection occurs over a very short period of time. Conversely, a diffuse reflection happens over a relatively long period of time.\nLinear Room Response: Also called a Flat Response. Excellent Linear Room Response is the goal of every good listening/performing room. An excellent linear response means that for each and every frequency produced, at any given volume level, the room will effect that sound with the same relative characteristics, producing an “un-colored” sound. The sound will behave evenly anywhere in the room.\nReverb Time: Reverberation time is the time it takes a for the sound level in the room to decay 60 decibels. Or in other words, the time it takes the sound to become inaudible after turning off the sound source. Depending on the purpose of the room design, different reverb times are desired. The following are good approximate times for different applications:\nSpeech (.4 to 1 second)\nMusic practice rooms (1 to 1.5 seconds)\nHome Theater rooms (.5 to 1.25 seconds)\nLive recording rooms for quartets & jazz (.75 to 1.25 seconds)\nLive performance rooms for ensembles & contemporary music\n(1 to 2.0 seconds)\nOrchestral performance rooms (1.5 to 2.5 seconds)\nPipe Organ recitals (2 to 4 seconds)\nIn a normal sized listening room a sound wave has to travel about 10 feet on average between reflections off one of the six surfaces of a room. If the room has the typical home reverberation time of .6 seconds, a given wave will ricochet around the room some 70 times before becoming essentially inaudible.\nLive End, Dead End: The Live End-Dead End room is one of the primary designs promoted since the early 1980’s. This is where the front end of the room has primarily hard surfaces and the rear wall and rear sidewalls are primarily covered with sound absorbing material. This makes the front of the room lively and the rear of the room quite dead.\nReflection Free Zone: This is the name given the primary listening area in Home Theater Rooms and Mix/Mastering rooms. This is where the direct sound wave from the loudspeakers hit the listener before any reflected sound waves. This is done by room geometry, speaker placement, and acoustic treatment of the walls and ceiling with absorption and diffusion.\nBass Build-up: There is a lot of sonic energy in low frequency sound waves. The walls of a room can actually act like drum skins. They can sympathetically pulsate with some low end frequencies. Sometimes the geometry of the room will cause constructive interference of certain frequencies. Either of these conditions can cause Bass Build-up.\nThere are several types of porous sound absorbers commonly in use today, such as fiberglass, mineral wool or polymer foams. There are also membrane type sound absorbers and Hemholtz absorbers. They are all used to absorb sound.\nAbsorbers work by converting the acoustical energy of sound waves into heat.\nThe efficiency of a porous absorber is highest when the sound is traveling at its highest velocity. This point is reached at ¼ of the wavelength, and thus varies with the frequency. Since porous absorbers rely on particle velocity, they have limited efficiencies at low frequencies when they are mounted at the wall surfaces.\nAt the wall surface, where most porous absorbers are placed, is where the particle velocity is zero. Unfortunately, this is where they are least efficient. However, this is where the pressure is at a maximum. To exploit this high pressure, a membrane type absorber can be employed. A membrane with high internal losses coupled with an air cavity which has a porous material near the membrane, will sympathetically oscillate with the pressure fluctuations at low frequencies, thus creating air movement through the internal porous material.\nSabin: A Sabin is a unit of sound absorption equivalent to 1 square foot having a coefficient of absorption of 1.00. This name comes from Wallace Sabine, generally considered to be the father of acoustics.\nTo calculate the amount of absorption in a room you take the number of square feet of each different material in the room and multiply it by its NRC (Noise Reduction Coefficient). Then, add these sums together. This will give you the total number of Sabins in that room.\nHow to determine how much absorption a given room needs to achieve a specific reverb time:\nA) Determine existing reverberation time\nT = V/20S\nT = Reverberation time in seconds\nV = Cubic volume in cubic feet in the room\n20 = The constant\nS = Sabins present in the room This quantity is obtained by multiplying the area of each surface by its absorption coefficient and arriving at a total.\nB.) Determine acoustical absorption required\nS = V/20T\nS = Sabins (units of absorption required in the room)\nV = Cubic volume in cubic feet in the room\n20 = The constant\nT = Desired reverberation time in the room\nC) To determine acoustical absorption we need to add\nRequired Sabins (part “B”)\n- Existing Sabins (part “A”)\n= Sabins we need to add to the space\nTo determine how many actual square feet of a particular material, you have to look up its NRC and multiply it times the number of Sabins required.\nAcoustic Treatments: Any device or object designed to affect the sonic characteristics of a room is an acoustic treatment. All acoustic treatment materials have published performance specifications. Sound absorbers have a rating known as a Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC). These properties vary over different frequencies. Materials are tested at 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000 & 4000 cps. An average of the middle 4 frequencies is known as the NRC.\nLoudness of Sound: The loudness of a sound decreases with the square of the distance from the source. Sound travels about 730 miles per hour in all directions. The size of the room affects the listening experience. In any room, especially smaller ones, it becomes quite obvious how critical the space and loudness of sound affects the listening experience.\nBass Trap - Diaphragmatic or Membrane Absorber, Hemholtz Absorber:\nEvery audio engineer knows the importance of proper acoustic treatment. Without real bass traps, mixes that sound fine in your control room often sound boomy or thin when played elsewhere. Foam products and light-weight tubes absorb only the mid and upper frequencies. They do little to stop standing waves and acoustic interference that cause severe low frequency peaks and dips. And if you can't hear bass instruments accurately, it's impossible to create mixes that sound good everywhere.\nLow frequency response variations as large as 35 dB are common, especially in smaller rooms. Worse, the peaks and dips change around the room. The sound is thin here. It’s too bassy over there. And nowhere is the response even close to flat. A lack of effective low frequency absorption also makes the bass range sound muddy and ill defined.\nOnce a room has been properly treated the clarity and articulation of bass instrumentsimproves enormously, so you can hear what you're mixing more accurately and with much less effort.\nA Hemholtz bass trap or resonator is a device used to capture a very specific low frequency problem. It works much like blowing over the top of a bottle; a particular note is produced. If a porous absorber is placed in the neck of the bottle it will trap that resonant frequency. This is how the Hemholtz bass trap is constructed constructed.

48	vintage baseball cards distribution method price range before after store vending machine	The Exhibit Supply Company initially distributed baseball cards through vending machines in arcades, stores, and bars for a penny each, with prices later rising to a dime. In contrast, the 1933 George C. Miller Baseball cards were distributed differently, being sold in toffee packages specifically marked as 'National Ball Game Toffee' or 'American Ball Game Toffee'.	"['|09-22-2009, 07:54 AM||#1 (permalink)|\nJoin Date: Jun 2007\nVintage Baseball Exhibit Cards Paved Way\nVintage Baseball Exhibit Cards Paved Way\nA simple concept became a long-running series of baseball cards when the Exhibit Supply Company began cranking up the presses.\nExhibit Supply Company was the first organization to ever distribute sports cards that were not tied to peripheral products. Previously, sports cards were often part of a promotion or even had coupons that one could clip out of the card itself. The cards produced by the Chicago-based company were sold merely for the novelty of collecting them and reading the biographies or information for the subject of the card.\nThe novelty of Exhibit Supply Company’s product did not end with its new product though. The delivery method was also an innovation for its time. Exhibit advertised to arcade owners, store owners, bar owners, and basically everyone that owned a high traffic venue, their ‘amusement machines’. The idea was that Exhibit Supply Company would sell an amusement device, such as a fortune teller, scale, etc. This device would bring the venue more customers and Exhibit Supply Company would profit from refilling and maintaining the device. This method was employed as the primary method of ESC\'s distribution of their cards through the sale of card vending machines. Some collectors refer to them rightfully as ""arcade cards"".\nThough the company did profit from the sale of the machines, its real profit was realized by selling the refills for these devices, due to the extreme popularity of the cards, and the sheer volume that each machine went through. The cards were originally sold for a penny apiece, but after their popularity was realized, the price steadily climbed as high as a dime, requiring a purchase of a new vending machine for the venue.\nThe company’s foray into card manufacture and distribution began in 1921 and saw enormous growth from the outset of the venture. They produced cards featuring nearly everything imaginable: sports stars, Hollywood starlets, fighter jets, and television stars. By far, the most popular cards were those of the baseball stars. By the 19th century, professional baseball was solidified as the national pastime, and there were few icons that embodied American idealism more than the rugged, powerful, and precise men of professional baseball. As the baseball cards took off, this prompted the company to produce even more cards, and when the popularity finally peaked in the early 1960’s, they even opted to sell the cards directly in celluloid packages, bypassing the need for the vending machines. The vending machines were so entrenched in the consumer mindset though, and the collectibility of the vending machine cards was so well established, that patrons were very leery about the value and quality of the packaged cards. This shift in focus eventually led to Exhibit Supply Company going out of business in 1971.\nThough they are no longer producing their famed cards, the fact that the company no longer exists has made its products into sought after collector’s items. The vending machines themselves are very popular when they come up in major sports memorabilia auctions. The advertising equipment that accompanied each machine has become highly desirable as well, especially those portraying baseball stars. A 1920s Exhibit vending machine sold at auction in June of this year for $1022.\nThe cards themselves though, are the most universally sought after commodity from this venture. Much less rugged than the machines and advertising peripherals, very few cards survived in pristine quality; after all, they were primarily the fare of school kids in arcades, and very few had the good sense to keep them locked away to preserve them.\nThe baseball cards are by far the most valuable from this collection though. Due in part to their popularity during the era of Exhibit Supply Company, but due mostly to the popularity of baseball cards today. ESC inspired a great number of other companies to begin producing their own cards when their product was performing so admirably. Those who chose to follow Exhibit Supply Company’s example chose to base their business model on the most profitable aspect of the company, its baseball card production. The initial foray into supplying baseball cards in celluloid packages helped to ease collectors into the notion that this was entirely acceptable, and this paved the way for the brands that still exist today.\nMany of the game\'s greatest stars are pictured on Exhibit cards--many of whom have multiple cards within the various series. During World War II, Exhibit cards remained among the few widely distributed trading card products despite a paper conservation effort, although its sets remained smaller during the War years. The \'42-45 series are more difficult to find that many of the other series.\nMany Exhibit cards are difficult to connect to a certain season because of the lack of statistics or a manufacture date on the back, but tireless research by collectors has established checklists that are generally accurate. Exhibit cards are generally exceptionally affordable except for certain issues, like those made in the 1920s. Two years ago, a 1925 Lou Gehrig \'rookie\' card graded PSA 5, sold on eBay for a ""best offer"" price of $14,000.\nThe baseball cards that Exhibit Supply Company produced primarily derive their value from their position near the beginning of the great baseball card legacy and their extreme cultural value, capturing players from the golden age of professional baseball.\n-Story from Sports Collectors Daily', '1933 George C. Miller Baseball Cards\nEqual parts difficult and beautiful, the attractiveness of the 1933 George C. Miller Baseball set is enough to make many collectors ignore the overall rarity and still attempt to complete the set. Geared primarily toward children, the scarce regional release features 32 cards that were originally available in toffee packages from the Miller Candy Co.\nDistributed in league-specific packages that were noted as ""National Ball Game Toffee"" or ""American Ball Game Toffee,"" 1933 George C. Miller Baseball cards are moderately sized at 2-3/8"" by 2-7/8"". The set is officially recognized as R300 in the American Card Catalog. Among the 32 card checklist, each MLB team has two players featured. While that includes a good variety of talent from across the sport, the card choices for the New York Yankees are somewhat disappointing since they went with Red Ruffing and Bill Dickey as opposed to Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.\nWhile the fact that the cards were only issued in and around Boston is partly to blame for the scarcity, 1933 George C. Miller Baseball card numbers are further diminished because of a promotion. In exchange for a complete set, collectors could receive a baseball, glove or game ticket. Redeemed cards were returned with the selected item, but they were ""cancelled"" to prevent duplicate redemption. This took a variety of forms, including cut edges, hole punches and stamped marks. As a result, the redeemed cards that weren\'t discarded carry this damage, keeping the supply of cards graded above a six to a minimum.\n1933 George C. Miller Baseball features a somewhat-generic, but still very impressive, artistic card design. In addition to a close-up image, largely with a forward posed shot, all 32 cards share a similar background. This includes a green field, bordered by woods, and a colorful sky. No text is found on the front of the cards.\nThe card backs leave little empty space, packing in basic stats for each player, a full checklist and information about the promotion. There are two different back designs available in 1933 George C. Miller Baseball, but the difference is minimal. The earlier edition, known as Type I, features larger text, brighter printing, and misspells Foxx and Klein in the checklist (Fox/Klien). Type II has the corrected spelling of the names and the text placement for the ad at the bottom does not match up the same as the first edition.\nAlthough the majority of the 1933 George C. Miller Baseball checklist features Hall of Fame players, a non-HOF card causes the most problems for collectors. As was the case in several products that included prizes for complete sets, one card from the George C. Miller release was severely short printed. The card for ""Ivy"" Paul Andrews is very tough to find in any condition, and virtually impossible to locate without the damage associated with being cancelled. As such, many collectors treat the set as complete at 31 cards.\nKey 1933 George C. Miller Baseball Cards\nClick on the images or images to shop for cards on eBay.\n1933 George C.

50	What are the economic barriers and funding sources discussed?	Vertical farming received over US$1 billion in industry funding in 2021, while facing high operational costs from energy usage and labor. For de-extinction, while the process would be extremely expensive, funding could come from unconventional sources like wealthy celebrities or investors interested in commercial ventures like 'Mammoth Park', rather than traditional conservation funding pools.	"['Pausing in her grazing, a mother mammoth casts a wary eye for signs of danger to herself and her offspring. Hidden from her view, a saber-toothed cat assesses his chances of getting a meal…or getting stomped. The cat is startled by movement behind it and whirls about to confront a vehicle full of people. Digital photos are snapped, then uploaded to Facebook. “Damn tourists”, thinks the cat, as it saunters away.\nWhile this scene is not yet a reality, there are people who hope to make it so through de-extinction. De-extinction is the restoration of a species that has been lost to extinction. The most famous fictional example is Jurassic Park: dinosaurs are restored and made the central focus of an amusement park. There have been real-life attempts at restoring lost species, but these have focused on species that went extinct far more recently than the dinosaurs.\nThere are various ways in which a species can be restored. The best known (thanks to the movies) is genetic restoration: the genes of the species are recovered and used to recreate the species. For example, recovered mastodon DNA could be implanted into an “emptied” elephant egg and the egg could then be implanted into a female elephant. If the process succeeded, the surrogate mother would give birth to an actual mastodon.\nA somewhat less known method is “trait” or “appearance” restoration. In this method, an extinct species is recreated by selectively modifying an existing species until it looks like the extinct species. For example, an extinct species of pigeons could be “restored” in this manner. One rather obvious question about this method is whether or not such a restoration should be considered an actual de-extinction. To use the obvious analogy, if after my death someone is modified to look like me, then I have not been restored to life. Likewise, creating a species that looks (and acts) like the extinct species does not seem to really restore the species. Rather, a rather clever imposter has been created.\nIn additional to the practical concerns of the science and technology of de-extinction, there are also moral concerns. Not surprisingly, many of these concerns involve he potential consequences of de-extinction.\nOne matter of concern is that the de-extinction of a species could actually have negative consequences for other species or the environment. A restored species could become an invasive and harmful species (directly or indirectly), which would be rather bad and has been shown by existing invasive species that have been transported by humans into new environments. In the case of de-extinction, humans would be re-created rather than transporting-but the effect could be quite similar.\nIt can be replied that the impact of a species could be sorted out ahead of time, especially if the species went extinct fairly recently. The counter to this reply is to point out that people have made rather serious mistakes when importing species and that it is not unreasonable to believe that people could make comparable mistakes.\nAnother matter of concern that a species could be restored despite there not being a viable habitat for it. This sort of irresponsible de-extinction might occur for a variety of reasons, perhaps to provide a novelty attraction for a zoo or park. This sort of treatment of an animal would certainly seem to be wrong because of the exploitation of the species. The reply to this is the same that is given when species that are close to extinction are kept in zoos or parks: such an existence is better than no existence. This does have a certain appeal, but it could be contended that restoring an animal to keep it in a zoo is relevantly different from endeavoring to preserve an existing species. It could also be contended that the zoo preservation of endangered species is wrong, hence the restoration of an extinct species to serve as a zoo exhibit would also be wrong.\nOne common argument against re-extinction is that it would be expensive and it would thus take money away from conservation efforts that would yield more results for the money. While I cannot predict the exact cost of restoring a mastodon, it seems safe to predict that it would be extremely expensive. This money could, one might argue, be better spent in protecting elephants.\nWhile such cost arguments have considerable appeal, they often suffer from an obvious defect. This defect is that the argument fails to take into account the fact that there is not just one pool of money that is allocated to this matter. That is, money spent on restoring a species need not come from the money that would otherwise be spent on preserving existing species.\nWhile it could be argued that money spent on de-extinction would be better spent elsewhere, it could very well be the case that the money spent on de-extinction would not, in fact, be spent on anything better. To use an obvious example, a wealthy celebrity might not care much about the plight of the snail darter, but he might be willing to spend millions of dollars to get a saber-toothed cat. To use another example, an investor might not be interested in spending money to save elephants, but she might be very interested in funding a Mammoth Park featuring restored mammoths and other charismatic but extinct species that people would pay to see. Interestingly, this sort of funding could itself raise moral concerns. That is, bringing back the mammoths so some investors can make a fortune on Mammoth Park might strike some as morally dubious.\nLaying aside the moral concerns connected to why we should not engage in de-extinction, there is also to matter of why we should (morally) do this. In the case of natural extinctions, it would seem that we would not have a moral reason to restore a species. After all, humans were not responsible for its demise. Naturally, we might have pragmatic (to create Mammoth Park) or scientific reasons to restore such a species.\nIn the case of human caused extinctions, a case can be made that we should undo the (alleged) wrong that we did. This line of reasoning has the most appeal. After all, if we were responsible for the death of a species and we could restore this species, then it would seem that we should do so. To use the obvious analogy, if I kill someone (by accident or by intent) and then I get the means to restore the person, then I should do so (unless, of course, killing the person was the right thing to do).\nIn any case, I am waiting for my dire wolf-husky crossbreed.', 'Vertical Farming: Location a Key Factor to Success, Says IDTechEx\nVertical farming, the practice of growing crops indoors on vertically stacked layers, has received no small amount of interest over the last few years. Vertical farms commonly tout impressive numbers, such as using 95% less water and providing crop yields 20-30 times that of conventional agriculture. These claims, among many others, have seen many vertical farming start-ups being founded alongside large amounts of industry funding; funding for the industry reached a record high in 2021, with over US$1 billion being raised across the entire industry. The recent IDTechEx report, ""Vertical Farming 2022-2032"", details the economic and technological factors shaping this rapidly growing industry.\nWith crops being grown indoors under controlled environments, a selling point used by multiple vertical farms is that they can grow crops anywhere – even in the heart of a city. This has led to proponents of the industry envisioning ""smart cities"", where vertical farms in city skyscrapers help feed the urban population. While this is achievable in principle, the truth is that the choice of location for vertical farming is much more involved and intricate than it may appear from these claims alone. Choosing an ideal location can be one of the most important factors in determining the success of a vertical farm.\nSome vertical farms may choose to set up their facilities in pre-existing facilities, such as abandoned warehouses. In these cases, identifying the suitability of the venue is the first point of consideration: vertical farms are very energy intensive, and it is important to ensure the facilities chosen can support these energy loads. In addition, the ergonomics of the facility is also important; should the layout not be given proper consideration, this can impede workers and decrease worker efficiency. As labor costs are typically among the largest sources of expenditure for a vertical farm, improving labor efficiency to reduce these costs is of paramount importance.\nWhile growing crops in the center of a city may seem ideal, the reality is that this may be counterproductive. Obtaining and maintaining such a location is expensive and can contribute significantly to the operating expenditure of a vertical farm while presenting logistical challenges in distributing produce; the ""last mile"" of food distribution is often the hardest. Having a farm right next to the consumers themselves may also be less ideal than instead choosing a location near food distribution centers, as this allows for more efficient delivery of produce. As distribution centers are typically located on the outskirts of cities, the cost of land is also much cheaper. This is the approach chosen by UK-based Jones Food Company, which chose Scunthorpe as a location for its vertical farm – this is a relatively low-cost location located near food distribution centers and a network of motorways that could still reach many consumers in a day, even if it isn\'t right in the middle of the capital city. Vertical farms should carefully consider their place in the supply chain before establishing a base.\nOn a larger scale, vertical farms may prove more profitable in different geographical regions. Vertical farms can reduce water usage significantly over conventional agriculture, and the high degree of control over the growing environment allows them to grow crops in extreme climates – where such crops may not otherwise be able to grow. In return, vertical farms demand more energy to carry out growing operations. To maximize their potential, vertical farms would ideally be located in regions of water scarcity, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, or in areas with extreme climates, such as in Scandinavian countries, where the low amounts of sunlight and high costs of regulating greenhouse environments single out vertical farms as an optimal solution. The amount of agricultural land available is also an important factor – regions looking to increase food security and reduce reliance on imports while facing challenges in acquiring sufficient agricultural land would find vertical farms to be ideal. A particularly prominent example of such a country is Singapore, which has demonstrated much interest in vertical farming over the last few years.\nBeyond the considerations of water scarcity and temperature, the general availability of fresh produce and the distribution networks of given countries should also be considered. Vertical farms use the added freshness and higher quality of their crops as a primary selling point, but these are typically offset by higher prices. Should there already be a large supply of high-quality produce made available at lower costs, vertical farms will find it hard to distinguish their own produce and may struggle to establish a significant market share. The converse would also be true; should a country lack easy access to fresh produce, vertical farms are expected to see much demand for their produce. An example of such a region would be the Middle East: leafy greens typically travel several thousand miles to reach stores, resulting in consumers facing high prices and low-quality products. The high price of conventionally farmed leafy greens, alongside government subsidies, makes it easier for vertically farmed produce to approach price parity while providing much fresher, higher-quality products.\nWhile the choice of location is an important consideration, it is only one of many others that must be given proper thought. Only through proper optimization of growing operations to improve efficiency and reduce costs can vertical farms reach their true potential. In the IDTechEx report, ""Vertical Farming 2022-2032"", many further important factors for consideration are discussed in detail, and the future of vertical farming is evaluated through 10-year market forecasts.\nIDTechEx guides your strategic business decisions through its Research, Subscription and Consultancy products, helping you profit from emerging technologies.

51	Hi! I'm a homeowner with both a gas tank and an emergency supply of fuel for disasters. I'm wondering which one typically requires more frequent inspections - the underground gas tank for home use or the emergency fuel storage for disasters?	Based on the documents, aboveground storage tanks require routine external inspections monthly by the owner/operator, plus external ultrasonic thickness inspection at least every 5 years when corrosion rates are unknown. Internal inspections must occur within 10 years of initial service and subsequent inspections are based on corrosion rates, not exceeding 20 years without a Risk Based Inspection assessment. For emergency fuel storage during disasters, while specific inspection intervals aren't mandated, the documents indicate fuel must be rotated regularly since it deteriorates over time, even with stabilizers. Diesel generally has a longer shelf life than gasoline.	['Facing an Emergency\nNatural Disasters or Man Made Disasters can result in situations when one’s life, health or property is at stake. A Disaster can cause severe problems for transportation, electricity, electronic communications, the access to gas, heating and other systems that most people rely on an everyday basis and take for granted. Most modern appliances like phones, computers, lights, heating, refrigeration, air condition and even water pumps can cease to function in this type of scenarios. Bugging In refers to the tactic of minimizing the impact that such an event may have for you. Many situations do not have to result in a life or death situation if you simply have a plan and the means to deal with them.\nA disaster rarely disrupts all functions in a society even if this is a possibility. Functions are often brought back relatively fast after a disaster, power companies can often be able to make repairs relatively quick etc. But some natural disasters like the 2006 Tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, The Haiti Earthquake and the recent Japanese Tsunami are event that have affected and will continue to affect entire regions for long periods of time. Disasters can also have a long lasting impact on local areas. In most crisis and survival situations life may completely or partly keep on going as normal – school, work and other activities may continue even if massive damage has been dealt to a community. The magnitude of disasters is not only total devastation or normality; therefore I suggest that you try to have a sliding scale approach in your Bug In Plan.\nDuring your everyday life you can often get Early Warnings for potential disasters like hurricanes by following the news and your local weather prognosis. How much time you should spend on following the events around the world is a matter of personal preferences; you can just make a quick check every morning and having a weather application for your Smartphone or computer; or you can spend basically an unlimited amount of time checking multiple international, regional and local news media. Another potential important source of information is your local or national crisis management agency like the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n[ ] Check the Weather Forecast and News Every Morning\nSome types of disasters like storms, Hurricanes and Blizzards may be foreseen before they actually take place. In these cases an Early Warning may be given by authorities or other sources that may allow for Preparations to be made. In these types of situations it is however very common that people ignore or downplay the threat; it’s hard for people to really perceive a hurricane as a threat if the warning is given several days before it hits when the sun is shining and the weather is great.\n[ ] Follow the Development of the Situation\n[ ] Make a timeline for what information that you have received, at what time and from what source.\n[ ] Inform Friends and Family about the ongoing Situation\n[ ] What you know about this type of Situation or Threat? Make some basic research to learn more about how this type of situation and what you can do to minimize the potential impact.\n[ ] Check if there are any plans made by local, regional or national crisis management agencies for how to deal with this type of situation.\nAt some situations it can become clear that a situation will become a real problem and that it will affect you. In this case you should make all the preparations that you can to minimize the impact.\n[ ] Continue to Follow the Development\n[ ] Continue to make a timeline for the ongoing development\n[ ] Check in with friends and family. How are they are planning to deal with the situation? Do they require any help or is there anything they can do to help you?\n[ ] Make Preparations to minimize the potential Consequences\n[ ] Check Supplies and your Inventory. Is there and field where you should increase your capability?\nA few types of scenarios may make it necessary to stay indoors in the Home. A catastrophic pandemic, massive civil unrest, a blizzard or a chemical or radioactive release may make require this approach for short or long periods of time. This represents the most extreme action required; most situations are not likely to require such drastic actions.\nPart 1: The Risk Assessment\nI suggest that as the first part of your Bug In Plan should be your Risk Assessment. A Risk Assessment is an attempt to find and classify Risks in a systematical manner by trying to judge the potential Consequences and how Likely a certain risk is.\nThis Assessment will give you an idea of potential threats that you may face, how likely they are and what consequences they might have. From this perspective you can start to action in order to minimize the potential impact of the Risks and acquire knowledge, skills and equipment that may allow you to cope with them in a better way. There are always Risks that may not be possible to foresee, but making an Assessment can help you to avoid some of the threats that you may face. Your setting will affect your vulnerability to these Risks; your type of housing, how high your Home is located above sea level, insulation etc. Dependencies on gas or district heating are other examples of factors that can make you vulnerable to certain types of Risks.\nAfter you have made you’re Risk Assessment its time that you ask yourself what kind of capacity that you want to have in order to deal with different kind of emergencies or disasters. Some questions that can be relevant:\n• How long do you think that you may have to be able to cope without external assistance?\n• What kind of Skills and Knowledge may help you to overcome these events?\n• What type of Equipment and Gear can be useful to deal with these threats?\n• What kind of solutions is most effective for your specific setting and situation?\n• How much of your time and income are you willing to invest in being prepared?\nPart 2: The Group\nIn the second part of the Plan I suggest that you gather information about the members of your household, friends and other people that are important to you. This information can help you to get in contact with them and make you aware of potential medical needs they may have during an emergency or how you should contact if anything would happen to them.\n• Home Phone Number and Fax Number\n• Home Address and Type of Housing\n• Mobile Phone Number\n• E-mail Address\n• Work Address and Occupation\n• Work Phone Number\n• Date of Birth\n• Special Medical Needs\n• Blood Group\n• Known allergies\n• Physical Description; Length, Weight, Hair, Eyes etc, a photograph can also be useful.\n• Skills and Education\n• Access to Specific Equipment\n• What type of driver licenses does the person have and what vehicles can they operate?\n• How should you contact if anything would happen to them? Write down the name of the persons and contact information like Phone Number, E-mail and Address.\nPart 3: Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)\nHow will you maintain your every day needs like Water, Food, Cooking, Trash Disposal, Hygiene and Sanitation, Light, Communications, Emergency Power during the types of Risks that you have identified? I suggest that you create Standard Operating Procedures, or in other words standardized solutions for how to deal with different types of needs. Here you can include predures for anything from where and how you can gather and purify water, how you will prepare food without electricity or gather information about an ongoing event.\nExamples of SOP:s for a Bug In Plan\n• Monitoring an ongoing Crisis\nCreate a Timeline: What has Happened? When Did You receive This Information? From what Source did you receive This Information? Multiple sources: The Media, Radio, TV, FEMA, Local Crisis Management Agencies etc.\n• Communications with Friends and Family\nCell Phone, Social Networks, CB or HAM Radio, Landline etc\n• CBRN Management and Preparedness\nClosing Ventilation, Closing Doors and Windows. Using towels and or tape to seal cracks around doors or windows.\n• Collecting and Purifying Water\nExtra Water Containers, Water BOB, Water Purification Filter, Water Purification Tablets, How much bleach to use in order to disinfect water etc\n• Emergency Toilets and Hygiene – Routines\nSame people using the same toilets, where to put waste, hand sanitation, routines for how often to clean facilities etc.\n• Loss of Electrical Power\nEat food that need refrigeration first, Light Sources, How to receive news (Battery powered radio or other alternative solutions) etc\n• Fire Safety\nFire Escapes / Fire Drills / Evacuation, Fire Alarms, Where can extinguishers be founds etc\n• Staying Warm\nHeaters, Warm Clothing, Extra Blankets, Sleeping Bags etc\nPart 4: Getting Home\nDisasters may strike at any time; most people spend much of their time either at work, school or some other type of daytime activity. If disaster strikes and you are far away from home it can be good to make preparations that may help you to get back home. This Plan should not only be for you but also for other family members. If you have children, elderly or disabled members in the household how where will they be picked up and how can they be transported? I also suggest that you make some meeting points, one primary and one secondary.\nCommunications is another critical aspect. How would you communicate? Phones or Cell phones is normally the easiest way of communications since most people often carry their Cell Phones with them at all times. Social Networks, E-Mail, CB-Radio or Ham-Radio could be other alternatives forms of communication.\nGet Home Bag\nA Get Home Bag (GHB) is a tool designed to provide you with the tools you may need to deal with everyday problems, emergencies and situation when you have to make back home during a disaster. A Get Home Bag may be the bag that you carry with you at all times with some additional equipment to cope with an emergency or a specific bag that you keep at your work place on in your vehicle. Having a GHB can be a great resource, but in a worst case scenario you may have to make do with the items that you carry on your person; this is equipment is often referred to as and Every Day Carry (EDC).\nDistance from Home\nIf you and your family members live close to your work place, school or other types of day activities getting everyone back home do not have to be a very complicated process. But if you work a long distance from Home, or possibly work in another area or town during the weeks this may be a more difficult process. How much efforts you must put into this type of preparedness depends on your own situation.\nTransportation and The Routes Back Home\nGetting back home during an ongoing Crisis Situation can be a very easy matter if you work very close to your home, but there are also people how commute long distances and may find them far away from home if disaster would strike. Your Every Day Life must govern your own plans and efforts. I suggest that you take the following steps when you make your plan for getting back home after an emergency.\n• Start with marking potential routes on Maps from your work place back to you Home; using markers with different colors can make the routes easy to view and follow. Online tools like Google Maps can also be used to establish routes.\n• Try to have both a Primary means of transportation like Vehicles available and a plan for a secondary means of transport like using public transports, bikes or walking.\n• Add information about the Route. Where can you find potential shelters, access to water, gas stations, hospitals, hotels, motels, hostels, hazards, repair shops, do you have any stashes on the way etc.\n• Try to identify Potential Choke Points like bridges, tunnels etc and potential ways around them.\n• Identify key infrastructure on the routes that can possibly be affected by events. Bridges could possibly be damaged or collapse from an Earthquake and Tunnels or roads be flood by a dam break etc\nPart 5: Budget\nHaving an Emergency is also a vital part of your Bug In Plan. A Disaster can cause direct economical los to your Home and other belongings; it may result in injury, destroy businesses and put people out of work. All these type of events require that you have some forms of emergency funds that can be used to cover expenses like rent, fuel, food, medical bills etc. Having the proper form of medical Insurances, Insurances for your Home that cover Natural Disasters etc may also be critical.\nReducing your Loans and Debt are also actions that give you a more solid financial situation if you have to deal with an emergency. This budget may also be of great use for other situations like a job loss, unexpected expenses or home repairs.\nI also suggest that you try to keep a medium amount of cash at hand so that you can pay for your needs if you are dependent on a credit or debit card in case of black out. Make sure that you have a safe place to store your cash, other valuables and important documents to prevent theft or the loss of these from hazards like fire. A safe can be a good alternative if you can afford it, a Bank safety deposit box can be another alternative or complement.\nPart 6: Inventory\nHaving an Inventory of your supplies makes it easy to know what you have available during a Crisis Situation and this can also help you to plan and organize your preparedness efforts. There are many ways of organizing your inventory; one way can be to organize it into different categories like:\n[ ] Water and Food\n[ ] Cooking\n[ ] Warmth – Blankets, Sleeping Bags, Warm Clothing\n[ ] Alternative form of Heating source: Wood Stove, Heat-Pal, Kerosene Heater, Candles,\n[ ] Medical Supplies and First Aid\n[ ] Light\n[ ] Equipment to Start a Fire\n[ ] Fire Safety\n[ ] Cash, Important Documents, Family Photos etc\n[ ] Tools\n[ ] Equipment for Repairs\n[ ] Emergency Sanitation and Hygiene\n[ ] Energy – Generator, Extension Cords, Spare Parts and Fuel, Solar Chargers for batteries etc\nFor more suggestion on what kind of supplies that can be useful to have during an Emergency check out the article: Equipment for Your Home – Checklist.\nPart 7: The Transportation and Logistics Plan\nA Disaster can temporarily disrupt the access to fuel and other types of transportation so it can be vital to have a Plan for how to deal with your day to day transportation needs and if there would be a need to transport a wounded friend or family member to a hospital.\nI suggest that you both have a Primary and Secondary means of transportations in your Bug In Plan, a primary mean can be vehicles or trucks; examples of secondary means can be motor cycles, bikes, walking or public transport. Also make sure that you know what types of public means of transport that is available in your area like subways, trains, buses, airports and make sure that you have phone numbers and contact information to these companies.\n• Primary means of Transportation – Cars, Truck etc\n• Secondary Means of Transportation – Public Transport, Bikes, Motorcycles, Walking etc\nFuel is one of the things that often becomes scares after a disaster and is used as fuel for vehicles, generators and heating. I suggest that you try to keep at least the equivalent of full tank of gas for your Vehicle Available. Fuel is flammable and must be stored safely; make sure to check your local recommendations and rules for storage. Fuel and Gasoline must also be rotated on a regular basis, since it deteriorates over time, even stabilizers can increase the shelf life of fuel. Diesel generally has a longer shelf life than gasoline and a lower flammability. Having some Spare Parts and Tools for Repairs available can also be a good idea.\nPart 8: Appendix\nIn the appendix of the Plan you can gather important information like\n• Map – City Maps, Road Map, Topographical Maps, Sea Charts etc.\n• Telephone numbers and addresses to hospitals, your house doctor, Police Department, Fire Departments, CERT, The Red Cross, FEMA, local Non Governmental Organizations (NGO:s), The Red Cross, Insurance Companies, Power Companies, Gas Companies etc.\n• Contact Information to Alternative Forms of transportation; Airports, Trains, Boats, Subways etc. Phone Numbers, Websites and Addresses to companies.\n• Phone Numbers and Contact Information to friends, people at work, contacts etc. Write down information like phone numbers, e-mail address, birthday, home address and what they do for a living and if they have any specific type of skills.\n• Articles, Books and other type of reference materials.\nMany people can have special needs like a Wheelchair for getting around, Glasses, Insulin for diabetes, Heart medication or hearing aids. Make sure that your plan Include this specific needs', 'What you should know about your petroleum storage tanks\nAre your storage tanks fit for service or are they an impending disaster? The purpose of this article is to advise you on the inspection of your storage tanks and how to minimize risks that they may pose to you, the environment and other stakeholders.\nAboveground Storage Tanks (AST) are used for storage of crude oil and its derivatives such as gasoline, kerosene, diesel and fuel oil. The material of construction is carbon steel, with tank sizes ranging from 3m to 60 m in diameter. They are constructed to BS 2654, API 650 or its predecessor API 12C. There are approximately 300 storage tanks in Kenya. The main components of storage tanks are the shell, bottom, and the roof. Other components include nozzles, roof trusses, electrical shunts, stair ladders, roof seals, among others.\nOwing to the impurities present in hydrocarbon such as salts and sulphur, tanks are prone to damage mechanisms such as corrosion, which if not adequately mitigated, leads to failure of the tank.Corrosion in tanks occurs at rates and patterns unique to every component and product stored. Different products have different corrosivity and corrosion patterns, thus they dictate different life spans for the tanks. The difference in product corrosivity results from the difference in the percentage composition and nature of impurities (corrosive media) embedded in each product.\nAs a result, some products may be more aggressive on bottom plates while others may attack the roof or the shell more. For instance, kerosene tanks corrode heavily on the bottom plates but negligibly on the roof plates whereas diesel tanks corrode heavily of the roof plates internally. While the shell plates for kerosene and diesel tanks may suffer mild corrosion, gasoline tanks on the other hand may suffer heavy uneven corrosion on the shell plates.\nConsequence of Failure\nUnmitigated corrosion and lack of sufficient inspection of storage tanks eventually results in failure by product leakage. Loss of containment is an undesired eventuality with unpleasant consequences such as;\n? Environmental pollution from spillage of hazardous product\n? Product loss\n? Environment decontamination/ clean-up cost\n? Negative publicity\n? Possible hazards e.g. fires, fatalities\n? Legal implications\n? Loss of asset, costly repairs/ replacement\n? Loss of operation time due to unplanned outage\nCase studies from around the world show that the major contributor to failure of storage tanks is failure to carry out sufficient, timely inspection. For instance in 1919, USA, 21 people died and 12 million litres of product lost after a storage tank exploded. This was attributed to inadequate inspection and hefty fines were incurred in legal suits by the owner. Several other failures have occurred in the recent past, including in Kenya resulting in various consequences listed above.\nA common malpractice among tank owners has been carrying out in-service external inspection that is assumed sufficient for evaluating the fitness of the tank for continued service. Similarly, during out-of-service inspection, inspection is carried out without sweep blasting of bottom plates, in which case, visual inspection results are compromised.Inspection, Repair, Reconstruction, and Alteration of AST is governed by API 653, which gives guidance on inspection methodology, frequency, evaluation for suitability for service (acceptance and rejection criteria for components), repair methods, welding guidelines, and QA/QC measures during and after repairs.\nInspection and tank evaluation must be done by an API 653 Certified Tanks Inspector.\nEvaluation of Suitability for Service\nWhen tank inspection results show that a change has occurred from the original physical condition of the tank, an evaluation must be done to determine its fitness for continued use or change of service. In addition, when making decisions regarding repairs, alterations, dismantling, relocating, or reconstructing an existing tank, this evaluation must be done.\nPlates corroded to an average thickness of less than 2.3 mm in any 100 m2 area or plates with through hole(s) must be repaired or replaced.\nFlaws, deterioration, and corrosion greater than the original corrosion allowance that might adversely affect the performance or structural integrity of the shell must be evaluated and fitness for service determined. The tank shell must be evaluated for strength, stability, remaining life and the maximum filling height allowable after corrosion.\nThe integrity of tank bottoms must be determined to prevent perforation and subsequent leakage of hydrocarbon. The bottom may fail from;\n? Internal corrosion (product side) – pitting or uneven corrosion\n? External (Soil side) corrosion\n? Uneven settlement resulting in high localized stresses in bottom plates/ welds\nProduct side corrosion may be minimized or delayed by use of internal lining protection whereas soil side corrosion may be mitigated by installation of cathodic protection system on bottom plates. Consequences associated with bottom leakage may be minimized by installation of leak detection systems and leak prevention barriers which prevent escape of released material and/ or contain/ channel it for leak detection.\nAPI 653 stipulates that the minimum bottom plate thickness at the time of next inspection must be 2.54 mm for sketch and rectangular plates and not less than 5mm for annular plates. This implies that the thickness at current inspection must be such that after incorporating corrosion rate over the interval to next inspection, the minimum thickness at next inspection must be as stated above. Therefore, evaluation of tank bottom integrity must be done such that all sections that do not meet API 653 requirements are repaired or replaced.\nWhen determining the inspection intervals for AST, several factors must be considered e.g.;\n? Nature of product stored\n? Corrosion allowance and corrosion rate\n? Corrosion prevention systems and leak detection systems in place\n? Condition at previous inspection and repairs done\n? Location of tanks and level of risk associated with failure\nService history of a tank or that of others in similar service can help in determining the inspection intervals.\nRoutine in-service external inspection must be done monthly by the owner/ operator personnel. This aims to observe for evidence of leak, shell distortion, signs of settlement, corrosion, condition of the foundation, paint coating insulation and grounding systems.\nExternal Ultrasonic Thickness Inspection must be done at intervals not exceeding five years when the corrosion rates are unknown.\nInternal inspection is required to ensure that the bottom is not severely corroded and leaking. It helps gather data necessary for minimum bottom and shell thickness assessment, as well as identify and evaluate bottom settlement.\nThe interval from initial service to the initial internal inspection must not exceed 10 years unless special conditions outlined in API 653 are met. The interval between subsequent inspections is determined in accordance with the established corrosion rates. Unless a Risk Based Inspection assessment is performed as described in API 653, the interval must not exceed 20 years.\nA written report must be prepared by the Tank Inspector after every external or internal inspection. This report must include;\n? Date of inspection\n? Type of inspection (internal or external)\n? Scope of inspection including mention of areas that were not inspected and reasons.\n? Description of the tank (number, size, capacity, year of construction, material of construction, service history, roof and bottom design)\n? List of components inspected and their condition\n? Inspection methods and tests used e.g. visual, MFL, UT and the results\n? Corrosion rate of bottom and shell\n? Settlement survey measurements and analysis\n? Recommendations for repair, replacement, monitoring, calculated inspection interval\n? Name, company, API 653 certification number and signature of the Authorized Inspector responsible for the inspection\n? Drawings, photos, NDE reports and other pertinent information appended\nTank Repair and Alteration\nAll repair work must be authorized by the Authorized Inspector (AI) or an engineer experienced in storage tank design before commencement of work by a repair organisation. All proposed design, work execution, materials, welding procedures, examination, and testing methods must also be approved. The AI must designate inspection hold points required during the repair or alteration sequence and minimum documentation that must be submitted upon job completion. During repair and alteration, various minimum requirements of API 653 must be met.\nWelding and Testing\nWelding procedure specifications, welders and welding operators must be qualified in accordance with ASME IX. Preheat and PWHT requirements must be observed where required.\nExamination and testing of repaired components shall be performed in accordance with sec 12 of API 653. Among techniques that are commonly used for testing are Visual Inspection, Magnetic Particle Inspection, Dye Penetrant Testing, Diesel Test, Vacuum Box Test, Radiography, hydrostatic test.\nStorage tanks are a critical asset to the energy sector. Proper maintenance and care is vital to ensure continued availability in service and prevent costly failures. Timely inspection by an authorized inspector is important to evaluate the corrosion rates, remaining life, strength, stability, fitness for service and maximum filling height.']	['<urn:uuid:5de85dd8-8dd4-42a8-9b30-12210d17512a>', '<urn:uuid:f352adbe-3d47-4791-ae06-cc66b6ce115b>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	41	95	4360
52	I've heard that some turbulence can be spotted ahead of time while other times it comes as a total surprise - which one is more dangerous and why?	Clear-air turbulence, which occurs unexpectedly in clear skies, is generally more dangerous than other types of turbulence because pilots cannot anticipate it, giving no time for flight crew to warn passengers to return to their seats. Other forms of turbulence like those caused by thunderstorms, thermal conditions, or mechanical interference can usually be detected through radar, weather reports, or pilot communications. This is why approximately 58 people are injured annually in the US due to clear-air turbulence while not wearing seatbelts. However, even with clear-air turbulence, if passengers keep their seatbelts fastened while seated as recommended, they'll be safe - injuries typically occur only to those who aren't buckled in.	"[""(CNN) -- From a little jolt to an all-out roller coaster ride, turbulence is a routine event when it comes to flying, but it scares the heck out of a lot of travelers. Fortunately, if you follow directions, your chances of getting hurt are slim to none.\nThe first thing to remember with turbulence is that it's almost never as bad as you think. In severe turbulence, it might seem like you dropped 100 feet, but it was probably not even 10.\nConsider driving fast down a dirt road. If you tried to hold on to a cup of water on that ride, you'd be just fine except for the thorough soaking you'd get about two seconds in. On the other hand, if you're in an airplane that hits turbulence, your water usually won't even splash outside of the cup.\nUnfortunately, we don't have the ability to see that next bump in the sky just yet. For control freaks like me and countless others, that's an anxiety-producing experience. But there are some important things to know about turbulence that should help calm your nerves.\nYou aren't going to crash\nAirplanes pass through turbulence all day, every day, and how often have you heard of an airplane actually crashing because of it? At cruising altitude, it just doesn't happen. And in other stages of flight it's, at most, very, very rare. It takes a lot more than bumps along the way to down a plane.\nPlanes are built to stay in the air. They are meant to withstand insane amounts of force on the body and wings. (See how far the Boeing 777 wings bent in testing before breaking). Airplanes have come out of extreme turbulence with the interiors looking like they were hit by a tornado, but the aircraft itself flew just fine. But that doesn't mean you should just ignore it. Turbulence can still break bones or even kill if you aren't smart.\nFasten your seatbelts\nIf there's one thing you should do when flying to stay safe, it's keeping your seatbelt fastened any time you're sitting down. If you need to get up to go to the bathroom, do it when the seatbelt sign is off. Otherwise, stay seated. Why?Because the people who don't put their seatbelts on are the ones who do their best impression of pancakes sticking to the ceiling when the ride gets really rough.\nThere are several severe turbulence incidents each year that get reported in the news. And inevitably, a handful of people get hurt. But if you have your seatbelt on, you'll be fine. The injuries come from hitting heads on the ceiling or being thrown around in the aisle like a rag doll. If you're seated with your belt on, it's like a roller coaster ride and nothing worse.\nRemember that I said it's rare, not unheard of, for turbulence to bring airplanes down. There is one kind of turbulence that has been known to cause accidents -- the turbulence generated by thunderstorms.\nThe updrafts and sudden wind shifts can be so violent that a big thunderstorm can bring an airplane down, especially if it happens near the ground. But pilots learned long ago to fly around storms.\nModern airplanes have sophisticated radar detection that allow pilots to navigate around thunderstorms. You might be in the middle of the clouds, but you aren't flying through the heart of a storm cell unless your pilot has made a big mistake.\nThough we don't know exactly what brought down Air France flight 447 over the Atlantic on its way from Brazil to France back in 2009, some speculate that the pilots flew right into some nasty storms that led to a series of events that brought the airplane down. But even then, turbulence was probably at most a contributing factor to the confusion in the cockpit after systems starting failing for other reasons.\nThe best news is that technology and training continue to get better, and that helps pilots avoid turbulence with greater ease year after year. In fact, one of the biggest threats, windshear near an airport, has been significantly muzzled for that reason.\nWindshear near the airport is one of the most dangerous types of weather. It involves a dramatic shift in wind direction that causes airplanes to gain and lose speed and altitude quickly. It's often related to a thunderstorm. The reason it's so dangerous near the airport is because the airplane is pretty close to the ground at that point. There just isn't much room to recover if something goes wrong.\nIn the past, there have been a handful of accidents from windshear including Delta flight 191 in Dallas in 1985. The airplane ran into windshear from a thunderstorm just before it was to land and the pilots couldn't recover in time.\nIt's incredibly unlikely that this kind of accident would happen again in the United States today for two reasons. Training and technology are far better. As with any accident, people learned from Delta 191 and training has changed to reflect those lessons. Pilots are taught to be more conservative in situations like that and they're trained to abort landings when conditions aren't right. They're also aided by windshear detection equipment on the airplane and at major airports.\nIn the end, turbulence is frightening but the chance that something bad will happen to you is incredibly small. Of course, fear isn't always rational. Just keep that seatbelt fastened."", 'What Exactly is Turbulence?\nFlying is one of the safest forms of transportation, but it may not feel like it when turbulence strikes. What exactly is that “rough air” pilots always talk about? How much disturbance is considered normal? Read on for the full low-down:\nRemember: Turbulence is Normal\nAirplanes travel on wind flow. Most of the time it’s smooth, making for an easy flight. However sometimes the smooth air turns choppy—think waves on an ocean—causing the plane to rise, fall, and sway as it makes its way across the sky.\nThese so-called eddies of rough air are caused by three main categories of interference: thermal, where warm air rises through cooler air; mechanical, where a mountain or manmade structure alters air flow; and shear, which occurs along the border between two pockets of conversely moving air—like if a pilot crosses into the jet stream to take advantage of a tailwind.\nYou Shouldn’t Be Worried\nWhile turbulence can feel scary, airplanes are designed to withstand massive amounts of it. “A plane cannot be flipped upside-down, thrown into a tailspin, or otherwise flung from the sky by even the mightiest gust or air pocket,” wrote pilot Patrick Smith on his site, AskThePilot.com. “Conditions might be annoying and uncomfortable, but the plane is not going to crash.”\nModern airplanes are built to withstand everything from so-called bird strikes to lightning strikes, extreme heat and cold, to a gust of wind so strong it could bend a jet wing up to 90 degrees. There’s little doubt that a well-maintained commercial airliner can handle some turbulence.\nThe Pilots Are Ready For It\nAirplane pilots usually know when turbulence is coming thanks to weather reports and a game of telephone played at 30,000 feet. When pilots hit choppy air, they alert air traffic control, as well as the pilots guiding other planes along the same flight path. Pilots or ground support can often spot turbulent air on the radar or note some telltale weather patterns, and brace themselves—and their passengers—or the oncoming bumps and slowing the plane down to “turbulence penetration speed.”\nThere is one type of turbulence that no one can see coming, though—so called clear-air turbulence, which seemingly comes out of nowhere in clear skies. This kind of turbulence can be the most dangerous as its sudden onset gives no time for the flight crew to warn passengers to return to their seats and buckle up.\nWear Your Seatbelt\nEach year, approximately 58 people in the United States are injured by turbulence while not wearing their seat belts, according to the FAA. Many of those injured are the flight crew, who were probably walking around the plane telling passengers to put on their safety belts. When the pilot or flight crew suggests that you wear your seatbelt whenever you are in your seat, they are trying to keep you safe in case of clear-air turbulence, which causes most turbulence-related injuries. And just so you know, pilots always wear their seat belts.\nTurbulence Might Be Getting Worse\nAs the planet heats up due to global warming, some scientists believe that turbulence will become more common and stronger. A 2013 report published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that in the coming years, climate change could increase turbulence strength by 10 percent to 40 percent, and turbulence frequency could jump by 40 percent to 170 percent, which will make it very hard to sleep on trans-Atlantic flights.\nLuckily researchers are developing new software and laser-based technology that could help airplanes avoid turbulence altogether. Some American Airlines planes and United’s 787 Dreamliner come outfitted with sensors that better predict invisible rough air, theoretically letting pilots avoid it all together.\nRemember, if you’re a really nervous flier you can always check out Turbulence Forecast before you go.']"	['<urn:uuid:01a1433b-7b91-468a-b618-5018d5d07339>', '<urn:uuid:be4bd959-bbe5-4e8f-9c90-9aa981463b60>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	28	110	1541

In prisons, there must be separate enclosures, respect for self-identity, appropriate search protocols by preferred gender, and revised admission registers to include 'transgender' as a category. Additionally, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is establishing 'Garima Greh' shelter homes to provide safe and secure shelter to transgender persons in need. Organizations are advised to develop inclusive policies, procedures, and spaces, even before serving openly transgender clients.	"[""Recognition of Transgender Persons in Indian Prisons\n- 12 Jan 2022\n- 7 min read\nWhy in News\nRecently, the Union Home Ministry sent an advisory to Heads of Prisons in the States/UTs to ensure privacy, dignity of the third gender inmates.\n- According to a National Crime Records Bureau, there were 70 transgender prisoners in jails across the country in 2020.\n- The advisory was issued in light of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, which came into effect from January 2020.\n- Infrastructure in Prisons:\n- Separate enclosures or wards and separate toilets and shower facilities for transmen and transwomen to preserve the right to privacy and dignity of the inmates.\n- Respect Self-identity:\n- The self-identity of transgender persons must be respected at all times while conducting admission procedures, medical examination, frisking, clothing, requisitioning of a police escort, treatment and care inside prisons.\n- Prisons to facilitate the process of acquiring the transgender identity certificate under the transgender persons law if such a request is made.\n- Search Protocol:\n- Searches should be carried out by a person of their preferred gender or by a trained medical professional or a paramedic trained in conducting searches.\n- The person conducting the search must ensure the safety, privacy and dignity of the person being searched.\n- Admission in Prison:\n- The prison admission register may be suitably revised to include “transgender” as a category other than male and female gender.\n- A similar provision may be made in the Prison Management System in maintaining electronic records.\n- Access to Healthcare:\n- Transgender inmates should have equal right to healthcare, without any discrimination on grounds of their gender identity.\n- Communication with outside World:\n- They must be allowed an opportunity to interact with their family members, relatives, friends and legal advisers and after-care planning by probation, welfare or rehabilitation officers.\n- Training and Sensitisation of Prison Personnel:\n- It should be done for developing an understanding of gender identity, human rights, sexual orientation and legal frameworks for transgender persons.\n- Similar awareness must also be spread among other prisoners.\nMajor Initiatives Related to Transgender\n- Transgender Persons Act, 2019:\n- The Act defines a transgender person as one whose gender does not match the gender assigned at birth. It includes transmen and trans-women, persons with intersex variations, gender-queers, and persons with socio-cultural identities, such as kinnar and hijra.\n- Judgements of the Supreme Court:\n- National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) v. Union of India, 2014: The SC declared transgender people to be a 'third gender'.\n- Read down the Provisions of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (2018): The SC decriminalised same-sex relationships.\n- Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Rules, 2020:\n- The Central Government made the rules under the powers conferred by the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019.\n- National Portal for Transgender Persons was launched under in consonance with the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Rules, 2020.\n- Scheme of ‘Shelter Home for Transgender Persons:\n- To provide safe and secure shelter to transgender persons in need, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is setting up 'Garima Greh' shelter homes for them.\nPrisons Act and Transpersons\n- In India, the Prisons Act, 1894, is the central legislation regulating the administration of prisons.\n- The Act majorly differentiates prisoners convicted under civil law from those convicted under criminal law.\n- Unfortunately, the Act does not even recognise sexual minorities based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) as a different class of prisoners.\n- It only separates prisoners into the categories of women, young offenders, undertrials, convicts, civil prisoners, detenues and high-security prisoners.\n- The NALSA judgment, while extending constitutional protection to trans persons under Articles 14, 15, and 21, directs states to make policies on their legal and socio-economic rights.\n- This extends to trans prisoners as well, since prisons and their administration is a state subject.\n- Even though the directions given in the NALSA judgment constitute the law of the land, there is still a requirement to bring forth changes in the present laws.\n- The Prisons Act, however, allows the prison authorities to follow procedures that are strictly gender-binary.\n- These procedures not only challenge the validity of the legislation but also result in a kind of torture and degrading treatment being inflicted upon trans people inside prisons.\n- All of this is substantiated by a report titled ‘Lost Identity: Transgender Persons Inside Indian Prisons‘ by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI).\n- This report sheds light on issues faced by Transgender persons confined in Indian prisons.\n- The colonial Prisons Act has become obsolete and it fails to be the touchstone of constitutional morality which ushers for a pluralistic and inclusive society.\n- Since constitutional morality is something that has to be cultivated keeping in mind the evolving nature of the law and the rights of the people, the present law falls short of any such progressive realisation of the rights of sexual minorities.\n- Awareness and documentation are two important tools to address the reforms in reference to sexual minorities, especially trans prisoners.\n- Thus, the CHRI is one step in that process which advocates for a gender-fluid approach for the treatment of transgender prisoners.\n- The CHRI’s recommendations should be considered by the Union government to bring a ‘model policy’ on the special needs of trans prisoners, through a consultative process with the members of the trans community, to honour the mandate of the NALSA judgment."", '“When you center the experience of the most marginalized, you create a system that better serves all.” – Jama Shelton, Deputy Executive Director of the True Colors Fund\nForty percent of homeless youth identify as LGBTQ. This number is astonishingly high considering that the rate is only about 7% in the general youth population. Adequately serving LGBTQ homeless youth is an imperative, as is preventing them from becoming homeless in the first place. However, not all subgroups of the LGBTQ community have the same needs and face the same challenges.\nI recently attended a webinar hosted by the New York Coalition for Homeless Youth on creating transgender-affirming systems for homeless youth. The webinar was presented by Jama Shelton, Deputy Executive Director of the True Colors Fund, and provided a wealth of information relevant to homeless-specific and other services.\nTransgender can be used as an umbrella term that captures multiple experiences of having one’s self-identity not conform to traditional male/female gender labels (including gender-queer, gender non-conforming, and gender expansive identities). Transgender youth commonly become homeless or runaway as a result of conflict in the home, often related to their gender identity or gender expression. Transgender youth tend to be homeless longer than other youth and commonly experience: a lack of social support; significant mental and physical health problems; barriers to accessing housing and employment; and barriers to accessing gender transition supports and services.\nSome key priorities for organizations looking to become more transgender affirming are to:\n- Develop inclusive policies, procedures, paperwork, and spaces, even if you have yet to serve a client that openly identifies as transgender;\n- Develop clear inclusion statements that include gender and apply to staff and clients;\n- Create programs that provide transgender clients with respite from an often unaccepting world; and\n- Think through timelines and program requirements when working with transgender clients to consider if they are appropriate.\nIn addition to these broad ideas, Jama discussed some of the challenges faced by transgender homeless youth, followed by suggested solutions for organizations to implement. I’ve summarized some of these below.\n- Not wanting to access services or shelter due to fear of being singled out, victimized, etc.\n- Service providers and programs that are uninformed and/or insensitive to transgender youths’ needs and experiences.\n- Staff/peers deliberately using incorrect names or pronouns.\n- Lack of access to appropriate restrooms and facilities.\n- Having to conform to dress codes that differ by gender.\n- Confidentiality concerns, such as being “outed” without consent.\n- Lack of appropriate role models.\n- Educate and train staff about the needs and experiences of transgender youth, and provide them with skills to effectively work with transgender clients, including consent and confidentiality processes.\n- Identify and familiarize staff about local community-based supports for transgender youth.\n- Include gender when thinking about organization/program staff diversity.\n- Record and use youth’s preferred name and correct pronouns.\n- Create all-gender communal bathrooms or gender-neutral single bathrooms.\n- Allow youth to dress in a way that matches their gender identity.\n- Offer gender-neutral clothing and avoid organizing clothing donations by gender.\n- Offer/identify transgender-specific support groups.\nThe True Colors Fund conducts community organizing, public awareness, policy advocacy, training, and research activities all aimed at the prevention and reduction of homelessness among LGBTQ youth. They also coordinate the Forty to None Network, a free online support community available to anyone who supports this mission.\nThank you to the New York Coalition for Homeless Youth for hosting this informative webinar. The Coalition is a statewide network of organizations that serve homeless and runaway youth, and this webinar is an example of the type of training providers are able to receive through their membership in the coalition. If you or your organization work with homeless or runaway youth in New York State, please consider joining the coalition.\nBlog Post Author: Amanda Aykanian, Research and Project Lead at the National Center']"	['<urn:uuid:7acef66d-4ede-4572-bad7-7b83f6b89a6c>', '<urn:uuid:672e4d88-f13c-4787-a390-c0110ac02950>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	7	82	1571
54	Is there a difference between how you should determine if a burger is done versus how you should check if a turkey is fully cooked?	Yes, there is a difference. For burgers, you should not rely on color as an indicator since more than 25 percent of burgers can turn brown inside before being fully cooked. Instead, you must use a thermometer to ensure it reaches 160°F. Similarly for turkey, you should use a thermometer to verify it reaches 165°F, rather than relying on visual cues.	"['Never Grill Your Meat or Chicken Like This, USDA Warns\nIt might seem like a good approach, but it could make you sick.\nWhen you\'re having a big group over for a barbecue, it can feel overwhelming to get all your burgers, hot dogs, chicken, and other side dishes ready and still be able to enjoy time with your friends and family. But if you were thinking about taking one shortcut in particular to try to get a head start on the barbecuing this weekend, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has a warning for you. Read on to find out what they say you never do next time you\'re manning the grill.\nNever partially grill meat or poultry and finish cooking it later, the USDA says.\nIf you thought you could start the grill up early, get some of your burgers and chicken partially cooked, put them in the fridge, and then finish them off later, you\'d be mistaken. In its guidance on grilling safety, the USDA says ""NEVER partially grill meat or poultry and finish cooking later.""\nBy only partially cooking your food on the grill, you\'re letting harmful bacteria fester, which could cause foodborne illness. ""Never brown or partially cook meat or poultry to refrigerate and finish later because any bacteria present would not have been destroyed,"" the USDA says in a FAQ.\nIf anything you\'re grilling is labeled as ""ready to cook,"" treat it as if it\'s raw.\nIn addition to being wary of partially cooked meat or poultry, beware that frozen products labeled as ""cook and serve,"" ""ready to cook,"" or ""oven ready"" also need to be cooked fully in order to be safe to eat.\n""Although frozen products may appear to be pre-cooked or browned, they need to be handled and prepared as raw food and cooked thoroughly,"" the USDA says.\nDon\'t rely on color to tell you if your food is done.\nYou probably tend to determine if your beef is done based on its color on a scale from red (meaning rare) to brown (meaning well done). But the USDA says grillers must ""remember that color is never a reliable indicator of safety and doneness.""\nAnd that applies to both steaks and burgers. ""More than 25 percent of burgers can turn brown inside before they are fully cooked,"" the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) Administrator Paul Kiecker said in a statement. ""Although your grilled foods may look done, foodborne illness causing germs are not killed until the safe internal temperature has been reached.""\nKnow the temperatures all of your food needs to reach in order to be safe to eat.\nTo determine whether or not your food has reached that safe internal temperature, the USDA cautions that any chefs working the grill should always use a thermometer. For beef, pork, lamb, and veal, the minimum safe temperature is 145 degrees Fahrenheit with a three-minute rest time; ground meat—whether beef, pork, lamb, or veal—needs to reach 160 degrees Fahrenheit; and poultry, whole or ground, should be 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\n""Don\'t let foodborne illness ruin the cookout,"" Sandra Eskin, USDA\'s Deputy Under Secretary for Food Safety, said in a statement earlier this summer. ""Follow food safety guidelines like washing your hands, thoroughly cooking your food, and checking food temperature with a thermometer.""', '10. Calculate turkey cooking time and temperature. The simplest way to figure out turkey roasting times is to calculate 13 minutes per pound at 350°F for an unstuffed turkey (that’s about 3 hours for a 12- to 14-lb. turkey), or 15 minutes per pound for a stuffed turkey.\nDo you cook a turkey at 325 or 350?\nRoast in a 325° or 350° (depending on size of bird; see below) oven until thermometer registers 160°. If turkey is unstuffed, tip slightly to drain juices from body cavity into pan. Transfer turkey to a platter. Let stand in a warm place, uncovered, for 15 to 30 minutes, then carve.\nHow many hours does a 16 pound turkey need to cook?\nThe rule of thumb for cooking a turkey is 13 minutes per pound. So our 16-pound turkey was estimated to cook in about 3 1/2 hours. However, some factors like brining the bird, cooking with an empty (un-stuffed) cavity, and leaving the legs un-trussed will contribute to much faster cooking.\nHow long does it take to cook a 15 pound turkey at 375?\nPour the broth into the roasting pan. Roast the turkey for 1 hour. Rotate the pan, reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees and continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh (dont touch the bone) registers 155 degrees , 1 1/2 to 2 hours.\nShould you cover your turkey with aluminum foil?\nJust make sure you uncover the lid about 30 minutes before the turkey’s done roasting so the skin has a chance to get crispy. … Covering the bird with foil mimics what a roaster lid would do — it traps steam and moistness so the turkey doesn’t dry out — all the while allowing the skin to crisp up.\nHow long do you cook a turkey at 325?\nHow Long to Roast a Turkey\n- For one 8- to 12-pound turkey, roast at 325°F for 2¾ to 3 hours.\n- For one 12- to 14-pound turkey, roast at 325°F for 3 to 3¾ hours.\n- For one 14- to 18-pound turkey, roast at 325°F for 3¾ to 4¼ hours.\n- For one 18- to 20-pound turkey, roast at 325°F for 4¼ to 4½ hours.\nShould you wash your turkey?\n“USDA recommends that you do not wash your turkey,” said Wendy Mihm, a director of food safety education at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. “It risks cross-contamination, you can get those turkey juices in and around your sink.” … For example, a 15 pound frozen turkey will need three days of thawing time.\nShould you cook a turkey upside down?\nTraditional turkey methods are prone to overcooking the breast meat or undercooking the dark meat. The benefits of roasting a turkey breast-side down are twofold: The dark meat cooks faster when it’s closer to the heat source, and the juices trickle down for extra-moist breast meat.\nHow long should a turkey rest for?\nTurkeys between 4-6kg should be rested for 1½ hours, and ones from 6-10kg can rest for two hours. Get your turkey out of the fridge 30 minutes before you cook it. You’ll get less shrinkage when it goes into a hot oven.\nIs turkey done at 165 or 180?\nWhile some recipes state that turkey should be cooked to 180 degrees Fahrenheit, the meat is safe to consume once it reaches the 165-degree mark. Cooking the breasts past 165 can result in dry meat, but the dark meat can be cooked to 180.\nIs 375 turkey too high?\nOur Best Turkey Tips\nThe Test Kitchen agrees that 375℉ is the best temperature to cook a turkey, because it’s not too hot, not too cold, and cooks quickly enough to ensure that a juicy, flavorful bird is ready by dinnertime. … Allow your turkey to rest for at least 25 minutes before carving.\nHow long does it take to cook a 20lb turkey at 375?\n- Preparing the bird – Heat oven to 375 degrees. …\n- Cooking the bird – Estimate 12-15 minutes per pound for stuffed turkeys. …\n- Testing for doneness – You can either test by checking the temperature or checking the color of the juices. …\n- Finishing off – Remove bird from the oven.\nWhat’s the rule of thumb for cooking a turkey?\nCooking Time – The rule of thumb for cooking a turkey is 13 minutes per pound. So our 16-pound turkey should have taken about 3 1/2 hours to cook. However, some factors like brining the bird, cooking with an empty (un-stuffed) cavity, and leaving the legs un-trussed will contribute to much faster cooking.\nIs it necessary to put water in the bottom of a roasting pan while roasting a turkey? No. We don’t suggest adding water to the pan since it produces steam, which may cause the turkey to steam-burn. The turkey will generate delicious juices on its own.\nHow often should you baste turkey?\nHow often to baste a turkey. Most recipes will tell you to baste your turkey every thirty minutes. But our rule of thumb is actually every forty minutes, and here’s why. You don’t want to open the oven too many times, or else the whole bird will take much long to cook, and that’s a huge inconvenience.\nHow do I keep my turkey from drying out?\n“When roasting the whole bird, the key is to cook the legs longer than the breast,” Tommy says. “Once the breast is cooked, remove the legs and put them back in the oven. This stops the breasts drying out.”']"	['<urn:uuid:d9c66d18-661c-443e-ab03-aab6f1e66d24>', '<urn:uuid:e7a943dc-9c46-4fb5-a2b5-e496d63d58cf>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	25	61	1482
55	What are GAAP earnings limitations and investment uncertainty factors?	While GAAP earnings provide standardized financial reporting for publicly traded companies, they have limitations as they may include one-time transactions that can distort a company's true financial performance. This is why many companies also report non-GAAP measures like EBITA. When making investment decisions, there are various uncertainty factors to consider beyond just the financial metrics. These include predictions of future cash inflows and outflows, the expertise and financial experience of those making the predictions, and qualitative factors such as potential negative publicity or damage to business image.	['What Is EBITA?\nEarnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) is a measure of company profitability used by investors. It is helpful for the comparison of one company to another in the same line of business. In some cases, it also can provide a more accurate view of the company’s real performance over time.\nAnother similar measure adds depreciation to this list of factors. That is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\n- Earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) removes the taxes owed, the interest on company debt, and the effects of amortization, which is the accounting practice of writing off the cost of an intangible asset over a period of years, from the earnings equation.\n- This measure can provide a more accurate view of a company’s real performance over time.\n- EBITA may also allow for easier comparison of one company to another in the same industry.\nA company’s EBITA is considered by some analysts and investors to be a more accurate representation of its real earnings. It removes the taxes owed, the interest on company debt, and the effects of amortization, which is the accounting practice of writing off the cost of an intangible asset over a period of years, from the equation.\nOne benefit is that it more clearly indicates how much cash flow a company has on hand to reinvest in the business or pay dividends. It also is seen as an indicator of the efficiency of a company’s operations.\nEBITA vs. EBITDA\nEBITA is not used as commonly as EBITDA, which adds depreciation to the calculation. Depreciation, in company accounting, is the recording of the reduced value of the company’s tangible assets over time. It’s a way of accounting for the wear and tear on assets such as equipment and facilities. Some companies, such as those in the utilities, manufacturing, and telecommunications industries, require significant expenditures on equipment and infrastructure, which are reflected in their books.\nBoth EBITA and EBITDA are useful tools for gauging a company’s operating profitability. Profitability is earnings generated throughout the ordinary course of doing business. A clearer picture of the company’s profitability may be gained if capital expenditures and financing costs are subtracted from the official earnings total.\nAnalysts generally consider both EBITA and EBITDA to be reliable indicators of a company’s cash flow. However, some industries require significant investment in fixed assets. Using EBITA to evaluate companies in those industries may distort a company’s profitability by ignoring the depreciation of those assets. In that case, EBITDA is deemed to be a more appropriate measure of operating profitability.\nIn other words, the EBITA measurement may be used instead of EBITDA for companies that do not have substantial capital expenditures that may skew the numbers.\nEBITA and GAAP Earnings vs. Non-GAAP Earnings\nGenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings are, as their name suggests, a common set of standards that are accepted and used by companies and their accounting departments. The use of GAAP earnings standardizes the financial reporting of publicly traded companies.\nMany companies report GAAP earnings as well as non-GAAP earnings, which exclude one-time transactions. The rationale for reporting non-GAAP earnings is that substantial one-off costs, such as organizational restructuring, can distort the true picture of a company’s financial performance and should therefore not be thought of as normal operational costs. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), EBITA, and EBITDA are examples of commonly used non-GAAP financial measures.\nInvestors need to be careful to take GAAP earnings into consideration when making investment decisions. Standardized accounting rules allow for the comparison of financial results between competitive companies. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been putting pressure on companies to be more transparent about their GAAP vs. non-GAAP earnings. One SEC concern is that economic conditions related to the coronavirus pandemic have forced companies to account for unusual gains, charges, and losses that have complicated their financial reporting.\nCalculation of EBITA\nTo calculate a company’s EBITA, an analyst must first determine the company’s earnings before tax (EBT). This figure appears in the company’s income statements and other investor relations materials. Add to this figure any interest and amortization costs. So the formula is:\nEBITA = EBT + interest expense + amortization expense\nWhat Is the Difference Between EBITA and EBITDA?\nEach of these is a measure of profitability used by investors: earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Both are useful in gauging a company’s profitability. EBITDA is the more commonly used measure and adds depreciation—the accounting practice of recording the reduced value of a company’s tangible assets over time—to the list of factors.\nWhere Can You Find a Company’s EBITA?\nIf a company doesn’t provide this metric (there’s no legal requirement to do so), you find it by looking at the firm’s financial statements. Look for the earnings, tax, and interest figures on the income statement; the amortization is normally found in the notes to operating profit or on the cash flow statement. A shortcut to calculating EBITA is to start with operating profit, also called earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), then add back amortization.\nHow Is EBITA Useful?\nEBITA is thought to be a reliable indicator of how much cash flow a company has on hand to put back into the business or to pay dividends. It also can indicate how efficient a company’s operations are.', 'Investment Appraisal: Net Present Value A2 Business Studies\nAims and Objectives Aim: • Understand NPV Method Objectives: • All Will: Define NPV • All Will: Explain the technique. • All Will: Calculate NPV • Most Will: Analyse NPV method • Some Will: Evaluate NPV method\nStarter • Give 2 benefits of the ARR method. • Give 2 drawbacks of the ARR method.\nDefinitions • Discount factor: the rate by which future cash flows are discounted (reduced) to reflect the current interest rate.\nNet Present Value Method • Considers the total return from an investment in today’s terms. • It recognises that £100 received today from the investment is worth more than £100 received in the future.

56	How does serology diagnose primary viral infections versus reinfections, and what are the key antibody patterns to look for in each case?	In primary infections, IgM antibodies appear first, followed by a higher titer of IgG. For diagnosing primary infection, there needs to be either seroconversion (from negative to positive), a significant rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent samples, or the presence of specific IgM. In reinfection cases, IgM either remains the same or rises slightly, while IgG increases rapidly and earlier than in primary infection. The IgG response is typically much higher in reinfection. It's often difficult to differentiate between primary infection and reinfection, but generally, reinfection shows a sharp large rise in antibody titers whereas IgM is usually low or absent.

More detailed information on individual methods\nC. Commonly used methods for individual viruses\nThere is also a Powerpoint slide set to complement these notes: Virological Methods Slide Set\nA. Overview of diagnostic methods\nIn general, diagnostic tests can be grouped into 3 categories.: (1) direct detection, (2) indirect examination (virus isolation), and (3) serology. In direct examination, the clinical specimen is examined directly for the presence of virus particles, virus antigen or viral nucleic acids. In indirect examination, the specimen into cell culture, eggs or animals in an attempt to grow the virus: this is called virus isolation. Serology actually constitute by far the bulk of the work of any virology laboratory. A serological diagnosis can be made by the detection of rising titres of antibody between acute and convalescent stages of infection, or the detection of IgM. In general, the majority of common viral infections can be diagnosed by serology. The specimen used for direction detection and virus isolation is very important. A positive result from the site of disease would be of much greater diagnostic significance than those from other sites. For example, in the case of herpes simplex encephalitis, a positive result from the CSF or the brain would be much greater significance than a positive result from an oral ulcer, since reactivation of oral herpes is common during times of stress.\n1. Direct Examination of Specimen\n2. Indirect Examination\nDetection of rising titres of antibody between acute and convalescent stages of infection, or the detection of IgM in primary infection.\n|1.

Particle agglutination|\n|4. Neutralization tests||4. Western Blot (WB)|\n|5. Single Radial Haemolysis||5. Recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA), line immunoassay (Liatek) etc.|\n1. Direct Examination\nDirect examination methods are often also called rapid diagnostic methods because they can usually give a result either within the same or the next day. This is extremely useful in cases when the clinical management of the patient depends greatly on the rapid availability of laboratory results e.g. diagnosis of RSV infection in neonates, or severe CMV infections in immunocompromised patients. However, it is important to realize that not all direct examination methods are rapid, and conversely, virus isolation and serological methods may sometimes give a rapid result. With the advent of effective antiviral chemotherapy, rapid diagnostic methods are expected to play an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of viral infections.\n1.1. Antigen Detection\nExamples of antigen detection include immunofluorescence testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates for respiratory viruses e.g.. RSV, flu A, flu B, and adenoviruses, detection of rotavirus antigen in faeces, the pp65 CMV antigenaemia test, the detection of HSV and VZV in skin scrappings, and the detection of HBsAg in serum. (However, the latter is usually considered as a serological test). The main advantage of these assays is that they are rapid to perform with the result being available within a few hours. However, the technique is often tedious and time consuming, the result difficult to read and interpret, and the sensitivity and specificity poor. The quality of the specimen obtained is of utmost importance in order for the test to work properly.\n(Virology Laboratory, Yale-New Haven Hospital)\n1.2. Electron Microscopy (EM)\nVirus particles are detected and identified on the basis of morphology. A magnification of around 50,000 is normally used. EM is now mainly used for the diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis by detecting viruses in faeces e.g. rotavirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, calicivirus and Norwalk-like viruses. Occasionally it may be used for the detection of viruses in vesicles and other skin lesions, such as herpesviruses and papillomaviruses. The sensitivity and specificity of EM may be enhanced by immune electron microscopy, whereby virus specific antibody is used to agglutinate virus particles together and thus making them easier to recognize, or to capture virus particles onto the EM grid. The main problem with EM is the expense involved in purchasing and maintaining the facility. In addition, the sensitivity of EM is often poor, with at least 105 to 106 virus particles per ml in the sample required for visualisation. Therefore the observer must be highly skilled. With the availability of reliable antigen detection and molecular methods for the detection of viruses associated with viral gastroenteritis, EM is becoming less and less widely used.\nElectronmicrographs of viruses commonly found in stool\nspecimens from patients suffering from gastroenteritis. From left\nto right: rotavirus, adenovirus, astroviruses, Norwalk-like\nviruses. (Courtesy of Linda M. Stannard, University of Cape\n1.3. Light Microscopy\nReplicating virus often produce histological changes in infected cells. These changes may be characteristic or non-specific. Viral inclusion bodies are basically collections of replicating virus particles either in the nucleus or cytoplasm. Examples of inclusion bodies include the negri bodies and cytomegalic inclusion bodies found in rabies and CMV infections respectively. Although not sensitive or specific, histology nevertheless serves as a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of certain viral infections.\n1.4.Viral Genome Detection\nMethods based on the detection of viral genome are also commonly known as molecular methods. It is often said that molecular methods is the future direction of viral diagnosis. However in practice, although the use of these methods is indeed increasing, the role played by molecular methods in a routine diagnostic virus laboratory is still small compared to conventional methods. It is certain though that the role of molecular methods will increase rapidly in the near future.Classical molecular techniques such as dot-blot and Southern-blot depend on the use of specific DNA/RNA probes for hybridization. The specificity of the reaction depends on the conditions used for hybridization. These techniques may allow for the quantification of DNA/RNA present in the specimen. However, it is often found that the sensitivity of these techniques is not better than conventional viral diagnostic methods.\nNewer molecular techniques such as the polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR), ligase chain reaction (LCR), nucleic acid based\namplification (NASBA), and branched DNA (bDNA) depend on some\nform of amplification, either the target nucleic acid, or the\nsignal itself. bDNA is essentially a conventional hybridization\ntechnique with increased sensitivity. However, it is not as\nsensitive as PCR and other amplification techniques. PCR is the\nonly amplification technique which is in common use. PCR is an\nextremely sensitive technique: it is possible to achieve a\nsensitivity of down to 1 DNA molecule in a clinical specimen.\nHowever, PCR has many problems, the chief among which is\ncontamination, since only a minute amount of contamination is\nneeded to give a false positive result. In addition, because PCR\nis so sensitive compared to other techniques, a positive PCR\nresult is often very difficult to interpret as it does not\nnecessarily indicate the presence of disease. This problem is\nparticular great in the case of latent viruses such as CMV, since\nlatent CMV genomes may be amplified from the blood of healthy\nindividuals. Despite all this, PCR is being increasingly used for\nviral diagnosis, especially as the cost of the assay come down\nand the availability of closed automated systems that could also\nperform quantification (Quantitative PCR) e.g. real-time PCR and Cobas Amplicor.systems. Other amplification\ntechniques such as LCR and NASBA are just as susceptible to\ncontamination as PCR but that is ameliorated to a great extent by\nthe use of propriatory closed systems. It is unlikely though that\nother amplification techniques will challenge the dominance of\nPCR since it is much easier to set up an house PCR assay than\n2. Virus Isolation\nCell cultures, eggs, and animals may be used for isolation. However eggs and animals are difficult to handle and most viral diagnostic laboratories depend on cell culture only. There are 3 types of cell cultures:\n2.1. Types of cell cultures\nPrimary cell culture are widely acknowledged as the best cell culture systems available since they support the widest range of viruses. However, they are very expensive and it is often difficult to obtain a reliable supply. Continuous cells are the most easy to handle but the range of viruses supported is often limited.\n2.2. Identification of growing virus\nThe presence of growing virus is usually detected by:\nConfirmation of the identity of the virus may be carried out using neutralization, haemadsorption- inhibition, immunofluorescence, or molecular tests.\nLeft to Right: Cytopathic effect of HSV, enterovirus 71, and RSV in cell culture. Note the ballooning of cells in the cases of HSV and enterovirus 71. Note syncytia formation in the case of RSV. (Linda Stannard. University of Cape Town, Virology Laboratory, Yale-New Haven Hospital)\n2.3 Problems with cell culture\nThe main problem with cell culture is the long period (up to 4 weeks) required for a result to be available. Also, the sensitivity is often poor and depends on many factors, such as the condition of the specimen, and the condition of the cell sheet. Cell cultures are also very susceptible to bacterial contamination and toxic substances in the specimen. Lastly, many viruses will not grow in cell culture at all e.g. Hepatitis B and C, Diarrhoeal viruses, parvovirus etc.\n2.4 Rapid Culture Techniques\nRapid culture techniques are available whereby viral antigens\nare detected 2 to 4 days after inoculation. Examples of rapid\nculture techniques include shell vial cultures and the CMV DEAFF\ntest. In the CMV DEAFF test, the cell sheet is grown on\nindividual cover slips in a plastic bottle. After inoculation,\nthe bottle then is spun at a low speed for one hour (to speed up\nthe adsorption of the virus) and then incubated for 2 to 4 days.\nThe cover slip is then taken out and examined for the presence of\nCMV early antigens by immunofluorescence.\nLeft: Haemadsorption of red blood cells onto the surface of a cell sheet infected by mumps virus. Also note the presence of syncytia which is indistinguishable from that of RSV (Courtesy of Linda Stannard, University of Cape Town). Right: Positive CMV DEAFF test. (Virology Laboratory, Yale-New Haven Hospital)\nThe role of cell culture (both conventional and rapid\ntechniques) in the diagnosis of viral infections is being\nincreasingly challenged by rapid diagnostic methods i.e. antigen\ndetection and molecular methods. Therefore, the role of cell\nculture is expected to decline in future and is likely to be\nrestricted to large central laboratories.\nSerology forms the mainstay of viral diagnosis. This is what happens in a primary humoral immune response to antigen. Following exposure, the first antibody to appear is IgM, which is followed by a much higher titre of IgG. In cases of reinfection, the level of specific IgM either remain the same or rises slightly. But IgG shoots up rapidly and far more earlier than in a primary infection. Many different types of serological tests are available. With some assays such as EIA and RIA, one can look specifically for IgM or IgG, whereas with other assays such as CFT and HAI, one can only detect total antibody, which comprises mainly IgG. Some of these tests are much more sensitive than others: EIAs and radioimmunoassays are the most sensitive tests available, whereas CFT and HAI tests are not so sensitive. Newer techniques such as EIAs offer better sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility than classical techniques such as CFT and HAI. The sensitivity and specificity of the assays depend greatly on the antigen used. Assays that use recombinant protein or synthetic peptide antigens tend to be more specific than those using whole or disrupted virus particles.\n3.1. Criteria for diagnosing Primary Infection\n3.2. Criteria for diagnosing re-infection/re-activation\nIt is often very difficult to differentiate re-infection/re-activation from a primary infection. Under most circumstances, it is not important to differentiate between a primary infection and re-infection. However, it is very important under certain situations, such as rubella infection in the first trimester of pregnancy: primary infection is associated with a high risk of fetal damage whereas re-infection is not. In general, a sharp large rise in antibody titres is found in re-infection whereas IgM is usually low or absent in cases of re-infection/re-activation.\nSerological events following primary infection and\nreinfection. Note that in reinfection, IgM may be absent or only\npresent transiently at a low level.\n3.3. Limitations of serological diagnosis\nHow useful a serological result is depends on the individual virus.\nThere are a number of problems associated with serology:-\nComplement Fixation Test in Microtiter Plate. Rows 1 and 2 exhibit complement fixation obtained with acute and convalescent phase serum specimens, respectively. (2-fold serum dilutions were used) The observed 4-fold increase is significant and indicates infection.\nMicroplate ELISA: coloured wells indicate reactivity. The darker the colour, the higher the reactivity\n3.4. Antibody in the CSF\nIn a healthy person, there should be little or no antibodies in the CSF. Where there is a viral meningitis or encephalitis, antibodies may be produced against the virus by lymphocytes in the CSF. The finding of antibodies in the CSF is said to be significant when ratio between the titre of antibody in the serum and that in the CSF is less than 100. But this does depend on an intact blood-brain barrier. The problem is that in many cases of meningitis and encephalitis, the blood-brain barrier is damaged, so that antibodies in the serum can actually leak across into the CSF. This also happens where the lumbar puncture was traumatic in which case the spinal fluid would be bloodstained. So really, one should really check the integrity of the blood-brain barrier before making a definite diagnosis. One way to check the integrity of the blood brain barrier is to use a surrogate antibody that most individuals would have, such as measles virus, since most people would have been vaccinated. So the patient's serum and CSF for measles antibody. If the blood-brain barrier is intact, there should be little or no measles antibodies in the CSF.\n[an error occurred while processing this directive]\nVirological Methods Slide Set""]"	['<urn:uuid:895a4249-7cdc-4069-aa22-1659e3470b6e>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	22	103	2323
57	How do prevention methods differ between human burns and arctic wildlife protection?	For human burn prevention, key measures include installing smoke alarms, keeping water heater temperatures at 120°F, proper storage of chemicals, childproofing homes, and teaching safety rules about matches/fires. In contrast, Arctic marine mammal conservation requires different preventive approaches including: improving co-management with local entities, monitoring population responses to climate change, studying impacts of human activities like shipping and resource exploration, and most importantly regulating greenhouse gases since habitat loss from climate change is the primary threat. Protected species legislation alone cannot address the main driver of Arctic habitat loss affecting these mammals.	"['Most burns are minor injuries that occur at\nhome or work.

Do not let children play with any small appliances such as curling\nirons, hair dryers, toasters, or heating pads.\n- Never hold a child\nwhile smoking or drinking a hot liquid, because any sudden movement by the\nchild could cause a burn.\n- Never leave hot\nfoods or liquids within reach of children, such as on the edges of tables or\ncounters. Also, be cautious about leaving hot liquids on a table with a\ntablecloth that young children can reach and pull down.\n- Prevent electrical, chemical, friction, and heat burns in young children:\nelectrical cords away from a child\'s reach. A child chewing on a cord could\ncause an electrical burn of the mouth.

The authors outline the current state of knowledge and their recommendations for the conservation of these animals over the 21st century.\n“These species are not only icons of climate change, but they are indicators of ecosystem health, and key resources for humans,” said lead author Kristin Laidre, a polar scientist with the UW Applied Physics Laboratory.\nThe overall numbers and trends due to climate change are unknown for most of the 78 populations of marine mammals included in the report: beluga, narwhal and bowhead whales; ringed, bearded, spotted, ribbon, harp and hooded seals; walruses; and polar bears.\n“Accurate scientific data – currently lacking for many species – will be key to making informed and efficient decisions about the conservation challenges and tradeoffs in the 21st century,” Laidre said.\nThe publicly available report also divides the Arctic Ocean into 12 regions, and calculates the changes in the dates of spring sea ice retreat and fall freeze-up from NASA satellite images taken between 1979 and 2013.\nReductions in the sea ice cover, it finds, are “profound.” The summer ice period was longer in most regions by five to 10 weeks. The summer period increased by more than 20 weeks, or about five months, in the Barents Sea off Russia.\nThe species most at risk from the changes are polar bears and ice-associated seals.\n“These animals require sea ice,” Laidre said. “They need ice to find food, find mates and reproduce, to rear their young. It’s their platform of life. It is very clear those species are going to feel the effects the hardest.”\nWhales may actually benefit from less ice cover, at least initially, as the open water could expand their feeding habitats and increase food supplies.\nApproximately 78 percent of the Arctic marine mammal populations included in the study are legally harvested for subsistence across the Arctic.\n“There’s no other system in the world where top predators support human communities the ways these species do,” Laidre said.\nThe study recommends:\nMaintaining and improving co-management with local and governmental entities for resources that are important to the culture and well-being of local and indigenous peoples.\nRecognizing variable population responses to climate change and incorporating those into management. In the long term, loss of sea ice is expected to be harmful to many Arctic marine mammals, however many populations currently exhibit variable responses.\nImproving long-term monitoring while recognizing monitoring for all species will be impossible. Alternatives include collecting valuable data from subsistence harvests, using remote methods to track changes in habitat, and selecting specific subpopulations as indicators.\nStudying and mitigating the impacts of increasing human activities including shipping, seismic exploration, fisheries and other resource exploration in Arctic waters.\nRecognizing the limits of protected species legislation. A balanced approach with regard to regulating secondary factors, such as subsistence harvest and industrial activity, will be needed, since protected species legislation cannot regulate the driver of habitat loss.\nWhile the report aims to bring attention to the status and future of Arctic mammals, the authors hope to provoke a broader public response.\n“We may introduce conservation measures or protected species legislation, but none of those things can really address the primary driver of Arctic climate change and habitat loss for these species,” Laidre said. “The only thing that can do that is the regulation of greenhouse gases.”\nThe report was funded by the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources and NASA. Co-authors are Harry Stern at the UW; Kit Kovacs, Christian Lydersen and Dag Vongraven at the Norwegian Polar Institute; Lloyd Lowry at the University of Alaska; Sue Moore at the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service; Eric Regehr at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage; Steven Ferguson at Fisheries and Oceans Canada; &Ostroke;ystein Wiig at the University of Oslo; Peter Boyeng and Robyn Angliss at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center; Erik Born and Fernando Ugarte at the Greenland Institute of National Resources; and Lori Quakenbush at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.\nThe study builds on a 2013 report by the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna, a multinational group that advises the Arctic Council on biodiversity and conservation issues.

58	What are the main changes to eyesight that people experience when consuming large amounts of alcoholic beverages?	Heavy drinking causes several vision problems including weakening of eye-muscle coordination leading to double vision, decrease in peripheral vision resulting in tunnel vision, and slower pupil response time making it difficult to see headlights or streetlights correctly.	['How Does Alcohol Affect Our Vision\nHow Does Alcohol Affect Our Vision?\nOver 85% of adults in the U.S. have had a drink at some point in their life. For some, that means casual drinking or a serving of beer or wine with dinner. Light drinking typically doesn’t have any adverse health effects, and it won’t cause any long-term problems. In fact, some studies have suggested that drinking a glass of wine each day can benefit your health.\nBut alcohol becomes a health risk in multiple ways when it’s consumed too frequently or in larger quantities. Excessive drinking or binge drinking can lead to both physical and mental health concerns — including problems with your vision. Unfortunately, according to the CDC, 1 out of every 6 adults in the U.S. binge drink four times per month.\nYou’ve probably heard the stereotypes about blurred vision after drinking too much. Schools and youth programs across the country even occasionally offer workshops where students have to wear “beer goggles” so they can see how alcohol can impact their sight.\nDrinking too much make vision problems far more serious. Its effects can last longer than just the time it takes to sober up. With that in mind, let’s take a look at how alcohol affects your eyes, as well as the rest of your mind and body.\nAlcohol and Your Eyes\nHeavy drinking doesn’t just cause problems with your vision; it damages your overall eye health. Some people complain about having “double vision” when they’ve had too much to drink. This is a symptom of the weakening of eye-muscle coordination. When you drink too much, your brain slows down. As a result, your vision can become blurry or you might think you’re seeing more than one object at a time.\nExcessive drinking can also lead to a decrease in your peripheral vision. It can give you tunnel vision, which makes it hard to see anything that isn’t right in front of you. Your pupils also have a slower response time, which makes it difficult to see things like headlights or streetlights correctly. Those are only a few of the reasons why it’s so dangerous to drive a car when you’ve had too much to drink.\nSome other effects include:\n- Excessive drinking over time can lead to a condition called optic neuropathy. This condition can lead to a loss of vision or change the way you see colors.\n- Alcohol is also often linked to migraines, which can affect your vision by creating “blind spots” or even squiggled or zigzag patterns in your vision.\n- Alcohol can potentially lead to nutritional deficiencies, including a lack of zinc. Your body needs zinc for a variety of reasons, but when it comes to eye health, a zinc deficiency can cause swelling of the cornea, as well as night blindness or macular degeneration.\nIn short, binge drinking limits how well your eyes work. Everything is slower to respond, and you’re less likely to be able to see the full picture of what’s going on around you.\nHow Binge Drinking Affects Your Body\nWhile the problems alcohol can cause with your eyes are concerning, it’s important to note some of the other health issues that can be caused by excessive drinking.\nHaving more than two drinks at a time can cause a spike in blood pressure. If you regularly binge drink, it can lead to hypertension as well as potential heart problems.\nOther potential health risks of binge drinking include:\n- Liver disease\n- Pancreatitis Cancer\n- Weakened immune system\nBecause alcohol directly impacts the brain, long-term use can actually change the way your brain works. When you’ve had too much to drink, this often leads to things like a lack of coordination or a slow response time.\nContinued use of alcohol, though, can lead to mood and behavioral changes. Alcohol causes more than just physical health problems; it can also affect you mentally and emotionally.\nSome people use alcohol to cope with existing mental health conditions, like depression. But, alcohol has actually been known to cause depression. It decreases the serotonin levels in your brain, which can make you feel sad, sluggish, or upset. Drinking too much alcohol when you’ve already got a mental health issue can also make it easier to make impulsive or “bad” decisions that can lead to regret later on.\nClearing Up Your Vision\nBinge drinking leads to a lot of immediate vision problems, but when you continue to do it, you could be creating long-term eye health issues for yourself. The good news is that many of the effects of alcohol can be reversed, even if you’ve been drinking for a long time.\nIf you do drink frequently and have noticed problems with your vision, or you’re having frequent migraines, the best thing to do is to see an eye doctor as soon as possible. Having a plan in place to take care of your vision can help you to get back on the road to better optical health.\nLimiting your alcohol intake or quitting drinking altogether will help to keep your entire body (including your eyes) healthy.']	['<urn:uuid:d43f23f4-eef1-4718-8ec2-44079b74052e>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	17	37	856

60	grant money vs working capital loan repayment time	Government grants do not require repayment at all, while working capital loans must be repaid within a short timeframe of six to 12 months.	"[""Government grants are available for everyone from artists to businesses to biochemists. Landing a government grant is a good deal as you don't have to pay the money back. Most grants are targeted in a way that's supposed to serve the greater good, whether by creating art or carrying out research. You can find a complete list of federal grants at the grants.gov website.\nDegree of Difficulty\nIf a grant's worth applying for, you're probably not the only one competing for it. The paperwork is often complex and you must make a compelling case that the money will benefit the community, not just you. Drawing up a good proposal is so challenging that some freelance writers specialize in writing grant proposals for others. A business or non-profit that meets some public need has the best shot. It's usually a lot harder for individuals to land a grant.\nBigger Is Better\nWhile many organizations offer grants, few have the resources of the federal government behind them. For some big projects, government grants may be the best funding source available. Grant money isn't taxable and, as it isn't a loan, you don't have to worry about a bad credit score disqualifying you. You may have to max out your own financial resources before the grant money kicks in, but after that you can look to the government to help your project stay afloat.\nKeep in mind that the government doesn't just cut you a blank check and forget about it. Even a grant for a writing fellowship requires you submit reports detailing how you've spent the money and your major accomplishments during the grant period. A charity or nonprofit organization faces an even larger pile of paperwork. You also have to abide by any restrictions on how you use the grant money, which can become intrusive and frustrating.\nTaking You Seriously\nBecause grant funding is so competitive, winning a grant is proof your group or project has some substance to it. Landing a government grant is a good sign to other donors that your project is worth investing in. If you're a non-profit, the government itself may be more inclined to listen to your views on policy after giving you money. The government sometimes helps grant recipients network with each other, offering you a chance to meet the big names in your field.\n- Photo Credit dolgachov/iStock/Getty Images\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Investing in Mutual Funds\nInvesting in a mutual fund is an alternative to investing in individual stocks, with the investor buying into a fund that has...\nThe Advantages and Disadvantages of Nonprofit Grants\nThe federal government is a major source of funding for nonprofit organizations, awarding grant money for a wide range of programs.

Business owners need to know what working capital is along with where they can secure a working capital loan for their financing needs.\nIf you run a small business, you know how vital it is to have enough cash on hand to pay bills, respond to unforeseen issues, take advantage of sudden business opportunities, and manage day-to-day expenses.\nWhether that means paying for an important marketing campaign, meeting payroll obligations, or paying for goods and services from vendors, having sufficient resources to do what is necessary to sustain and grow your business is a must. Each of these common finance issues among small businesses is covered by working capital.\nCash and other assets easily converted into cash are part of working capital. However, not all small businesses have available working capital lying around that can be used to cover what’s needed quickly.\nIn these scenarios, small businesses need to have options for working capital financing, often in the form of either a term loan or a business line of credit.\nThis guide offers insight into what working capital is, how it is acquired and the application process, and lenders that provide financing solutions to meet working capital needs.\nOn this page:\n- What is Working Capital?\n- How Can You Get Working Capital?\n- Lenders That Offer Working Capital Loans\n- How Do You Apply?\n- Difference Between a Small Business Loan & Working Capital Loan\nWhat is Working Capital?\nIn the simplest terms, working capital, sometimes referred to as net working capital, is the difference between current assets and current liabilities.\n- Current assets include accounts receivable, inventory of certain raw materials, finished goods, and of course cash on hand.\n- Current liabilities, on the other hand, are debts owed by the business that are due within the next 12 months.\nThis could mean accounts payable, salaries due to employees, or credit line payments to vendors or suppliers. The extent to which your current assets exceed your current liabilities is a measure of your business’s efficiency and short-term financial well-being.\nSecuring working capital through a loan allows you as the business owner to protect your own money. Instead of supplementing the business with your personal cash, a working capital loan provides short-term financing to help cover short-term needs. Also, having access to working capital provides a solution when cash flow is tight. Making payments to vendors on time, along with employee payroll and other debts are necessary to keep the business in good financial health for the long haul.\nHaving access to working capital allows you to steer clear of equity investors in your business. Some companies will seek out investors to help fund their business needs who ultimately inject capital into the business in exchange for ownership in the company.\nHowever, when this takes place, business owners forfeit some of their ownership stake in the business and the decision-making power that goes with it. Having enough working capital on hand eliminates this need. Some available funding and working capital lines of credit will only be available to established businesses, while other financial institutions will lend to new businesses. It’s important to find the right fit.\nHow Can You Get Working Capital?\nFortunately for small business owners, working capital can be acquired in several ways, including:\n- Working capital loans – these are the most common funding sources for short-term working capital needs, offered by a variety of small business lenders.\n- Merchant cash advance – working capital may also be available through a merchant cash advance in which a lender provides funds equal to daily or monthly credit card sales. The business then repays these funds with new card sales in the future.\n- Invoice financing and factoring – small businesses with outstanding invoices may sell these accounts for upfront cash. Invoice factoringcompanies then collect on the invoices as repayment from the business.\nEach method for receiving working capital outside what is currently available in the business comes with advantages and drawbacks of which business owners should be aware. It is always important to look at the costs, terms, and collateral needs for a working capital financing solution before signing on the dotted line.\nBest Lenders Offering Working Capital Loans\nSeveral lenders offer working capital loans to qualified businesses as a form of business credit, but each has a different set of eligibility criteria, interest rates, loan terms, and application processes.\nAs an online small business lender, Kabbage focuses on providing quick funding companies in need of short-term working capital for daily operations. With Kabbage, small businesses may apply for a loan amount between $2,000 and $250,000, with interest rates ranging from 24% to 99%.\nThe business must have an annual revenue of at least $50,000 to qualify, as well as at least one year in business. Kabbage is a good fit for small business owners who are willing to provide a personal guarantee, those who have less than perfect credit, or businesses that want fast working capital funding.\nAnother online lender offering working capital loans is OnDeck. The finance company provides working capital loans to small businesses that have been in business at least one year and have annual revenue of no less than $100,000. The working capital loans from OnDeck can range from $5,000 up to $500,000, with interest rates as low as 16.7%.\nOnDeck is best for small businesses with strong cash flow and those that do not mind a relatively short repayment term.\nA newer entrant to the small business lending market, StreetShares is a viable option for some small businesses with working capital needs. The online lender provides working capital loans to businesses in amounts ranging from $2,000 to $250,000 and interest rates ranging from 9% to 40%. Businesses must have annual revenue of at least $75,000 and be established for at least one year to qualify.\nStreetShares may require a personal guarantee from the business owner, as well as a minimum credit score of 600. This online lender is best suited for small businesses that want lower interest rates on working capital loans who have strong credit and steady cash flow from the business.\nHow Do You Apply for Working Capital Loans?\nThe application process for securing a working capital loan is not much different from any other small business financing application. Businesses need to provide the following information in order to show the lender they are a good fit for borrowing short-term funding:\n- Business owner’s social security number\n- The small business EIN or tax identification number\n- Recent bank account statements for the business\n- Recent personal and business federal tax returns\n- Financial statements like profit and loss statements or balance sheet\n- Cash flow details for the past several months\n- Outstanding business debts\nThis information is provided to a working capital lender either in person or online, and then it is reviewed in depth. Lenders want to know that businesses have the capacity to repay working capital loans in a timely fashion.\nIf business or personal financials are not strong, a working capital loan may require collateral to secure the loan or a personal guarantee from the business owner that promises repayment from personal assets. Once the lender feels confident in the small business’s ability to repay the loan, funds are deposited into the business bank account and can be used.\nDifference Between a Small Business Loan & Working Capital Loan\nWorking capital loans are beneficial to small business owners in need of financing because of the inherent differences they have from small business loans.\nWith a working capital loan, business owners have far more flexibility in what the loan proceeds may be used to cover. Items like payroll, overhead of the business, vendor payments, and inventory may be covered with a working capital loan. In many cases, small business loans are more specific. A business owner has less flexibility to pay for what is needed if it falls outside the reason for the small business loan, as listed on the application.\nAdditionally, working capital loans are much faster than small business loans as far as the application process and approval. However, working capital loans also have much shorter repayment terms than small business loans. Most working capital lenders require full repayment within six to 12 months, while small business loans may extend up to three or five years. Because of the shorter repayment timeframe and the fast access to cash, working capital loans may also have higher costs, including the interest rate, compared to small business loans.\nIt is important for business owners to consider their options for financing, including working capital and small business loans, before making a decision.']"	['<urn:uuid:c45e495c-184c-4c81-80d7-260c72a81cb8>', '<urn:uuid:9d641d5d-46bd-4839-8fd6-98a547088f03>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	8	24	1976
61	looking for foundation inspection which expert difference structural engineer home inspector	A structural engineer provides a more thorough inspection than a home inspector. While home inspectors do an overall inspection of home systems like plumbing and electrical wiring, structural engineers thoroughly examine the foundation, floors, walls, roof, and columns. They assess load-bearing capacity, foundation settling, and ensure proper construction of load-bearing components, providing detailed reports of damage and repair plans if needed.	"[""RSE, residential structural engineer, the difference between a structural engineering report and an unlicensed contractor's evaluation is expertise. Through years of study and licensure, a professional engineer can help identify, evaluate and provide recommendations to homeowners in need of structure or foundation repair.\nIf you’re buying a new home, one of the most important first steps is to have a thorough and accurate inspection of its structural integrity. Many homes appear structurally sound at the exterior but have severe underlying problems that are not detectable to the untrained eye. During the first phase of an inspection, a structural engineer will come to the property to assess the overall condition of the home and its foundation.\nThe engineer will look for spacing between beams and joists to be sure it is of load-bearing capacity. He or she will also look for problems like foundation settling. The engineer will check all load-bearing components in the home to make sure they are constructed and attached properly.\nAfterwards, the professional will generate a report of any existing damage and create a repair plan if necessary. Structural inspections are far more in depth than regular home inspections. Home inspectors merely look at the condition, whereas structural engineers thoroughly examine the foundation, floors, walls, roof, columns, and more. This is an important step you will need before buying your home. Your home is an investment and it’s imperative to know you will be safe there for years to come and that your investment is sound.\nDo I Need an Inspection?\nMany first-time homebuyers do not think of having a structural engineer perform their home inspections. Home inspection is a necessary part of the home buying process, but often people just go with the home inspector recommended to them through the real estate company. Home inspectors usually do not get into the true structure of the home. Instead, these inspectors just do an overall inspection of the workings of the home, like plumbing, electrical wiring, basement flood protection, and other areas.\nMany homebuyers are interested in buying foreclosed homes in today’s market. After all, foreclosed homes can sometimes be a great deal on a home that would otherwise be out of budget. However, foreclosed homes are almost always neglected. When the bank takes over a home, it is not interested in doing any repairs to get it back into shape. Foreclosed houses can sometimes sit on the market for years without any repairs or inspections. During this time, any number of problems can develop and worsen, and the home can rapidly deteriorate.\nWhen the bank tries to sell the home, it usually does not disclose these types of problems, leaving homeowners on their own when things crop up. A structural inspection will tell you the true state of your potential home, so you can be prepared to make necessary repairs, or in severe cases, walk away from the offer.\nThere are a number of different companies that are providing trade services for the builder: site work, masons, electricians, plumbers, carpenters, sheet rockers, roofers, painters etc. These trades people are usually on site for only a few days before moving on to the next work site. They are focused on getting the job done and moving on.... often at the expense of compromising quality.\nUnless you walk the roof, crawl through the attic, pull the breaker panel and know what you are looking for there is a good likelihood that missing roof tile, piggy backed breakers, and black mold will be overlooked. All of these and many more problems have been detected by inspectors of newly constructed homes.\nYes, you should be able to rely on a new home and its warranty, but the fact of the matter is most big problems go undetected.... until it's too late!\nThe builder will make a big case for you not needing an inspection.... now really, why do you think this is?\nPlay it safe and have an inspection or you can always roll the dice!"", 'What do Home Inspectors Do?\nOne of the common contingencies to real estate purchase agreements is a home inspection. Hired by the buyer, an inspector examines the house thoroughly for non-functioning systems, damages, and repairs that may be needed. His detailed report forms the basis for continuing with the purchase, renegotiating the sale price, allowing the seller to make repairs, or for pulling out of the sale. A home inspection is recommended on purchases of new construction as well as re-sales and is a critical component of an escrow timeline.\nStructural Components A home inspector climbs onto the roof, pokes at the foundation, and crawls into attic space looking for water condensation or penetration. On homes in hurricane zones, he’ll examine roof trusses to be sure they’re connected to the frame as per code. Walls are examined for leakage or mold. Floor cracks are noted, as is separation from the baseboards. The ceilings, especially around electrical fixtures, must be clear of any signs of water leakage.\nExterior Faults Close inspection of the exterior may reveal where additional caulking is needed to prevent water seepage. Broken seals on glass, deteriorating tread steps, decking and settlement cracks are a few of the items that require professional repair. Even the garage door is tested whether it’s electronic or manual.\nRoofing The roof is examined closely for loose shingles or tiles, and the flashing is tested for tightness. Tree limbs touching the house provide a passageway for rodents and also can threaten the house during violent storms. Gutter debris is noted, and all drains are tested for a tight connection to the house. Skylights and chimneys also are examined for proper sealants.\nPlumbing All piping is tested, including drains, vents and waste systems. Water ingress and egress is examined, as are the interior fuel and water distributors and the sump pump, if present. All drains are examined for signs of leakage, mineral deposits and the fitting of proper filtering apparatus. Inspectors may test the water for bacteria.\nElectrical All the electrical components are examined to ensure they fit and are operating safely. Conductors, grounding equipment and distribution panels are tested for efficient operation. The location of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors also is noted in the inspection report.\nHeating/Air Conditioning The entire heating and air conditioning system is tested to verify it’s in working condition, and the appropriate filters are examined for accumulation.

62	What are the potential consequences of having high pH levels in grapes during wine production, and why is accurate pH measurement important?	High pH in grapes can lead to wines that taste flat and lack freshness. More critically, it can result in bacterial growth and wine spoilage. For accurate measurement, a pH meter is necessary as it can provide readings within a 0.1 margin, which is essential for winemaking. Standard pH test kits are not suitable as they don't provide the required level of accuracy.	['Do your grapes look ripe; they are full of color and have reached the size you expect from the varietal. But before harvesting, a number of factors must be considered to determine if they are truly ready for harvesting: Brix, titratable acidity (TA), pH, phenolic ripeness and flavor development.\nThe latter two factors are determined by taste, and may vary from one person’s palate to another’s, so let’s focus on the first three and the tests that can be performed to determine each. Start by picking grapes at random from the middle of clusters from different vines of the same variety to be your test subjects. Avoid vines or grapes that appear damaged or are at the end of a row.\nThe perfect red grape will have a reading around 22-25 °Brix, 0.6-0.8% acid and a pH of 3.2-3.6. However, few things in this world are perfect and grapes often are not one of them.\nLet’s start with Brix, which is the percent of sugar in the grape juice. Brix will determine the potential alcohol content grapes possess if fermented to dryness. Because a sugar solution like grape juice has a higher specific gravity than water, Brix can be measured with a hydrometer. The specific gravity of water is 1.000. The higher the Brix content in grape juice the higher the resulting specific gravity will be.\nIn his book, From Vines to Wines, Jeff Cox states that averaging the specific gravities of two separate 100-berry samples, each crushed, sieved and measured with a hydrometer, will result in an accuracy of plus or minus 1 °Brix, while five 100-berry samples will give an accuracy within ½ °Brix.\nBrix can also be measured with a refractometer, which measures the sugar content by how much light is refracted through the juice. The advantage of a refractometer is that it can be taken into the vineyard to determine Brix immediately by squeezing a drop of grape juice onto it; of course many grapes from across the vineyard must be tested to get a feel for the entire crop.\nTitratable acidity (TA) is the total amount of acid in the grape juice expressed as the tartaric acid content. Acids give crispness, tart and thirst-quenching qualities to wine and help with balance. Most of the acid in grapes is tartaric (and possibly high malic acid in some varietals grown in cool-climates). Tartaric acid has a strong, sour taste and has the biggest impact on taste. The optimum range of acids for reds is 0.60-0.80% and for whites is 0.65-0.85%.\nIf TA is too low your wine will have a flat, flabby taste, and also be more susceptible to bacteria, while grapes with too high a TA will have a sour taste. Most winemaking supply stores sell TA test kits, or, if you live within the vicinity of a wine laboratory, they will also give you these readings for a price.\nThe final factor to look for is pH, which is somewhat related to TA, however there is not always a correlation. While TA measures the acid concentration, pH measures the relative strength of those acids. The optimum pH for reds is 3.2-3.6 and 3.0-3.3 for whites. A low pH wine will taste tart, while high pH — often caused by overripe grapes or soil with too much potassium in it — will taste flat and lack freshness. High pH can also lead to bacterial growth and spoilage in your wine — not good! A pH meter is needed to get an accurate reading. Retailers sell pH test kits, however they are not intended to accurately give readings within a 0.1 margin, which is necessary for winemakers.\nIn addition to looking at ideal readings for each factor, UC-Davis researchers have determined a ratio of Brix:TA from 30:1 to 35:1 lead to the most balanced wines. But keep an eye on all three numbers, because sometimes waiting in one area causes diminishing returns in another area.']	['<urn:uuid:3a0a1225-b167-4644-81c6-bcd256bef449>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	22	63	658
63	how does spacebuster bubble structure work	The Spacebuster's bubble structure is supported by air pressure generated by a fan underneath a ramp. It has a translucent membrane that allows people inside to see what's happening outside and vice versa. The flexible structure can adjust to its surroundings - it can squeeze underneath bridges, wrap around trees, and cast patterns of fences or building facades. People enter through the van's passenger door and walk down a ramp into the inflated space.	['Foto: (c) Berk Asal\nInvited by Storefront for Art and Architecture the Spacebuster was developed and designed to explore the qualities and possibilities of public space in New York City. Spacebuster interacts with the architectural and the social space and its conditions. It opens urban space for temporary collective uses.\nAuf Einladung der Storefront for Art and Architecture haben wir den Spacebuster entwickelt und gebaut um die Qualitäten und Möglichkeiten im öffentlichen Raum New Yorks zu erkunden. Der Spacebuster reagiert auf den architektonischen und sozialen Raum und seine Bedingungen. Er öffnet den Stadtraum für temporäre gemeinschaftliche Nutzungen.\nThe Spacebuster is build on the basis of a step van and a big inflatable space coming out of the back of the van fitting up to 80 persons in it. People enter the bubble through the passenger’s door of the van walking through to the back down a ramp right into the inflated space. The bubble is supported by air pressure generated by a fan underneath the ramp. The membrane of the bubble is translucent so people on the inside can see schematically what´s going on outside and vice versa. So the membrane acts as a semi permeable border between the public and the more private.\nFoto: (c) Alan Tansey\nThis way the surroundings become the backdrop of the scene as viewed from the inside and the Spacebuster a stage in terms of a public theater piece. Projections onto the membrane can be viewed from the outside as well as from the inside of the space. Depending on the program taking place in the Spacebuster the space is furnished with desks, chairs, dinner tables in different layouts. As the flexible structure of the bubble can adjust to the surrounding it squeezes underneath a bridge, wraps around a tree or casts the pattern of a fence or the profile of a façade.\nTraveling through Manhattan and Brooklyn on 9 consecutive evenings the Spacebuster hosted various events that emerged from cooperations of raumlaborberlin, the Storefront for Arts and Architecture and different local art institutions, nonprofit organizations and communities. The mixing of more formal formats as workshops, lectures, screenings etc. with everyday easily accessible program as dinners, bar gathering and parties created a special atmosphere to the space as well as the momentum of the visibility of the things happening to the public. For instance there were workshops about the development of a public area held within the Spacebuster on the spot where the further development was supposed to take place. Thus the questions discussed and the developments projected were catalyzed by the pathos of the real.\nAs a research tool the Spacebuster disclosed the peoples relation to the urban space as well as a quite big amount of invisible borders within the city that shape the built and the social space.\nby Gideon Fink Shapiro, NYC, April 2009\nFrom within a hard shell swells the soft bubble, a billowing urban room hatched in the back of a delivery van. This genie in a lamp makes for instant theater, and shows how wind in a bag can make instant architecture. But this is no ordinary pop-up circus tent. Rather than being consumed as entertainment, like a circus act or the dead matter of architecture, Spacebuster consumes its viewers, and they in turn transform it. Touch it, see and be seen through it, drink and debate inside it.\nNew York is full of invisible walls. The spaces that Spacebuster busts are penned by intangible limits. Space busting is about uncompressing the void, sprouting between the cracks, squeezing the vacuum, enveloping the moment. Ambiguity no longer equates to amnesia. The strange yet banal spectacle of inflation, the making of walls and boundaries, turns out to be an overture to cross those boundaries and infiltrate the volume. Spacebuster mobilizes us to mobilize space.\nEnter Spacebuster, the amorphous enigma: A certified building by the Department of Buildings. A licensed vehicle by the Department of Motor Vehicles. A certified street event by the Department of Transportation. An experimental realm-laboratory by Raumlaborberlin.

Today, the entire Eastern Seaboard is alive with talk of incidents of paranormal activity. Alleged ghost sightings and related supernatural occurances have been reported across the entire Tri-State area.” Quarter of a century later, paranormal activity appears to have subsided, but that’s not to say all is quiet, dull, business as usual in the streets, plazas and open spaces of New York City – at least not this April. The celebrated Ecto-1 Cadillac may be long gone, but the Spacebuster is here, and although the Ghostbusters may have retreated into early retirement, their architectural equivalent, Raumlabor, are busier than ever. For although ectoplasms have not been sighted in New York since 1989 – when Ghostbusters II was released – there is plenty of work here for anyone intent on engaging the ghostly abandonment of the city’s leftover spaces. And this is precisely what Raumlabor’s mission is.\nThe principle behind the Spacebuster is simple. Take an archetypal American step van (the kind used by DHL, UPS or the US Postal Service for deliveries). Attach a large, translucent, balloon-like sac to its rear entrance. Place a ramp leading down from the delivery van’s cab into the bubble, and beneath that a fan that constantly pumps air into the enclosure. LAy down a carpet on the floor, and switch on the fan. In a few minutes, a vehicle and a large balloon are joined in matrimony to become a mobile, self-powered, flexible and adaptable work of profoundly non-site-specific architecture.\nBut what is the point of all this? Let’s take a step back. Raumlabor hails from Berlin, a city in which space was traditionally abundant, and where money is less critical to innovation than intuition. In the ‘90s, Berlin was unexpectedly engulfed in a fireball of construction, comparable to what we have seen more recently in Dubai or Beijing; space, and particularly public space, was attacked with the weapons of speed and aggressive, regimented policy. It was party time for architects in Berlin, but only for the 60 to 80 year olds. As Niklas Maak puts it in the introduction to Acting in Public, a monographic book on Raumlabor’s recent work, the government policies of the time were “comparable to the pathological behaviour of parents who furnish their child’s first flat according to their own tastes – which is exactly what the centre of Berlin now looks like: dreary sandstone blocks”.\nCities are made up of buildings, but also of people; with the physical definition of Berlin’s new urban form beyond their reach, the younger generation voluntarily engaged the city’s social fabric, transforming this into their site of operations and area of influence. It was in this way that the Kitchen Monument, an inflatable structure that inspired the form of the Spacebuster, was born in 2006. Kitchen Monument, together with many of Raumlabor’s early projects, represented a new approach to urbanity, one centred on the behaviour of people rather than the arrangement of buildings. The Kitchen Monument’s seductive appearance was an ironic commentary on the smooth architectural forms architects dreamed of; at the same time it was a hospitable, womb-like space capable of transforming any one of the city’s many inhospitable, abandoned, left-over spaces into a gathering place, a temporary node of vitality; this it achieved through the simple guise of extracting the most intimate of domestic spaces, the kitchen, and placing it in public space. In a short period of time a flurry of sightings of the Kitchen Monument was recorded in squares, next to bridges, beneath flyovers, in parks and in construction sites around the city. People ate, drank, talked, danced and cooked – in public space. Yet most critics were not even sure if the object in question could even be called “architecture”.\nAs it turned out, the exquisite simplicity of the Kitchen Monument struck a nerve far beyond the confines of Berlin. Soon it was touring Europe, making appearances all across Germany, in Poland and in Liverpool. In 2008, Storefront for Art and Architecture invited Raumlabor to engage a very different environment from their home city of Berlin: the density of Manhattan and the complex social fabric of Brooklyn. In a city where space is one of the most valuable commodities – even just for one evening – mobility was crucial; thus, the Spacebuster was born. From 16 to 26 of April, for 10 consecutive evenings, New Yorkers held conversations, watched screenings, witnessed performances, dined, drank, talked and listened to music in car parks; under highways; beneath the High Line; in abandoned factories. The Spacebuster became a device for rediscovering and reappropriating the city, and experiencing it in collectively.\nAs Vito Acconci stated in a recent interview with Hans Ulrich Obrist, “The thing that terrifies me about architecture is that by designing a space you are necessarily also designing the way in which people behave in that space”. One of the remarkable qualities of the Spacebuster (and the Kitchen Monument) is that by virtue of its humble, cheap construction it is born free from the shackles of authority to which “Architecture” is beholden by convention. Through the milky, semi-translucent skin of the Spacebuster’s bubble, many saw the city around them in sharper detail than they had ever seen it before.\nNew York City\nraumlaborberlin SPACEBUSTER Team\nMarkus Bader, Benjamin Foerster- Baldenius, Andrea Hofmann, Christof Mayer, Matthias Rick, Axel Timm mit Manfred Eccli, Christoph Franz, Berk Asal und Katja Szymczak\nStorefront for Art and Architecture\nJoseph Grima und César Augusto Cotta\nPartner Organizations: Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, Studio-X/Columbia GSAPP, Meanred Productions, Meatpacking District Initiative, Dumbo Improvement District, MARP LDC / Myrtle Ave Brooklyn BID, ForYourArt\nrelated projects: “Küchenmonument“']	['<urn:uuid:65bd5bac-5aa1-4f82-b80b-3a270199c1ca>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	6	74	2091

Before you check on the damage, make sure you’re following a few basic safety protocols to prevent injuries.\nFirst, make sure that all utilities are completely turned off including the electricity, gas, and water. The risk of electric shock is extremely high when people venture into flooded streets and homes.\nAlways wear the property safety gear including protective glasses, rubber waders, and gloves. This gear will keep you from getting injured by falling objects, hidden items that can cut you, and exposure to dirty water.\nBefore you check on your property, make sure you have a fully stocked first aid kit with you. It’s a great way to be prepared in the event of minor cuts or bruises. You should also wash your hands frequently with antibacterial soap and clean water to keep germs from spreading.\nAlways check the structural integrity of the property after a flood to make sure it’s safe to enter. Look closely at the foundation and be aware of any signs of cracking or settling. You should also examine all doors, windows, and floors for cracks or for anything that has come loose.\nIt’s a good idea to call a professional electrician to come and take a closer look at the electrical system. If you have a well, it’s recommended that you treat it with disinfectant before using the water in the home. Well-water can become contaminated after a flood or natural disaster.\nMaking an Insurance Claim\nBefore you start to perform any major cleaning, you should contact your insurance company immediately to file a claim. Take clear photos and videos of everything including damaged personal belongings. These photos can provide proof of damage if your insurance company asks for it later.\nCall your insurance company and ask them about any other requirements needed to make a flood-related claim. Rules can vary depending on your provider as well as your location.\nIt’s important to note that insurance has different types of coverage depending on the type of flood. For example, if your water heater burst and caused damage, that’s a different claim than if you were dealing with flooding as a result of a natural disaster.\nMost insurance companies will send an adjuster to your property as soon as possible to assess the damage. They will give you an estimate for repairs as well as the cost to replace your damaged personal belongings.\nIf you have soaking wet paperwork, photos, and books, you can freeze them until you need them. Place wax paper between the layers of the paper, and then store them in plastic bags before you place them in the freezer.\nOnce you have a claim number and a scheduled appointment to meet with an adjuster, you can begin to start cleaning the property. Knowing how to clean up after a flood is important to ensure your health and safety.\nHow to Clean Up After a Flood: Disinfecting\nMold and mildew can start to spread quickly after a flood, so it’s important to make sure you clean and disinfect as much as possible. Most basic household cleaners can be used to remove dirt, and disinfectants will stop the spread of disease-causing microorganisms that tend to live in floodwaters.\nPurchase powder or liquid cleaners like bleach, which is much less expensive and more practical than an aerosol product. Try to buy cleaners in the largest sizes available since you’ll need to cover a large area.\nAlways read the labels and follow instructions carefully based on manufacturer recommendations. When using products like bleach or ammonia, make sure you do so in a well-ventilated area.\nAmmonia and trisodium phosphate are highly effective cleaners for walls, linoleum floors, tile, and most woodwork. You can find many household cleaners at any home improvement store or major retailers. Powdered cleaners with abrasives are ideal for removing mud, silt, and grease from surfaces.\nMost fabrics like upholstered furniture and carpet will likely be removed and replaced after a flood. If you need to rinse these items, use diluted chlorine bleach. Laundry detergents can be used for most textiles like clothing, bedding, and curtains.\nWhen diluting bleach, use a mixture of 10 parts water to one part bleach. Delicate items made of wool or silk may need to be professionally dry cleaned.\nMore Cleaning Tips\nAs you go through your property, wipe down every surface using some form of disinfectant. Throw items away that are damaged beyond repair as long as you’ve documented them for insurance purposes.\nSoaked linens, carpet, and other textiles might not be able to get clean enough for use. Area rugs should be dry cleaned if you plan on keeping them.\nAlways use rubber protective cleaning gloves and wash your hands frequently with mild soap and clean water. Never mix ammonia and bleach together as this can create extremely dangerous and toxic fumes. When using any cleaning product, open the windows and turn on fans to get proper airflow and ventilation.\nKeep pets and children out of the flooded property until you get the all-clear. Wear rubber boots or protective shoes so you don’t step on sharp objects or broken glass during the cleanup process.\nPrepping the Property for Cleanup\nAfter everything is disinfected and all wet or soaked items are removed, you can begin removing any leftover standing water. Use buckets or pumps to remove water and then vacuum the excess with a wet/dry vac.\nAnything that is soaked or contaminated should be placed in a plastic garbage bag, sealed, and taken outside. Depending on your location, regulations may require that they have a tag added to indicate they’re contaminated with standing water or sewer water.\nIf there is mud and silt throughout the property, shovel as much out as possible when it dries. For garages and sheds, use a garden hose to rinse excess mud, silt, and debris away.\nRemoving dirt, soaked items, and standing water will make it easier for a professional water damage restoration company to do their job. It’s also easier for you if you plan to do most of the cleaning yourself.\nMost homes have drywall inside which can act like a sponge as it soaks up water from the floor. You may be able to salvage some walls or trim and molding if you clean everything up as quickly as possible.\nIf mud and water get into the wall cavities, remove all insulation and let the inside of the walls air out. Any walls or finishes from the high water line as well as water that has absorbed upward must be removed and thrown out. In some cases, the absorption can reach up to a foot or more over the high water line.\nA good rule of thumb when deciding if you need to remove some of the walls is if it feels or looks wet, it’s best to discard it. Any insulation that gets wet must be removed from the property and discarded or else it could become contaminated.\nPlaster walls must be dried quickly in order to save them and to prevent the decay of any wood framing in and around the walls. All insulation or completely soaked parts of the wall must be taken out immediately.\nClean and disinfect any remaining trim and walls. Start at the bottom and work your way up using chlorine bleach.\nYou can use a moisture meter to help you locate wet walls and trim. When in doubt, discard any materials you are not completely sure about. You may be able to find a moisture meter at hardware stores or through a home inspector.\nCleaning Floors and Woodwork\nScrub your floors using a stiff brush within 48 hours after the flood to prevent mildew. Use hot water and an ammonia-free detergent along with a disinfecting product to clean hard surface floors.\nMake sure you remove any leftover silt and mud from all corners, cracks, and crevices on the floors and around trim. You can scrub mildew-stained floors using an alkali solution, or mix borax with water to get the floors clean. To disinfect, rinse the floors and all surfaces using a mixture of one-half cup bleach to one gallon of clean water.\nYou may be able to save wood trim and woodwork if it’s made of solid wood. Scrub the woodwork using the same items you used for the floors (alkali solution or a borax and water mixture).\nDisinfect the wood with a chlorine bleach and water mixture and dry it off using a clean microfiber cloth. Remove any paint or varnish with paint remover, and rinse the woodwork with clear water, making sure everything dries thoroughly.\nDry Everything to Prevent Further Damage\nAll materials in your property should be dried with heat and air within the first 24 to 48 hours whenever possible. When you dry things quickly and remove contaminated items, it can help prevent the potential for mold growth and biological contamination.\nEnsure that there is constant circulation and continual flow of heated air over any wet surfaces. This can reduce drying times by a significant amount. Heat speeds up the drying process, and humidifiers will also help improve dry times.\nThe type of materials used to build your home can have an effect on the total drying time after a flood. It may also depend on the air circulation and any moisture content in the air. If you live in a humid area, drying times can increase.\nRemember to be patient and know that total drying time could take a few weeks or even a few months. Floors and walls can take a very long time to become completely dry from the inside out.\nContinue to monitor your home and all surfaces, and treat items for mildew on a regular basis. You might be excited to start remodeling your home or business after a flood. Remember that it is best to wait at least six months or more after a flood before you do any kind of remodeling.\nWith the right process and a reputable water damage restoration service, your home or business can recover after a flood. Continual monitoring for mold growth and mildew will help to protect your property from further damage as time goes on. Make sure you have the right level of flood coverage under your insurance policy so it helps cover most of the costs to restore your home.\nStaying Dry After a Flood\nWith the right processes in place, you’ll know how to clean up after a flood the safe, correct way. Make sure you remove all soaked items and take photos or videos of anything that is damaged for insurance purposes.\nDisinfect and clean every surface and make sure you discard anything that is soaked or affected by mold. Patience, hard work, and time can ensure that your home is dry and safe to live in once again.\nFor more about water removal and restoration and to find a certified restoration specialist, visit our website and contact us today to schedule an appointment.']"	['<urn:uuid:2c3e3e95-86ce-4af6-bbc5-3145e347efe4>', '<urn:uuid:5b7b2464-7a2e-4fe5-842e-6acb2263b88a>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	9	120	3519
65	I work in digital forensics and need to understand both the attacking methods used against steganographic content and what protective measures can be implemented. What's the relationship between these offensive and defensive aspects?	Attacks against steganographic content focus on either exposing the existence of secret messages or rendering digital watermarks unusable. These attacks can involve analyzing file signatures, examining raw hex data, and detecting patterns in binary sequences. The development of protective countermeasures directly builds upon understanding these attack methods. By assessing the vulnerabilities exposed by attacks, more robust protection methods can be developed. This includes investigating tradeoffs in perceptibility, bandwidth, and survivability of hidden information, as well as exploring alternatives to digital watermarking techniques as countermeasures to distortion attacks against carriers. The goal is to develop methods that can better withstand various forms of manipulation and attack attempts.	"['Steganalysis refers to the process of locating concealed messages inside seemingly innocuous ‘containers’. The idea behind steganography is embedding plaintext messages in places where an unsuspecting user would not think them to be present. During steganalysis, our objective is to discover where and how these plaintext messages are hidden within the provided files or data. Steganalysis is a process of trial-and-error. The solutions provided below offer only the correct approaches to solving particular steganographic challenges, while skipping the unsuccessful attempts for the sake of brevity.\nEthical Hacking Training – Resources (InfoSec)\nAbout Net-Force Steganography Challenges\nThese challenges require that you locate passwords concealed in a variety of file types. Note that the password itself is never ‘encrypted’ since we are dealing with steganography, not cryptography. In fact, the password is in plaintext and the challenge lies in locating it in the provided file.\nPlease be advised that the following content provides solutions to the intriguing steganographic challenges on Net-Force. It would be unavailing to read further without having tried your absolute best at the challenges first\nSolutions to Steganographic Challenges 1 to 7\nSteganography Challenge 1, Level 801: “Can you see me?”\nThis is a starter challenge to get one acquainted with the concept of steganography and is therefore quite straightforward.\nThe first clue is the text that is written in ‘color: white’ over a white background and is therefore invisible. Selecting the whole page (CTRL+A) would reveal the hidden clue [Figure 1].\nSo we need to access the file ‘password.gif’ at the following location:\nNotice that the image does not open in the browser. This is our first clue that it is not a GIF image as advertized. We download this file on our local machine and analyze the file using the Linux ‘file’ utility that reads Magic Numbers in the file to determine the file type. In our case, we notice that this file contains ASCII text, and so we use the ‘more’ command to print its content on the screen, which reveals the password [Figure 2].\nSteganography Challenge 2, Level 802: “Go Holland Go!”\nThis one is even simpler than the previous one. The password is clearly visible in the binary pattern on the screen [Figure 3].\nSteganography Challenge 3, Level 805: “Another picture!”\nThis challenge offered us a simple JPEG image and asked us to locate the password within it. The ‘file’ utility that we discussed earlier shows us that it really is a JPEG image, not a text file as in challenge 801. So we focus our attention on the bytes stored within the image. To view the hexadecimal bytes within the image file, a hex editor is required. You can use ‘hexedit’ or ‘hexeditor’ on a Linux machine, and ‘Hiew’ (Hacker’s view) on a Windows machine. Here, when we view the raw data inside the image, wenotice a binary sequence in the ASCII view of the data [Figure 4].\nThis binary sequence immediately stands out from the rest of the ‘garbage’ ASCII dump. Consequently, we convert this binary sequence to ASCII and we get the password. For this, we use Perl’s pack function to derive ASCII text corresponding to the binary sequence [Figure 5]:\necho 01101011011011110110010101101011011010100011001101110011 | perl -lpe \'$_=pack""B*"",$_\'\nNote: Alternatively, you can open this image file in ‘notepad.exe’ to view the raw ASCII dump and scroll to the end of the file to locate the binary sequence that stands out [Figure 6].\nSteganography Challenge 4, Level 803: “Words, words, words…”\nThis challenge is a little different in that it presents us with something that seems more like a riddle rather than a file [Figure 7]. However, bear in mind that this is a steganography challenge and so the password must be hidden in plain sight within these words. You could try all words as possible passwords, but such mindless brute forcing would be cheating and no fun. We need to discover the logic in the challenge. If you look closely, the words in the text are rather oddly placed. This provokes us to either re-arrange the words until a pattern emerges, or to simply skip certain words. We notice the title which states ‘words’ 3 times. If we start from ‘The’, at the beginning, and read the text skipping 3 words, we get: “The password that You Need for the challenge page is Again.”\nSteganography Challenge 5, Level 804: “Nice colors eh?”\nOnce more, we are provided with an image file and we need to extract the password out of it. Our first clue is that the image contains vertical lines separating certain colors. The first intuition is that each of these colors may represent a letter in the password. We need to determine how the alphabets were mapped to these particular colors. To reverse the process, we open the given image in an image editor such as GIMP. Next, we use the ‘color picker’ tool in GIMP to study the particular colors. For example, GIMP shows us the following details corresponding to the first color from the left [Figure 8]. Notice the HTML notation of the color.\nFor all the colors in the image, we have:\nColor 1: 8b8b61 Color 2: 8b8b61 Color 3: 8B8B70\nColor 4: 8B8B6A Color 5: 8B8B65 Color 6: 8B8B73\nThese patterns are clearly hexadecimal representations. To obtain the password, we convert them to ASCII text [Figure 9].\nSteganography Challenge 6, Level 806: “Just a flag…”\nIn this challenge, we are provided a small icon image that contains a hidden password. To commence steganalysis, we first make sure that it really is an icon image file. We use the ‘file’ utility to verify this [Figure 10].\nAs evident from the result, the file really is an ‘MS Windows icon resource’.\nNext, we take a look at raw hex bytes of the file to detect any anomalies or patterns. It is easy to browse through all of these hex bytes in the hex editor since the file is very small in size. We notice the ‘PK’ header that indicates the presence of a ZIP archive. Hence, we reach the conclusion that a ZIP archive is embedded inside the icon resource file. This ZIP archive contains a text file, ‘file.txt’, which most likely contains the password. Our task is to first extract the raw bytes germane to the ZIP archive, and then extract the text file from the archive.\nThe start of a file is marked by the ‘Magic numbers’. These numbers tell Operating Systems and programs about what sort of data to expect inside the file. In our case, the ‘PK’ header of the ZIP archive corresponds to hexadecimal values ’50 4B’, and this serves as the starting point of our extraction. First, we use the ‘xxd’ utility in Linux to extract a raw hex dump from the original icon file [Figure 11].\nNext, we locate the hex pattern ’50 4B’ (PK header) in the hex dump and copy these and all of the following bytes into a new file.\nNote: Simply creating a new file and then copying these bytes into that new file in text mode will not accomplish our objective. The file hence created will be a simple ASCII text file and not the ZIP archive we are trying to build. You need to ensure that you copy these bytes into a new file in hexadecimal editing mode [Figure 12].\nMoving forward with the steganalysis, we created a new ZIP archive using these raw hex bytes extracted from the icon resource image. This ZIP archive, which we named ‘pass.zip’, contained an encrypted text file [Figure 13].\nAs we do not know the password to the ZIP archive—and we cannot take a stab at guessing either—we think of brute forcing the password. ‘fcrackzip’ is one of the popular tools for brute forcing ZIP archives on a Linux box and we use it in order of increasing complexity.\nNote: By order of increasing complexity, we mean that we start with assuming that the password is very simple and then increase the complexity after failure in locating the password within the current character set. This is especially important while solving CTF challenges since we know that creators want us to locate the flag and so would not have set a very complex password.\nWe first ‘benchmark’ to see the cracking method that would perform best on our machine, and then use ‘fcrackzip’ to brute force the password [Figure 14]:\nfcrackzip ""/root/Desktop/pass.zip"" -u -v -m zip2 -l1 -c a\nDuring brute forcing, the simplest character set is when we assume the password to be lowercase and a single character in length. We used the following parameters:\n-u: unzip to avoid false passwords\n-v: verbose mode\n-m: method (zip2 according to our benchmark test)\n-l: length (1 character)\n-c: character set (‘a’ implies lowercase alphabets, no special characters)\nThe password to the ZIP archive was found to be ‘a’, the simplest password possible. We use this to unzip the text file inside the ZIP archive and read it to locate the password [Figure 15].\nSteganography Challenge 7, Level 807: “Learn See Become”\nThe first clue to solving this challenge is noticing the hint embedded in the slightly odd title. Notice that the first letter of each word is capitalized which indicates an acronym. Ultimately, you would need to arrive at this association in your mind: Learn See Become—LSB—Least Significant Bit. Least Significant bit in a binary sequence is the bit that is farthest to the right. In our case, it would be the 8th bit in each byte. We focus our attention on extraction of the last bit from each byte of the text given to us.\nSince we are dealing with bits, our first task is the derivation of binary data from the given text [Figure 16]. In order to do this, we use Perl’s unpack function in this manner:\necho ""2C7CBi*66iC6C2BBB3i6B36i<;][XJ\\D>AQJ>Q7[\\C;|Q[M]>917,.E.|G]B>S.2X3YXYXXY./YY.2Y3XY32.X.Yl//lmml.63mm2*l6.+7lml622336*26/"" | perl -lpe \'$_=unpack""B*""\'\nAfter obtaining this binary sequence, we need to extract the least significant bit from each byte. We could manually extract LSB from this sequence, but that would be tedious. Hence, after storing the bits into variable ‘binary’, we use Python’s strip function to obtain the LSB in the following manner:\nConsequently, we obtain the LSB sequence:\nAs in a previous challenge, we use Perl to pack this into corresponding ASCII text and obtain the password [Figure 18]:\necho 011101000110100001100101011100000110011101101111011100100110010001101001011100110110000101101100011100000110100001100001 | perl -lpe \'$_=pack""B*"",$_\'\nThese steganographic challenges at Net-Force were well thought out and intriguing. If you are new to steganalysis, these exercises put you on a rapid learning curve with challenges that increase in complexity as you move forward. Each challenge uses different logic and requires analytical thinking to arrive at the hidden flag. Your preliminary analysis should begin with a careful study of the data or file provided to locate any anomalies such as unexpected magic numbers. As previously stated, steganalysis is a process of trial-and-error, and normally it would take several attempts before you comprehend patterns in complex challenges.', ""Digital data hiding techniques for images are explored, analyzed, attacked and countered. Understanding the limitations of these methods provides for the construction of more robust methods that can better survive manipulations and attacks.\nINFORMATION HIDING: STEGANOGRAPHY AND WATERMARKING - ATTACKS AND COUNTERMEASURES presents important research contributions in three fundamental areas: investigation of data hiding and labeling techniques (steganography and watermarking), attacks against steganography and watermarked information, and countermeasures to such attacks. With the proliferation of multimedia and concerns of privacy on the Internet, such research has become even more pressing. Information is collected by numerous organizations and the nature of digital media allows for the exact duplication of material with no notification that the material has been copied. The more information placed in the public's reach on the Internet, the more owners of such information need to protect themselves from unwanted surveillance, theft, and false representation and reproduction. Systems to analyze techniques for uncovering hidden information and recovering seemingly destroyed information are thus of great importance to many groups, including law enforcement authorities in computer forensics and digital traffic analysis.\nTechniques for hiding information have existed for centuries. Methods include communication via invisible inks, microdots, covert channels, and spread spectrum channels. The techniques explored by the authors involved embedding information within digital media, specifically digital images. The authors analyze the limitations of these digital methods, which can in turn be used to devise attacks. The goal of these attacks is to expose the existence of a secret message or to render a digital watermark unusable. Finally, in assessing these attacks, countermeasures are developed to assist in protecting digital watermarking systems. Understanding the limitations of these methods will allow the construction of more robust methods that can better survive manipulations and attacks.\nINFORMATION HIDING: STEGANOGRAPHY AND WATERMARKING - ATTACKS AND COUNTERMEASURES is suitable for a secondary text in a graduate level course, and as a reference for researchers and practitioners in industry.\nOrganization of the Book\nChapter 1: Introduction\nprovides an overview of information hiding techniques and a brief history of steganography.\nContributions of the authors' research is described to provide the setting for the remainder of the book.\nChapter 2 Exploring Steganography in Images: This chapter explains some concepts of image-based steganography and digital watermarking. Methods for hiding information in images are introduced and classified. This chapter also introduces various tools used to embed information in images and illustrates results.\nChapter 3 Steganalysis: Attacks Against Hidden Data: In this chapter, attacks against hidden information are revealed as the art of steganalysis. Terminology and principles of steganalytic techniques are discussed. Attack techniques may apply to both steganography and watermarking tools, so the emphasis here is on embedded or hidden information rather than differentiating between steganography and digital watermarking.\nChapter 4 Countermeasures to Attacks Against Digital Watermarks: Given the available knowledge of attacks, how do we protect the digital media we have? This chapter looks at how to strengthen information hiding techniques in light of various attacks. Tradeoffs in perceptibility, bandwidth, and survivability of hidden information are also investigated. Alternatives to digital watermarking techniques are explored as countermeasures to distortion attacks against carriers and means to recover damaged watermarks are illustrated.\nAppendices: Several appendices are included to provide information to supplement the research discussed in this book.\n- Appendix A provides a discussion and illustration of hiding information in TCP/IP packet headers.\n- Appendix B provides a glossary of methods used to distort stego-images based on the processing instructions and descriptions from the software used to perform the manual distortion tests in Chapter 3.\n||Reference to an Appendix E for more details about the Picturemarc Tests.\nThis appendix does not exist in the book as the summary information is\nsufficient for explanation.

66	What are chromosome's roles in heredity, and how can they be manipulated for genetic control?	Chromosomes carry genes that allow offspring to inherit traits from parents, as demonstrated by Morgan's fruit fly experiments linking eye color to sex chromosomes. This chromosomal mechanism can potentially be exploited through selfish genes like R2d2, which could be used in gene drives to control invasive species and disease vectors by pushing sterility genes through populations.	"['“Sex Limited Inheritance in Drosophila” (1910), by Thomas Hunt Morgan\nKeywords: Thomas Hunt Morgan, Drosophila\nIn 1910, Thomas Hunt Morgan performed an experiment at Columbia University, in New York City, New York, that helped identify the role chromosomes play in heredity. That year, Morgan was breeding Drosophila, or fruit flies. After observing thousands of fruit fly offspring with red eyes, he obtained one that had white eyes. Morgan began breeding the white-eyed mutant fly and found that in one generation of flies, the trait was only present in males. Through more breeding analysis, Morgan found that the genetic factor controlling eye color in the flies was on the same chromosome that determined sex. That result indicated that eye color and sex were both tied to chromosomes and helped Morgan and colleagues establish that chromosomes carry the genes that allow offspring to inherit traits from their parents.\nPrior to Morgan’s fly experiments, other researchers were studying heredity. In 1865, scientist Gregor Mendel in eastern Europe published an article describing heredity experiments he had performed using pea plants. By mating pea plants, Mendel observed that the resulting offspring inherited characteristics, such as seed color and seed shape, in predictable patterns. Mendel hypothesized that there were heritable factors, later called genes, controlling the development of those characteristics.\nBy the early 1900s, other scientists aiming to explain heredity began to reapply Mendel’s theory. In the late nineteenth century, researchers discovered structures inside the nuclei of cells. Researchers called those structures chromosomes because of the way staining materials colored them. Staining chromosomes enabled researchers to observe chromosomes throughout development. In 1902, Walter Sutton, a researcher at Columbia University, and Theodor Boveri, a researcher at the University of Würzburg in Würzburg, Germany, each observed that chromosomes behaved in a manner that was consistent with Mendel’s theories. Boveri and Sutton hypothesized that chromosomes carried heritable factors, or genetic material. Researchers called Boveri and Suttons’ theory the Boveri-Sutton chromosome theory.\nBy 1904, Morgan had begun to study the processes that affect heredity and development at Columbia University. However, Morgan, like other scientists at that time, was reluctant to accept the Boveri-Sutton chromosome theory. Morgan argued that scientists had a bias towards associating phenomena, like the inheritance of traits, with known structures, like the chromosome. Similarly, he argued that if one gene didn’t explain a phenomenon, scientists could argue that any number of genes might. In 1910, Morgan published an article explaining why he was reluctant to accept the Bover-Sutton chromosome theory.\nLater that year, Morgan made an observation that eventually provided evidence in support of the chromosome theory. In 1910, Morgan was studying Drosophila at Columbia University to find what he called mutants, or individual flies that had atypical, heritable characteristics, such as white eyes instead of the normal red eyes. In May of 1910, after breeding thousands of flies, he observed a single male fly with white eyes, which he called a white mutant. Typically, both male and female flies have red eyes. To explain the white eye mutation, Morgan bred the mutant fly and observed how the mutation was inherited throughout successive generations.\nIn 1910, Morgan published details of his research in an article titled “Sex Limited Inheritance in Drosophila."" First, Morgan took the white mutant and bred it with pure red-eyed female flies. All of the females that resulted from that breeding had red eyes. Morgan then took those red-eyed females and mated them with the original white-eyed mutant male to determine whether or not the inheritance of eye color followed Mendel’s inheritance patterns. If Mendel’s patterns applied to Morgan’s flies, there would be one white-eyed fly to every three red-eyed flies in the resulting generation of flies, regardless of sex. Although Morgan did observe one white-eyed fly to every three red flies, that inheritance pattern was not shared equally across males and females. Most of the white-eyed flies were male. That result indicated that the flies did not follow Mendel’s ratio in a traditional sense.\nAfter observing the white-eye inheritance pattern, Morgan hypothesized that a factor, or gene, controlling eye color was located on the X chromosome. Female flies have two X chromosomes, and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. If a trait, like eye color, correlated with a specific factor on the X chromosome, then the trait was called X-linked. Because males only have one X chromosome, they display all X-linked traits. Females, on the other hand, often need an X-linked trait to exist on both X chromosomes to display that trait. Morgan hypothesized that, in his breeding experiment, the first generation of flies contained males only with white eyes because the gene controlling eye color was on the X chromosome. Males displayed the white eye trait because the trait was present on their only X chromosome. Females did not display the white eye trait because the trait was only present on one of their X chromosomes.\nTo test his hypothesis that the white-eyed trait was on the X chromosome, Morgan mated other specific groups of flies together and observed the offspring. Prior to doing so, Morgan predicted what the sex and eye color ratios of the offspring would be if his hypothesis were true. By comparing the observed results with the predicted results, Morgan determined that his hypothesis was supported. In one mating, Morgan took a red-eyed male and mated it with a white-eyed female. He predicted and observed that half of the flies would be red-eyed females and the other half would be white-eyed males. That mating showed that the occurrence of the white-eyed trait is limited to the X chromosome, as only male offspring were capable of displaying the white-eyed trait with a single copy of the trait. Morgan showed that inheritance of a trait could differ between sexes.\nIn the following years, Morgan and a group of scientists at Columbia University established the chromosome theory of inheritance, which described the role that chromosomes play in heredity. In 1911, Morgan published more details of his experiments with the white-eyed mutant, an account in which Morgan explicitly stated that chromosomes carry heritable factors, or genes. In 1915, Morgan, and his colleagues, Alfred Henry Sturtevant, Calvin Bridges, and Herman Joseph Muller published the book Mechanism of Mendelian Heredity. That book contained contemporary scientific information about heredity and included the results of Morgan’s white-eyed mutant experiments.\nIn 1933, Morgan won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work establishing the chromosome’s involvement in heredity.\n- Boveri, Theodor. “Über mehrpolige Mitosen als Mittel zur Analyse des Zellkerns (On multipolar mitosis as a means to analyze the cell nucleus).” Verhandlungen der physicalisch-medizinischen Gesselschaft zu Würzburg (Proceedings of the physical-medical company at Wurzburg) 35 (1902): 67–90. http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/15991 (Accessed April 2, 2017).\n- Kandel, Eric R. “Thomas Hunt Morgan at Columbia University.” Columbia University Living Legacies. http://www.columbia.edu/cu/alumni/Magazine/Legacies/Morgan/ (Accessed March 25, 2017).\n- Mendel, Gregor Johann. “Versuche über Pflanzen-Hybriden (Experiments Concerning Plant Hybrids)” .

It is a true selfish gene. It propagates itself through generations but not for some evolutionary advantage. Quite the opposite.\nResearch led by UNC School of Medicine’s Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena, PhD, showed that some copies (alleles) of the mouse gene R2d2 can spread quickly through laboratory and wild mouse populations. This happens in spite of the fact that these R2d2 alleles cause females to have fewer offspring. The discovery, published in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution, marks the first time scientists have used laboratory and natural populations of mice to show that a selfish gene can become fixed in a population of organisms while at the same time being detrimental to “reproductive fitness.”\nThese findings violate a key principle in biology: Darwin’s theory of natural selection, which suggests that alleles beneficial to an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce – its fitness – will increase steadily in frequency over time. Meanwhile, alleles that are detrimental to fitness will decrease in frequency and eventually disappear. As a beneficial allele rises in frequency, it eventually crowds out all other alleles in a process called a “selective sweep.” A famous evolutionary example in humans is an allele of the lactase gene that makes it possible for adults to digest milk. Over the past 4,000 years, this allele has risen to high frequency among people that practice pastoral agriculture, but remains rare in other parts of the world.\nThe patterns left behind by a typical selective sweep are valuable tools for learning about which genetic changes are beneficial during evolution. But Pardo-Manuel de Villena said the R2d2 result suggests that caution is required when working backwards from a selective sweep to a hypothesis about a beneficial trait.\n“The ‘selfish sweep’ at R2d2 looks just like a typical selective sweep but has nothing to do with adaptation,” said Pardo-Manuel de Villena, a professor of genetics at UNC and senior author of the paper. “We know very little about the relative importance of selfish and adaptive sweeps in evolution.”\nHow does R2d2 escape natural selection? By cheating at female meiosis, the specialized type of cell division that produces eggs. Most animals and plants, including humans and mice, carry two alleles of every gene – one allele from each parent. When an organism reproduces, it passes along only one allele to each offspring. The “law of segregation,” posited by Gregor Mendel in 1865, suggests that there is an equal probability of transmission of either a maternal allele or paternal allele.\nBut in a previous paper, published in PLoS Genetics in 2015, Pardo-Manuel de Villena’s team showed that some alleles of R2d2 distort meiosis to promote their own transmission to offspring in a process called meiotic drive. This advantage comes with a cost.\n“Female mice with distorted transmission of R2d2 also had fewer offspring,” said co-author Andrew Morgan, a graduate student in Pardo-Manuel de Villena’s lab. “This trade-off is what makes R2d2 selfish: if meiotic drive is strong enough, then it increases the frequency of alleles that decrease reproductive fitness.”\nThe findings have implications in fields from basic biology to agriculture and human health. “Exceptions to fundamental rules of biology are always important to study,” said Pardo-Manuel de Villena. And, he added, R2d2 has unique features that make it a promising system for studying how chromosomes are transmitted to offspring.\nA second, more practical application is the possibility that R2d2 or its components could be used in “gene drives.” A gene drive involves a selfish gene that pushes a second gene – usually one that causes sterility – through a population. Gene drives have potential for the control of invasive species and vectors for human diseases, such as mice, rats, and mosquitos.\nThis work was funded by the National Institutes of Health. The first authors of the Molecular Biology and Evolution paper are Andrew Morgan and former UNC graduate student John Didion, PhD. Didion is now a postdoctoral fellow at the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, MD.']"	['<urn:uuid:4334ac37-3f4d-4f2f-afcc-401f2e5e0d46>', '<urn:uuid:3dad9688-8e10-41f3-b83e-cb83a4973b38>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	15	56	1997
67	security requirements phi protection vendor management	Protected Health Information (PHI) security requirements encompass both internal controls and vendor management. Internally, organizations must implement comprehensive security measures including firewalls, malware protection, monitoring systems, and employee training on phishing attacks. For vendor management, covered entities must carefully select business associates through due diligence of their privacy policies, maintain updated lists of all vendors with PHI access, establish HIPAA-compliant business associate agreements, and review these agreements annually. Vendors must commit to security requirements in writing and demonstrate compliance through independent audits rather than self-attestation. Both covered entities and their vendors must maintain multiple layers of security, including network firewalls, application firewalls, and intrusion detection systems in active, online states.	"['Conducting Business in the Cloud, Part 2\nBest Practices to Ensure that Your Data Is Safe\nAn article taken from the January/February issue of HBMA Billing, by Chris Seib\nRead the first segment of this article in the previous edition of HBMA Billing (www.hbma.org) or in HBMA \'Public\' News.\nAs more management companies and medical practices transition their electronic records to private clouds, they risk long-term data outages and other crippling failures that may pose significant threats to their bottom lines. The first article of this series highlighted some of these concerns, detailed best practices for transitioning to a private cloud, and offered tips to use in discussions with vendor partners. This article offers additional tips and best practices, with a focus on disaster recovery, business continuity, and security.\nDisaster RecoveryEven with high degrees of local redundancy in a private cloud data center, you need to prepare for significant disasters with a comprehensive disaster recovery plan. Disaster recovery sites should be in geographically disparate areas. Having a data recovery site in close proximity to the primary site is essentially pointless – but still surprisingly common!\nMany vendors take a very low-cost approach to disaster recovery. They may back up their data offsite, but it would take days or weeks to bring the backups online. The best practice is to have a site exactly like the primary site ""ready to go"" at any time. Many vendors back up their data offsite and contract an IT company for equipment rental in the event of an emergency, which would take days or weeks to receive with no guarantee that it will work. This can greatly affect the recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).\nRTO: how long it will take to restore services from when a disaster is declared\nRPO: how far back the point of data restore is from when a disaster is declared\nAs a best practice, you should look for an RTO and RPO of a few hours or less. Because this requires a significant investment, many vendors skimp. They have a plan, but it may only be tested once per year – or not at all. When tested, there are often multiple flaws found, and commonly there is little or no action taken (but the vendor can still claim that the plan was tested).\nIt is important to consider the human factor as well. Many vendors have a disaster recovery plan that involves putting people on a plane or bus to go to an offsite location. In the event of a disaster, what are the chances that planes and buses will be operational in the immediate area? As a best practice, it is important to have adequate staff in the alternate locations to operate critical functions.\nTip: Ask your vendors about their disaster recovery plans. How often are they tested? What were the test results? What are the RTO and RPO? Were those objectives met in the most recent test?\nBusiness ContinuityBusiness continuity extends the concept of disaster recovery by ensuring that all business functions, not just IT systems, can remain operational with minimal disruption in the event of disaster.\nWhat are the critical business functions that you rely on from your vendors? Often, it is more than just a website or file server: it involves customer service and other human interaction. As a best practice, vendors should have multiple business locations with adequately trained staff that are capable of handling non-IT related business functions such as customer service. Do not rely on busing or flying staff to an alternate location.\nTip: Ask your vendors about their business continuity plans, specifically if they account for customer service and other critical functions.\nSecuritySecurity breaches can cause significant disruption to your business, either through data leakage (which may have significant HIPAA and HITECH Act implications) or by causing downtime and disruption of services. It is important that your vendors take a robust and comprehensive approach to security threat management. Require multiple layers of security, a robust security policy, proactive monitoring, alerting, and independent auditor verification.\nMultiple Layers of Security\nBest practices include both host-based and network-based anti-virus, anti-malware, intrusion detection and prevention, integrity-monitoring network firewalls, and application firewalls configured in an active, online state. This means that security components will ""take action"" to block or prevent attacks before they happen, and not just send an alert to indicate a problem.\nYour vendors (and you) should have a written security policy outlining all aspects of the security program. Trained security personnel need to review and update this at least once a year. This should also include a regular security risk assessment.\nBilling services also should have a designated security officer. This is often not the case, and security is more of an afterthought of the IT department.\nIndependent Auditor Verification\nDo not take your vendor\'s word for it – ask how they prove their security with independent audits. The Electronic Network Healthcare Accreditation Committee (EHNAC) is a good start, but it does not cover security in a detailed manner. In addition to EHNAC, look for a Payment Card Industry (PCI) ""Data Security Standards Level One"" audit performed by a PCI-approved Qualified Security Assessor, an SSAE16 Type II audit, and regular external and internal vulnerability detection by third parties. As a rule, make sure your vendors are certified by a third party and not just ""compliant"" through self-attestation. There is a difference!\nGet It in Writing\nIf your vendors are down for days or weeks, the costs to your billing service will be serious. It is crucial to ensure that your vendors are able to offer ""true availability"" for the services they provide. Many vendors claim to have availability and disaster recovery, but they take shortcuts to save money, resulting in single points of failure and poor disaster recovery. Vendors should commit to these things in their contracts and publish these commitments on their websites.\nAs businesses in all industries transition to the cloud, it is crucial to ensure that your data will be safe when disaster strikes. I encourage all types of businesses to use these best practices and tips as a checklist when discussing disaster recovery and security with current or potential vendor partners. Leveraging the cloud can significantly enhance the way you conduct business, but you must first take these precautions to protect your business and yourself.\nChris Seib is the co-founder and CTO of InstaMed, the leading Healthcare Payments Network.

In 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, prompted lawmakers to build a set of privacy laws governing the management and security of patient information.\nUsing this HIPAA security rule checklist, you can see how these standards apply to your organization and take steps to obtain compliance.\nWhat is the HIPAA Privacy Rule?\nThe Department of Health and Human Services issued a set of orders that standardized privacy law for all individuals and organizations that would manage patient health data. These accountable organizations are known as covered entities and are liable for all mandates expressed in the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, also known as the HIPAA Privacy Rule.\n“A major goal of the Privacy Rule is to assure that individuals’ health information is\nproperly protected while allowing the flow of health information needed to provide\nand promote high quality health care and to protect the public’s health and well being.” – United States Department of Health and Human Services\nThese privacy standards arrived as medical professionals started to digitize medical records. Taking advantage of digital documentation allows all healthcare-related organizations to better serve patients, since managing digital records is far more efficient than managing hard copies of medical records.\nTo Whom Does the HIPAA Privacy Rule Apply?\nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to what are referred to as covered entities. These agencies assist in the administration of healthcare services, to include treatments, insurance payments, and more.\nWhat are Covered Entities?\nA covered entity includes private medical practices, hospitals, and any auxiliary organization that must access protected health information to operate. Often, there are several healthcare-related agencies working together to assist a patient in receiving the medical care that they require.\nThe Privacy Rule identifies a covered entity as one of the following:\n- Health Plans\n- Insurance providers\n- Medicare/Medicaid insurers or supplemental insurers\n- Employer-sponsored plans\n- Government-sponsored plans\n- Church-sponsored plans\n- Coop plans\n- Healthcare Providers\n- Healthcare Clearinghouses\nThe Privacy Rule also applies to non-covered entities that serve as third-party vendors or business associates to a covered entity.\nWhat is Protected Health Information (PHI)?\nProtected Health Information, or PHI, is the formal term for “individually identifiable health information.” Covered entities manage PHI in accordance with their duties and are under scrutiny to protect patient identities and privacy by abiding by all HIPAA compliance standards pertaining to lawful use of PHI.\nDownload Our HIPAA Compliance Checklist\nWhat are HIPAA Authorizations?\nIn the event that a covered entity needs to share PHI with another individual or agency, but that individual or agency is not otherwise permitted access to a patient’s PHI under HIPAA Privacy law, covered entities may seek a patient authorization.\nHIPAA authorizations must be signed by the patient and lay out clearly who the authorization is for, the purpose of the authorization, and when the authorization expires. The covered entity should also define any contingencies or parameters laid out by the patient to meet the authorization’s purpose.\nAn example of a HIPAA authorization could be a mental health patient that agrees to share his/her therapy notes in a full psychological evaluation. This is a common scenario for veterans providing medical evidence during a PTSD disability claim. Even though filing a disability claim involves due process and legal discovery, investigators may not access those medical records without a signed patient authorization.\nHIPAA Protected Health Information Uses and Disclosures\nWhat is a Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP)?\nAll covered entities must disclose a notice of privacy practices, or NPP, that outlines the patient’s rights according to HIPAA privacy law and PHI. The NPP should also explain how a patient may file a complaint against a covered entity that they feel violated their rights under HIPAA privacy law.\nNPPs are items commonly found in registration paperwork when a patient sees a medical professional for the first time. The documentation explains how a covered entity may use the patient’s PHI within the bounds of HIPAA compliance.\nYour HIPAA Security Checklist:\nA HIPAA security checklist can help you identify where your business operations fail to meet HIPAA privacy requirements. You can use the checklist below to perform an internal audit. Or you can use the checklist as a way to gauge how seriously your organization takes HIPAA compliance.\nPatient Access and Consent\n- Have you established a process to help patients access their PHI? In this day and age, many covered entities make sure that patients can access their PHI safely online, even if another covered entity maintains the PHI database. Regardless, your organization should have clear policies and procedures to help patients view their PHI.\n- Do you have a process for accepting and fulfilling PHI copy requests from patients? When a patient requests copies of their PHI, HIPAA compliance dictates that you give the patient a copy in the requested format (hard copy or digital) within 30 days of their request.\n- If your firm decides to charge patients a fee for copies of their PHI, do you make those fees accessible? HIPAA compliance requires covered entities to fulfill PHI copy requests to patients at a reasonable cost. Prohibitive costs do not properly reflect the amount of labor and expenses required to fulfill PHI requests. Agencies that charge too much may be doing so intentionally to keep from having to be HIPAA compliant.\n- Are your authorizations specific, to include uses, recipients, disclosures, and expiration dates? Vague HIPAA authorizations do not protect your organization or the patient. All critical details of the authorization should be clearly spelled out according to the patient’s expectations.\n- Do your authorizations use “plain English,” as opposed to medical jargon and elusive clinical terms that the patient will not understand? If it appears that the patient had no clue of what they were signing because of convoluted words and phrases, your authorization could be in violation of HIPAA privacy law. It’s critical that your authorizations use language that is understandable to the average patient.\n- Do you secure the patient’s signature and date on every authorization? HIPAA authorizations are invalid unless they have the patient’s signature, as well as the date on which it was signed.\n- Do you store your HIPAA authorizations in a secure location and properly dispose of them once they are no longer needed? Losing a HIPAA authorization could open your organization up to legal action from the patient. It’s critical that you properly store and share authorizations in accordance with HIPAA privacy law.\nNotice of Privacy Practices (NPP)\n- Do you have an NPP included in your new patient paperwork? To be HIPAA compliant, you should onboard every new patient or client with an NPP so that those individuals understand their PHI rights from the start of your services.\n- Do you have your patients or clients confirm that you informed them of their rights according to HIPAA privacy law? Having your patients or clients confirm in writing and with a signature that they have read and understood your NPP protects you as a covered entity.\n- Do you prominently display your NPP on the premises and/or clearly on your website? Demonstrating that you publicize your NPP for all to see further protects you against patients claiming that you did not inform them of their rights under HIPAA privacy law.\n- Do you have policies and procedures in place to manage patients with concerns that you’re not complying with your NPP? It is possible that some patients may accuse you of not advising them of their rights per HIPAA privacy law. More importantly, a patient or client may fall through the cracks. Either way, you should have a clear process on how to manage those complaints and rectify them immediately.\n- Do your day-to-day operations align with your NPP and HIPAA Privacy Law? You should perform routine audits of your business operations to ensure that you’re not merely paying lip service to HIPAA privacy law.\nEmployees and Business Associates\n- Do all of your staff members understand HIPAA privacy law, as well as workplace policies and procedures relevant to PHI? Much of your HIPAA compliance pertains to consistent adherence by your staff. As a covered entity, it is your responsibility to ensure that every employee understands HIPAA privacy law and how they must manage PHI in their current role.\n- Have you trained your employees and collected proof (such as signed documentation) that they received the proper HIPAA compliance training? Similar to how you have patients sign and confirm that they had read and understood your NPP, you should include attestation documentation at the conclusion of HIPAA compliance training for your staff.\n- Do you have a process in place for employees to report HIPAA non-compliance without fear of reprisal? Ideally, you should create a way for employees to report non-compliance anonymously. This approach ensures that managers and lower-level employees alike are held accountable in accordance with HIPAA privacy law.\n- Do you collect confidentiality agreements from your employees and independent contractors? Employees and independent contractors of covered entities are known as non-business associates. Since it is likely that these people will come into contact with or manage PHI as part of their job description, it’s important that you collect confidentiality agreements from each of them.\n- Do you choose your business associates carefully, to include carrying out due diligence on that organization’s privacy policies and procedures? You could be held liable if one of your vendors mismanages PHI that your business maintains. Part of being HIPAA-compliant is ensuring that you only work with vendors that also understand HIPAA privacy law.\n- Do you maintain a list of all your business associates and third-party vendors? If your organization manages PHI, it’s very likely that most or all of your business associates and third-party vendors may come into contact with that PHI. It’s critical that you maintain an up-to-date record of all external parties with whom you do business.\n- Have you established the proper contracts (business associate agreements) with your business associates and third-party vendors that contain HIPAA-compliant directives on all matters pertaining to PHI? You should disclose to your business associates that managing PHI is part of your business operations. This informs your vendors that they must maintain HIPAA compliance, especially if their services also involve the use of PHI.\n- Do you reexamine your business associate agreements every year, to include updating your list of business associates? The nature of your relationship with third-party vendors and business associates can change year-over-year as you and the other party scale your respective operations. As such, you may need to update portions of your business associate agreements to remain HIPAA-compliant.\n- Do you have an up-to-date network diagram? Network diagrams show you all possible attack vectors from which hackers and malware might enter and try to steal or destroy PHI.\n- Do you have basic cybersecurity protocols in place? Due to the sensitivity of PHI, it is critical that you maintain all the necessary firewalls, malware protection, and monitoring to keep your and your patient’s information secure.\n- Do you have a plan to respond to an incident or breach? The initial moments after a security breach are often the most critical. Having a plan in place to quarantine the incident, diagnose the root cause, patch the intrusion, and report any damage will protect PHI under your organization’s care. Also, it will help your cybersecurity team update its tools, policies, and procedures to deal with similar intrusions more efficiently.\n- Has your staff received training on phishing attacks and how to prevent them? Sometimes the biggest threat to your organization is an employee clicking on an unknown link and releasing malware onto the company network. Making sure that your employees know how to safely deal with phishing attacks can drastically reduce your cyber risk.\nKey Takeaways: HIPAA Security Rule Compliance Checklist\nUsing the checklist above, you can take initial steps to become HIPAA-compliant in accordance with privacy laws pertaining to PHI. Failing to comply with HIPAA Privacy Law can result in financial penalties and patient lawsuits.\nRSI Security is an agency dedicated to assisting covered entities in their quest to acquire and maintain HIPAA security compliance.

68	benefits camera controlled prosthetics	Controlling prosthetics through phone camera tracking offers several advantages: it eliminates the expensive need for prosthetist fittings, allows users to program unlimited grip patterns quickly and intuitively, and provides a more affordable alternative to traditional myoelectric sensors. The system is particularly useful for activities like holding books, cups, or shopping bags.	"[""What is the Mirru App?\nMirru is a free and open source Android app under development with which one can control robotic prosthetic hands via hand tracking. With our app, a user can instantly mirror grips from their sound hand onto a robotic one, which could be 3D-printed and self-assembled at low cost. With Mirru, we want to provide a cheap, intuitive and open end-to-end alternative to existing, costly, cumbersome and proprietary technology.\nFigure 1: A demonstration of using MediaPipe hand tracking to move a robotic hand’s fingers with the Mirru app.\nThe Mirru team is a collaboration between Violeta López and Vladimir Hermand, two independent designers and technologists currently based in Paris. To kickstart the project, the team took part in Tweag’s Open Source Fellowship program which provided funding, mentorship and data engineering expertise from one of their engineers, Dorran Howell. The fellowship helped get Mirru launched from the ground-up.\nOur goal for the 3-month fellowship was to develop an initial version of the Android app that can control any bluetooth open source hand using computer vision techniques, and make the app available for free on the Google Play store so anyone can print their own hand, assemble it, and download the app. With the help of MediaPipe, we were able to quickly prototype our app without having to build our own machine learning model, as we didn’t have the resources or training data to do so.\nWhy use hand tracking?\nUsing your phone and a front-facing camera with hand tracking opens up a new, affordable, accessible, and versatile way to control prosthetics.\nLet's say I'm a left hand amputee who owns a robotic prosthesis. Every day, I need my prosthetic hand to actuate a lot of different grip patterns. For example, I need to use a pinch or tripod grip to pick up small objects, or a fist grip to pick up objects like a fruit or a cup. I change and execute these grip patterns via myoelectric muscle sensors that allow me to, for example, open and close a grip by flexing and unflexing my upper limb muscles. These myoelectric muscle sensors are the main interface between my body and the prosthesis.\nHowever, living with them is not as easy as it seems. Controlling the myoelectric sensors can take a lot of time to get used to, and many never do. It can also be quite expensive to get these sensors fitted by a prosthetist, especially for people in developing countries or anyone without health insurance. Finally, the number of grips on many devices currently on the market is limited to less than ten, and only few models come with ways to create custom grips, which are often cumbersome.\nMirru provides an alternative interface. Using just their phone, a tool many have access to, a user can digitally mirror their sound hand in real-time and communicate with their prosthesis in an intuitive way. This removes the expensive need to be fitted by a prosthetist and enables the user to quickly program an unlimited amount of grips. For now, Mirru stays away from electromyography altogether as reliable muscle sensors are expensive. The programmed grips therefore need to be triggered via the android phone, which is why this first version of our app is more suited for activities like sweeping, holding a book while reading it, or holding a cup or shopping bag. In the future we hope to combine myoelectric sensors with hand tracking to get the benefits of both.\nProgramming a grip with the Mirru app looks like the following: Let’s say that I want to grab an object with my robotic hand. I bring my prosthesis near the object and I then form the desired grip with my sound hand in front of my android phone and Mirru mirrors it in real-time to the prosthesis. I then lock my prosthesis into this new grip and free up my vsound hand. Finally I might save this grip for later use and add it to my library of grips.\nFigure 2: A user tester using hand-tracking on their phone to program their prosthesis’s grip to pick up a measuring tape and measure with the other hand.\nThe Brunel Hand and the Mirru Arduino Sketch\nIn order to accomplish our goal of allowing as many people as possible to print, assemble, and control their own hand, we designed the Mirru android app to be compatible with any robotic hand that is controlled by a bluetooth-enabled Arduino board and servo motors.\nFor our project, we printed and assembled an open source robotic hand called the Brunel Hand made by Open Bionics. First, we 3D printed the Brunel Hand’s 3D printable files that are made available under the CC Attribution-Sharealike 4.0 International License. We then bought the necessary servos, springs, and screws to assemble the hand. In combination with printing and buying the servos, the hand costs around €500 to purchase and assemble.\nThe Brunel Hand comes with myoelectric-based firmware and a PCB board developed by Open Bionics, but since the hand is in essence just 4 servo motors, any microcontroller could be used. We ended up using an Adafruit ESP32 feather board for its bluetooth capabilities and created an Arduino sketch that can be downloaded, customized, and uploaded for anyone who is printing and assembling their own hand. They could then download the Mirru app to use as the control-interface for their printed hand.\nHand-tracking with MediaPipe\nThere are many computer vision solutions available for hand tracking that could be used for this project, but we needed a fast, open source solution that didn’t require us to train our own model, and that could be used reliably on a portable device such as a phone.\nMediaPipe provides great out of the box support for hand tracking, and since we didn’t have the training data or resources available to create a model from scratch, it was perfect for our team. We were able to build the Android example apps easily and were excited to find that the performance was promising. Even better, no tweaking on the ready-made hand tracking model or the graphs was necessary, as the hand landmark model provided all the necessary outputs for our prototype.\nWhen testing the prosthesis on real users, we were happy to hear that many of them were impressed with how fast the app was able to translate their movements, and that nothing else exists on the market that allows you to make custom grips as fast and on-the-fly.\nFigure 3: A user tester demonstrates how quickly the MediaPipe hand-tracking can translate her moving fingers to the movement of her prosthesis’s fingers.\nTranslating 3D MediaPipe points into inputs for Robotics\nTo achieve the goals of the Mirru app, we need to use hand tracking to independently control each finger of the Brunel Hand in real-time. In the Brunel Hand, the index, middle, and ring fingers are actuated using servos that move at an angle from 0 to 180 degrees; 0 means the finger is fully upright and 180 means the finger is fully flexed down. As we lacked adequate training data to create a model from scratch that could calculate these servo angles for us, we opted to use a heuristic to relate the default hand tracking landmark outputs to the inputs required by our hardware for an initial version of our prototype.\nFigure 4: In the lab testing the translation of the outputs to inputs with the app and the prototype.\nWe were initially unsure whether the estimated depth (Z) coordinate in the 3D landmarks would be accurate enough for the translation of inputs or if we would be limited to working in 2D. As an initial step, we recorded an example dataset and spun up a visualization of the points in a Jupyter Notebook with Plotly. We were immediately impressed by the quality and accuracy of the coordinates, considering that the technology only uses a single camera without any depth sensors. As noted in the MediaPipe documentation, The Z coordinates have a slightly different scale than the X/Y coordinates, but this didn’t seem to pose a significant challenge for our prototype.\nFigure 5: A data visualization of the hand made up of 21 3D hand landmarks provided by MediaPipe.\nGiven the accuracy of the 3D landmarks, we opted to use a calculation in 3D for relating landmark outputs to the inputs required by the prosthesis. In our approach, we calculate the acute angles of the fingers in relation to the palm by calculating the angle between the finger direction and the normal of the plane defined by the palm. An angle of 0° corresponds to maximum closure of the finger, and an angle of 180° indicates a fully extended finger. We were able to calculate the finger direction by calculating the vector from the landmark at the base of the fingers to the landmark on the tip of the fingers.\nFigure 6: Diagram showing the 3D landmarks and which ones we used to calculate the finger direction vector, the palm normal, and the angle that both form.\nWe calculate the palm normal by selecting three points in the plane of the palm. Using Landmark 0 as the reference point, we calculate the vectors for side 1 and side 2, and compute the cross product of those vectors to give us the palm normal. Finally, we compute the angle of the finger direction and the palm normal. This returns an angle in radians that we use to calculate degrees.\nWe had to do some extra processing to match the degrees of freedom for the thumb on our prosthetic hand. The thumb moves in more complex ways than the rest of the fingers. In order to get our app to work with the thumb, we did similar calculations for thumb direction and the palm normal, but we used different landmarks.\nOnce we do the calculation of the servo angles on the android phone, we send those values via bluetooth to the Arduino board, and the Arduino board moves the servos to the proper position. Due to some noise in the model outputs, we add a smoothing step to the pipeline, which is important so that the movements of the robotic fingers aren’t too jittery for precise grips.\nFigure 7: A user tester makes a pinch grip on her prosthesis with the Mirru app.\nThe Mirru app and Mirru Arduino Sketch are designed to allow anyone to control an open source prosthesis with their sound hand and an Android phone. This is a novel and frugal alternative to muscle sensors, and MediaPipe has proven that it is the right tool for the essential hand tracking component of the full application. The Mirru team was able to get started quickly with MediaPipe’s out of the box solutions without having to gather any training data or having to design a model from scratch. The speed of the real-time translation from hand tracking points to the robotic hand has especially excited all of our users in our testing sessions and opens up many possibilities for the future of prostheses.\nWe see exciting potential for combining the MediaPipe hand tracking features with existing myoelectric prostheses which could open powerful and advanced ways to create and save custom prosthesis grips in real-time. Also, with the help of MediaPipe, we have been able to provide an open source alternative to proprietary prostheses without the need for myoelectric sensors or a visit to a prosthetist, at a cost that is much lower than what is already on the market, and whose source code can be customized and built-upon by other developers. Our team is excited to see what other ideas the open source community might come up with, and to see what hand tracking can bring to users and manufacturers of prostheses.\nAs for the current state of the Mirru application, we have yet to implement the possibility of recording and saving moving gestures that are longer sequences compared to the static grip positions. For example, imagine being able to record the movement of the fingers to play a bass line on a piano, like a loopable animated gif. There is a realm of possibilities for prostheses that is waiting to be explored, and we’re really happy that MediaPipe gives us access to it.\nThis blog post is curated by Igor Kibalchich, ML Research Product Manager at Google AI.""]"	['<urn:uuid:ba51beab-a83f-4313-ae9c-e6b24f134482>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	4	51	2067
69	Can you explain what backflow is in plumbing systems and why it poses significant health and safety risks in modern water supply systems?	Backflow is a condition where water reverses its flow direction in plumbing pipes, contrary to its intended one-way flow. This occurs when there are pressure changes in the system. It presents significant health and safety risks because it can lead to contamination when dirty bath and wastewater mixes with drinking water. This is particularly concerning in modern plumbing systems that rely on pressure rather than gravity to move water. There have been documented cases where people have died from consuming such contaminated water due to backflow.	['One of the greatest advancements in our history was the development of running water systems. The idea of running water is believed to have originated from the Romans thousands of years ago. They had a system that supplied running water throughout their cities. Some of those systems are still in existence and constitute the earliest plumbing systems humanity has. In these modern times, we have professionally designed plumbing and sewage systems that serve both commercial and residential premises with fresh water. We can thus safely drink, bath, and clean with the water supplied.\nThe modern plumbing systems tend to come with certain challenges, despite the advancements. They depend on pressure to keep the water moving into different places, unlike the earlier systems that relied on gravity. While pressure is the more efficient option, it presents the problem of backflow.\nBackflow is a situation in which water reverses flow in the plumbing pipes. Water in a plumbing system is meant to move in one direction. It, however, can flow in the other direction in case there is a change in pressure. In such a situation, there are some considerable health and safety risks. There, for one, can be contamination from the dirty bath and wastewater mixing with the drinking water. There have been deaths where people have unknowingly taken such water.\nThere are backflow prevention devices you can use to ensure that such incidents do not occur in your home. Backflow prevention devices are usually installed at different junctures in a plumbing system. They will see to it that there are no pressure fluctuations to prevent backflows so that your family or your employees remain safe. There are several kinds of backflow prevention devices and setups which control flow direction while preventing backflow. There is the Pressure Vacuum Breaker. It happens to be the most common device for preventing backflow. It is easy to install and maintain. They are better for outdoor use since they can eject water from time to time. There is also the Double Check Valve. It is usable in indoor and outdoor settings. They are pricier than the former option but serve up more convenience. You can have it installed horizontally or vertically. You can also go for the Reduced Pressure Zone Assembly, which is the priciest. It is the most reliable device you can get. It can be used where there are landscaping chemicals, which is why it is applied in irrigation systems.\nWhen constructing a new house, you are expected to have the backflow preventers installed as well. Older houses may not have fallen under such regulations, but times have changed, and so have the rules. You need to consult with the professionals during such an installation, to know which one fits your needs the best. They will assess the structure for possible backflow scenarios and make their recommendations.\nApart from the initial inspection and installation, there is also a need for annual backflow inspections. The rules dictate that the ongoing dangers people face from contaminated water make it necessary for those annual inspections. They are the best way to know if your plumbing system has developed any changes sufficient to cause such a dangerous state. You need to consult the experts for such services.']	['<urn:uuid:17207332-2a1f-48ab-bf7e-0dcf2c2c1a00>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	23	86	540
70	how did black death spread transmission method death rate europe 1347	The Black Death spread through fleas that carried the bacterial infection Yersinia pestis. These fleas would first bite infected rats and then transmit the disease to humans. The plague killed approximately 35-50% of Europe's population between 1347-1350. People could also contract the disease through physical contact with infected bodily fluids. The plague was especially deadly in spring, summer and fall months, and could kill otherwise healthy people before dawn.	['We are searching data for your request:\nUpon completion, a link will appear to access the found materials.\nBy Kathryn Walton\nThe Black Death of 1347-51 was one of the worst pandemics in Europe’s history. It decimated the population, killing roughly half of all people living. After the ravages of the plague were finished, however, medieval peasants found their lives and working conditions improved.\nOne of the most famous pandemics in Europe’s history raged across the continent and around the world from 1347-51. The plague pandemic, coined The Black Death by a nineteenth century scholar, is generally thought to have been caused by a bacterial infection derived from the bacillus Yersinia pestis. The disease was transmitted by fleas who latched onto a human host after biting an infected rat. It swept across a huge portion of the globe. The Palestinian chronicler Abū Hafs Umar Ibn al-Wardī reports that it spread through China, India, Turkey, Egypt, Palestine, as well as Europe. You can see his account of its spread animated in the video below.\nThe disease was devastating. The physician and poet Abū Ja’far Ahmad Ibn Khātima, who lived on the southern coast of Spain, leaves us a very detailed description of the effects of the plague in his Arabic treatise A Description and Remedy for Escaping the Plague in the Future. It begins, as he says, with a fever that rises over the course of a few days making the patient disoriented and depressed. This is followed by some severe physical reactions:\ncramps; coldness in the extremities; frightful, bilious, recurring vomiting; diverse lesions on the skin; or: a tightness in the chest; difficulty in breathing; spitting of blood or stinging pain on the side or just below the breast, accompanied by inflammation and an intense thirst; coughing; blackness of tongue or swelling of the throat with complications of quinsy; and a difficulty or impossibility swallowing; or: headaches; fainting fits; dizziness; nausea and foul-smelling diarrhea.\nThis passage was translated by Suzanne Gigandet. You can read it is full as well as many of the documents that I refer to here in John Aberth’s The Black Death, The Great Mortality of 1348-1350: A Brief History with Documents.\nIt was a terrible disease that inspired a great deal of fear across Europe and around the world. The medical professionals of the time did not really know what caused it or how to contain it. It was often attributed to God’s wrath and blamed on such environmental factors as bad smells. There were some attempts made to control its spread. Quarantine and sanitation measures were put in place and travel between cities was restricted. But nothing really worked, and the plague spread rapidly.\nImpact on Peasants and Members of the Lower Classes\nIt affected everyone but was especially devastating for peasants and those in the lower classes. In the face of an outbreak, those who had enough money to finance relocating would simply leave the infected location. Those who did not died in greater numbers. The Italian poet Giovanni Boccaccio in The Decameron describes the plight of common people in cities who, not having the resources to leave, were forced to stay close to home. As a result, they “sickened daily by the thousands and because they received little help, they nearly all died with few exceptions.”\nThose outside of the cities also died in extremely high numbers. Peasant farmers tended to be more removed from the outbreaks, but as Boccaccio stresses, they had no access to physicians and often little help when they fell ill. As a result, they “died, not like men, but like animals, on the roads, in their fields or in their houses at all hours, by day and night.” These quotations come from the Project Gutenberg edition of Bocaccio’s text. I have modernized the language. You can access the full text here.\nIt was a devastating event. Millions of people around the world suffered and died. When the plague ended roughly half of the population of Europe was gone. The face of Europe was changed forever.\nBut for the peasant population, it was changed for the better.\nLives of Peasants Before the Plague\nPrior to the plague, medieval peasants were often extremely poor and had few freedoms. Peasants typically farmed a portion of an estate owned by a lord in return for the protection of that lord and the use of the land. But, as a result, peasants were often tied to the land and had to give up certain freedoms to hold on to it. They also had to turn over a portion of their harvest to the lord as payment. This arrangement absolutely benefited the lord over the peasant. The lord was able to amass great wealth from the work of his peasant farmers. The peasants were often barely able to produce enough to get by and had few means of improving their position in the world.\nIf you want to read more about the working conditions of peasants and the prevalence of serfdom in early medieval England, check out Lucie Laumonier’s column Who were the Peasants in the Middle Ages?\nThe Resulting Labour Shortage\nAfter the ravages of the Black Death were finished in Europe, however, there were suddenly far fewer people to farm the lands. Egyptian scholar Ahmad Ibn Alī al-Maqrīzī, described what this looked like after the plague had passed through Egypt: “When the harvest time came, there remained only a very small number of ploughmen.” There were some who “attempted to hire workers, promising them half of the crop, but they could not find anyone to help them.” The same was true in Europe, and crops remained unharvested and great revenues were lost for the local landowners because they couldn’t get anyone to do the work.\nLabourers and farmers were consequently suddenly in high demand. To maintain their estates and ways of living the lords needed peasants to farm their lands, and so, faced with a labour shortage, the lords were forced to pay peasants more for their work and enter into agreements that were more beneficial to the peasants. Peasants suddenly had more agency and more control over their working lives. They could dictate the terms of their contracts. They could simply leave their position if their lord treated them poorly or was unwilling to pay them more. They were able to acquire more wealth and freedom as the importance of their labour was increasingly recognized in the face of its loss.\nMany and various attempts were made by local governments and officials to block this upward movement. An Ordinance from Castile in 1351 condemns those who “wander about idle and do not want to work” as well as those “demand such great prices and salaries and wages.” It orders all able to do so to work for a set, pre-plague price. Another from Sienna condemns those who “extort and receive great sums and salaries for the daily labor that they do every day” and sets a fixed price of six gold florins a year.\nImproved Salaries, Freedoms, and Lifestyles\nThese ordinances show the anxieties of the governing members of society, but they were not always effective. Peasants continued to ask for and receive more money for their work and greater freedoms. Court records show that peasants and labourers frequently demanded more pay for their labour, left before the end of a contract, and abandoned one position if they were offered more money in another. They were charged for these offenses, but they kept doing them.\nAs working conditions and salaries improved, so did the lifestyles of the peasants. Goods and activities that had only been available to those with money were suddenly being taken up by peasants and other members of the lower classes. They used their newfound wealth to buy fancier clothes, eat nicer food, and take up leisure activities like hunting. The English poet John Gower lamented in his Mirour de l’Omme that labourers who were used to eating bread made of corn now were able to eat that made of wheat and that those who had previously drunk water were now enjoying luxuries like milk and cheese. He also complained about their new, fancier attire, and their choice to dress above their station. His attitude was common among some in the upper and middle classes who lamented the social improvements of the lives of peasants and the loss of the good-old-days before the plague when the world was “well-ordered,” and people knew their place (as Gower says).\nWhat the Black Death Tells Us\nPlagues and pandemics are terrible. But they usually end eventually. And the example of the Black Death shows that when they do, society can find itself changed for the better. The Black Death is often credited with catapulting the medieval world into the Renaissance. It is thought to have inspired the cultural, technological, and scientific innovations by which this period is typically defined. While many medieval scholars (myself included) question the extent to which the early modern period was uniquely innovative (there were many innovations taking place before that), there is no question that one of Europe’s greatest pandemics changed the continent and made a positive impact, for a time, on the lives of medieval peasants.\nTime will tell what the end of our current pandemic will bring. The Black Death shows that pandemics can bring positive social changes. Hopefully, COVID-19 will bring some too.\nKathryn Walton holds a PhD in Middle English Literature from York University.

It kills most of the people exposed to it, depending on the particular strain. Imagine a plague that kills an estimated 35% of the entire population of Europe in a matter of three short years. Now imagine that you are living in the Late Middle Ages (1300-1450), modern medicine had not developed yet, and modern scientific processes explaining where the disease comes from and how it is transmitted is more than 400 years in the future. This is the situation in which the people of Europe found themselves in the mid-1300s, as the plague swept through Europe.\nBubonic plague, also known as Black Death or The Plague, was a deadly disease introduced to Europe by ships carrying rats infected with diseased fleas. There are few distinct forms of the plague, but bubonic was the most commonly seen and therefore lent its name to the epidemic as a whole. The name itself comes from the swelling and blackening of the lymph glands of the groin, armpits, or neck of the infected individual. These black lumps were known as buboes.\nThe infected person might also carry the disease in the bloodstream, resulting in the septicemic version of the plague. These forms of the illness were fatal most of the time. The third subtype of the plague, pneumonic, was the most deadly, taking the lives of nine of ten infected individuals. The illness created boils, which could ooze pus and blood, and also caused a fever, chills, vomiting, general malaise, or respiratory ills manifested through coughing and sneezing. Physical contact with an infected individual’s bodily fluids could also pass on the disease.\nFrom late 1347 until 1350, the Black Death ravaged Europe. It was most active in the spring, summer, and fall months and less active in the cold winter months, but all individuals were at risk of infection. The plague took the lives of more than half of the inhabitants of some cities. Peasants were found dead along roadsides, and ships would wash ashore after their crews perished at sea. Entire streets or families would succumb to the illness seemingly overnight.\nMap 1. Spread of the Black Death from 1347-1350. (Sayre, 2008)\nHistorical records from the time are not complete, so determining an exact number of victims is impossible. However, many estimates put the death toll at or above 25% of the European population during the height of the plague years alone. All of Europe was impacted. No one could be assured of being spared. Much of this was due to the fact that people did not know how the disease was spreading. They did not take basic precautions that would be encouraged in modern times to stop or slow the spread of disease.\nFig. 1 Pages with Three Living (left) and Three Dead (right), from the Psalter and Book of Hours of Bonne of Luxemburg. ca. before 1349 (Sayer, 2008)\nThe Black Death was carried by rats and fleas and transmitted by the bites of these animals. Although rats and fleas are not part of modern daily life for most individuals, in the fourteenth century, these creatures were part of day-to-day existence. Records show that there had been rumors of a plague sweeping through areas in the east in the years before it came to the European continent, but relatively little attention was paid to the tales.\nIt is widely believed the disease first appeared in Europe when ships coming from trading ports on the Black Sea returned to Genoa, Italy in 1347. Fleas, once their rat hosts died, would feed on other nearby mammals. In the case of rats on ships, the sailors became the victims. As the rats and their fleas literally jumped ship in Genoa, the plague began a reign of terror and continued throughout Europe for many years to come.\nThe people of Europe did not know how disease was spread or what precautions to take to overcome the diseases effects. Isolating oneself from the general public or large gatherings during times of disease was also an unknown practice, as it relates to reducing one’s exposure to disease. Likewise, isolating the ill from the well, and ensuring that the well did not come into contact with bodily fluids of the ill were not common practices. The treatment of the dead and the handling of corpses were also different from what is done in modern practice. The lack of knowledge about how the disease was transmitted and what could be done to slow or stop the spread contributed to the great number of deaths.\nThe impacts of the Black Death were many and varied. The initial decimation resulted in a decrease in the foods available at the market. It is also reported that animals were likely affected by the plague. Some reports note entire flocks of dead sheep in the fields. However, with fewer people for whom food needed to be produced, this temporary decrease was soon made up for as the remaining population took over the farmland of those who had perished.\nFig. 2 Black Death did not spear those it across, all were susceptible. (Sayre, 2008)\nEconomically the Black Death would hurt the nobles the most. Nobles were accustomed to collecting significant amounts of dues either in the form of crops or cash payments but eventually there were fewer serfs on whom they could depend for on ‘payments’. This decreased their power to demand payment for the privilege of working the nobles’ lands. Eventually, serfdom was replaced by a system in which the landowners paid those who worked their lands. The sociopolitical structure existing prior to the plague underwent significant changes.\nAnother effect of the Black Death was an increase in university enrollments at institutions where medicine was a field of study. Students who had seen the effects of the plague and survived brought with them new ideas about how diseases could spread or how they might be treated. At this time, there was also a push for the translation of major medical texts into vernacular languages from the more traditional Greek or Latin presentations.\nThe late Middle Ages were a time of change in every sense of the word and would give way to the Renaissance. Black Death, in essence, helped fuel much of the social, political and economic changes seen in later years. In many towns traditional burial services were not preformed and the dead were buried in mass graves. “By 1350, all of Europe, with the exception of a few territories far from traditional trade routes, was divested by the disease.” (Sayre, 2013, p. 200) As the push for better understanding about the natural world was thriving in the universities, the Middle Ages as the “age of faith” was giving way to “an ages of intellectual exploration”. (Sayre, 2013, p. 207) During this time humanist, individual interested in the recovery, study, and spread of art and literature of Greece and Rome, would emerge. These individuals would start to rebuild and revolutionize the Western course of history and change social behaviors to the greatest degree ever seen in the West.\nSayre, H.M.(2013).

71	What role did music and activism play in fighting for environmental causes?	Willie Nelson used his musical platform to organize Farm Aid and support various causes, with recordings and concerts documented in Jody Fischer's collection including numerous benefit performances and collaborative sessions with other artists. Similarly, the Standing Rock protest brought together not just tribal activists but also celebrities and supporters from across the country, demonstrating how cultural figures and activism combined to fight for environmental protection. The gathering near Cannon Ball drew 1,500 people and inspired support from American Indians, celebrities, and activists nationwide.

The materials are arranged into the following series: Personal Papers, Ephemera, Posters, Photographs, Audio Cassette Tapes, Video Cassette Tapes, and Artifacts.\nIdentification: Collection 103\nExtent: 20 boxes plus oversize folders (13 linear feet)\nJody Fischer was born December 21, 1949. During the 1970’s she lived in New York City, and was active with the music scene. She was a bit of a musician and writer herself. According to a 1991 Texas Monthly article, she started following Willie Nelson in the early 1970’s helping wherever she could. When he purchased the Pedernales Country Club in 1979, she was hired on as his personal secretary. Her job was to schedule studio time for Willie and his musician friends, assist Lana Nelson with charitable work, and generally assist in managing the property. She also had a small part in his movie, Red-Headed Stranger, which was filmed on the property.\nWhen Willie Nelson began the Farm Aid movement, Jody took calls coming in from famers and their families, and is often quoted as being a compassionate listener. She was very close to the extended Nelson family, as well as involved in diverse causes such as Farm Aid and Native American civil rights.\nJody passed away on December 25, 2003 at the Christopher House hospice for cancer patients, in the Willie Nelson room.\nScope and Content Note\nThe Jody Fischer Collection of Willie Nelson spans from 1974-2003, with the bulk of the materials covering 1983-1988. The collection is comprised of photographs, audio cassette tapes and video tapes collected by Jody Fischer that relate to Willie Nelson. The arrangement of the collection is entirely artificial as the materials were not organized when received. Titles in quotation marks are attributed to Jody Fischer.\nThe collection is arranged into the following seven series: Personal Papers, Ephemera, Photographs, Posters, Audio Cassette Tapes, Video Cassette Tapes, and Artifacts. An overview of each series is provided below.\nSERIES I: Personal Papers, 1985-1986, 2003, undated\nThis series includes correspondence letters, rough drafts of song lyrics and a birthday card to Jody Fischer.\nSERIES II: Ephemera, 1977, 1985-1987, undated\nBoxes 1, 3 & drawer 24\nThis series includes programs, a calendar, and a press kit for Red Headed Stranger. The press kit includes photos on set, director’s notes and cast descriptions. Programs include Austin Opry House performances, Run for Your Life program, Farm Aid 1985 program and First Decade Reunion program. The calendar is a Willie Nelson calendar from 1983.\nSERIES III: Photographs, [1984-1988]\nBoxes 1-3 & drawer 24\nThis series is divided into six sub-series: Willie Nelson portraits; Willie Nelson performing; Willie Nelson with others [non-performance]; non-Willie Nelson photographs; snapshots on the set of Red Headed Stranger, and snapshots on the set of Ned Blessing.\nSERIES IV: Posters\nBox 3 & drawer 24\nPosters are divided into Willie Nelson and non-Willie Nelson subseries. The Nelson posters include ones for the sixth annual Fourth of July picnic; Honeysuckle Rose, and two advertising concerts. The bulk of the non-Willie Nelson posters are for concerts at the Austin Opry House by performers such as The Charlie Daniels Band, Kinky Friedman, Dave Loggins, The Lost Gonzo Band, and Taj Mahal.\nSERIES V: Audio Cassette Tapes, 1976-1995\nThese audio cassettes primarily feature Willie Nelson, though there are several of other recording artists. The cassettes are in varying condition, some have been recorded over multiple times and the labels are not always descriptive of what is on the tape. The series of audio recordings has been divided into 5 subseries; Jody Fischer recordings, Willie Nelson studio recordings, Willie Nelson dated live recordings, Willie Nelson undated live recordings, and other recording artists. The collection also included a variety of commercially produced and released cassettes that have been transferred to the library holdings.\nThe cassettes covered a broad scope of music, as well as some personal recordings of events, phone calls and jam sessions. The cassettes did not have a particular original order, and when possible have been arranged by date. The priority for sorting recordings was broken down by separating out the Studio recordings, Jody’s own recordings which give insight to the interests and activities outside of strictly music that she participated in as an individual and as Willie Nelson’s personal assistant. Following that recordings are sorted by those including Willie Nelson, and those of other artists.\nWhen it is not possible to sort by date, the recordings are sorted by alphabetical order of contributing artists. Often the labels only include first names, such as Hank, Dolly, Kris, Frank, and Johnny to name a few. While some of the last names can be inferred based on other famous musicians and context, last names that have been added by the processing staff are put in parenthesis to indicate that they are additions not included on the actual labels.\nSubseries 1: Jody Fisher Recordings, 1988 – 1996, Undated\nThese recordings are difficult to date, frequently Ms. Fischer has recorded over other tapes, and many of her recordings have Willie Nelson music on the other side. These recordings include phone conversations, Hawaiian music taped from the radio on her trip to Hawaii, and programs focusing on Native American civil rights, amongst other topics.\nSubseries 2: Willie Nelson Studio Recordings, 1983 – 1987, Undated\nThese recordings with one exception are from the Pedernales Studio. They are arranged by date when possible, with undated recordings at the end of the series.\nSERIES V: Audio Cassette Tapes, continued\nSubseries 3: Willie Nelson Recordings Dated, 1976 -1995\nThese recordings vary from jam sessions to concerts to rough recordings prior to production. Often they include other artists such as Kris Kristofferson, Merle Haggard, and other country, folk and blues artists.\nSubseries 4: Willie Nelson Recordings, Undated\nThese recordings are similar to those in subseries 3, except that they are undated. Recordings will be grouped by collaborating artists listed on the labels.\nSubseries 5: Recordings by Other Artists, 1982-1986, undated\nThese are other un-produced recordings in the Jody Fischer collections featuring other artists. These will be sorted alphabetically by artist last name.\nSERIES VI: Video Cassette Tapes, 1982-1995, undated\nThis series consists of VHS and U-Matic tapes. Most of the tapes are programs featuring Willie Nelson recorded from the television. The programs include news interviews, music concerts, television shows and film. The majority of the tapes are produced video although, there are some tapes featuring raw footage of Willie Nelson. The raw footage includes a music performance at a bar in 1990, the auction of Willie Nelson’s personal belongings, Willie Nelson performing at Phoenix Indian School and Willie Nelson performing a toast to Mae Boren Axton. The raw footage tapes have been copied onto DVDs. The collection also includes television recordings of Farm Aid 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 that aired on the MTV network. The VHS tapes that do not feature Willie Nelson include two episodes of Ned Blessing, a raw footage recording of the play, Small Town Girl and a raw footage recording of a tribal award ceremony with Kris Kristoferson in attendance. Titles supplied by Jody Fischer are in quotations.\nThis series is divided into five subseries: Farm Aid Concerts, Farm Aid Related Videos, Willie Nelson Produced Video, Willie Nelson Raw Footage and Non-Willie Nelson.\nSERIES VII: Artifacts, 1974-1989, undated\nThe bulk of the series are T-shirts, sweatshirts, jackets and hats. Most of the T-Shirts are from Farm Aid, the 4th of July Picnic, and other concerts with some from various running events, and a couple from the Austin Opry House. The four sweatshirts are from Farm Aid. The jackets include paraphernalia from Willie Nelson concerts, Pederanales Recording Studio, and the 1984 Darrel and Willie Invitational. There are two hats; one white hat with “Willie Nelson Luck Texas,” on the band, and one baseball cap with “Willie Nelson Who’ll Buy My Memories? The IRS Tapes,” on the front. Also included in this series is a variety of items including match boxes, pins, golf balls fans, and bumper stickers.\nClick here for the complete PDF inventory including the detailed description', 'CANNON BALL, North Dakota——The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and eight Washington state tribes gathered along the banks of the Cannonball River to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline, which would run through Standing Rock’s ancestral homelands. The tribes urged the United States District Court to rule in favor of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s request to issue an injunction that stops construction of the pipeline until the Tribe’s waters and cultural resources are protected.\nThe eight Washington state tribes included the Yakama Nation, Swinomish Indian Tribal Community, Lummi Nation, Puyallup Tribe, Nisqually Indian Tribe, Suquamish Tribe, Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe and Hoh Tribe, many of whom have faced similar challenges to their lands and ways of life. Some of the tribes that attended the event have won recent battles against proposed oil and coal export terminals that would have violated treaty rights, endangered fish and shellfish, and threatened the tribes’ very existence.\n““We’’ve seen the success our friends from Washington state have had in their battles to protect treaty rights against the transport of fossil fuels,”” said David Archambault II, Chairman of Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. “”Their support is crucial in the protection of our land, water, and cultural resources, as well as all of our sovereign rights that we are asking Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Jo-Ellen Darcy to honor.””\nThe peaceful gathering near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, is estimated at 1,500 people, and has inspired American Indians, celebrities, and activists from across the country to show their support for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Numerous tribes have written letters to President Obama and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers asking them to fulfill their trust obligation to tribes and reconsider the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.\n““Words can’t express how thankful we are for all of the prayers, support, letters, and donations we have received,”” said Archambault. “”It inspires us every day on our mission to protect this area for future generations and all who use it.””\nMore than 150 tribes are standing with Standing Rock on this pipeline issue, with dozens of tribes joining the camp to show their support.\nThe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is arguing in court that the Dakota Access Pipeline was fast-tracked by the federal government, which is a direct violation of the Tribe’s rights as a sovereign nation because it will hurt the Tribe’s safe drinking water and historic and cultural resources. The Tribe has asked the United States government to conduct a more stringent environmental review to ensure the protection of the Tribe’s treaty rights and sacred places.\n““Everyone has heard that this pipeline would be more than 1,100 miles long and would transport more than half a million barrels of crude oil every day across our lands,”” said Cedric Good House, a traditional leader for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. “”What they don’t know are the irreplaceable sacred places across the landscape and the deep cultural and spiritual knowledge that is tied to them. These are the places and the knowledge that make us who we are today as a tribe. I plan on telling my grandchildren about the time when tribes across the country stood up and fought for treaty, culture, and the future. And we fought for the future of safe drinking water for all Americans. No longer is the world watching us, the world is with us.””\n“Yakama is humbled and honored to stand beside our brothers and sisters of the Standing Rock Sioux. We, along with peoples of all walks of life, are observing a peaceful and prayerful gathering to move an entire country. We stand united in solidarity with the natural laws of this land, advocating for responsible decision making and honorable communications. Together, we express to the U.S. government that now, more than ever, is the time to fulfill the trust obligations laid out within the treaties and historical interactions with the Native peoples of this land. Until such things come to pass, the spirit and voice of all peoples shall unite with Standing Rock. One voice, one heart, and one spirit to speak for those things that cannot speak for themselves. Nye.” -JoDe Goudy, Chairman of Yakama Nation\n“Lummi is honored to stand in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux. Like the Standing Rock Sioux, Lummi’s waters, sacred burial sites, and treaty rights have been at risk. We stand with our fellow tribal nations to protect our sacred resources.” -Timothy Ballew II, Chairman of Lummi Indian Business Council\n“We are a placed-based society. We live where our ancestors are buried. Our culture, laws, and values are tied to all that surrounds us, the place where our children’s future will be for years to come. We cannot ruin where our ancestors are buried and where our children will call home, uproot ourselves and move to another place. We cannot keep taking for granted the clean water, the salmon and buffalo, the roots and berries, and all that makes up the places that our First People have inhabited since time immemorial. Our futures are bound together.” -Brian Cladoosby, Chairman of Swinomish Tribe\n“The Chalaat people from Hoh River, Washington, are honored to stand here with our brothers and sisters from all of Indian Country. We come in a good way. We are the voice for future generations of all of humanity. We are doing what is right and protecting Mother Earth, our water, and our natural resources, from the land to the sea. We will stand and fight the good fight. It is time for the federal government to honor the treaties.

72	How do predictive models for stroke outcomes perform in external validation, and what are the technological barriers to implementing such predictions in intensive care monitoring?	The predictive models showed excellent discrimination with ROC areas ranging from 0.75 to 0.89 in external validation, with 5 of 6 models showing reasonable calibration. However, there are translational barriers that impede making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care, which necessitates the development of platform-based approaches to integrate continuous monitoring signals with electronic medical record systems for enhanced clinical decision making.	['Predicting Outcome in Ischemic Stroke\nExternal Validation of Predictive Risk Models\nBackground— Six multivariable models predicting 3-month outcome of acute ischemic stroke have been developed and internally validated previously. The purpose of this study was to externally validate the previous models in an independent data set.\nSummary of Report— We predicted outcomes for 299 patients with ischemic stroke who received placebo in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke rt-PA trial. The model equations used 6 acute clinical variables and head CT infarct volume at 1 week as independent variables and 3-month National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Barthel Index, and Glasgow Outcome Scale as dependent variables. Previously developed model equations were used to forecast excellent and devastating outcome for subjects in the placebo tissue plasminogen activator data set. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was used to measure discrimination, and calibration charts were used to measure calibration. The validation data set patients were more severely ill (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and infarct volume) than the model development subjects. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curves demonstrated remarkably little degradation in the validation data set and ranged from 0.75 to 0.89. Calibration curves showed fair to good calibration.\nConclusions— Our models have demonstrated excellent discrimination and acceptable calibration in an external data set. Development and validation of improved models using variables that are all available acutely are necessary.\nAmultivariable model that could predict outcome after stroke would be useful in clinical trials to assess the balance of treatment groups and to predict expected outcomes of patients who are lost to follow-up. We developed and internally validated a series of predictive risk models for 229 ischemic stroke patients from the Randomized Trial of Tirilazad Mesylate in Patients with Acute Stroke (RANTTAS)1. However, the models have not been validated in an external data set. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of those predictive models in an independent data set.\nTwo hundred ninety-nine patients from the placebo group of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) rt-PA trial were used for the validation analysis.2 The NINDS rt-PA trial population has been described in detail previously.2 Briefly, this was an ischemic stroke population treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or placebo within 3 hours from symptom onset. Only the placebo group was used for this analysis because intravenous tPA is known to improve clinical outcome, and the predictive model being validated was designed to predict outcome without an intervention.\nThree hundred twelve patients were treated with placebo in the NINDS rt-PA trial. Thirteen patients were excluded from our analysis for missing variables: 6 were missing 7- to 10-day CT scan infarct volume, 5 were missing stroke history information, and 2 were missing diabetes history information. The remaining 299 were used for this analysis.\nBaseline clinical information including age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score,3 history of previous stroke, history of diabetes mellitus, and history of prestroke disability were collected acutely. Infarct volume and stroke subtype were collected at 7 to 10 days after stroke onset.\nThe NIHSS, Barthel Index (BI),4 and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS)5 were used as outcome measures 3 months after stroke symptom onset. Each was dichotomized into excellent outcome (NIHSS ≤1, BI ≥95, GOS =1) or devastating outcome (NIHSS ≥20 or death, BI <60 or death, GOS >2) as previously defined.1\nThe previously defined models were forecast to the study population using the previously defined weights. Model discrimination was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which was computed by a nonparametric method.6 An area under the ROC curve of 0.5 indicates no ability to discriminate and an area of 1.0 indicates perfect discrimination. We prespecified an acceptable area under the ROC as ≥0.8. Calibration was assessed using calibration curves.7 The perfect 45° line demonstrates ideal calibration. The closer the model calibration is to the ideal line, the better the calibration. Hosmer-Lemeshow tests were performed to assess whether the models differed significantly from perfect calibration.8\nThe clinical and imaging characteristics of the validation population are compared with those of the original population from the RANTTAS trial9 in Table 1. There were more blacks and fewer whites in the validation population. The validation population had substantially more severe strokes, as demonstrated by higher NIHSS scores and greater infarct volumes at 1 week, as well as worse outcomes when compared with the original data set.\nThe models’ ability to discriminate outcome, in both the original and validation data sets, is demonstrated in Table 2. In the original data set, 5 of the 6 models had excellent discrimination above the 0.8 level. The validation models demonstrate very little decline in area under the ROC curve in all 6 data sets and demonstrate excellent discrimination in 5 of the 6 models.\nModel calibration is demonstrated in the Figure. Five of the 6 models have calibration curves that are very similar to the line of identity. The excellent outcome as measured by the NIHSS model calibrated less well and predicted a greater probability of excellent outcome than was observed in the validation data set for most of the range of predicted probabilities. For example, in the calibration curve “Excellent NIH Outcome,” at a model prediction of 70% probability of excellent outcome (fourth point on the curve), only about 40% of patients were actually observed to have excellent outcome by the NIHSS. Hosmer-Lemeshow tests of the calibration accuracy indicate that 5 of the 6 models were detectably (P<0.05) less than perfect, with all of the models tending to predict better outcomes than were observed.\nThese 6 models have now been validated in an external data set. Five of the models have excellent discrimination (ROC area ≥0.8). The model for devastating outcome defined by the NIHSS (ROC area=0.75) likely discriminates less well due to the small number of devastating outcomes in the model development data set. Five of the 6 models appear to be reasonably well calibrated, as shown in the calibration curves. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test demonstrates that these are not perfectly calibrated but the calibration appears to be adequate.\nThe validation population clearly had more severe strokes as demonstrated by both the NIHSS and infarct volume. Although the model discrimination was affected little by this, the poorer calibrations in the 6 models compared with the original models may be related to this difference. The fact that the models had such good discrimination and adequate calibration in 5 of the 6 models, even in such a different population, supports the generalizability of these models.\nA predictive tool that would allow an accurate prediction of individual outcome at 3 months could be very useful in clinical research. The great heterogeneity among stroke patients may contribute to difficulty identifying treatment effects in clinical trials.10,11 Heterogeneity in a randomized clinical trial is mathematically expected to result in an underestimate of the treatment effect.11 A predictive model that could adjust for heterogeneity would allow a less biased estimate of the treatment effect and demonstrate a larger treatment effect in the same sized sample.\nThe small number of subjects and least frequent outcomes in both data sets limits how well the models can predict outcome. These models are also limited by the fact that only 5 of the 7 variables used in the prediction were collected acutely. Infarct volume and stroke subtype were collected at 1 week. Although a prediction of 3-month outcome is still valuable to the clinician at 1 week, this limits the use of these models in acute stroke clinical research. The dichotomized outcomes, though identifying the extreme outcomes (excellent outcome suggesting full or nearly full recovery; devastating outcome suggesting nursing home level disability or death), are not designed to predict the clinically relevant recovery levels in between. These extreme outcomes using the NIHSS, BI, and GOS are most useful in the clinical research realm in that they allow more reliable comparisons of standardized outcomes. These models, therefore, function as the proof of concept that predictive models can be developed and then internally and externally validated for the prediction of 3-month outcome. Future models must now be developed using variables that are all available in the acute setting.\nDr Johnston is supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (grant No. K23NS02168-01).\nThe NINDS rt-PA Stroke Trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke through contracts to the participating sites.

ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform;2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation. Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs.\nRecurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation. The present work is built upon our previously developed algorithm of detecting acute ICP elevation and an open software platform for hosting predictive algorithms to further develop and evaluate a real-time ICP elevation alerting system that will provide accurate alerts of impending ICP elevation. Rigorous human factor engineering principles and techniques will be adopted in developing this system and we will further leverage this real-time alerting system to investigate the principal physiological abnormalities that are associated with accurate ICP elevation.\n|Arroyo-Palacios, Jorge; Rudz, Maryna; Fidler, Richard et al.

73	what ingredients needed for sourdough bread	To make sourdough bread, you need: 1,000 grams (7 1/2 cups) milled whole-wheat flour, 850 grams (3 3/4 cups) filtered water, 20 grams (2 1/2 tablespoons) sea salt, and 200 grams (3/4 cup) sourdough starter.	['Any place where sourdough bread is made plays host to a lively and complex microbiome known as a sourdough starter.\nThis community of wild yeasts and bacteria—yes, sourdough also comes from a SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture Of Bacteria and Yeast)—is easy to capture and cultivate and requires nothing fancy in the way of kitchen gadgetry. A kitchen scale is helpful but not essential: a couple of one-quart containers with lids, filtered water, and basic flour are all that’s needed.\nWild yeast is too small to see but it’s everywhere and can be encouraged to thrive with a simple daily routine. Once established, a starter can be fed weekly or even kept happily, albeit sleepily, in the refrigerator for months.\nIgnore the romantic claims that a starter needs to be purchased or collected from a particular place. The story of the “heirloom starter”, one passed down for generations, is well loved but is, quite probably, a kitchen myth. According to several studies on the composition of sourdough starters, the kitchen environment has the most impact on the cultures present. In other words, for a starter to remain the same as when it started, it would need to remain in the same kitchen, prepped by the same person/people, with the same water and the same flour.\nMake it a habit\nYour ability to stick to a schedule is critical when beginning a sourdough starter and quite helpful when establishing a baking routine. I suggest that the feeding of the starter be linked to something you do every day anyway, like making coffee. A vigorous stirring to combine the ingredients and a moment to clean the utensils can all be accomplished while preparing one’s morning coffee.\nEstablish a place in your kitchen for the starter to occupy. This should be in a cooler spot, out of the direct sun; a cupboard corner or the back of a countertop are good choices. While the refrigerator is certainly an option, personally I only use the fridge when I’m not baking very much and want to slow the starter down.\nFor maximum vitality, flavor and vigor, keep the starter at ambient temperature. In the summer when temperatures rise, the starter will be very active and the amount of starter required to raise your loaves can be reduced. In the cooler months, the starter percentage can be increased. Establishing a good daily routine will reward you with a reliable kitchen companion that will raise your loaves and stamp them with your own signature terroir, the flavors of your particular environment.\nCultivate a small quantity of starter and build it up on the days when you plan to bake. On bake days the starter should be fed with a freshly milled, whole-grain flour in proportions to suit the number of loaves that will be produced. Fresh whole-grain flour will stimulate the starter into a lively state that will bring the desired results of well-developed crumb structure, a crisp crust, and a complex flavor.\n- A kitchen scale (not essential but recommended for better accuracy)\n- 2 containers (1-quart each) with lids\n- Mixing spoon\n- Dedicated storage spot for the starter\n- Organic or heirloom all-purpose flour (try Roan Mills heirloom flour)\n- Filtered water\nHow to capture wild yeast\nPut a 1-quart container on a scale. And set the weight to zero.\nPut 115 grams of flour and 115 grams of filtered water into the container and stir vigorously to combine, cover the container and place it in a designated spot in your kitchen or pantry.\nIf you don’t have a scale, use about 1 cup flour to ½ cup water. Adjust ratio to get starter the consistency of thick pancake batter.\nPut 115 grams (or just about a cup) of the young starter into a clean 1-quart container and add 115 grams of flour and 115 grams filtered water. Stir vigorously to combine, cover and return to its designated spot.\nRepeat day 2 and pay attention to any changes that may begin to develop. A sour smell and a few bubbles are signs that the starter is ripening.\nPlace half of the starter into the clean container with 115 grams of flour and 115 grams of filtered water, stir vigorously to combine, cover and return it to its designated spot.\nThe starter should be ripening nicely by now; notice the changes in texture and smell. It may be very bubbly or even frothy.\nTo test the ripeness, fill a glass with water and drop a spoonful of starter into the glass. If it floats for a few seconds before sinking then it is ready to use. If it sinks immediately, it needs more time; simply continue the steps above for a few more days.\nMaintaining the starter between bakes\nOnce the starter is ripe it needs to be maintained.\nThis means that you will toss 80% of it each morning* (or once a week if maintaining the started in the fridge) and replace that amount with equal parts water and flour.\nThe routine starts with scooping about a cup of starter into the clean quart container and adding 115 grams each of flour and water. Proceed as before, stirring the starter vigorously, covering and allowing it to rest on the counter. If using the slow maintenance, put the starter back in the fridge after it starts to grow.\n*The discarded starter can be used in pancakes and waffles or composted. It can also be dried and stored in a paper bag. A dried starter can be used to start a new sourdough starter.\nBaking sourdough bread\nOn bake day, start with a room-temperature starter.\nScoop about a cup of starter into a larger clean container and feed it with 115 grams your choice of whole-wheat, rye, spelt, einkorn, or all-purpose flour and 115 grams of filtered water. The whole-wheat flour will make the starter very lively; it should pass the float test before 6 hours have passed.\n- 1,000 grams (7 1/2 cups) milled whole-wheat flour\n- 850 grams (3 3/4 cups) filtered water\n- 20 grams (2 1/2 tablespoons) sea salt\n- 200 grams (3/4 cup) sourdough starter\n- Put the flour, water, and salt in a large bowl. Mix until combined and cover with a kitchen cloth. Leave this to rest while the starter ripens.\n- Once the starter passes the float test, usually after 5 or 6 hours, add to the well-hydrated dough.\n- Mix well, cover and allow the dough to rest for 20 minutes before stretching and folding the dough 3 or 4 times. Cover and repeat the stretch-and-fold sequence twice more at 20-minute intervals.\n- At this point, the bulk dough can be left to ripen for several hours at ambient temperature. As it develops it will rise, so the container needs to be large enough to accommodate the increase.\n- When you are ready to shape the dough, pull it from the container and divide the dough into 2 equal parts.\n- Shape the bread and place in a floured breadbasket (or improvise one with well-floured kitchen towels draped into a 1-quart bowl).\n- These can be slipped into a large plastic bag and held in the fridge for up to 24 hours before baking. Alternately, they can be left at ambient temperature for an hour or 2 and baked the same day. Preferences for the long, cold fermentation are valid. The acids from the sourdough starter break down the proteins in the wheat; this process makes the nutrients more available and the final bread more digestible. The flavor and keeping quality of the bread are also noticeably improved.\n- That said, a bake that starts and finishes on the same day still produces very delicious results.\nAfter the starter ripens, reserve about ½ cup, feed it the maintenance dose of flour, and set it aside for another day.\nA cast-iron double Dutch oven makes a great bread oven. Place it into a cold oven and preheat to 500oF.\nOnce at temperature, carefully remove the hot Dutch oven from the oven and place it on the stove. Remove the lid and plop the dough into it. Carefully score the top and cover the loaf with the hot lid. Quickly return to the oven.\nAfter 20 minutes, remove the lid and drop the temperature to 400oF. Continue baking for 35–40 minutes or more, until the desired color is achieved. Remove from Dutch oven and allow to cool on a wire rack.\nHow to slow down the sourdough starter\nSourdough starter can be frozen with good results. Freeze it after it’s been fed and ripened for several hours. To activate, thaw it and follow the regular maintenance schedule. It should bounce back to full vigor within a couple of days.\nThe process of maintaining the sourdough starter becomes intuitive over time. The look and smell of it will become familiar and working with it will become second nature. Stick with it even if the bread isn’t perfect initially. Eventually, the results will please you and bring joy to those who break bread with you.']	['<urn:uuid:2a9263f7-ae7a-4682-8b30-1bba7650c275>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	6	35	1512
74	secure quantum data transmission basics mechanism benefits	Quantum data transmission provides security guaranteed by the laws of physics. The process works by encoding information in quantum particles like photons, whose states cannot be measured without detection. In quantum key distribution (QKD), a one-time pad code is sent using quantum processes to encrypt messages sent over regular channels. A newer method called quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) uses entangled photons to transmit the actual message directly - if an eavesdropper intercepts the photons, their state changes reveal the breach before the sensitive data is sent. China has demonstrated this technology through fiber optics and via satellite, achieving perfectly correlated photon pairs over 1,120 kilometers. While current transmission rates are too low for widespread practical use, this represents a major advance toward unbreakable communications secured by quantum physics.	['In 2019, a team of Chinese technicians, engineers, and scientists sent pairs of photons from a single satellite called Micius to two ground stations in China separated by over 1,120 kilometers. The photons were prepared in such a way that they carried information that remained perfectly correlated in spite of the distance between them. In addition, the two receiving stations in China were able to ensure that the two receivers could not be disrupted or deceived by any third party. The experiment demonstrated the ability to share secret cryptographic keys between the two locations in China, with no known means for a third party to covertly observe or copy them. Although the rate of the key exchange was too low for practical use, the achievement represented a step toward secret communications guaranteed by the laws of physics.\nSeveral countries have spent decades trying to find ways of moving data that are both cost-effective and secure by investing in quantum communication technology. The surge in China’s work in the field dates to 2013, when the release of classified information by Edward Snowden detailing U.S. intelligence capabilities caused deep concern in Beijing. “This incident has been so fundamental to Chinese motivations that Snowden has been characterized as one of two individuals with a primary role in the scientific ‘drama’ of China’s quantum advances, along with Pan Jianwei, the father of Chinese quantum information science,” the researchers Elsa Kania and John Costello concluded in a 2017 report.\nThe national-security implications of China’s interest in space-based quantum communications cuts several ways. The development of impenetrably secure communications links in China would be a loss for American intelligence organizations. On the other hand, China’s intensive efforts in using space for secure quantum-based communications may lead that nation to consider international agreements governing space activities as in their national interest. This strategic interest might be leveraged as part of a future U.S.-China agreement in managing competition in space. There are ample opportunities for collaboration in this field among the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, and other democratic allies. China’s leading position in quantum data security suggests that U.S.-China collaboration—at least on basic science—would be a net benefit for the United States in understanding the state of the art.\nQuantum computing and secure communications\nData transmitted between two parties over the internet is subject to unwanted interception. The value of the internet depends on the fact that data sent between the sender and receiver can be securely encrypted. Encryption methods are based on exchanging secret keys used to encode data in a way that reveals minimal information to someone lacking the key. Keys can be as simple as a long random string of 0’s and 1’s. Common methods for sharing secret keys over the insecure internet are based on numerical computations that are easy to make in one direction but very difficult to make in the reverse direction—on our current computers. For example, multiplication of two prime numbers is easy, but given a very large integer, determining which primes were multiplied together to yield that integer is a difficult problem, and it gets rapidly more difficult the larger the integer. This is true even on today’s most powerful conventional computers.\nFundamentally new types of computing architectures based on interactions of quantum systems were first proposed in the 1980s. Within a few years, Peter Shor and other theorists proved that quantum computer algorithms, running on sufficiently large quantum computers, could in principle solve the extremely time-consuming numerical problems like factoring large integers much more quickly than a classical computer algorithm could.\nIn short, working quantum computing systems threaten to make useless current methods of encryption that provide the basis of internet commerce and digital communication. Though such systems are generally thought to be unachievable before 2030, when such quantum computers are available, decrypting some communications streams may become feasible if nothing is done to protect those streams. What’s more, any encrypted data that has been intercepted and stored will be vulnerable to decryption. That means any country that attains a quantum computing system of sufficient power in the future will be able to decrypt stored data from the current era that would otherwise remain impossible to decode. And the data at risk goes beyond national-security information to include genomic, medical, and financial data.\nThese concerns have spurred efforts in the United States to develop new encryption algorithms that are more resistant to known quantum computing-based decryption methods. These post-quantum cryptography (PQC) methods are being designed and evaluated to be run on current classical computers. The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) is leading an evaluation of PQC alternatives and has recently published its latest list of top contenders.\nWhat is perfect security?\nIn discussions of cryptography, the sender and receiver of a message are usually referred to as Alice and Bob, respectively. They are assumed to have a public channel and an encrypted channel over which to send data. Proofs of security assume that an adversarial eavesdropper, called Eve, has access to both channels, as well as powerful computers at her disposal.\nIf Alice wants to transmit a message to Bob at some future time over a network on which Eve lurks, Bob can meet at Alice’s totally secure office. There they create two identical copies of a long string of completely random binary digits, called a key, and securely package one copy of the random key so that Bob can take it to his secure office. When Alice wants to send a message to Bob over the compromised channel, Alice converts her message to a string of bits using an agreed upon encoding scheme that does not need to be secret. She then chooses the first segment of the random key the same length as the binary form of her message, aligns the key bits with the message bits so that they are paired, and computes a bitwise exclusive “or” operation (XOR). A bitwise XOR operation of the two bits is a simple function that outputs a 0 if both inputs are 0, a 1 if one bit is 0 and the other is 1, and the “exclusive” part means that the output is 0 if both inputs are 1. The result is an encrypted string of bits that is equally likely to be any message. Alice sends this string of bits to Bob. Bob XORs the encrypted message with his copy of the key, and then he can convert the result back to text using the public encoding. Then they both discard the random key.\nThe procedure above provides no new information to Eve, even if she captures the entire string of encrypted bits. However, the requirements of this ideal scheme are immense: The random string of bits in the key must be truly random, a new key must be generated for each message since it is discarded after one use, the key must be as long as the message, and the key must be shared in perfect secrecy. This makes data exchange very inefficient. The requirement for perfect randomness cannot be met using readily-available computer random number generators: Only physical systems such as radioactive decay, or other quantum systems can generate truly random numbers. Encryption methods in use today make compromises to the idealized algorithm above in order to trade perfect security for efficiency.\nQuantum key distribution may offer secrecy with fewer such compromises. Quantum key distribution methods transmit random keys by encoding these strings of 0’s and 1’s into sequences of photons whose quantum states obey the rules of quantum mechanics. For single photons, these rules allow for photons to exist in a combination of two quantum states until they are detected by a device that can measure the states. Once detected by a particular kind of device, the photon will take on a definite state that is in part determined by the device itself. This close relationship between the photon and the measurement device is at the heart of QKD methods. Other QKD methods use pairs of photons which are generated to have perfect correlation between their states, regardless of their separate travel paths. Common to all QKD methods is the fact that an eavesdropper that detects the photons will either gain no information about the keys, or will signal to Alice and Bob that they have successfully intercepted the data. This allows Alice and Bob to make adjustments in order to complete the key exchange. In any case, the eavesdropper can never copy the quantum information. In classical information exchange over the internet, an eavesdropper can detect, copy, retransmit the 0’s and 1’s without changing how this information is later observed by Alice and Bob, thereby remaining invisible.\nThe ability to replicate classical digital data without error is a key enabler of the current internet, as it allows the same information to travel to multiple places for use. Since the quantum states of photons cannot be copied, this creates special challenges for quantum networking. However, by compromising on the perfect security of quantum information exchange at a few, well-trusted sites, quantum networks have been built.\nThe guaranteed secrecy of QKD systems threatens to make it impossible to spy on communication channels use by adversary countries. Whether these are channels that are already tapped, or ones that would be useful to tap in the future, improvements in communication security can potentially cut off information that might be useful in statecraft or to gain advantage in a military crisis.\nThis gives rise to two important reasons for pursuing QKD research. First, by understanding the weaknesses of QKD devices, one can guard against attacks on the integrity or reliability of one’s own QKD system. Second, if one can deny an adversary the secure use of QKD, it may drive that adversary to use less secure communications means, which may then be exploited. Thus, the development of QKD systems between geopolitical rivals will take on a measure-countermeasure character, in much the same way as military communications and sensing measures must overcome sophisticated electronic warfare countermeasures.\nNational efforts at QKD and QKD networks\nThe United States, Japan, Canada, Singapore, and Europe initially led the efforts in quantum key distribution. Initial research involved point-to-point QKD, but networks of quantum-secured information exchange is the real goal of these efforts. The first QKD network was established in Boston by DARPA in 2003 and, by 2004, ran between Harvard University, Boston University, and the offices of the research firm Bolt, Beranek, and Newman. Between 2008 and 2009, the European FP6 project integrated several QKD systems into one QKD backbone in Vienna. In 2010, researchers in Tokyo demonstrated a QKD network with encryption for video.\nToday, China has taken the lead in quantum key distribution: The largest demonstrated network is one that began operating in 2017 in China within the cities of Beijing, Jinan, Hefei, and Shanghai with a 1,200 mile quantum backbone network connecting them. In the United States, meanwhile, the U.S. firm Battelle, together with the Swiss company ID Quantique, is constructing a 400 mile link between Columbus, Ohio, and Washington, D.C..\nQKD research and development continues today, as part of broader developments in quantum technologies in Canada, the European Union, South Korea, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Russia, China and other countries. Over the past 20 years, emphasis within the overall field of quantum technology has shifted, with the United States and other Western countries tending to focus on quantum computing and China putting greater emphasis on QKD. Though there are efforts underway in China to build advanced quantum computers, this difference of emphasis reflects the deep concern about internet security at the highest levels of Chinese leadership, while in the United States, quantum computing advances have been driven by large companies. As China, the United States, and other countries build a larger workforce with the experience in designing and building quantum information systems, it may be that all countries converge to a more broad-based quantum information technology base.\nCompanies based in China dominate applications for patents in quantum cryptography in the most recent period when data is available, from 2012 to 2016. Companies based in the United States and Japan dominated quantum cryptography patent applications between 2002 and 2010, but have since slowed considerably. In the field of quantum computing on the other hand, the United States, Japan, and Canada have applied for the great majority of patents from the period 2001 to 2016 and far more than China.\nAs commercial QKD component offerings grow, benefits will likely accrue to companies that can innovate while meeting or establishing industry standards. South Korea Telecom and ID Quantique have worked through the International Telecommunications Union to establish standards for quantum communications tools. The competition to help set standards is perhaps as consequential in this field as is any particular technological development. Companies that can adapt to voluntary international standards for technical devices and data can establish a market advantage as other companies and countries around the world begin to integrate that technology into their own infrastructure. Industries cooperate in setting standards by consensus, and to the extent that Chinese companies can bring real expertise and experience in quantum technology to international standards organizations, they will have a better chance that their technical approaches will be integrated into the standards and that they will be competitive in the long run.\nFinally, it is always useful to keep in mind throughout technical discussions of data security, that the weakest points in technological systems is often humans. Greed, fear, carelessness, lack of training or darker motives can open the most technically secure systems to risks. The methods of social engineering—manipulating the perceptions and behaviors of human users—that are core to cyberattack methods transfer directly to future quantum secure communications. Proper training and monitoring for insider threats will remain a key element of information security, regardless of any particular technology implementation.\nThe global quantum race\nThe need for varying levels of data security, up to and including near-perfect security, is driving countries around the world to invest in improvements in encryption based on both mathematics and on quantum physics. With quantum computers now in active production around the world, the risk to current internet encryption may arise a decade from now. This also raises immediate concerns about the long-term security of sensitive data that is already being intercepted. One possible future for information security is one that involves a hybrid of post-quantum cryptography based on mathematics and QKD based on physics, with the former providing security for authentication required over classical data channels.\nAs the United States increases its reliance on the secure flow of data, QKD will probably play a significant role. Therefore, it is important for the United States to develop a mix of technical infrastructures, such as satellites and fiber links. It also critical to understand the vulnerabilities of those QKD links. In cryptography, open analysis of methods has always led to better security, and the same is likely to be true for QKD. The United States would be best served through collaboration on quantum information among the national governments, business, and academic groups within the United States and between the US, Europe, South Korea, Australia, Japan, and other countries. This will minimize strategic surprise by maximizing the breadth and depth of U.S. understanding of quantum information science and engineering.\nChina has a demonstrated lead in demonstrations of several specific QKD technology areas, including space-based quantum key distribution using entangled photons launched from space. Since this method has some distinct advantages for very long-range secure information, China could become increasingly dependent on space-based QKD for securing data over long distances. This could provide the basis for a common interest in preserving the stability of satellite-based communications between the United States, China and other countries that are increasingly dependent on space.\nThe United States should also continue to engage in technical exchange and collaboration with China in the area of quantum information science for several reasons. First, China has a demonstrated lead in several QKD technology areas, including space-based QKD using entangled photons and large terrestrial quantum networks. The United States is likely to learn something about the engineering issues if not the physics. The second reason for collaboration has to do with the nature of QKD itself: It is provably secure. Unlike the codebreaking of WWII, which was so important to the Allies, certain QKD systems are impervious to eavesdropping. Understanding of the technology does not create a security vulnerability for either side. The final reason for collaboration is to maintain expert exchange between the two countries in the critical nexus of information technology, cybersecurity, and the uses of space. China could become increasingly dependent on space-based QKD for securing data over long distances. The United States has long been dependent on space for collecting and moving data. This convergence of needs could provide the basis for future agreements on activities in space that are mutually beneficial, such as limitations on disruptions of satellite communication systems.\nTom Stefanick is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution.', 'Back in the 1980s, quantum physicists discovered that the strange rules of quantum mechanics allowed information to be sent from one part of the universe to another with complete privacy. This so-called “quantum cryptography” would be perfect, they said, because the security of the message would be guaranteed by the laws of physics themselves.\nWithin a few years, researchers demonstrated the technique in the lab, and today quantum cryptography is becoming commercially viable thanks to companies such as ID Quantique in Geneva, Switzerland.\nBut the entire mechanism is a little counterintuitive. The private message is not sent using quantum mechanics at all. Instead, physicists use quantum processes to send a code called a one-time pad that is used to encrypt the original message. The encrypted message is then sent over an ordinary telecommunications channel and decoded in the usual way. The technique is called quantum key distribution.\nComputer scientists know that a message encoded using a one-time pad cannot be broken. So the security comes from the ability to send the one-time pad with perfect privacy, which is what this approach guarantees.\nAnd that raises an interesting question. If it’s possible to send the one-time pad securely using quantum mechanics, why not just send the original message that way?\nToday, Wei Zhang at Tsinghua University in Beijing and a few pals say they have done just this. The new process is called quantum secure direct communication, and the Chinese team have used it through 500 meters of fiber-optic cable for the first time.\nThe reason physicists have relied on one-time pads in the past is simple. At issue is whether a message has been overheard. Physicists can check this because quantum particles cannot be measured without destroying the information they contain.\nSo when photons are transmitted, if they are arrive in the same state they were sent in, an eavesdropper cannot have extracted the information they contain. But if they arrive in a different state, that is clear evidence that the information has leaked into the environment and the message is not secure.\n(In practice, physicists can be sure that a message is secure as long as this leakage is below some critical threshold.)\nThe problem is that the leakage becomes apparent only after it has occurred. So an eavesdropper would already have the information by the time physicists found out about the ruse.\nThat’s why they use this process to send a one-time pad, a set of random numbers that can be used to encrypt a message. If the one-time pad is overheard, physicists simply disregard it and send another, until they can be sure that the process was completely private.\nBut physicists would dearly love to do away with the one-time pad if they could find a way to ensure the secrecy of a message before it is sent. And some years ago, theorists worked out a way to do this.\nThe method exploits the quantum phenomenon of entanglement. This occurs when quantum particles are so closely linked that they share the same existence—for example, when they are both created at the same time and place.\nWhen this happens, the particles remain linked, even when they are separated by vast distances. And a measurement on one particle immediately influences the state of the other.\nSo the trick is to create a set of entangled particles, such as photons, and encode information in their polarization state. So vertical polarization could represent a 1 and horizontal polarization a 0, for instance.\nThe sender, Alice, keeps one half of each pair and sends the others to Bob, who then has a set of photons that are entangled with Alice’s photons.\nBob separates his photons randomly into two groups. He measures the polarizations of one set and sends the results back to Alice. She then checks whether the states have changed during transmission—in other words, whether Eve has been listening in.\nIf not, then Alice and Bob know Eve cannot have seen the other photons either, because they have been separated at random. And that means Alice and Bob can use the remaining photons to transmit data using the normal process of quantum communication, which is perfectly private.\nAnd that’s exactly what Zhang and co have done. One reason the experiment is difficult is that the photons have to be stored while this checking process is ongoing. Zhang and co do this by sending the photons around a two-kilometer loop of optical fiber and carrying out the checks as quickly as possible. The longer it takes, the more likely the photons are to be absorbed or scattered by the optical fiber.\nThe results clearly show the potential of the technique. “This fibre based QSDC system has the potential to realize a transmission rate close to security key rates of current commercial quantum key distribution systems,” say Zhang and co. “The advantage [is] that the QSDC system could transmit not only secure keys but also the information directly.”\nOf course, various improvements are needed to make this kind of system commercially viable. But the work is an important stepping stone toward entirely quantum-based secure communication. Banks, governments, and military agencies will be watching eagerly.\nRef: arxiv.org/abs/1710.07951 : Experimental Long-Distance Quantum Secure Direct Communication']	['<urn:uuid:d0983495-8a6b-4fe3-8a25-e09a08c097fb>', '<urn:uuid:8aba708a-3afb-417b-a0ef-4d7c9a825161>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	7	129	3709
75	toxic chemicals ingredients look for avoid household cleaners	Several dangerous chemicals to avoid in household cleaners include: phthalates (found in soaps and fragranced products), perchloroethylene (in dry-cleaning products), quaternary ammonium compounds or 'Quats' (in floor cleaners and fabric softeners), 2-butoxythanol (in multipurpose cleaners), ammonium hydroxide (in glass and oven cleaners), chlorine (in bleach and toilet cleaners), coal tar dyes, nonylphenol ethoxylates (in stain removers and detergents), and sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate (in deodorizers and disinfectants). These chemicals can cause various health issues including hormone disruption, nervous system damage, respiratory problems, and cancer.	['You love keeping your place clean and healthy. But if you’ve ever looked at the ingredient list of conventional household cleaners, you’ll know that, even though they’ve got the “cleaning” part down, the same can’t be said for the “healthy” part.\nWhen we examined what’s in conventional household cleaners, we were shocked by what we found. (Spoiler alert: they’re really toxic).\nAnd today we’re sharing these findings with you.\nWe’ve put together a list of the most dangerous chemicals in household cleaners. Use this post to sort through your household cleaning products and stop exposing yourself (and your family) to harmful substances.\nWe’ve also researched some natural alternatives to household cleaning products, all vetted by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) to equip you with some safe home cleaning product options that you can switch to.\nIf natural DIY cleaning recipes are more your style, we’ll also tell you about ingredients that have even amazed researchers when they tested their cleaning power.\nWithout further ado, here are the most toxic ingredients in your household cleaners.\nHarmful chemicals in household cleaners\nPhthalates are nasty because they disrupt your endocrine system – meaning your hormones, which are important for the proper functioning of several body systems, especially the reproductive system.\nThey accumulate in your body over time. Your body acquires them both through contact with your skin and inhalation (or ingestion).\nPhthalates commonly lurk in soaps of all kinds (including shampoos, hand soaps, body washes, and dish soap), hair sprays, anything containing artificial fragrance (including household cleaners and baby wipes), and even toilet paper.\nCheck the ingredient list of your household cleaning products to make sure they do not contain phthalates. According to the National Academies Press, these are the most commonly found phthalates:\n- DMP – Dimethyl phthalate\n- DEP – Diethyl phthalate\n- DBP – Dibutyl phthalate\n- DIBP – Diisobutyl Phthalate\n- BBP – Benzylbutylphthalate\n- DEHP – Diethylhexyl phthalate or DOP – dioctyl phthalate\n- DINP – Diisononyl phthalate\nUnfortunately, there are far more than can be listed here. Suffice it to say: if there’s an ingredient that ends with the word “phthalate”, or that is listed as an acronym that ends in “P”, steer clear of it.\n2. Perchloroethylene (PERC) or Tetrachloroethylene\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has classified perchloroethylene as a potential human carcinogen.\nIt also wreaks havoc on your nervous system. Symptoms of exposure include neurological effects, behavioral changes, impairment of coordination, sleepiness, dizziness, and loss of consciousness. (Yikes!)\nIt can also irritate your respiratory tract and cause eye and kidney problems. This is mega-bad stuff, folks.\nPerchloroethylene is most commonly found in dry-cleaning products. That’s why it’s super important to only go to a dry-cleaner that refrains from using perchloroethylene.\nShould you encounter household cleaning products that include perchloroethylene on the ingredient list, it’s important to avoid inhalation and contact with the skin.\n3. Quarternary ammonium compounds, or “Quats”\nThese chemicals can be found in products like floor cleaners, fabric softeners, oven cleaners, hard-water-stain removers, toilet cleaners, stove top cleaners, all-purpose household cleaners, and in chemically-based antibacterial products.\nLike the recently-banned triclosan, Quats promote the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. According to the EWG’s Healthy Guide to Cleaning, Quats should not be inhaled or come into contact with skin.\nThe best way to avoid these ingredients is to avoid using chemical disinfectants and store-bought fabric softener. (Vinegar is a great alternative on both counts).\nIf that’s not your style, we have created a list of common Quats so you can check the ingredients of your products:\n- Babassuamidopropalkonium chloride\n- Behentrimonium chloride\n- Behentrimoniu methosulfate\n- Benzalkonium chloride\n- Cetalkonium chloride\n- Grapefruit seed extract (…I know! But this stuff is actually\nheavily processed with intense chemicals, hence the Quats.)\nGuar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride\n- Methylbenzethonium chloride\n- Stearalkonium chloride\n- Vegetable oil quaternary\nThis is what gives the household cleaner products in your cabinet—multipurpose cleaners, kitchen cleaners, bathroom cleaners, and window cleaners—their sweet smell.\nAccording to the EPA, exposure to 2-butoxythanol enters your body through skin contact, inhalation, and/or ingestion. Once inside, it can damage your red blood cells and liver, depress your central nervous system, and cause cancer.\nProducts that contain 2-butoxythanol can be dangerous to your health, and should be avoided.\nAlthough many people believe they will be fine as long as they use the product in a well-ventilated room, our two cents is: why be so cavalier with your health? After all, if it’s a scented product and you can smell it, then you’re breathing it in.\nWe recommend using safer alternatives like water, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, baking soda, and hydrogen peroxide (available at any drugstore).\n5. Ammonium hydroxide\nAmmonium hydroxide is found in glass cleaners and polishing agents for sinks and bathroom fixtures, as well as oven cleaners, drain openers, toilet cleaners, stove top cleaners, and all-purpose household cleaners.\nThis substance can be dangerous if inhaled, leading to asthma and chronic bronchitis.\nAccording to the New York State Department of Health, exposure to this chemical even at low concentrations leads to skin or eye irritation, and even blindness. Higher concentrations cause severe injury and burns.\nAmmonia that comes into contact with products containing chlorine (including bleach) gives off fatal fumes.\nThis is why we recommend staying away from products that include ammonia.\n6. Chlorine (sodium hypochlorite)\nIf you use bleach, toilet bowl cleaners, laundry whiteners, scouring powders, oven cleaners, drain openers, hard water stain removers, stove top cleaners, household cleaners, or mildew removers, you may be exposing yourself to chlorine.\nAccording to The New York State Department of Health, chlorine can lead to airway irritation, wheezing, difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough, chest tightness, eye irritation, and skin irritation (learn more about things you should never put on your skin).\nAs we saw, chlorine produces a poisonous (potentially fatal) gas when it comes into contact with ammonia. This combination can happen even if you are not mixing bleach with other cleaning products. For example, urine naturally contains ammonia. Therefore, using chlorine to clean a diaper pail, kitty litter box, or urine mess can inadvertently release poison gas.\nChlorine also gives off poisonous gas when it comes into contact with anything acidic–which includes vinegar, lemon juice, window cleaners, drain cleaners, and other types of cleaning products.\nChlorine bleaches are harmful in other ways besides creating poison gas. They kill germs in a heavy-handed way that helps to create drug-resistant “superbugs”.\nChlorine is also highly corrosive, and can damage the surfaces and materials in your home. Chlorine bleach should never be used on wood, paper, stone (including stone countertops), tile, grout, or fabric, because it corrodes these materials. It also shouldn’t be used on anything metal.\n7. Coal tar dyes (aniline)\nThe National Toxicology Program and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have found coal tar to be carcinogenic. Also, the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics warns of exposing your skin to coal tar.\nRemarkably, many household cleaning products include coal tar dyes even though they serve no purpose in the cleaning function!\nTo spot coal tar dyes, look out for these ingredients on cleaning product labels:\n- Coal tar solution\n- Coal tar solution\n- Coal tar solution USP\n- Crude coal tar\n- KC 261\n- Picis carbonis\n- High solvent naphtha\n- Naphtha distillate\n- Benzin B70\n- Petroleum benzine\n8. Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs)\nA study published in the Oxford Journal of Toxicological Sciences has shown that nonylphenol ethoxylates affect your endocrine (hormone) system and harm male reproductive capabilities.\nNonylphenol ethoxylates are found in numerous cleaning products, including stain removers, toilet bowl cleaners, all-purpose cleaners, air fresheners, degreasers, liquid laundry detergents, and car wash products.\nOur suggestion: avoid the NPEs. Instead, use genuinely natural cleaning products made from good ingredients.\nHere’s a list of Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) to look out for on your household cleaning products:\n- 2-(p-Nonylphenoxy) ethanol\n- 2-(2-(p-Nonylphenoxy)ethoxy) ethanol\n- p-Nonylphenol polyethylene glycol ether\n- Nonylphenol hepta(oxyethylene)ethanol\n- Nonylphenol nona(oxyethylene)ethanol\n- Onylphenoxy ethanol\n- Oxirane, methyl-, polymer with oxirane, mono(nonylphenyl) ether\n- 2-(2-(2-(2-(p-Nonylphenoxy)ethoxy) ethoxy)ethoxy) ethanol\n- Nonylphenol polyethylene glycol ether\n- Ethanol, 2-[2-(nonylphenoxy)ethoxy]-\n- Nonylphenol ethoxylate\n- Poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), alpha-(nonylphenyl)-omega- hydroxy-, phosphate\n- Nonylphenol ethoxylate\n- Ammonium salt of sulphated nonylphenol ethoxylate\n- Poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), alpha(isononylphenyl) omega-hydroxy\n9. Sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate\nThis ingredient has been found to seriously irritate the respiratory system and eyes. Inhaling its fumes or dust causes respiratory damage.\nHands should be washed upon contact, as sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate can also severely irritate the skin.\nThis ingredient is commonly found in deodorizers, surface cleaners, toilet bowl cleaners, and disinfectants.\nNow that you know some of the worst common ingredients in cleaning products, and no longer want to use them, how do you get rid of them?\nHow to safely dispose of products containing these ingredients\nHere are a few tips to keep in mind in order to do this the right way.\nWhat NOT to do:\n- Do NOT pour these products down the drain (as this will contaminate the environment and your local water supply)\n- Do NOT toss them in the garbage (as the container will eventually leak, causing the toxins inside to leach into the ground and groundwater).\nWhat to do:\n- Drop them off at your local collection point for toxic household products. Most local governments offer at least one “hazardous waste” collection day per year; if you live in a big city, your local collection point might be open several days a week. A quick web search will reveal what’s available in your area.\n- Talk to members of your household about the dangers of these products in order to prevent them from reappearing in your cupboards.\n- Choose safer alternatives. Water, club soda, hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, baking soda, non-chemically-based dish soap, and good old-fashioned elbow grease are wonderfully versatile cleaning agents. When you are armed with knowledge about the clever uses of each, no household grime will stand a chance.\nReady to learn more?\nDIY natural household cleaners for cleaning your home\nIf you want to stop using conventional household cleaners, the good news is that there are many natural alternatives available to you that work well, especially for removing hard water stains.\nVinegar is one of them.\nA study published in Environmental Health showed that vinegar can be used as a household cleaner. Tests have shown that it kills 98.6% of common bacteria found in households. Vinegar’s acidity also helps it to dissolve dirt and grime.\nIt’s a simple, all-natural substitute to conventional cleaners and well-suited for cleaning windows, blinds, kitchen appliances, bathtubs, shower floors, sinks, stove tops, and many other areas in your home. (Just don’t use vinegar on marble or granite countertops, because the acidity can etch the stone). Lemon juice substitutes well for vinegar.\nAnother ingredient that makes for a great DIY household cleaner is baking soda. Sprinkling some baking soda onto a moist cloth is a great for cleaning surfaces like kitchen counters, sinks, tiles and other areas.\nWhat if you don’t like the smell of vinegar, and are looking for a stronger cleaner than baking soda? Then you can choose from a number of carefully-formulated natural cleaning products.\nThere’s one important caveat though. You need to ensure that each product you buy is truly safe for your health, and isn’t just a marketing hoax.\nIn the next section we’re going to walk you through what to look out for when choosing a truly natural household cleaner.\nNatural alternatives to conventional cleaning products\nThere are some amazing natural cleaners available that facilitate your move away from toxic household cleaners to healthy, natural alternatives.\nBut don’t take a product’s packaging at face value. As consumers have grown more health-conscious, manufacturers have gotten increasingly clever at leading us to believe that their products are “green,” even when they’re not.\nAn independent study by The Sins of Greenwashing found that only 4.5% of products that claim to be healthy and environmentally friendly actually live up to their promise.\nThe most common sins that manufacturers commit include:\n- Cherry-picking certain positive attributes without mentioning a product’s weightier harms (e.g., organic cigarettes; sugary cereal fortified with iron; a cleaning product that contains essential oils alongside really harmful ingredients.)\n- Making vague promises, or not providing any proof for claims (e.g., “MSM is known as the ‘beauty mineral’.”)\n- Designing product labels in “earthy” tones, or using retro / nostalgic / childlike graphic design to imply that a product is wholesome.\n- Making meaningless “green” claims (e.g., advertising a product as “CFC-free” even though CFC is a universally-banned substance.)\n- Implying that a harmful ingredient is safe by offering irrelevant information about it (e.g. “laureth-7 (plant-derived cleaning ingredient)”).\n- Making outright false statements about a product’s environmental impact.\nThe surest way to protect yourself from harmful ingredients –and from marketers’ greenwashing attempts– is to read a product’s full ingredient list.\nThe list of dangerous chemicals in household cleaners that we presented in this post can help you to a certain extent to spot dangerous ingredients and identify greenwashers.\nAt the same time, chances are you will quickly run into ingredients on product labels that you do not recognize. When that happens, ignore anything the manufacturer may say on the label or website (e.g. “plant-derived”) to attempt to explain the ingredient away. Instead, look up the ingredient or product in the EWG database.\nThe EWG database is a powerful tool that helps you to see through a company’s marketing communications and spot ingredients that can harm your health.\nBut in case you don’t have time for that, we created a list of common cleaning products that got excellent scores for health and sustainability from the EWG:\nTheir natural laundry soap gets your clothes clean, makes them smell great, and all of this without any (and we mean any) harsh or toxic substances.\nHere’s their ingredient list:\nWater, Decyl glucoside, Sodium oleate, Glycerin, Caprylyl glucoside, Lauryl glucoside, Sodium chloride, Sodium gluconate, Carboxymethyl cellulose, Alpha-amylase, Protease, Lipase, Citrus Limon (Jade lemon) peel oil, Citrus aurantium bergamia (Bergamot) peel oil (Furocoumarin-free), Syzygium aromaticum (Clove) bud oil, Citrus limon (Lemon) peel oil, Cinnamomum zeylanicum (Cinnamon) bark oil, Eucalyptus radiata oil, Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary) leaf oil.\nWe checked each ingredient individually to ensure the formula is safe, and we were very pleased with the result. This is a truly natural product that we’re happy to recommend. You can check for yourself in the EWG database to see if you agree and then read what other customer had to say about this amazing product.\nThis next cleaner easily removes food residue on your countertop and dinner table. It works great in your bathroom, even electronic gadgets, hardwood floors, granite, glass, metal, painted surfaces, plastic, porcelain, stainless steel, and any other solid surface.\nAnd all of this without using any harsh and toxic ingredients.\nThe ingredients of this all-purpose cleaner are: lavender oil, grapefruit oil, coco-glucoside, lauryl glucoside, ethanol, and water.\nThe EWG gave this product an “A” rating, and you can check out how the individual ingredients were rated in the EWG Guide to Healthy Cleaning database.\nHaving a natural all-purpose cleaner in your household can be very handy, especially since there’s no natural alternative for some types of special cleaning products.\nThis is one example where a natural all-purpose cleaner comes in handy and if you happen to have a glass or ceramic stovetop, and want a simple, non-toxic solution, then a stove-top scraper can serve you in addition.\nDue to the especially harsh toxins in conventional toilet bowl cleaners, you should consider using a natural alternative to protect yourself and your family.\nWe found a toilet bowl cleaner that was formulated without ingredients that compromise your health. You can read the reviews here:\nNot all Seventh Generation products are of equally high quality. However, we are happy to recommend Seventh Generation’s Toilet Bowl Natural Cleaner, Emerald Cypress & Fir because the formulation is so non-toxic that the EWG gave it an “A” rating.\nDish soap is another household cleaner product that contains ingredients that are more harmful than most people would expect.\nConventional dish soaps often contain ingredients like:\n- Benzisothiazolinone (leads to skin irritation or damaged skin)\n- Dipropylene glycol (causes cancer, damages DNA, irritates or damages skin, damages vision, affects respiratory, digestive, nervous, endocrine, and reproductive systems.\n- Fragrance (unspecified ingredient used to hide a large number of toxic chemicals)\n- Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (affects your digestive system)\n- Methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone (irritates and sensitizes skin, causes allergic contact dermatitis)\n- Polysorbate-20 (damages DNA, causes cancer, developmental, endocrine, and reproductive problems, affects respiratory, nervous, and digestive systems, irritates or damages skin, and damages vision)\n- Sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate (damages DNA, affects many body systems including respiratory, endocrine, reproductive, digestive, and nervous systems, and causes cancer)\nYour dishes are what you eat from. Your (moist) food spends time on the dishes, and picks up any chemical residue lingering on it– which is why the chemicals in your dish soap matter more than any other household cleaning product in your house.\nHere’s an all-natural dish soap we’re excited to recommend. It’s made from just six easy-to-understand ingredients:\n- Distilled water\n- Vegetable glycerin\n- Coconut oil\n- Castor oil\n- Lavender essential oil\nNow that you’ve learned which ingredients in household cleaners to avoid, find out how to detox your body naturally in 8 sure-fire steps.\nAnd if you wanna read more about how to keep your home sparkling clean, here’s a list of the top 100 house cleaning and housekeeping blogs.\nHey there reader!

76	as structural engineer need depth retaining wall system concrete blocks hold back hillside soil	The depth of a Retaining Wall System using concrete blocks typically ranges from six to twelve inches deep. The specific depth depends on how much land you are trying to retain. The system uses blocks of various sizes to suit different needs and is designed to hold back soil and prevent erosion on hillsides.	['Retaining Walls are used for retaining a hillside or mountainside hillside, to hold back the erosion of the soil. They come in various materials like stone and concrete. Retaining Walls are made to resist pressure and act as a pressure point against the erosion of the soil. The retaining wall is constructed by piling up bricks, stones, or even concrete and placing them into place. Retaining Walls are also known as Slabs.\nRetaining Walls are used to retain a flat hillside where you would like the soil to stay for a long period of time. This is to retain the slopes and keep them from being eroded away. Retaining walls are usually quite rigid and they are placed on top of the soil so that it is retained at various levels on both sides. There are different ways in which the Retaining Walls is built.\nThe basic material that is used for constructing Retaining Walls is either concrete or rock. The size of the Retaining Wall System is dependent on how much land you are trying to retain. It can range from six to twelve inches deep depending on the size of the Retaining Wall System. The blocks used for the system come in various sizes, to suit the varying needs of the people who need them.\nThe concrete block or rock can be slotted into slots cut in the earth by the builders. The slots can accommodate as many as eight to ten bricks. When the slots are filled up, then this is known to be a layer. A layer two or three layers deeper can hold back the sediment and waste material that form on the soil. This is called a layer of retained dirt or a base soil. Retaining Walls are laid out as per the requirement, depending on the type of soil and the size of the Retaining Walls.\nGenerally, Retaining Walls are built with the slotted bedding blocks above the ground level. There are different ways of constructing Retaining Walls. In some cases, the retaining walls are built at a right angle to the slope, and at right angles to the bank. In such constructions, the bottom of the sloped bedding blocks is placed on the earth’s surface, while the upper ones are fitted into the spaces in the slope. The space in the slope can be filled up by compacting the dirt, using a sump pump. The depth can also be varied depending on the need, as well as on the availability of water runoff.\nIn some cases, retaining walls are built with rectangular blocks, which are fitted vertically into the retaining grout. These blocks are placed side by side on top of a layer of compacted gravel or on top of a single layer of soil or on top of a single layer of crushed stone. In this case, the sloping surface on which the blocks are set is slightly slanted. This type of construction results in more efficient drainage.\nIn cases where Retaining Walls are to be constructed over a concrete slab, it is necessary to use an appropriate concrete mixture. Normally the recommended concrete mixture for concrete masonry retaining walls is the concrete to which lime has been added. This concrete mixture gives strength to the wall and makes it durable.\nIn building Retaining Walls, it is necessary to ensure that they are strong enough to support the weight of the concrete slabs. The strength of the wall depends on various factors such as the type of base slab, the thickness of the base slab, and the number of slabs required to construct the Retaining Wall. Generally, the more slabs a base slab contains, the stronger the cantilever retaining wall will be. The thickness of the base slab should be such that the cantilever and the wall do not dip or bow at any point when the wall is fully constructed.']	['<urn:uuid:8e886512-20f8-4fb6-bde5-0e4e7c71634e>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	14	54	650
77	mongolia grazing problems near cities	Areas close to urban areas, settlements and permanent water in Mongolia are overgrazed, creating strong 'piosphere' effects, while remote areas are undergrazed with oxidising litter and susceptibility to fire.	['Understanding the relationship between pasture type and management systems in the steppe ecosystems of Mongolia and the rangeland of Australia\nGraeme Hand, Stipa Native Grasses Association Inc., Caroona Lane, Branxholme VIC 3302. Email: firstname.lastname@example.org\nThis study examined ways to reduce rangeland degradation, sustain resilience of livelihoods of nomadic herder communities, and enhance the cultural and biological diversity of desert and steppe areas of Australia and Mongolia using the positive deviance approach. This approach has been developed at Tufts University, Boston, USA for improving traditional activities at the community level in third world countries by identifying what was going right in the community in order to amplify it, as opposed to focusing on what was going wrong in the community and fixing it. For further information see http://www.positivedeviance.org/.\nGrazing in Mongolia\nThe environment in Mongolia is well suited to extensive grazing and transhumance with its cold and arid climate (Suttie 2005). However, collectivisation in the 1950s led to the development of permanent settlements in many areas and the start of grazing land degradation. De-collectivisation occurred in the 1990s and the responsibility for risk avoidance and economic management changed from state to household where it remains (Suttie 2005). However, social modernisation and the availability of rapid transport has meant that the traditional transhumance pathways have been given lower priority with remote areas of the country being undergrazed (oxidising litter and susceptible to fire) whereas the areas close to urban areas, settlements and permanent water are overgrazed, giving rise to strong ‘piosphere’ effects (Lange 1969; Suttie 2005).\nPurpose of the travel\nThe purpose of this travel was to investigate the present grazing management activities within the Sukhbaatar aimag of eastern Mongolia – specifically around the Erdenetsagaan soum, and to develop and design a joint project based on the positive deviance approach. Discussions with local livestock managers revealed that the older generation still retained knowledge of the indicators of proper grassland management for the region but that this information is usually not used by the present generation. Therefore, the identification of these ‘uncommon successful practices’ is a key step in the positive deviance approach.\nIndicators of uncommon successful grassland management in these rangelands would include the diversity of species, canopy cover of palatable perennial pasture plants, evidence of adequate perennial grass recovery after grazing, a well-developed litter layer and adequate animal impact to promote litter decomposition and germination and establishment of new perennial grasses.\nThe majority of the necessary steps were unable to be completed though the grasslands of Erdenetsagaan soum were generally better managed than other areas inspected and monitored. This was considered to be not due to ‘uncommon successful practices’ but as a consequence of distance from the capital Ulaanbaatar! An example of the Mongolian grassland with varying levels of degradation (as defined by ESD – Ecological Sustainable Development) are shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Examples of degraded, moderately degraded and healthy grasslands across the herding area of one family in the Sukhbaatar region of eastern Mongolia. Piosphere patterns were seen with increasing distance from both water and the location of a summerhouse (used as base for herding over the summer period).\nSteps in the positive deviance approach completed were:\n- Define the problem, current perceived causes, challenges and constraints, common practices, and desired outcomes\nThe interviews and monitoring confirmed that the herders contacted were aware of the problems but had not moved to identifying the causes or initiating corrective action. The majority of herders pointed to older herders or practices that seem to be no longer followed that maintained healthy grasslands.\nSteps in the positive deviance approach not completed were:\n- Determine the presence of positive deviant individuals or groups in the community.\n- Discover uncommon but successful practices and strategies through inquiry and observation.\n- Design activities to allow community members to practice the discovered behaviours.\n- Monitor and evaluate the resulting project or initiative which further fuels change by documenting and sharing improvements as they occur, and help the community discern the effectiveness of the initiative.\nKey messages for Australian rangeland users and/or researchers\nIt appears that when approaching grassland degradation using the positive deviance approach, simple and quick measures of current common practice are easily obtained. Discussing these findings with the herders also opened up the conversation about which practices were most likely creating the degradation and possible causes and corrective action.\nLange RT. 1969.

These trips typically run from sundown to midnight and do not require backpacking experience.	['At least once a quarter, we set up our telescopes for public viewing on campus (we have used Lake Lagunita, the Student Observatory, and the Mausoleum in the past). On stargazing nights, both SAS members and visitors learn about the night sky and enjoy views of stars, star clusters, nebulae, planets and the Moon through the society’s telescopes. We usually convene shortly after sunset and continue until ~11pm or later. Check the calendar for dates, times, and locations.\nIn addition to regular public viewing, the Society regularly volunteers for outreach events hosted by other organizations. Members have regularly attended Escondido Elementary School’s “Family Science Night” with telescopes for observation and hands-on activities and in the past, and have set up a solar observation station at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC)’s 11th Anniversary Open House as well as at a Second Sunday at Stanford’s Anderson Collection. More recently, the Society has started to travel to Bay Area elementary schools to promote astronomy to broader audiences with the help of Stanford’s Haas Center for Public Service. We are always looking for new ways to reach the broader community through public outreach, so please feel free to reach out if you’re interested in having us attend your event!\nWe hold solar observation sessions as a supplement to our usual night time observing activities. We always emphasize safety in observing the Sun and as such we use a wide variety of filters fitted to telescopes, projection facilities, dedicated H-alpha solar telescopes and spectrographs to study the sun in its richness. Our solar observation sessions are always a great chance to see sunspots, faculae, granulation, prominences and flares and other important structures on our nearest star first hand. We also organize special observing sessions for solar eclipses and transits whenever such events are visible in the region.\nWorkshops and conferences\nOur members and friends are always glad to share their knowledge with the Stanford community. We have organized talks on topics in astrophysics research in collaboration with the Physics Department and the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) in the past, and have more recently begun to co-host speakers with other student organizations during the academic year. In addition, we enjoy close connections to the Stanford University Department of Physics, and inform our members when relevant Department Colloqiua, KIPAC Tea Talks, Astrophysics & Cosmology Colloquia, and public lectures are held.\nTrips to dark sky sites\nOnce every quarter we plan for an outing to a darker site which has less light pollution than our regular stargazing location at Lake Lagunita. Most times, we take trips lasting from sundown to around midnight to the Monte Bello Open Space Preserve, conveniently located around thirty minutes from campus, which features exceptional skies for the Bay Area and a great environment for first-time observers. In the past, we have organized stargazing and astrophotography trips to Henry Coe State Park, impromptu outings to San Antonio reservoir for meteor showers, and we explored more dark sites nearby and far beyond the Sierras to observe deep sky objects. Most of these trips are daily roundtrips and do not require backpacking experience.']	['<urn:uuid:87fcf31e-0bb7-494d-8c8e-122a41b093a3>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	11	38	525
79	what are symptoms common between hashimotos thyroid disease and hyperthyroidism hair loss dry skin	While both conditions can cause hair loss, they actually have distinct symptoms. Hashimoto's disease leads to hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) which causes dry skin, but hyperthyroidism has different symptoms. With hyperthyroidism, a person experiences increased perspiration, weight loss despite good appetite, fast heart rate, trembling hands, and increased bowel movements. In contrast, hypothyroidism from Hashimoto's causes dry skin, weight gain, sluggishness, and constipation.	['What you need to know about alopecia areata related conditions\nIf you have alopecia areata, you may also have one or more related diseases. The most common of these include other autoimmune diseases (such as thyroid disease), atopic conditions (such as asthma, allergic rhinitis or hay fever , atopic dermatitis and other forms of eczema) and mental health impact (such as depression or anxiety).\nThese kinds of related diseases are known as “comorbid conditions.” Comorbid simply means that one condition exists in the body together with another condition. It’s important to understand which comorbid conditions you may be at higher risk for, so that you can work with your doctor if you are experiencing symptoms of these conditions.\nI have thyroid disease and alopecia areata — is one the cause of the other?\nMany diseases have related conditions, but that just means one disease exists alongside another\nGet the facts on alopecia areata related conditions and the signs and symptoms you should look for\nLearn how to spot depression or anxiety and when it is time to seek medical advice or counseling\nSee your doctor to find out if you have any diseases commonly seen in association with alopecia areata\nDiseases that cause your immune system to go haywire and attack its own tissues are known as autoimmune diseases. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease where your immune system attacks its own healthy hair follicles. Studies show that people with alopecia areata can have other autoimmune diseases, such as thyroid disease. However, the fact that you have alopecia areata doesn’t mean you will automatically develop another autoimmune disease. Either way, it’s important to talk with your doctor if you are experiencing symptoms of these conditions.\nThe thyroid is a buttery-shaped gland at the base of the neck that produces the thyroid hormone which controls your metabolism. Any kind of abnormality in the thyroid that results in its inability to function normally is known as thyroid disease. Some thyroid conditions such as Hashimoto’s, are considered autoimmune diseases.\nThyroid disease is divided into hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) and hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid). These affect people of diffierent ages and both sexes, and include a wide range of symptoms, depending on which type of thyroid disease a person has.\nSymptoms of hyperthyroidism include:\n- Increased appetite\n- Weak muscles\n- Rapid heartbeat, irregular heartbeat, or pounding of the heart\n- Nervousness and anxiety\n- Trembling in the hands and fingers\n- Changes in menstrual patterns\n- A greater sensitivity to heat\n- Changes in bowel movements\n- Enlarged thyroid\n- Diffculty sleeping\n- Thinning of the skin\n- Fine hair that easily breaks and splits\nSymptoms of hypothyroidism include:\n- Feeling cold\n- Weak muscles\n- Joint or muscle pain\n- Weight gain\n- Sadness or depression\n- Pale, dry skin\n- Dry, thinning hair\n- Slow heart rate\n- Less sweating\n- A puffy face\n- A hoarse (rough) sounding voice\n- Heavy menstrual bleeding\nOther autoimmune diseases\nAdditional autoimmune diseases that can sometimes be associated with alopecia areata through common genes include type 1 diabetes, celiac disease and rheumatoid arthritis, among others. The risk of developing these conditions in individuals with alopecia areata is low, though family members may show an increased incidence of other autoimmune diseases, since these tend to cluster in families.\nDid you know?\nComorbid conditions are diseases that exist in the same person at the same time; one is not the cause of the other. The only way to know if you have comorbid conditions with your alopecia areata is to make an appointment with your doctor.\nAtopic conditions are those that make a person more likely to develop allergic “hypersensitivity” reactions. Studies indicate that people who have alopecia areata may also have atopic conditions, too. These include allergic rhinitis also commonly called hay fever, asthma, and atopic dermatitis. Unlike other comorbid conditions, people with alopecia areata who also have an atopic condition may notice a seasonal change in their alopecia areata, as their allergies flare up or calm down.\nAtopic conditions are by far the most common comorbid conditions with alopecia areata. However, the fact that you have alopecia areata doesn’t mean you will also develop one of these atopic conditions. Either way, it’s important to recognize the signs and symptoms of this family of conditions.\nAsthma is an atopic (allergy) condition that causes a person’s airways to become inflamed, swollen and narrow, which makes it difficult to breathe. This leads to tightness in the chest, coughing and wheezing. Asthma commonly first appears in childhood, but can continue throughout your life. Some people with asthma only experience it from time to time, while others require constant treatment in order to prevent it from getting worse.\nSymptoms of asthma include\n- Tight chest\n- Shortness of breath\nAllergic Rhinitis or Hay Fever\nAllergic rhinitis is an inflammation in the nose and sinuses, which is linked to allergens like seasonal pollen, dust mites and pet dander. It is also known as “hay fever.”\nMany people suffer from seasonal hay fever at different places or times of the year depending on what triggers their allergies.\nSymptoms of allergic rhinitis/hay fever include\n- An itchy nose, mouth, eyes or skin\n- A runny nose and/or stuffy nose\n- Watery eyes\n- Sore throat\nEczema is a condition that causes the skin to be red and itchy. It often appears in early childhood. Babies usually develop it on their face (especially the cheeks and chin), but it can appear anywhere on the body. The most common type of eczema is called atopic dermatitis (AD). All of types of eczema cause itching and redness, but some may also cause a person’s skin to blister, “weep,” or peel.\nSymptoms of eczema may include\n- Dry, sensitive skin\n- Red, inflamed skin\n- A rash that keeps coming back\n- Rough, leathery or scaly patches of skin\n- Oozing or crusting\nMental Health Impact\nDepression or Anxiety\nBecause hair loss and regrowth from alopecia areata is unpredictable and sometimes it comes back again and again, it can be emotionally challenging for people to live with the disease.\nPeople with alopecia areata commonly report feelings of frustration, embarrassment and sometimes sadness and fear related to their condition. If you have had these feelings for more than several weeks, or if they seem overwhelming or too difficult to manage on your own, it’s important to make an appointment with your doctor because you may be experiencing depression or anxiety.\nSymptoms of depression and anxiety may include\n- Withdrawal or isolation\n- Restlessness (unable to sit still)\n- Feeling frantic\n- Difficulty concentrating\n- Problems with sleeping\n- Loss of interest in hobbies or other activities\n- Decreased energy, feeling tired more often\n- Weight change\n- Thoughts of death or suicide\n- Sadness or depression', 'Thyroid Guide – Thyroid Disorders: The thyroid gland is a small butterfly-shaped gland that can be found just below the Adam’s apple. It produces thyroid hormones that are used for metabolism in the body. The growth and development of all the body tissues are dependent on the proper functioning of the thyroid gland. Problems arise if the thyroid gland is overactive or underactive. There are three common thyroid disorders. These are hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and the thyroid nodules.\nHypothyroidism happens when the thyroid gland fails to produce an adequate supply of thyroid hormones. Common symptoms of this thyroid disorder are hair loss, dry skin, sluggishness, constipation and weight gain.\nHyperthyroidism refers to an overactive thyroid gland. In this case, the thyroid gland produces more thyroid hormones than what the body needs. When this happens, an individual may feel exhausted most of the time, lose weight excessively, experience palpitations and irritability.\nCollect your sample, mail it back in the prepaid envelope, and receive results by email or phone.\nThyroid nodules are lumps that grow in the thyroid which are mostly common and harmless. Only a small percentage of thyroid nodules are cancerous. One must undergo a biopsy to be further evaluated if the lump or tumor is benign or cancerous.\nNot all people with thyroid disorders may notice and feel symptoms. Someone can even go on living without having any clue that they may be suffering from a thyroid disorder. It is best to consult a doctor should an individual feel any symptoms either related or not related to thyroid disorders. Thyroid disorders if left untreated may put one’s health and even life at risk.\nInteresting Questions about Thyroid:\nThe basic goal of treatment is to return thyroid hormone levels to normal.\nHyperthyroidism makes the body work too fast because there is too much thyroid hormone in the blood. Graves’ disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Graves’ disease occurs because of a problem in the body’s immune system: antibodies are produced that overstimulate the thyroid gland.\nPatients who are hyperthyroid from taking too much thyroid hormone need only to have their dosage properly adjusted.\nPatients whose hyperthyroidism is caused by transient thyroiditis usually do not require any of the treatments described below, since their condition gets better on its own.\nTreatment for hyperthyroidism from Graves’ disease, toxic autonomously functioning thyroid nodule, or toxic multi-nodular goiter may include one or more of the following:\nRadioactive iodine (I131)\nRadioactive iodine shrinks an enlarged thyroid or toxic nodule or nodules that are making too much thyroid hormone. This treatment is safe and is widely used in adults with hyperthyroidism.\n* Radioactive iodine (I131) is the treatment of choice for the majority of the endocrinologists in this country. It is an effective, simple, safe way to treat patients with Graves’ disease or other forms of hyperthyroidism. Patients often have fears and misconceptions about using radioactive iodine.\n* Studies have been done since the 1940’s on patients receiving this treatment. Treated patients, their children, and their grandchildren do not have an increased incidence of cancer, leukemia, etc.\n* There are no increased instances of birth defects in children born to mothers who have had this treatment and waited the recommended time before becoming pregnant. (Pregnancy should be avoided for at least six months after the treatment.) As a matter of fact, fertility is often restored to women whose infertility is due to hyperthyroidism. Treating the disease also lessens the chance of miscarriage.\n* Pregnant women should not be given radioactive iodine for any reason. If a patient has any doubt as to whether she is pregnant, treatment (and testing) with radioactive iodine should be delayed.\n* Hospitalization is not required in order to treat hyperthyroidism with radioactive iodine.\n* Radioactive iodine treatment ablates the thyroid gland (turns it into something like a dried-up raisin). Patients wishing to avoid destruction of the gland should know that the thyroid gland frequently “burns out” within 15 years even without treatment.\n* Radioactive iodine does not cause a person to gain weight. However, because Graves’ disease increases the metabolism, patients should keep in mind that they cannot continue to eat the way they did while hyperthyroid. Because of changes in the metabolism after hyperthyroidism is treated, many patients will gain weight . This weight can be lost through diet and exercise once the thyroid levels are normalized.\nAntithyroid drugs, such as propylthiouracil (PTU) and methimazole (Tapozole®), are used in patients with Graves’ disease and, less commonly, in other hyperthyroid patients\nIn some cases beta-blocking drugs are prescribed to treat the symptoms of hyperthyroidism while waiting for one of the above treatments to work.\nYour doctor will be able to discuss the benefits and risks of each treatment.\nMany patients treated for hyperthyroidism become hypothyroid. They will need to take thyroid hormone pills for the rest of their lives. In addition, they will need to see their doctor at least once a year.\n® Tapozole is a registered trademark of Jones Medical Industries.\nThe standard treatment for hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone pills. The pills provide the body with the right amount of thyroid hormone when the gland is not able to produce enough by itself. While the symptoms of hypothyroidism are usually corrected within a few months, most patients need to take the pills for the rest of their lives.\nThe preferred thyroid hormone for treatment is levothyroxine (T4). You should use only the brand-name that your doctor prescribes, since generic brands may not be as reliable. Name brand levothyroxine pills include Levothroid®, Synthroid®, Levoxyl®, and Eltroxin®.\nPatients sometimes take more pills than they should, trying to speed up the treatment or lose weight. However, this can lead to hyperthyroidism, a disease in which there is too much thyroid hormone in the blood, and to long-term complications, such as osteoporosis. You should take the pills as your doctor prescribes.\nAt different times in your life, you may need to take different amounts of thyroid hormones. Therefore, you should see your doctor once a year to make sure everything is all right.\n® Levothroid is a registered trademark of Forest Pharmaceuticals.\n® Synthroid is a registered trademark of Knoll Pharmaceuticals.\n® Levoxyl is a registered trademark of Jones Medical Industries.\n® Eltroxin is a registered trademark of Roberts Pharmaceuticals.\nSigns and symptoms of Hyperthyroidism may include:\n- fast heart rate (100-120 beats per minute or higher)\n- slightly elevated blood pressure\n- nervousness or irritability\n- increased perspiration\n- muscle weakness (especially in the shoulders, hips, and thighs)\n- trembling hands\n- weight loss, in spite of a good appetite\n- hair loss\n- fingernails partially separated from finger-tips (onycholysis)\n- swollen fingertips (achropachy or clubbing)\n- retracted (pulled back) upper eyelids\n- skin changes\n- increased frequency of bowel movements\n- goiter (an abnormal swelling in the neck caused by an enlarged thyroid gland)\n- in women, decreased menstrual flow and less frequent menstrual flow\n- in men, slight swelling of the breasts\n- in Graves’ disease: thick or swollen skin over the shin bones (pretibial myxedema); eyes that seem to be popping out of their socket (exophthalmos).\nMost of these conditions will return to normal after the hyperthyroidism is treated. Certain others may be treated separately.\nHave more questions? Need more answers? Check our Full Thyroid FAQ\nAutoimmune Thyroid Disorders\nAutoimmune thyroid disorders are common and occur when the thyroid gland is being attacked by the immune system. This results in an abnormal functioning of the thyroid gland. In cases like autoimmune thyroid disorders, the thyroid gland is either underactive or overactive. Examples of autoimmune thyroid disorders are Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.\nAutoimmune thyroid disorders are also more common in women than in men. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis occurs in women between the ages of 30 and 50. This disease may be inherited since it appears to have a genetic component. People over 50 years old who have hypertension are prone to develop an autoimmune thyroid disorder called Graves’ disease.\nThyroid Disorder Symptoms\nThyroid disorder symptoms often appear gradually, thus making it commonly misdiagnosed. Some people may not feel or notice any symptoms at all. Common thyroid disorders are hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and thyroid nodules. Common symptoms for hypothyroidism are weight gain, constipation, heavy or abnormal menstrual flows, dry skin and hair loss. As for hyperthyroidism, an individual may notice and experience hair loss, excessive weight loss, frequent bowel movement and irritability.\nThyroid nodules are often ignored because most of the time, the lumps or tumors are benign. But one must not ignore these lumps or tumors since these may also be cancerous. Should one feel any of these symptoms, it is best to consult a doctor and seek medical help. Tests will be done to check one’s thyroid function and determine if these symptoms are caused by any thyroid disorder.\nThyroid Guide & Links to Related Articles\n|There are four parathyroid glands that are normally having the size of a single rice grain.

Both sectors rely on wireless connectivity and data transmission to enable remote access and timely decision-making based on collected information.	['Quality 4.0 derived from Industry 4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution. Prior to the fourth revolution, the first revolution started with machine manufacturing, steam power, and the move to cities by agriculturalists. In the second industrial revolution, production was automated and mass manufacturing cut the cost of consumer and industrial products. The third revolution involved the use of electronics and control systems in manufacturing, which helped drive down costs and resulted in increased product complexity and lower product costs. Today’s fourth industrial revolutionary change is driving new quality paradigms, processes, and technologies (https://blog.lnsresearch.com/quality40).\nIn the medical device manufacturing market, in particular, there are numerous challenges to design and produce safer devices. Regulatory requirements are just one component—but incorporating emerging and continually evolving technologies requires device companies to raise their game if they want to stay ahead of the competition and leverage cutting edge technologies—from the Internet of Things (IoT) to artificial intelligence and machine learning to augmented reality and even robotics. Quality 4.0 is the convergence of these new technologies that make up the manufacturing landscape.\nTechnology to Reshape the Market\nIndustry 4.0 represents the dawn of the digital transformation having begun with the third revolution, connecting the physical and natural worlds. The impact of digital data, analytics, connectivity, scalability, and collaboration are the drivers empowering this fourth industrial revolution and informing Quality 4.0 strategies. As we find new ways to connect people, devices, and data, the democratization of technologies is introducing transformative capabilities in analytics, material science, and connectivity. For the medical device industry, such technologies empower a quality transformation of culture, leadership, collaboration, and standards (https://blog.lnsresearch.com/quality40).\nQuality 4.0 is reshaping device designs, functionality, manufacturing processes, supply chain strategy, customer service, and the methods of maintaining quality systems that are compliant with regulatory bodies like the FDA and ISO. Intelligent and connected technologies are rapidly becoming more widely used as manufacturers seek an advantage to introduce inventive products to market and leapfrog existing competitors.\nThe Move to Digital\nMarketsandMarkets forecasts the medical device market will grow to $63.43 billion by 2023. Smarter, more automated, and connected devices are improving the state of healthcare, making it possible to perform remote surgeries with doctors on the other side of the globe. Medical device companies’ ability to leverage Quality 4.0 technologies will be key to market success in the years ahead. LNS Research sees Quality 4.0—the application of Industry 4.0 technologies to quality initiatives—as following in IoT’s path. In fact, industry experts have determined that a quarter of medical device manufacturers’ digital transformation technologies drive quality improvements. These same technologies are being used to design and deliver products. What does this mean for medical device manufacturers?\nFor starters, digital transformation trends have helped define Quality 4.0 strategies to eliminate reliance on disparate paper-based quality management systems and processes. The move away from manual systems reduces errors, silos, collaboration barriers, and traceability issues. Furthermore, the digitization and automation of design and production processes enables small and global companies to scale their design and supply chain processes quickly. For instance, one such company, RefleXion Medical, a leader in biology-guided radiotherapy systems for cancer treatment, knew they needed to implement a completely connected QMS that could scale to support their path to digital transformation and improved compliance. They required a flexible platform that could grow with their team, products, and path throughout the quality compliance process.\nNewer Quality Standards along the Supply Chain\nIn order to speed products to market, today’s medical device manufacturers rely on distributed teams and supply chains, including contract manufacturers, design partners, and tiered component suppliers. Companies that have embraced new technologies and cloud-based systems understand the unique benefits that digital transformation technologies can bring to a device manufacturer’s product requirements, product capabilities, and regulatory compliance objectives.\nIn the life sciences realm, digital therapeutics, medical diagnostic equipment, implantable devices and disposable devices are just a few of the wide array of devices that strive to be problem-free while delivering higher throughput and maintaining compliance.\nIntegration with Connected Teams\nUsing a connected, or more product-centric quality management system (QMS) can help to meet the demands created by Quality 4.0 trends. As complexity of products increases with AI, IoT, robotics, and related 4.0 technologies, quality teams must have a unified system to identify issues, address audits, and resolve quality incidents. This ensures that the full, complex product design comprised of electrical, mechanical, and software components is contained within a single system.\nThis foundation allows for complete, connected quality and corrective action records and provides increased visibility and transparency as teams collaborate through each phase of new product development and introduction.\nMedical device companies will gain competitive advantages by having more intelligence-driven product and quality process insights. This, in turn, will lead to better data-driven decisions and cross-functional visibility with quality, engineering, operations, and supply chain teams. These Quality 4.0 transformational technologies add complexity in meeting strict medical device requirements:\n- ISO quality system requirements\n- Complaint management and corrective action preventive action (CAPA)\n- FDA 21 CFR Part 820\n- FDA 21 CFR Part 11\n- ISO 13485\n- To ensure compliance, a product-centric QMS solution makes it possible to:\n- Create a completely connected quality and product process\n- Establish quality product processes to avoid audit issues\n- Ensure traceable design and change controls\n- Manage product bills of materials linked directly to quality records\n- Drive closed-loop quality and CAPA processes to faster resolution\n- Improve quality compliance and supplier management processes\nThe last point about supplier management process is essential because the right QMS solution can unify quality and product record management to provide complete control and traceability, simplify audits, and decrease risks.\nUse Cases from Device Makers\nSwan Valley Medical is a manufacturer of surgical instruments and accessories for applications in the field of urology. They were burdened with inefficient paper-based manual processes that resulted in potential compliance exposure due to misplacing critical documentation. During audits, when missing or inaccurate information was found, it was difficult to recover and could take hundreds of hours or even several months.\nWith a cloud-based product-centric QMS solution, accelerated root-cause analysis and risk management observation processes were implemented. This enabled different processes to connect with others through linked product and quality records, thus supporting audits with cross-linked evidence chains.\nClosed-loop CAPA processes help quality teams identify, analyze, and resolve quality issues faster. In one example, Pulse Biosciences deployed a closed-loop quality system across its organization. All team members were able to work collaboratively on the most current product definition and latest quality records with a product-centric QMS. With streamlined CAPA processes, Pulse Biosciences was able to address urgent corrective actions rapidly with better audit trails.\nKinsa offers the ﬁrst FDA-cleared, doctor-recommended smart thermometers. They implemented product-centric QMS to assist in the design of the company’s ﬁrst-ever connected device. The application of Quality 4.0 technologies has helped Kinsa revolutionize how healthcare can be reimagined in an IoT universe through connected technologies to streamline product development, improve quality management, and shorten the time to resolve customer issues.\nKeeping up with Quality 4.0\nThe march to deliver more intelligent devices is moving ahead at full speed. Both large, established medical device companies and smaller innovators are racing to improve healthcare by connecting people and data using newer technologies like IoT, AR, and robotics to deliver better outcomes to patients around the globe.\nThe advances made with Industry 4.0 have helped drive Quality 4.0 technologies and strategies to improve quality compliance. The ability to align complex product development and quality processes is critical to compete in today’s global economy. We not only develop products virtually with distributed teams, but we now have the ability to heal and perform surgeries where doctors and patients are separated by multiple time zones with intelligent robotics and augmented reality devices.\nSo, consider your goals and realities for creating and delivering complex products that meet regulations from the FDA to ISO. Make sure you can create a completely traceable, reduced-risk environment to protect your patients as well as your profits and long-term viability.\nQuality 4.0 trends require smarter, connected strategies to ensure your company isn’t left behind.', 'Smart agriculture, also known as precision agriculture, is revolutionizing the farming industry by utilizing advanced technologies to optimize crop production.

83	Which works better in trending vs sideways markets: moving averages or oscillators?	Moving averages work best in trending markets, while oscillators are more beneficial in sideways or horizontal trading patterns. Moving average chart lines are trend-following indicators that work best when there's a clear trend, whereas oscillators help identify overbought and oversold conditions when the market has no clear trend.	['Following 10 Trading Rules can be used for Trading Future,Margin Trading and Trading using Technical s.\n1. Map the Trends\nStudy long-term charts. Begin a chart analysis with monthly and weekly charts spanning several years. A larger scale map of the market provides more visibility and a better long-term perspective on a market. Once the long-term has been established, then consult daily and intra-day charts. A short-term market view alone can often be deceptive. Even if you only trade the very short term, you will do better if you’re trading in the same direction as the intermediate and longer term trends.\n2. Spot the Trend and Go with It\nDetermine the trend and follow it. Market trends come in many sizes long-term, intermediate-term and short-term. First, determine which one you’re going to trade and use the appropriate chart. Make sure you trade in the direction of that trend. Buy dips if the trend is up. Sell rallies if the trend is down. If you’re trading the intermediate trend, use daily and weekly charts. If you’re day trading, use daily and intra-day charts. But in each case, let the longer range chart determine the trend, and then use the shorter term chart for timing.\n3. Find the Low and High of It\nFind support and resistance levels. The best place to buy a market is near support levels. That support is usually a previous reaction low. The best place to sell a market is near resistance levels. Resistance is usually a previous peak. After a resistance peak has been broken, it will usually provide support on subsequent pullbacks. In other words, the old “high” becomes the new low. In the same way, when a support level has been broken, it will usually produce selling on subsequent rallies â€“ the old “low” can become the new “high.”\n4. Know How Far to Backtrack\nMeasure percentage retracements. Market corrections up or down usually retrace a significant portion of the previous trend. You can measure the corrections in an existing trend in simple percentages. A fifty percent retracement of a prior trend is most common. A minimum retracement is usually one-third of the prior trend. The maximum retracement is usually two-thirds. Fibonacci retracements of 38% and 62% are also worth watching. During a pullback in an uptrend, therefore, initial buy points are in the 33-38% retracement area.\n5. Draw the Line\nDraw trend lines. Trend lines are one of the simplest and most effective charting tools. All you need is a straight edge and two points on the chart. Up trend lines are drawn along two successive lows. Down trend lines are drawn along two successive peaks. Prices will often pull back to trend lines before resuming their trend. The breaking of trend lines usually signals a change in trend. A valid trend line should be touched at least three times. The longer a trend line has been in effect, and the more times it has been tested, the more important it becomes.\n6. Follow that Average\nFollow moving averages. Moving averages provide objective buy and sell signals. They tell you if existing trend is still in motion and help confirm a trend change. Moving averages do not tell you in advance, however, that a trend change is imminent. A combination chart of two moving averages is the most popular way of finding trading signals. Some popular futures combinations are 4- and 9-day moving averages, 9- and 18-day, 5- and 20-day. Signals are given when the shorter average line crosses the longer. Price crossings above and below a 40-day moving average also provide good trading signals. Since moving average chart lines are trend-following indicators, they work best in a trending market.\n7. Learn the Turns\nTrack oscillators. Oscillators help identify overbought and oversold markets. While moving averages offer confirmation of a market trend change, oscillators often help warn us in advance that a market has rallied or fallen too far and will soon turn. Two of the most popular are the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic. They both work on a scale of 0 to 100. With the RSI, readings over 70 are overbought while readings below 30 are oversold. The overbought and oversold values for Stochastic are 80 and 20. Most traders use 14-days or weeks for stochastic and either 9 or 14 days or weeks for RSI. Oscillator divergences often warn of market turns. These tools work best in a trading market range. Weekly signals can be used as filters on daily signals. Daily signals can be used as filters for intra-day charts.\n8. Know the Warning Signs\nTrade MACD. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator (developed by Gerald Appel) combines a moving average crossover system with the overbought/oversold elements of an oscillator. A buy signal occurs when the faster line crosses above the slower and both lines are below zero. A sell signal takes place when the faster line crosses below the slower from above the zero line. Weekly signals take precedence over daily signals. An MACD histogram plots the difference between the two lines and gives even earlier warnings of trend changes. It’s called a “histogram” because vertical bars are used to show the difference between the two lines on the chart.\n9. Trend or Not a Trend\nUse ADX. The Average Directional Movement Index (ADX) line helps determine whether a market is in a trending or a trading phase. It measures the degree of trend or direction in the market. A rising ADX line suggests the presence of a strong trend. A falling ADX line suggests the presence of a trading market and the absence of a trend. A rising ADX line favors moving averages; a falling ADX favors oscillators. By plotting the direction of the ADX line, the trader is able to determine which trading style and which set of indicators are most suitable for the current market environment.\n10. Know the Confirming Signs\nInclude volume and open interest. Volume and open interest are important confirming indicators in futures markets. Volume precedes price. It’s important to ensure that heavier volume is taking place in the direction of the prevailing trend. In an uptrend, heavier volume should be seen on up days. Rising open interest confirms that new money is supporting the prevailing trend. Declining open interest is often a warning that the trend is near completion. A solid price uptrend should be accompanied by rising volume and rising open interest.', 'Top Technical Indicators for Stock Investors\nAn indicator is a mathematical calculation that can be used with the stock’s price and/or volume to help make investment choices. The end result is a value that’s used to anticipate future changes in price. There are two types of indicators: leading and lagging.\nLeading indicators help you profit by attempting to forecast what prices will do next. Leading indicators provide greater rewards at the expense of increased risk. They perform best in sideways or trading markets. They work by measuring how overbought or oversold a stock is.\nLagging (or trend-following) indicators are best suited to price movements in relatively long trends. They don’t warn you of any potential changes in price. Lagging indicators have you buy and sell in a mature trend, when the risk is reduced.\nThe Relative Strength Index\nThe technical conditions of overbought and oversold are important to be aware of. They’re good warning flags to help you time a trade, whether that means getting in or getting out of a position. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a convenient metric for measuring the overbought/oversold condition.\nGenerally, the RSI quantifies the condition and gives you a number that acts like a barometer. On a reading of 0 to 100, the RSI becomes oversold at about the 30 level and overbought at about the 70 level.\nThe RSI is a metric usually calculated and quoted by most charting sources and technical analysis websites. It’s generally considered a leading indicator because it forewarns potential price movements.\nFor stock investors, the RSI is particularly useful for timing the purchase or sale of a particular stock. When you are looking at a favorite stock that you like and notice that its RSI is below 30, check to see whether anything is wrong with the stock (did the fundamentals change?).\nIf nothing is wrong and it’s merely a temporary, market-driven event, consider buying more of the stock. After all, if you loved a great stock at $40 and it’s now cheaper at $35, all things being equal, you have a great buying opportunity.\nConversely, if you’re not crazy about a stock and you see that it’s overbought, consider either selling it outright or at least putting a stop-loss order on the stock.\nThe moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a lagging indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the signal line, is then plotted on top of the MACD, which acts as a trigger for making buy and sell orders.\nThat’s the technical definition of the MACD but don’t worry if you didn’t understand it on the first go-round. Fortunately, it’s not something that you have to calculate on your own; the MACD indicator is usually provided by the technical analysis software or trading service that you may use.\nCrossovers and divergence\nA crossover is the point when the stock’s price and an indicator intersect (or cross over). It’s used as a signal to make a buy or sell order. Say that a stock, for example, falls past $20 per share to $19, and the 20-day moving average is $19.50. That would be a bearish crossover, and it would indicate a good time to sell or risk further downward movement.\nThe opposite is true as well; some crossovers indicate a good time to buy.\nDivergence occurs when the price of a stock and an indicator (or index or other related security) part company and head off in opposite directions. Divergence is considered either positive or negative, both of which are signals of changes in the price trend.\nPositive divergence occurs when the price of a stock makes a new low while a bullish indicator starts to climb upward.\nNegative divergence happens when the price of a stock makes a new high, but bearish indicators signal the opposite, and instead the closing price at the end of the trading day is lower than the previous high.\nCrossovers and divergence are usually leading indicators.\nOscillators are indicators that are used when you’re analyzing charts that have no clear trend. Moving averages and other indicators are certainly important when the trend is clear, but oscillators are more beneficial under either of the following circumstances:\nWhen the stock is in a horizontal or sideways trading pattern\nWhen a definite trend can’t be established because the market is volatile and the price action is very uneven\nOscillators may be either leading or lagging indicators, depending on what type they are. Momentum oscillators, for example, are considered leading indicators because they’re used to track the momentum of price and volume.\nBollinger bands have nothing to do with musical groups. A band is plotted two standard deviations away from a simple moving average. The bollinger band (a lagging indicator) works like a channel and moves along with the simple moving average.\nBollinger bands help the technical analyst watch out for overbought and oversold conditions. Basically, if the price moves closer to the upper band, it indicates an overbought condition. If the price moves closer to the lower band, it indicates an oversold condition.']	['<urn:uuid:2ed45eed-65c5-4e67-941e-16f6bee8303b>', '<urn:uuid:32c9501a-563e-4c9d-bb86-18ffaf07547d>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	12	48	1941

85	oil fired home heating efficiency cost benefits	Oil-fired heating systems offer several advantages over traditional central heating systems. They can achieve up to 98 percent efficiency and are less expensive compared to radiators. Instead of heating the entire space through water-filled pipes like central heating systems, oil-fired systems pump oil directly into home radiators, transferring heat directly to rooms. This results in faster heating, making the house warm and comfortable quickly. Additionally, because of their inexpensive operation, homeowners can avoid dealing with rising utility bills.	['Everything to Know About Heating Your Home\nHeating your home is essential in sunny and cold places, but choosing the right heating system can be overwhelming. For a simplified, concise guide to the world of heaters, check out Everything you Need to Know About Heating Your Home. This helpful guide teaches you about common heating systems such as heating oils, solar systems, heat pumps, as well as how to winterize these types of heaters. The guide also details how to get the most out of your heating appliance and where to find more information on different types of heating systems that you can find through HVAC supplies.\nUnderstanding the basics of heating components and how they work makes it simple to know how to choose and maintain an energy-efficient system for your home. Because comfort and safety depend on a proper working system, keep these tips in mind when deciding how to heat your home.\nChoosing a Heating Emitter\nWhen choosing a heating emitter, you need to know what the most popular options are and how they compare.\nEmitters are small boards that are designed to heat a specific area. They are often used as a cheaper method than radiators and can combine with under-floor heating to create a warm, cozy home. Each of the choices above has its own benefits and drawbacks. The right emitter is all about ensuring the best heat output for the room and, of course, saving money. There are essentially three types of emitter to choose from, depending on your individual heating needs.\n- Underfloor heating\nFor new build self-builders and residential extensions, underfloor heating is the top choice for increasing comfort, adding value to your home, and reducing running costs. It’s less expensive than radiators to install; it can be fitted around obstacles and offers much more flexibility when it comes to fitting furniture and soft furnishings.\nRadiators are the most popular choice for home heating emitters, whether you want to heat a single room or your entire home. These devices are mounted on the wall and have pipes that distribute heat to different rooms. Their warm air will fill your premises faster than artificial heating, although UFH will last longer.\nA radiator works by heating a pipe and releasing the heat into the room via convection. The heat can then be distributed around the room in whatever way is most efficient; radiators on their own tend to use less electricity than UF systems without any heating radiation.\nRadiators are the only type of boiler heating system that directly heats the air in your home, with no added ductwork or exhaust fans. A central heating radiator looks similar to an electric heater but is built to be much more efficient and last much longer. These radiators are generally available in sizes between 15 and 68kW, although a wide range of options is available depending on your specific needs!\n- Skirting board heaters\nSkirting board heaters (SBHs) is one of the easiest and most cost-effective ways of heating a space, especially in a refurbishment project where existing pipework allows them to be installed easily. They are surface-mounted electric heating devices that can provide supplemental heat on top of underfloor heating.\nSkirting board heaters are a great option for retrofitting an existing home. They may look a little old-fashioned, but they are simple to install and fit most decorating schemes andndash; not only that, the heating elements are concealed in the wall, so you’ll never have to worry about them getting damaged or covered in dust.\nSkirting board heaters are a great, under-appreciated solution for many homes. They can be skimmed or cut into any skirting, affording a quick and simple, relatively cheap retrofit that can give you low-upkeep, continuous heat with minimal risk of burns. Differing resistor wattages allow you to alter the heat output if required.\nSkirting board heating is a great alternative to radiators if you want to avoid drilling into your walls. With ready-prepared pipes, just run them behind your skirting boards and secure them with the included wall plugs.\nHow Does the Heating System Work?\nHow does a home heating system work? A home heating system is designed to keep your home warm in the winter and cool in the summer by moving hot and cool air around.\nA furnace has three main parts: the furnace blower, the heat exchanger, and the controls. Mainly, the blower blows air superheated by heat exchanger tubes and circulating through your home radiators. The computerized control measures the temperature of your home and the desired temperature you set on the thermostat. It then turns your furnace on or off and keeps it running until your home reaches that comfort level.\nA home heating system uses a boiler to heat water in your home. The heated water is then distributed from the boiler through radiators throughout your home. When the cold weather hits, the system reverse-flows: warm air is blown into your home through small ducts and vents; as a result, your home warms up again.\nHome Heating Systems\nStay warm with the new generation of heating systems that are available in today’s market. There are several different types, including forced air, heat pumps, and gas furnaces, that provide unparalleled comfort throughout your home. You can even find systems that can easily be controlled with a mobile device app or with the included thermostat controller.\nA heat pump is a device for transferring thermal energy from one location to another. Heat pumps are a great way to save both energy and money on your heating and cooling bills.\nHeat pumps are a type of central heating and cooling system that uses a refrigerant to heat a building and extract heat from it at the same time. Heat pumps are common in colder climates as an affordable way to heat a home or business. Still, they also can be used in warmer regions to regulate air conditioning contractor costs.\nHeat pumps are energy-efficient, environmentally friendly, and economical. Heat pump systems use electricity to move heat rather than generate heat, providing significant energy savings over conventional methods. You’ll save money each month with a heat pump system, whether you’re preheating your home, cooling it down, or both!\nHeat pumps are an easy, cost-efficient alternative to furnaces and air conditioners. They work by transferring heat from a cold area to a warmer one without moving the heat around physically.\nOil Heating Services\nUnlike central heating systems that pump heated water through pipes and radiators, heating oil-fired systems pump oil directly into your home’s radiators. So, for even more heat and greater cost savings, consider a heating oil service.\nAnd unlike central heating systems that pump heated water through pipes and radiators, oil-fired systems pump oil directly into your home’s radiators. Oil heats rooms more quickly, so the house is warm and comfortable when you walk in. It’s also way cheaper than other types of heating.\nOil-fired systems offer high efficiency (up to 98 percent), they are also absolutely inexpensive compared to radiators. Rather than heating the entire space, oil-fired systems transfer heat directly to your rooms. It’s fast, it saves space, and because it’s inexpensive, you won’t have to keep up with rising utility bills.\nBoiler heating system\nThe high-efficiency boiler heating system is a revolutionary technology for the boiler industry. A boiler is a closed vessel where fluids (liquids or gases) are heated. A boiler heating system efficiently heats the water in your home using gas, oil, or electricity.\nBoiler Heating Systems Boiler heating systems work by using a boiler, which is a vessel used to convert water into energy. The hot water produced by this process can be used for various household activities and be adjusted appropriately according to your particular needs. A boiler heating system\nis made up of a boiler and associated interconnected devices, such as a pump and a temperature/pressure relief valve.\nThese three components create an independent system that automatically generates hot water through the boiler’s combustion chamber and pipes. When the temperature gets too high, the pressure relief valve releases water that was previously cooled into the atmosphere. If there isn’t any water in the tank, the system will get cold because there is no more heated water. Usually, these heating systems include sensors that alert you if there are malfunctions.\nYour boiler heating system controls your home’s temperature and provides valuable services like hot water and central heating. You’ll also find that a boiler system is responsible for supplying your central heating and hot water.\nA boiler heating system is a very common system used in commercial, industrial, and residential applications. The boiler heating system relies on high-pressure steam to heat spaces. Some of the most popular and cost-effective boilers are from the HVAC business.Boiler heating systems are used to produce hot water or steam primarily in industries, offices, hotels, and apartments. They can also bring convenience to your home by heating water for showering, washing dishes, and doing laundry.\nHybrid Heating service\nWe all want that perfect tan, but too much time in the sun is bad for your skin. Now there’s a solution. The Hybrid Heating system combines both convection and infrared heating technology to ensure that you enjoy a safe, evenly-heated tanning session.\nA hybrid heating system is a gas appliance that also has an electric element to it. Hybrid heating systems have an average annual fuel efficiency rate of 78% and average annual emissions on par with a 100-watt light bulb. These systems are the most efficient for keeping living spaces warm, particularly during winter.\nThe Hybrid Heating system combines the speed and precision of electronic control with the power and reliability of a traditional heating system. The ultimate indication of quality is temperature stability, which you can enjoy with this system. After all, temperature consistency matters, especially when you’re cooking. For example, steak. One minute too long on an over-hot grill, and it’s tough and chewy; one minute too short, and what’s the point? Precise temperature gives you great results every time.\nA hybrid heating system uses convection to circulate heat and a heat sensor to maintain an even temperature. With this type of system, you can enjoy the best of heated blankets without hot or cold spots to keep you feeling comfortable all through the night.The Condensation Free Hybrid Heating system combines the best of convection heating and infrared heating, delivering precise heat control while maintaining powerful warmth. It circulates warm air around food with a precise temperature-controlled zone that keeps moisture in food at a minimum.\nSolar heating systems\nA solar heating system is a great tool for keeping your house warm and cozy. Solar heating systems gain heat from lights that absorb solar energy from the sun instead of from a boiler or furnace. This eliminates pollution and improves air quality because there is no gaseous combustion by-product as there are in conventional systems.\nSolar energy is free, pollution-free, and independent. Solar heating systems can be used both in domestic and industrial environments; solar thermal systems are designed to meet all of your heating needs andndash; hot water, space heating, and cooling.\nHeating your home is a winter necessity, and today you can choose your source of warmth: natural gas, electricity, or oil. Whichever you choose, remember that a backup source of heat is important in case your primary heating system fails. Always install and maintain multiple sources of heat to protect your family from dangerous cold spots in the event of an emergency.\nHeating your home has many benefits, including keeping everyone in your family warm and cozy all year long, soothed by the sound of a crackling fire or the whoosh of warm air wafting through your vents. It also reduces energy bills and can save you time and money because it’s always running.']	['<urn:uuid:aa787e8b-9815-4a43-aba0-7b64bbe0d11d>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	7	78	1973
86	My horse has thick hair. How can I thin the mane?	You can use several tools to thin the mane without pulling it. The Solo-Comb cuts the hair instead of pulling it, and there are also thinning shears and various other tools available to achieve the desired thickness.	"[""How to Shorten a Horse's Mane with Scissors\nBy April D. Ray\nI wanted the look of a tidy, short, thin mane, but didn’t want to continue pulling manes… so I got creative. It’s amazing what you can do with the right tools, some patience, and a little imagination. While some traditionalists will argue that the look achieved with scissors isn’t the same as a pulled mane, I was happy to find another way to shorten and thin manes without inflicting pain on the horses I work with.\nTo get started, you’ll need a pair of sharp scissors, a long plastic mane comb, and some sort of thinning device if thinning is desired. Personally, I’m a fan of the Solo-Comb, but there are many other tools on the market that don’t involve pulling the hair from the root while still achieving a nicely thinned mane (see Figure 1).\nFirst, comb out the mane and ensure that it is lying flat on the neck and all on one side (see Figure 2).\nStart at the top and use the plastic mane comb as a guide to get the length you want and keep it even throughout. Once the comb is at the desired spot, take the scissors at a 90-degree angle and cut up into the mane. Doing it this way will avoid the blunt look that results from just cutting across the mane. Don’t be alarmed if it looks jagged at first as it takes some practice to get the hang of this. Making multiple small cuts will help achieve the look of a more natural mane, rather than one that resembles a bowl cut (see Figure 3).\nYou can also make cuts at a 45-degree angle, both to the left and the right, to further ensure a more natural look. Remember to start small – you can’t put mane back if you cut too short, but you can certainly cut more if it’s not short enough (see Figure 4).\nOnce you are happy with the first section you can continue to work your way down the mane until you get to the end. Often this will be enough to achieve the look you want, but if your horse’s mane is quite thick you can choose from several tools to help thin the mane without actually pulling it. I use the Solo-Comb, which gives the same result as pulling the mane, but cuts the hair instead. There are also thinning shears and various tools on the market to achieve the desired thickness of mane. Remember that typically the top and bottom of the mane are naturally thinner (see Figure 5).\nOnce you are done, critique your work and make any corrections needed, or tidy up rogue hairs. A nicely trimmed bridle path also helps complete that neat, well-groomed look. Should you make any dire errors, just remember that it’s only hair and will grow back. Much like everything else in horse management and riding, practice makes perfect!\nRelated: Clipping 101\nThis article was originally published in Canada’s Equine Guide 2017.\nPhotos courtesy of April D.

87	hydrogel biochar soil amendment effectiveness comparison	Hydrogels and biochar show different effectiveness as soil amendments. Hydrogels, particularly PAM (polyacrylamide) gels, have variable and often short-term effectiveness, with their functional lifespan outdoors being as short as 18 months and at best only a few years. Their water-holding effectiveness decreases over time, especially when exposed to UV radiation, salts, and freeze-thaw cycles. In contrast, biochar is characterized by recalcitrant carbon that can persist in soils for years, decades, or even millennia. While hydrogels primarily focus on water retention, biochar offers multiple benefits including improving soil health, raising soil pH, remediating polluted soils, sequestering carbon, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and improving soil moisture. Additionally, hydrogels pose potential environmental risks due to their degradation products, while biochar is generally considered environmentally safe.	['Although our main interest is in the effectiveness of garden-variety hydrogels, it is important to realize how widely these compounds are used in other contexts and to understand their positiveâ€”and negativeâ€”impacts.\nThere are two broad classes of polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogels: soluble (linear) and insoluble (crosslinked). Linear PAM dissolves in water and has been successfully used in reducing irrigation-induced erosion in agricultural fields (see “Hydrogel use for erosion control”).\nCross-linked PAM does not dissolve, but forms a gel when water is added and is often used in garden, landscape, and nursery situations as a way of retaining moisture.\nInsoluble PAM products are marketed as “superabsorbent gels” or “hydrating crystals.” Instead of dissolving, these gels absorb water, swelling to many times their original size. As they dry, water is slowly released to the soil. Popular with the nursery industry and homeowners alike, these latter compounds are the focus of this article.\nHow do hydrogels work? In addition to their solubility, hydrogels are also defined by their overall chemical charge: they may be characterized by a negative (anionic), positive (cationic) or neutral charge. These charge classes are found in both linear and cross-linked PAM; the charge determines how they will react with soils and solutes. Cationic PAM hydrogels should not be used in gardens and landscapes.\nBriefly, clay components of soils have a negative charge; heavy metals have a positive charge, and other commonly found minerals in soils and water may possess either a positive or a negative charge, depending on the compound in question. Therefore, cationic PAMs (+) generally bind to clay components (-) and act as flocculants (congealers); anionic PAMs (-) cannot directly bind to clay (-) and may act as dispersants. However, anionic PAMs can bind to clay and other negatively charged particles in the presence of ionic bridges, such as calcium (Ca+2).\nHow polyacrylamide gels will act in any given situation can be hard to predict, as the chemical interactions between the gels, soil components, and dissolved substances are complex and occur simultaneously. Electrical charges, hydration levels, van der Waals forces, Linda Chalker-Scott, Ph.D. MasterGardener WSU editor Extension Urban Horticulturist and Associate Professor, Puyallup Research and Extension Center, Washington State University Puyallup, Washington and hydrogen bonding all modify the affinity of the gel for other compounds.\nThe polyacrylamide polymer contains a complex array of positively charged, negatively charged, and neutral chain segments, all with varying affinities for other molecules. The stronger the attraction between the gel and surrounding solutes and soil particles, the greater the ability of the gel to absorb water, create aggregates, and stabilize soil structure.\nThe functional lifespan of cross-linked PAM hydrogels used outdoors can be as short as 18 months and at best only a few years Unfortunately, on-the-ground conditions can prevent PAM hydrogels from functioning optimally.\nFertilizers and other dissolved substances can interfere with hydrogel water-holding capacity. Hot, dry weather conditions can lead to increased degradation and decreased effectiveness of PAM hydrogels. And for every success story, one can find a situation where hydrogels have failed to function.\nHydrogel effects on plants\nThe documented impacts of crosslinked PAM hydrogels on plant survival and establishment are variable. Some researchers report enhanced growth of crop and tree species. Presumably this enhancement is caused by improved soil water conditions, though in some cases salt tolerance is also reported. This latter ability may be due to the ability of cross-linked gels to enhance calcium ion availability, reducing the amount of sodium uptake. According to other researchers, however, PAM did not improve plant survival compared to control or other treatments, especially if performance was evaluated over time. In several cases, PAM-treated plants performed worse than the untreated controls. Moreover, excessive use of PAM can lead to nutrient deficiencies; phosphate and silicon were reduced in tomato and wheat, and this latter plant also suffered manganese and boron deficiencies when grown under high PAM concentrations.\nWhy is there such high variability among research results? I believe the cause is both environmental and temporal. Many of the positive results are drawn from studies that are short-term and/or performed under controlled conditions; for instance, one study reports on tree survival only a few months after installation. As we already know, PAM gels lose their water-holding effectiveness over time, especially when exposed to high levels of ultraviolet, salts, and freeze-thaw cycles. Positive results in the short-term may be perfectly valid for nursery plant production, where environmental conditions can be more tightly controlled, but they are not as applicable to landscapes. Indeed, it is under such conditions (e.g. revegetation of quarries and mines) over the long-term that PAM gels perform most poorly.\nAlthough synthetically produced, polyacrylamides are organic chemicals that can be degraded by both living and non-living environmental factors. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation, chemical oxidizers, fertilizer salts, mechanical abrasion, and freeze-thaw events will degrade the polymer, breaking it up into smaller fragments. These smaller fragments do not have the same properties as the larger polymers, and thus the hydrogelâ€™s water-retaining capacity and other functions are reduced and ultimately lost. Gels that are applied to soil surfaces experience these environmental stresses most frequently and will degrade most rapidly, especially in soils with high levels of solar ultraviolet. Even if gels are protected from environmental exposure, they will still be broken down by decomposition. A number of naturally occurring soil microbes have been identified as active decomposers of both soluble and cross-linked polyacrylamide gels.\nPolyacrylamides up close and very personal\nPeople are exposed to polyacrylamides every day. More than a hundred formulations are used in cosmetics such as sunscreen, shampoo, soap, lotion, and shaving cream. They are used in personal products such as denture adhesives, contact lenses, diapers, and wound dressings.\nInjectable polyacrylamide gels are becoming increasingly popular for use in plastic and reconstructive surgery, especially for facial and breast augmentation. Proponents of this application claim that the gels are non-toxic and stable.\nMore recently, PAM hydrogels have been injected directly into the urethral wall to treat stress incontinence in women. Researchers state that polyacrylamide gel “seems to be a promising new bulking agent” in treating incontinence, despite the fact that 16 of the 17 patients in the study had negative health events (such as urinary tract infection) associated with the treatment. Alarmingly, there have been dozens of studies telling of hundreds of patients with complications resulting from polyacrylamide injection, including pain, hematoma, nodule formation, gel migration resulting in tissue asymmetry or deformation, inflammation, and even cancer.\nThe recommended treatment for complications arising from injectable polyacrylamide gels is full removal of the gel and replacement with silicon. Even the most fervent advocates of PAM gels for tissue augmentation acknowledge the existence of these adverse reactions, though they place blame on human error (i.e. contaminated gel, improper technique, poor hygiene) as the underlying cause. Other researchers blame the gel itself.\nSeveral researchers have noted that it may take several months to a few years for complications to arise; thus, the impact of injectable PAM gels must be studied over time. In fact, enough negative evidence now exists that usage of PAM hydrogels in tissue augmentation surgery is forbidden in Russia and Bulgaria, where they had been used since the early 1990s.\nRegardless of arguments regarding culpability, researchers are increasingly recommending against its use for facial tissue augmentation or tissues that have not been previously operated upon. Still others call for prohibiting its use in plastic surgery and searching for alternatives.\nDecomposers include bacterial species (Bacillus sphaericus and Acinetobacter spp.) and white rot fungi (Dichomitus squalens, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and Pleurotus ostreatus).\nThe fungal species dissolve the polymer, which is then susceptible to further degradation by many other soil microbes. Itâ€™s not surprising that polyacrylamide is rapidly broken down by decomposers; one study found the average size of the polymer to be less than 25 percent of the original in only 14 days of microbial action.\nThese gels contain a significant amount of nitrogen, which is often a limiting nutrient in both aerobic and anaerobic environments. In most outdoor applications, therefore, the functional life of polyacrylamides is short; this is borne out by a number of studies that have noted decreased efficacy of field-applied polyacrylamide gels over time. If gel activity is destroyed in as little as 18 months, there should be serious reservations about its use in long-term landscape applications.\nAs the name suggests, polyacrylamides consist of many linked acrylamide units (monomers). Acrylamide is a known neurotoxin in humans and is suspected to be carcinogenic as well. During the manufacture of PAM gels, residual acrylamide is present as a contaminant and strictly regulated in the United States to levels of no more than 0.05 percent or 500 parts per million for agricultural use. However, an international study recommended that polyacrylamide gels used in cosmetics contain a residual monomer level of only 0.1 to 0.5 ppm. Therefore, the PAM hydrogels manufactured for agricultural and garden use can contain much greater concentrations of toxic acrylamide than that found in personal products.\nWhile new PAM hydrogels contain a higher initial level of acrylamide than older gels, there is bitter debate over whether the degradation of polyacrylamide gels provides a constant, significant source of environmental acrylamide.\nOn one hand there are the researchers who claim that microbes quickly metabolize the nitrogen from the polymer, eliminating the possibility of acrylamide production (acrylamide contains nitrogen). Yet others have argued that degrading gels do produce measurable levels of acrylamide, especially when exposed to elevated temperatures or high levels of solar radiation.\nIn any case, there is no question that PAM hydrogel degradation produces uncharacterized, variable polyacrylate units whose environmental and human impacts are unknown. Hydrogels and human health There are two separate, but related, human health issues relevant to PAM hydrogels: risk of polyacrylamide exposure and risk of acrylamide exposure.\nThe dangers from acrylamide exposure were briefly mentioned earlier and tend to be greatest for workers in occupations that routinely use polyacrylamide-based products such as grouts and wastewater flocculants. It is unlikely that the infrequent user of garden hydrogels will experience any significant exposure to acrylamide from this source.\nThe other health issue is that presented by exposure to the more or less intact polyacrylamide gel. Though PAM gels are much less toxic than acrylamide, chronic exposure can cause minor problems such as skin irritation and mucus membrane inflammation. More worrisome are recent reports of toxic effects of PAM both at the cellular and whole organism levels.\nAn earlier article from 1992 reported on the accidental aspiration of polyacrylamide by a patient who subsequently died from lung injuries.\nFinally, there is the issue of exposure to degrading PAM hydrogels, whose risks are entirely unknown. People most likely to be exposed to degradation products would be those involved in agricultural or nursery production where gels are commonly used and where environmental degradation would be most likely to occur.\nComwide_box piles containing potting mixes with hydrogels would also be a source of exposure. Should you be concerned about your exposure to PAM hydrogels? This is where the big picture regarding hydrogel usage becomes important. Because these Hydrogel use for erosion control Soluble polyacrylamide gels have been used for over a decade in reducing erosion and enhancing water infiltration of finetextured agricultural soils.\nUnlike “water crystals” that retain their shape as they absorb water, soluble PAM dissolves in water, forming a thin slimy film that coats the soil surface.\nIn irrigation furrows and other bare soils where irrigation can exacerbate erosion, this film protects the soil from washing away and hydrates the surface so that irrigation water can more easily permeate. Many studies have been conducted on a variety of soils in different environments, showing that agricultural PAMs are a viable (though short-term) solution to soil loss and degradation.\nOften their effectiveness can be enhanced by the addition of gypsum –a calcium source –especially in saline soils. Anionic soluble PAMs have generally been found to be more effective than cationic formulations in reducing soil erosion, which is fortunate considering the environmental toxicity of cationic gels. Certain soils and environmental conditions are antagonistic to soluble PAM gel effectiveness.\nIn general, soluble PAM gels do not work well on sandy soils, and can actually reduce infiltration, possibly due to pore blockage by the viscous gel. They may not work well on clay soils. Sodic soils decrease soluble PAM gel effectiveness since sodium prevents ion bridging and prevents soil aggregation. Neither do they perform well on slopes, often increasing runoff, and requiring either higher applications of gel or additional mulching materials to maintain effectiveness.\nUsage of soluble PAM is acknowledged to be a short-term solution to erosion; for this reason its usage should not be extended to garden and landscape use.\nMulches are demonstrably better in reducing erosion than bare soil and PAM hydrogel and provide other, additional benefits. Moreover, the soluble PAM hydrogels have no documented benefit to plant growth. As with many other agricultural production practices, soluble PAM usage does not translate well to home gardens and landscapes.\nSoil scientists R.E. Sojka and R.D. Lentz have provided a concise and informative review of linear PAM applications in agriculture; it can be found at http://polymersinc. com/polymers/pam2.htm.\nCompounds are so ubiquitous, itâ€™s likely that most of us are exposed to a number of PAM gel sources every day. Studies that estimate lifetime risks of developing cancer usually focus on only one source of exposure, such as that from usage of personal care products that contain polyacrylamide. While these individual estimates are almost always very low, there have not been analyses to determine additive risks associated with exposure to multiple sources of polyacrylamide.\nThe lack of scientific data makes it difficult to predict risks associated with exposure to polyacrylamide gels. Environmental health As a neurotoxin and carcinogen, acrylamide is dangerous not only to humans but to other organisms as well; the evidence does not need to be repeated here. Of more concern for gardeners and landscapers is the impact of PAM hydrogels on other organisms in the environment.\nCultural practices that conserve soil moisture are simple, inexpensive, safe, effective, and natural alternatives. Microbes do not appear to be negatively affected by PAM gels; indeed, we already know that gels are colonized and degraded by a number of naturally occurring bacteria and fungi. Toxicity information on terrestrial organisms (other than humans) exposed to PAM gels is nearly non-existent and therefore canâ€™t be addressed.\nSome inhabitants of aquatic systems, however, have been studied in relation to PAM gel toxicities and the news is not good. There are few indications that anionic PAM gels, used appropriately, pose a significant health threat to aquatic organisms. Cationic and neutral PAMs, however, have greater toxicities and should not be used. The charged nature of cationic PAM hydrogel is attracted to hemoglobin in fish gills, where the gel binds and suffocates the fish.\nIn addition to fish, a variety of algal and invertebrate species are also injured or killed when exposed to low levels of cationic PAMs. Since cationic PAMs may also contain higher levels of acrylamide monomer, many researchers recommend against any environmental use of cationic PAM hydrogels and in fact use of these compounds is illegal in a number of municipalities where aquatic contamination is likely.\nAlternative strategies The recognized hazards associated with cationic PAM gels, as well as those associated with residual acrylamide, have spurred many researchers to develop alternatives for agricultural and landscape usage. These alternatives include resins, paper-making by-products, and a number of polysaccharides such as gums, starches, and gels. These alternatives are more environmentally sound, and in many cases are cheaper to use and functionally superior to polyacrylamide gels.\nThe best news for those of us managing a home garden or landscape is that simple changes in management practices are often superior to using polyacrylamide hydrogels. In several cases, alternative water management strategies had higher success rates than usage of PAM. These strategies were as simple as adding 2 liters of water when planting Pinus patula seedings, or providing wind protection to reduce water stress in musk melon.\nMore commonly, mulches (especially organic) were rated superior to hydrogels in terms of erosion control, enhancing water infiltration and conservation, plant growth and establishment, and nutrient value.\nMany of the products labeled “water gel crystals” and “poly-clear” are cationic PAM gels. Not only are they more toxic to aquatic organisms and generally less effective than anionic gels in landscape situations, they can also contain higher levels of residual acrylamide.\nEven though these cationic gels are banned for many applications, they are still manufactured and sold in the United States, China, and other countries.\nCationic PAM hydrogels should not be used in gardens and landscapes. It is difficult to predict short-term effectiveness of anionic PAM hydrogels on plant survival and establishment, since the ability to absorb water is reduced by several environmental factors, especially salt, temperature extremes, ultraviolet radiation, and microbial activity.\nThe functional lifespan of cross-linked PAM hydrogels used outdoors can be as short as 18 months and at best only a few years; they cannot be regarded as long-term solutions to landscape water needs. As PAM gels degrade, they give rise to smaller, less functional polymers whose risk to people and ecosystems is unknown; they also produce some level of acrylamide, a known neurotoxin.\nLack of documented information on the nature and toxicity of degraded PAM hydrogels makes it impossible to assess human or environmental health effects.\nPeople need to be aware of their total exposure to polyacrylamides from all sources, including occupational use, garden products, and cosmetics.\nThere are a number of products and management practices that can reduce unnecessary usage of and exposure to polyacrylamide. In particular, cultural practices that conserve soil moisture are simple, inexpensive, safe, effective, and natural alternatives to PAM hydrogels.

Biochar is a stable solid, rich in carbon that is made from organic waste material or biomass that is partially combusted in the presence of limited oxygen. The qualities that make up biochar vary depending upon the material that it comes from (feedstocks; i.e., timber slash, corn stalks, manure, etc.) and the temperature at which combustion occurs. The various materials and methods to produce biochar result in a wide variety of chemical and physical properties across biochar products. To understand the properties of biochar, a user should know 1) what it was made from (i.e. the feedstock), and 2) the temperature at which it was made (i.e. 300-700C).\nA common attribute among all types of biochar is the primary ingredient: a recalcitrant carbon that can persist in soils for years or decades, and even millennia. Biochar can be used as a soil amendment by itself, or it can be blended with other soil amendments to address a wide range of environmental, agricultural, and forestry challenges. Research underway by the USDA Forest Service, USDA Agricultural Research Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and others will provide insight into how effective biochar is at binding with heavy metals and chemicals from agricultural and road runoff for the purpose of environmental remediation. Applications of biochar include improving soil health, raising soil pH, remediating polluted soils, sequestering carbon, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and improving soil moisture. Know your soil amendment goal(s), to determine which biochars are best to achieve your goals.\nThe Pacific Northwest Biochar Atlas is an online platform that helps users choose a biochar to suit soil health goals. In addition, the Atlas provides details about the benefits of biochar, case studies of over half a dozen example operations implementing biochar across the region, and a map of biochar producers to simplify access for interested users. These and other features of the Atlas help to improve information exchange, continuing education, and biochar accessibility for the Northwest.\nAdditional biochar resources:\nBiochar Basics: An A-Z Guide to Biochar Production, Use, and Benefits.

88	peach trees nectarine trees water requirements compare	Both peaches and nectarines are characterized as 'heavy drinkers' in terms of water consumption. However, specific care must be taken with peach trees, as overwatering close to harvest time can result in brown rot. For both types of trees, it's recommended to consider alternatives like pear trees if water conservation is a priority.	"['Gardening can be challenging with low water, deer and heatMay 12, 2023 12:14PM ● By Kerry Angelbuer\nAs residents of Davis County contemplate what to do with their lawn and gardens this year after a couple years of low water, extreme heat and plenty of deer, Debbie West offers good, local-oriented advice. She has worked at the Rockin’ E Country Store in Bountiful for many years and has a lot of practical experience under her belt.\nMany people may want to improve their grass which may have thinned or died during the drought. She recommends a turf seed blend that includes turf-type fescue, rye and Kentucky blue grass which will offer a “nice lawn that does not require too much water.” This blend was created by the University of Utah to be a “duraturf.” The turf-type fescue does not grow like the fescue weed that often infests grasses, but has a more pleasing look. It is a clump grass that doesn’t spread like the Kentucky blue grass and only needs to be watered once a week. West said artificial turf, looks good but is really hot. Though not as hot as concrete or stone, the artificial turf can be hot enough to cause burns so watering before playing on it might be needed.\nAlthough watering requirements may not be as strict this year, due to ample snowfall, West suggests that supplementing soil around the yard can improve plant’s ability to survive no matter what comes. She is a fan of vermiculite, heated brown rock that “expands to hold water and keeps the soil for compacting.” Humic acid has similar benefits especially for the lawn. Compost, aged organic material, or mulch, not-aged organic material can be used to improve soil and its ability to maintain water. Both are available for purchase at the Bountiful landfill for much less than local stores. West also likes coconut coir which is sold in compacted bricks that expand to 1 cubic foot or mulch. “Laying the coir over the lawn can help it maintain moisture,” she said.\nWest also recommends rain barrels for harvesting the snowmelt and rain in yards. “Since 2010, residents are allowed to collect up to 100 gallons of water in barrels and if you apply for a free water permit, you can collect up to 2,500 gallons,” she said. Most barrels are placed near a waterspout to collect water from the roof. The water passes through the atmosphere and collects nitrogen, an important chemical for plant growth.\nAs far as what to plant, West has a lot of ideas for drought tolerant plants. Grapes, for example, “hate water” and she recommends the Interlaken or nimrod variety. “Tomatoes and peppers only need to be watered two times a week if you water them down to six inches,” she said. Melons, winter squash, mustard greens, carrots and beets also do fine with low water.\nWest said that nectarines and peaches are heavy drinkers and suggests a good pear tree instead. Drought resistant flowers include geraniums, gazania, moss rose, ageratum, and zinnias. She also recommends perennials that come back every year like arabis, blue flax and cone flowers. Deer resistant plants include ornamental grasses and herbs like mint, thyme, basil and cilantro. An eight-foot fence will also deter deer.\nPutting down contractor-grade shade cloth on plant beds is also helpful, said West. She cuts an X in the cloth and adds the plant and then places the cloth right up to the base of the plant to keep weeds down. This cloth is then covered with about four inches of mulch for aesthetics. This keeps moisture in the soil by blocking the heat of the sun from evaporating surface moisture. Mulch should be larger pieces like medium bark to avoid blowing away in strong winds. λ', ""In the Garden:\nSouthern California Coastal & Inland Valleys\nThinning the fruits encourages better quality fruit and reduces the strain on tree branches.\nEarly Summer Care for Fruit Trees and Vines\nEarly summer is the time to tend to fruiting plants to get them on the path to producing the best crops possible. No matter what the summer weather brings, there are certain routines that can give these plants a good chance of staying healthy and filling our fruit bowls.\nThe best crop is not necessarily the heaviest crop. In fact, reducing the number of fruits generally improves their quality. Thin fruits on trees and vines to what you realistically expect to consume. Thin tree fruits to opposite sides of branches for balanced and more complete development with less strain on trees, especially on those bearing fruit for the first or second time. Leave at least 3 inches between apricots and plums, and 5 inches between peaches, nectarines, pears, and apples. Thin grape clusters to produce bunches of fewer but larger individual fruits, rather than many tiny ones.\nProtect Fruits From Birds\nPut netting on trees two or three weeks before the fruit begins to ripen to discourage birds from making a habit of visiting the trees. (You know they decide the fruit's ripe the very day before you do, so they get them first!) Tie the loose ends of the netting so birds don't get trapped inside.\nPaint tree trunks with a light-colored indoor latex paint to prevent sunburn damage, which then invites borers and fungus infections. Use an inexpensive brand, or thin down a more expensive one to a solution of half water and half paint.\nFinish trimming citrus trees. Fruit is produced on new wood, so remove entire branches (thinning) rather than shortening them (heading back). To redirect branches, trim them to a leaf pointing in the direction you want new growth to go.\nYou can prevent fungal and bacterial mildews and rots on grapes by pruning away some of the foliage. When grapes are pea-sized, clear away leaves about 6 inches from the bunches. This will improve air circulation and help prevent the rots from getting started. Keep leaves on the sunny south side of the clusters, however, to provide shade.\nWater citrus and avocados deeply every two or three weeks, and add a 3-inch-thick layer of mulch to maintain uniformly cool temperatures. These trees are more tender than other fruit trees and cannot withstand the stress of alternate moisture and dryness. Citrus roots grow beyond the tree's dripline, so give them a larger basin area.\nPeach brown rot may result from overwatering close to harvest, so irrigate these trees deeply but less frequently.\nFeed fruit trees approximately every three weeks during their growing season with a half or quarter dose of fertilizer to encourage them to produce fruit and grow strongly for next year's fruit.\nCare to share your gardening thoughts, insights, triumphs, or disappointments with your fellow gardening enthusiasts?

89	social anxiety disorder research methods digital tools ethical safeguards needed	Research on social anxiety disorder (affecting 6.8% of Americans) can now use advanced tools like brain scanning and digital monitoring, but ethical safeguards are crucial. While brain connectivity analysis can predict treatment outcomes with 80% accuracy, researchers must address privacy concerns and informed consent issues. This includes proper disclosure of privacy policies, compliance with federal regulations, and potentially involving tech ethicists to ensure ethical data usage. The digital health research environment is currently described as the 'Wild West,' highlighting the need for standardized regulations and protocols.	['By analyzing brain regions, researchers can predict clinical responses to cognitive behavioral therapy in patients with social anxiety. These illustrations represent the brain of someone with social anxiety. On the left brain, in red, are empirically-defined seed regions. On the right brain, red clusters identify brain regions that, when compared with the seed regions, helped predict the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy. The blue circle highlights bilateral inferior temporal/amygdala clusters. Image credit: Alfonso Nieto-Castañón and MIT News.\nBrain Scans Can Predict Success of Treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder\nFor patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD), current behavioral and pharmaceutical treatments work about half the time. After weeks of investment in therapy, about half of patients will likely still suffer with symptoms of anxiety, and have little choice but to try again with something else. This trial-and-error process — inevitable due to an absence of tools to guide treatment selection — is time-consuming and expensive, and some patients eventually just give up.\nBut new MIT research suggests that it may be possible to do better than a coin toss when choosing psychiatric therapies for patients. The study, which performed brain scans on 38 SAD patients, found that these scans contain clues that indicate, with about 80 percent accuracy, which SAD patients will do well in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), an intervention designed to help patients change thinking patterns. Use of the scans to predict treatment outcomes improved predictions fivefold over use of a clinician’s assessment alone.\n“Choice of therapy is like a wheel of chance,” says first author Susan Whitfield-Gabrieli, a research scientist in the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT. “We’re hoping to use brain imaging to help provide more reliable predictors of treatment response.”\nThe researchers used a form of brain imaging that scans patients in a state of rest. Resting-state images can be done quickly, in about 15 minutes, and reliably, since they don’t require patients to follow instructions, so they have the potential to be used in a clinical setting as a tool that helps doctors select the best treatments for patients.\n“Knowing who to give which therapy to upfront would save time, money, and health care resources,” says Greg Siegle, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who was not involved in this study. “This ability would be staggering to have at our disposal for the health care system.”\nThe findings are reported in the current issue of the journal Molecular Psychiatry. The work was carried out in the lab of principal investigator John Gabrieli, the Grover Hermann Professor of Health Sciences and Cognitive Neuroscience at MIT and a member of the McGovern Institute.\nSocial anxiety disorder affects approximately 6.8 percent of Americans, about 15 million individuals, and is the country’s third-most-common mental health disorder, according to the National Institutes of Mental Health. Its symptoms include extreme anxiety in social settings that can interfere with work and quality of life. Patients living with this disorder are also at higher risk of other psychiatric disorders, such as depression and substance abuse.\nThe study analyzed SAD patients from the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders at Boston University and the Center for Anxiety and Traumatic Stress at Massachusetts General Hospital. The patients were scanned prior to participation in 12 weeks of group-based CBT. They also were evaluated using a behavioral assessment tool called the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) before and after CBT to determine who had improved.\nIn 2013, co-author Satrajit Ghosh, a principal research scientist at the McGovern Institute, studied task-based scans of this same group of patients. He and Whitfield-Gabrieli found that scans of patients’ brains as they responded to angry or neutral faces and emotional or neutral scenes predicted CBT outcomes.\n“But task-based scans have downsides,” Whitfield-Gabrieli says: Behavioral differences among patients can affect performance. Also, task-based scans can only be used on patients who can follow a task, which excludes infants and some elderly or very ill patients.\nScanning the resting brain\nSo Whitfield-Gabrieli followed this earlier research with a study of the predictive power of resting-state imaging, which she and colleagues had also performed prior to CBT. During a resting-state scan, the patient just lies there. “That’s the beauty of it,” she says. “They’re just letting their minds wander.”\nResting-state imaging provides a look at the way a patient’s brain is wired, both structurally and functionally. For instance, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) shows which parts of the brain synchronize with one another during rest, suggesting that they are functionally connected. In addition, analysis of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) shows the underlying anatomy of the white matter tracts that interconnect distant brain regions.\nBased on findings from their earlier research, Whitfield-Gabrieli and colleagues first used resting-state fMRI to look at connections to the amygdala, the seat of fear in the brain. They found that patients with higher connectivity to the amygdala from certain other regions were more likely to have lower anxiety after CBT.\nThey then performed a second analysis of the resting-state fMRI data, this time looking across the entire brain for patterns of connectivity. This analysis revealed additional markers that were predictive of treatment. The researchers also analyzed dMRI data and found that more robust connectivity in the tract that connects visual cues with emotional responses is also predictive of improvement with CBT.\nHigher LSAS scores, which indicate more severe SAD, correlate modestly with larger improvements after CBT. In this study, each brain scan analysis had predictive value beyond the LSAS, and the three analyses together produced a fivefold improvement in predictive power over the LSAS alone.\nThe next step for Whitfield-Gabrieli and colleagues is to validate their predictive model on hundreds or possibly thousands of patients. Such a large-scale study may be possible because resting-state scans are comparable even when performed in different labs or by different researchers. Such comparisons weren’t feasible using task-based scans, which tend to vary from lab to lab.\n“Right now there’s a huge movement to create massive data sets, to share resting-state imaging data, and really change the way people do science,” Whitfield-Gabrieli says.\nOther next steps for Whitfield-Gabrieli’s group are studies to predict the success of more than one form of therapy, and to look at other psychiatric conditions, such as depression and attention disorders. “We don’t want to just know if they’re going to respond to one treatment,” she says. “We want to know which treatment is best for each patient.”\nAbout this psychology research\nFunding: The National Institutes of Mental Health and the Poitras Center for Affective Disorders Research at MIT supported this work.

Published online August 11 2015 doi:10.1038/mp.2015.109\nBrain connectomics predict response to treatment in social anxiety disorder\nWe asked whether brain connectomics can predict response to treatment for a neuropsychiatric disorder better than conventional clinical measures. Pre-treatment resting-state brain functional connectivity and diffusion-weighted structural connectivity were measured in 38 patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) to predict subsequent treatment response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We used a priori bilateral anatomical amygdala seed-driven resting connectivity and probabilistic tractography of the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus together with a data-driven multivoxel pattern analysis of whole-brain resting-state connectivity before treatment to predict improvement in social anxiety after CBT. Each connectomic measure improved the prediction of individuals’ treatment outcomes significantly better than a clinical measure of initial severity, and combining the multimodal connectomics yielded a fivefold improvement in predicting treatment response. Generalization of the findings was supported by leave-one-out cross-validation. After dividing patients into better or worse responders, logistic regression of connectomic predictors and initial severity combined with leave-one-out cross-validation yielded a categorical prediction of clinical improvement with 81% accuracy, 84% sensitivity and 78% specificity. Connectomics of the human brain, measured by widely available imaging methods, may provide brain-based biomarkers (neuromarkers) supporting precision medicine that better guide patients with neuropsychiatric diseases to optimal available treatments, and thus translate basic neuroimaging into medical practice.\n“Brain connectomics predict response to treatment in social anxiety disorder” by S Whitfield-Gabrieli, S S Ghosh, A Nieto-Castanon, Z Saygin, O Doehrmann, X J Chai, G O Reynolds, S G Hofmann, M H Pollack and J D E Gabrieli in Molecular Psychiatry. Published online August 11 2015 doi:10.1038/mp.2015.109', 'Direct-to-consumer wellness products, location-tracking apps, and access to personal data on social networks present both exciting opportunities and significant ethical worries for researchers.\n“The digital revolution is rapidly influencing how health research is conducted. We can now passively observe and record people ‘in the wild’ and 24/7,” says Camille Nebeker, EdD, MS, founder and director of UC San Diego’s Research Center for Optimal Data Ethics.\nThe use of artificial intelligence and active assisted living robots in the health sector also is increasing. “While there is amazing potential, the digital health ecosystem is not consistently regulated. We are in the Wild West of digital health research,” says Nebeker.\nThe authors of a recent paper proposed steps the scientific community can take to ensure social media data are used ethically.1 The paper was prompted in part by the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, involving allegations that the firm used data improperly obtained from Facebook to build voter profiles.\n“Many of my colleagues are conducting research using social media platforms,” says Nebeker, one of the paper’s authors.\nIRBs and researchers are struggling to navigate this new territory, sometimes unsuccessfully.\n“When something goes wrong, as it did with Cambridge Analytica, it compromises public trust and jeopardizes research that is in progress,” says Nebeker.\nThe following are two central ethical concerns:\n• Researchers may need to cover additional information during the informed consent process.\nCommercial products — such as fitness tracking devices — are used as measurement tools. This means privacy policies and terms of service should be considered.\n“These terms might influence the study risk assessment,” explains Nebeker. Potential research participants also need to factor in this information to make informed decisions.\n“In many cases, the terms of service directly conflict with the federal regulations for human subjects protections in that a participant, if harmed by the product, must agree to arbitration,” notes Nebeker.\n• Not all tech companies comply with federal requirements for research.\nFederal regulations for human subjects protections must be followed if research is funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. However, many tech companies that are involved in biomedical research are not regulated. “We need to develop common standards that govern digital health research,” says Nebeker.\nResearchers using social media data are operating in an unregulated environment. Thus, there is growing concern about potential harms. “This is another case of how technology has evolved faster than regulations,” says Sherry Pagoto, PhD, director at the University of Connecticut Center for mHealth and Social Media.\nPrivacy breaches are possible — intentional or not. “This poses risks to everyone involved: researchers, social media companies, and, most importantly, the general public,” says Pagoto.\nFor example, few Twitter users are aware that public social media posts can be used by researchers.2 Notably, the majority believe that researchers should not be able to use their tweets without consent. Also, users of commercial products do not always understand privacy implications.\n“We cannot fault them, though. These policies are very lengthy, and written in ways that are difficult to understand,” says Pagoto.\nThe following changes are needed, according to the study authors:\n• Public education on the research performed with social media data, why it is important, and how researchers protect user privacy.\n“Consultation with an expert in health tech ethics is critical if being proactive and diligent about human research protections,” says Nebeker.\nStakeholders — including researchers, IRBs, potential participants, or policymakers — may not be fully aware of how data are collected, used, or shared by social media platforms. “This lack of knowledge will influence risk assessment and information included in the informed consent process,” notes Nebeker.\n• Federal regulations on the use of social media data in research.\n“We can anticipate that the technology and research landscape will only continue to evolve, and rapidly,” says Pagoto. IRBs rely on federal regulations for guidance on the ethical conduct of research. These regulations are outdated as they pertain to the use of data generated by new technologies like social media. Thus, says Pagoto, “universities, funders, and researchers need to be more vigilant about potential harms and begin to craft guidelines for the purpose of self-policing. We need a code of conduct.”\n• “Tech ethicists” working alongside researchers as they attempt to use social media data.\nSomeone with tech ethics expertise could comment on the ethical implications specific to technology used in studies and conduct training for clinicians. “It would also be useful for these folks to advise on grant applications, even serving as consultants or co-investigators,” says Pagoto.\nSomeone on the IRB could take on this role. “But if limited expertise is available on campus, external expertise should be commissioned,” says Pagoto.\nIRBs also should have the expertise to properly review social media research. “Adequately attending to research ethics will require an investment,” says Pagoto. “We want to nudge institutions to make this investment.”\n- Pagoto S, Nebeker C.

90	What makes business records useful for decisions and sales?	Business records are useful because they provide both quantitative and qualitative information for decision-making. In cost and management accounting, these records help managers control operations, set goals, and develop strategies. When selling a business, these records become crucial for determining company worth, as they demonstrate the business's financial condition, earning capacity, and goodwill. The information helps in analyzing customer concentration, operational efficiency, and future growth prospects, which are essential factors for both ongoing management decisions and potential business sales.	"['Cost accounting is that branch of accounting which aims at generating information to control operations with a view to maximizing profits and efficiency of the company, that is why it is also termed control accounting. Conversely, management accounting is the type of accounting which assist management in planning and decision-making and thus known as decision accounting.\nThe two accounting system plays a significant role, as the users are the internal management of the organization. While cost accounting has a quantitative approach, i.e. it records data which is related to money, management accounting gives emphasis on both quantitative and qualitative data. Now, let’s understand the difference between cost accounting and management accounting, with the help of given article.\nContent: Cost Accounting Vs Management Accounting\n|Basis of Comparison||Cost Accounting||Management Accounting|\n|Meaning||The recording, classifying and summarising of cost data of an organisation is known as cost accounting.||The accounting in which the both financial and non-financial information are provided to managers is known as Management Accounting.|\n|Information Type||Quantitative.||Quantitative and Qualitative.|\n|Objective||Ascertainment of cost of production.||Providing information to managers to set goals and forecast strategies.|\n|Scope||Concerned with ascertainment, allocation, distribution and accounting aspects of cost.||Impart and effect aspect of costs.|\n|Recording||Records past and present data||It gives more stress on the analysis of future projections.|\n|Planning||Short range planning||Short range and long range planning|\n|Interdependency||Can be installed without management accounting.||Cannot be installed without cost accounting.|\nDefinition of Cost Accounting\nCost Accounting is a method of collecting, recording, classifying and analyzing the information related to cost. The information provided by it is helpful in the decision-making process of managers. There are three major elements of cost which are material (direct & indirect), labor (direct & indirect) and overhead (Production, Office & Administration, Selling & Distribution, etc.).\nThe main aim of the cost accounting is to track the cost of production and fixed costs of the company. This information is useful in reducing and controlling various costs. It is very similar to financial accounting, but it is not reported at the end of the financial year.\nDefinition of Management Accounting\nManagement Accounting refers to the preparation of financial and non-financial information for the use of management of the company. It is also termed as managerial accounting. The information provided by it is helpful in making policies and strategies, budgeting, forecasting plans, making comparisons and evaluating the performance of the management.\nThe reports produced by management accounting are used by the internal management (managers and employees) of the organisation, and so they are not reported at the end of the financial year.\nKey Differences Between Cost Accounting and Management Accounting\n- The accounting related to the recording and analysing of cost data is cost accounting. The accounting related to the producing information which is used by the management of the company is management accounting.\n- Cost Accounting provides quantitative information only. On the contrary, Management Accounting provides both quantitative and qualitative information.\n- Cost Accounting is a part of Management Accounting as the information is used by the managers for making decisions.\n- The primary objective of the Cost Accounting is the ascertainment of cost of producing a product, but the main objective of the management accounting is to provide information to managers for setting goals and future activity.\n- There are specific rules and procedure for preparing cost accounting information while there is no specific rules and procedures in case of management accounting information.\n- The scope of Cost Accounting is limited to cost data however the Management Accounting has a wider area of operation like tax, budgeting, planning and forecasting, analysis, etc.\n- Cost accounting is related to ascertainment, allocation, distribution and accounting face of cost. On the flip side, management accounting is associated with impact and effect aspect of cost.\n- Cost accounting stresses on short-range planning, but management accounting focuses on long and short range planning, for which it uses high level techniques such as probability structure, sensitivity analysis etc.\n- While management accounting can’t be installed in the absence of cost accounting, cost accounting has no such requirement, it can be installed without management accounting.\n- Branch of Accounting\n- Helpful in decision-making\n- Prepared for a particular period.\n- Not reported at the end of the financial year.\nBoth the cost accounting and management accounting are a part of accounting. They are helpful in for ensuring the smooth and efficient running of the business. On the basis of the information provided by the two entities various analysis are conducted. Cost accounting aims at reducing extra expenditure, eliminating unnecessary costs and controlling various costs. On the other hand management accounting aims at the planning of policies, strategy formulation setting goals, etc.', ""Originally published in Greenville's Upstate Business Journal\nBecause business owners are not immortal, every business faces one of two fates at some point: sale or closure. And every business owner—at least, every one we’ve known—prefers the former over the latter.\nYet, very few of the 15,000 business owners in Greenville—much less the 70,000 in all of South Carolina—have a realistic idea of what their business is worth. This knowledge is not only essential to selling a business; it can also provide a marker for gauging the ongoing success of your business while you are operating it.\nWhen you consider the value of your business, we recommend that you follow these five guideposts:\n1) Understand When A Valuation Is Essential, and What Question It Answers\nA business valuation can be useful at any point in a company’s life to reference how your organization is performing. However, in some cases, knowing your company’s worth can be the difference between maximizing opportunities and missing them entirely.\nA business valuation is critical to these major company transactions:\n- Tax or Estate Planning, where you might ask, “How do I compare my business as an asset to other things I own, like a house, life insurance policy or investment portfolio?”\n- Transfer of ownership, where people might wonder, “Will I treat everyone fairly when I give an interest in my business to a relative, employee or business partner?”\n- Sale of a Business, when the question often is, “How much will someone able to buy my business actually pay for it, and how could I affect that number?”\n2) Understand What Factors Influence Value\nTo truly understand what your company is worth, you must look beyond your balance sheet. The IRS recommends analyzing the following:\n- The nature and history of your business from inception.\n- The overall economic outlook, as well as your industry’s current and projected condition.\n- The financial condition of your business.\n- Your company’s earning capacity.\n- The existence or non-existence of goodwill or other intangible factors.\n- The book value of your company’s stock\n- Sales of the stock and size of the block of stock to be valued.\n- The market price of stocks or entities engaging in the similar line of business.\n3) Understand the Best Valuation Approach for Your Business\nThere is no universal formula for a valuation. The strategy you employ depends on why you’re pursing a valuation and the state of your company and industry. Three basic approaches are used by business valuation professionals:\n- Asset Approach: Best for distressed businesses or those that will liquidate in the near future, this approach bases a company’s value off the sum of its assets on the balance sheet—both tangible and intangible.\n- Market Approach: Ideal for large, robust and healthy companies, the market approach determines value by comparing the company against businesses within a similar industry, size or geographic area.\n- Income Approach: The income approach values a business based on its generated income and is comprised of two methods—single–period capitalization and multiple-period discounting.\nSingle-period capitalization, which involves forecasting one typical future year, is ideal if past income has been steady and would serve as a reliable indicator of future income. Multiple-period discounting forecasts three to 10 years or more in some cases, and is ideal for quantifying the value of growth plans or possible future investments. My experience is that when business owners sell to professional investors, the meat of the conversation is based on a multiple-period forecast of income, discounted to the present.\n4) Understand When To Adjust The Answer\nThe traditional three approaches will guide you to a sense of value for the whole business, but they don’t take factors like marketability and control into account. While such variables do not impact the outright value of a company, they do resonate with the interests of individual shareholders. For example, how should a grown child think about the value of her interest in a private company versus in a mutual fund? How should a minority business partner think about the value of his interest in the company when other people make the decisions?\n5) Understand How To Leverage Your Value\nOnce you get the value of your business, don’t let that knowledge sit on a shelf. I’ve found that the insight a valuation provides can serve as one of your best business tools to drive up value.\n- Dig deep into financials to get a comprehensive view of what is driving your business and what is detracting from it. Make your numbers tell the story of what you have built and where it is going.\n- Address customer concentration issues. If more than 20 percent of your revenue stream is coming from one source, diversify your income base to reduce risk.\n- Empower your team so you have well-defined leaders capable of streamlining operations and making quality decisions.\n- Delve into details of existing documents, including contracts and compliance records, to know where investors might see risks so you can address them yourself.\n- Project future growth to help guide your decision making.\nValuing a business can be a complex process—certainly more involved than can be covered in a brief column. To learn more, call a valuation expert at an accounting firm or investment bank.""]"	['<urn:uuid:3b5df8a7-7dde-4350-8a37-b359ddb8e4ab>', '<urn:uuid:11e74bf3-6081-4619-8708-5217c107ca58>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	9	79	1657
91	What makes modern emergency response equipment so expensive to acquire, and what kinds of security concerns should we have about their network connectivity?	Modern emergency response equipment is expensive due to its advanced technological capabilities. For example, the Stinger fire engine costs around £460,000 and features sophisticated capabilities like shooting water up to 80 meters, delivering 4,000 liters of water per minute, and using a hydraulic spike to penetrate building materials. Similarly, their high-tech training facility cost £367,000 to develop. However, as these modern devices increasingly connect to networks, they become vulnerable to various security threats. Connected devices can be compromised by hackers who can access sensitive data, launch spam attacks, or incorporate them into botnets for DDoS attacks. According to reports, over 40% of connected devices in homes are vulnerable to hacking, and when one device is compromised, hackers can potentially access all devices sharing the same network.	['Lancashire’s fire service is leading the way in developing groundbreaking technologies which have saved lives across the county.\nDrones, stingers that can shoot water up to 80m and a new hi-tech training facility have all recently been added to Lancashire Fire and Rescue’s arsenal.\nAnd at a time of austerity, where Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service has been forced to make around £18m of cuts to its operating budget since 2011, bosses say they make no apologies for the investment, which has already prevented several deaths.\nJustin Johnston, Deputy Chief Fire Officer for LFRS, said: “We have been through many years of austerity and a lot of the developments and innovation have been driven by this.\n“The stinger, for example, has been a significant investment for the fire service, but it speeds up response times and reduces the amount of time we need to stay at an incident for. Ultimately this helps to save resources.\n“Expensive in itself isn’t a bad thing, it’s about delivering on that expense.”\nThe pioneering Stinger technology, which has been trialled for the last 12 months, is said to cost around £460,000 and the LFRS is currently the only service in the country to benefit from this technology..\nThe Stinger, which was developed in association with Rosenbauer UK, serves as a regular fire engine and deals with house fires, road traffic collisions and the range of emergencies.\nBut in addition, it is able to jet water a distance of 80 metres onto a fire from a maximum height of 16.5 metres. It can also deliver around 4,000 litres of water a minute directly onto a fire - the equivalent of around thirty seven and a half bath tubs.\nIt has a hydraulically-powered “Stinger” spike mounted on the articulated boom of the appliance which can drive through slates, tiles and other building composites, spraying water jets directly onto the fire.\nJustin Johnston said: “Trialling the Stinger at Blackburn proved the worth of an innovative design, delivering outstanding performance at the incidents it has been assigned to and fully justifying our belief in the importance of keeping abreast of changing technologies.\n“Following the successful trial period we purchased the prototype Stinger, which has remained at Blackburn Fire Station. A second Stinger is on order, to be based in another part of the County, as yet to be decided.”\nIn 2016 a military grade drone was bought by the LFRS and Lancashire Police at a cost of around £60,000.\nThe drone – an Aeryon Skyranger – is one of the most advanced in the world and features a high-definition zoom lens, Infra-Red vision and day and night flying ability.\nFire services revealed that the drone is used almost on a daily basis to help search for missing people and had been directly responsible for saving three people’s lives.\nIn November 2017 the drone located a missing 73-year-old dementia patient who was suffering from hypothermia and other injuries. Paramedics estimated he had about an hour to live when the crew found him in Freckleton.\nAssistant Fire Chief Justin Johnston said: “The partnership with Lancashire Constabulary to operate a drone has proved its worth time and time again at a number of major fires and missing person incidents.\n“We are the first Fire and Rescue Service to locate a missing person using the drone, which is a great accolade and further endorses the wisdom of investing in new resources.”\nLancashire Fire and Rescue Service says that overall these new additions showcase it as a leader in training facilities.\nThe addition of the drone and the Stinger, they add, makes Lancashire a safer place to live, work and visit.\nGallery Three - Multi-compartment Training Prop\nAs well as investing in new technology to use in emergencies, LFRS also has new state-of-the-art training facilities.\nThe multi-compartment live fire prop, also known as Gallery Three, was launched by LFRS in September 2017.\nThis is a suite of metal shipping containers put together to create a multi-roomed, multi-level building which enables trainers to carry out realistic, safe and repeatable fire scenarios for trainees.\nGallery Three cost around £367,000 to develop but bosses at the fire service say it has enabled over 1,000 firefighters to become much more effective in putting fires out and rescuing casualties.\nTraining Manager Mark Warwick said: “We can control the conditions and make them how we want them to look. For example we can simulate what it looks like when there’s a back-draft scenario.\n“We want to make sure our firefighters’ competency is on point at all times and the only way we can do that is to bring them in and assess them.\n“Gallery Three helps us to make sure that our guys know what they’re doing in realistic training facilities.\n“It has been a god-send to us to be honest, and it’s only just developing and evolving - it’s been exactly what we want it to be.”', 'Technology is exciting. We’re more connected than ever before, and things we thought impossible not long ago have become part of everyday reality.\nBut with all that Internet of Things (IoT) excitement also comes potential risk.\nBelow, we’ll take a look at IoT security and how you can protect your devices and yourself.\nWhat are IoT devices?\nIoT devices are any item that has the ability to connect to and share data with a network or another item. It might sound high-tech, but you likely have more than one IoT device in sight right now. You’re probably even using an IoT device to read this content (unless you’ve printed this on paper). According to some estimates, there are nearly 27 billion IoT devices in the world.\nWhat are some examples of IoT devices? Smartphones, computers, tablets, smart thermostats, connected irrigation, smart cars, video cameras, drones, jet engines, connected light bulbs … the list goes on and on.\nCan there be IoT security issues?\nBecause IoT devices connect with others and transmit data back and forth, this also makes them prone to potential digital security threats.\nPotential IoT security threats\nWondering why IoT security is important? Take a look at potential risks to get an idea:\n- Outbound spam – Ever get a weird Facebook message or email, seemingly from someone you know? It could be spam. Unprotected devices make you prone to spam “takeovers,” which send out messages on your behalf. Back in 2014, for example, a connected refrigerator was hacked and started sending spam via email.\n- Botnets – An IoT botnet is a network of devices that have been hacked and connected to one another. Hackers do this to share data between devices without the owners knowing. They administer distributed-denial-of-server (DDoS) attacks, which is what hackers do to attack and take out servers. A 21-year-old from Washington, along with two co-conspirators, created the notorious Satori botnet which launched several DDoS attacks throughout 2017 and 2018.\n- Data leaks – With so much data being shared, this opens the possibility of that information being compromised. This includes passwords, personal information and even your physical location. (Luckily, there ways you can protect your online identity from these types of threats.)\n- Home “intrusions” – According to one report, more than 40% of homes have at least one device that’s vulnerable to hackers. If hackers get into one device, they can access every other device sharing the same network. This gives them access to information you’d want to keep private, like your IP address, which can reveal your physical address. They can also spy on your internet activity, getting potential access to credit card and other sensitive information.\n- Vehicle takeover – Connected cars are more prone to auto theft. Hackers can control your car, see your driving habits and monitor your internet activity. Two hackers, for example, developed a way to hack into a connected Jeep and virtually drive it off the road.\nBeyond hackers, companies that make IoT devices can also sneak in user permissions and agreements to sharing data with marketers and advertisers. While this might not technically be an IoT security risk, it can be considered a breach of privacy. Not to mention creepy!\nSo, how secure are IoT devices?\nIt really depends, both on the device and how you use it.\nAre there some IoT security tips?\nLuckily, there are IoT security measures you can take to beef up your protection:\n- Use strong passwords – “123456” is the most common password in the world. If you use that, you’re an easy target for any individual. It is your first line of defense, after all. Create strong, unique passwords, with a combination of letters, numbers and special characters (when allowed), to mitigate your vulnerability.\n- Install security software – Security apps and software programs can protect your devices from harmful malware, ransomware, viruses and other online threats.\n- Set your privacy and data preferences – Many devices have their own unique IoT security settings you can adjust to make sure you’re protecting yourself. Only share the data that seems necessary, and deny overreaching permissions.\n- Change your IP address – You can browse via a virtual private network (VPN) which will disguise your device location by changing your IP address. Instead of browsing on a vulnerable public network, this makes it more difficult for hackers to know where you are and access your tech.\n- Mind your devices – It may seem silly and minor, but something as simple as leaving your phone unattended at the pool or coffee bar can be a risk. It makes you susceptible to curious minds around you — potentially with bad intentions.']	['<urn:uuid:9c1f5c35-8036-4fc7-9c7f-0adea0b68890>', '<urn:uuid:85210e56-60b9-4b21-9fbe-bc100fa66b91>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	23	126	1601
92	Why do microwaves need a turntable to cook food?	Microwaves need turntables because they do not cook uniformly. Microwaves bounce off walls creating wave patterns with peaks and troughs. Food near these points gets most energy while parts in between get little. The turntable rotates food to ensure it contacts different wave points, making it essential for safe, even cooking.	"[""You do not currently have any recently viewed products\nMost microwave turntables are made of glass and can easily be removed from the microwave for cleaning. However, this also means that it is not uncommon for turntables to become damaged or broken.\nReplacing a broken microwave turntable is a very simple repair. Most turntables simply slot into position. Our quick finder is the easiest way to find the replacement turntable that's right for your microwave. Simply enter the brand of microwave you have and the model number.\nIf you don't know your model number it will usually be printed on the appliance in one of the following places; on the inside of the door, behind the door on the main unit or on the back of the microwave.\nOnce you have entered the above information a list of suitable turntables will be displayed along with specifications for each, including the diameter of the turntable.\nThe below steps will help you get your microwave looking as good as new\nIf you use your microwave regularly then the odd spill is inevitable. The microwave can be tricky to clean, especially if you have allowed the spill to cool and it has baked on the microwave walls. Fortunately there is an easy way to loosen microwave grime that makes cleaning a breeze.\nRemove the build up of splatter in your microwave the easy way:\nStep 1: Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into a microwavable dish.\nStep 2: Add roughly 300ml of water and microwave on full power for 5 - 10 minutes until the steam condenses on the microwave walls.\nStep 3: Step 3: Simply, wipe clean using a dry cloth.\nAlternatively there are a wide range of microwave cleaning products available.\nIf the turntable in your microwave oven has stopped rotating then it could be due to a number of things.\nHere are a few things to check:\n1. Ensure the turntable is resting on the guide correctly. If you have placed something heavy on top of the turntable it can cause it to slip off the guide. This is a very simple problem to correct, simply lift up the turntable and reposition on the guide.\n2. Check that the rollers for the guide have not become blocked. Occasionally bits of food or spills within the microwave can become jammed in the guide rollers which stop them from turning. If this is the case, you simply need to clean the rollers.\nMicrowave turntables are important as the design of microwave ovens means they do not cook uniformly. To understand why the turntable is needed, first you need to know how microwaves work.\nDuring the cooking process microwaves bounce of the inside walls to set up complex wave patterns. Microwaves have peaks and troughs, much like any wave, and the intensity is greatest at these points. Food near the peaks and troughs get most of the microwaves energy while the parts of food in between get very little - leading to uneven cooking.\nThe turntable helps to combat this problem by rotating the food to ensure that it comes into contact with different points of the wave. For this reason, the turntable is an essential component of safe microwave cooking and if it breaks or stops turning it is important you get it repaired or replaced before continuing to use the microwave.""]"	['<urn:uuid:b31d09a6-17d8-4653-ab11-27b15ae5618b>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	9	51	561
93	blade types wood metal differences	Different materials require specific blade types for optimal cutting. For wood cutting with a jigsaw, a fine-toothed blade with 10-12 TPI produces clean cuts, while a coarse-toothed blade with 1 TPI offers faster cutting. Metal cutting requires blades with higher TPI (32-35) due to the material's hardness. In bandsaw blades, the tooth form varies - skip tooth blades (3, 4, and 6 TPI) are best for rip cutting wood, while regular/triangular tooth blades (10 TPI or more) are suitable for plywood, MDF, and metals. For non-ferrous metals, 14, 24, and 32 TPI blades are recommended with slow cutting speeds.	['The jigsaw is essential equipment to have in your workspace. Not only is it one of the most powerful tools of the trade, but it is also versatile enough to cut through a myriad of materials: wood, plastics, metals, and others. A good woodworker would not rely on his or her saws alone though. Bringing out your best work and minimizing the dangers the jigsaw might inflict on others (because let’s be honest, the blade is not the safest thing in the planet) necessitates that you know how to operate it properly.\nUsing a jigsaw with little background and regard to safety is a very foolish thing to do. Do not be that person — get to know the powerful thing that is in your collection, and make the most out of your purchase. If you have not decided on one yet, you can check out our list of the best jigsaws currently in the market here: https://www.sawinery.net/jigsaw/best/.\nAre you a new woodworker? Did you just expand your tools and now have a powerful jigsaw at your disposal? Are you wondering if there are any steps you’re missing? The following should be able to help you, so read along.\nWHAT ARE THE STEPS I SHOULD FOLLOW TO USE THE JIGSAW EFFECTIVELY?\nStep 1: Find the right blade for your jigsaw.\nThe blade is the most important component of your jigsaw, but it would not be the same for every material you intend on cutting. The thickness of the material is the factor that should be considered. Cutting with a blade that can get through it will make your life easier. Generally, the lower the teeth per inch (TPI) is, the more aggressive and faster the cut becomes. Also, depending on the jigsaw model, the appropriate blades can be T-shaped or U-shaped and are often made of carbon steel. You can check the manufacturer’s provided manual to verify the information if you are unsure.\nIf you want clean cuts on wood, choosing a fine-toothed blade with 10-12 TPI should do the trick. If speed is more important for you, then you can switch into a coarse-toothed blade which usually has 1 TPI. Meanwhile, cutting metal would be best done with a blade that has more TPI because the material is harder. Generally, these take the form of blades with 32-35 TPI.\nStep 2: Prepare other necessary materials.\nWhen cutting different materials using a jigsaw, you would not be relying on the jigsaw alone to do your job perfectly and safely. There are other materials necessary here, such as the wood, metal, or plastic you will be applying the jigsaw on. Others are necessary for keeping you safe, including a mask, goggles, and earplugs. The task would also inevitably produce plenty of debris and dust — you can prepare ahead by putting tarpaulins or similar materials on the floor to easily collect these and organize your workshop.\nStep 3: Mount the jigsaw blade properly.\nFeel free to seek the assistance of a professional if you are afraid that you might do the mounting wrong, but you should have no problems if you follow the manual on how the install the blade on the jigsaw. The steps can be different depending on the age of the tool. For newer jigsaws, the steps should be more straightforward using a push lever and clamp. Older models might require having a screwdriver handy. For the process to be safe, make sure that the jigsaw is unplugged. Develop the habit of unplugging your jigsaw when it is not in use to avoid accidentally turning it on.\nStep 4: Measure and trace lines on your chosen material.\nDo not go right into plugging and cutting your material of choice. To ensure accuracy, planning has to take place first. Do measurements of the material regardless if it is plastic, wood or metal that you are working with and then mark the cutting features with lines using either a pen or a pencil. Doing this first will also make the job easier, and the shapes that your materials can be cut into are plenty enough.\nStep 5: Secure your chosen material using a clamp or a workbench.\nWondering when to turn on the jigsaw? That step should be next after the material you will be cutting is positioned on a surface using clamps. This will ensure that it will not move around while you are applying the jigsaw on it. The clamps should be as sturdy or more than a C-clamp and you can use as many as you deem necessary. With clamps in place, cutting with a jigsaw should produce fewer vibrations.\nStep 6: Plug in or insert the battery pack of the jigsaw.\nIt’s time to turn on your jigsaw. Many would have to be plugged in a power source, while others would depend on a battery. It is worth reiterating that the jigsaw should be unplugged or the battery must be removed in case the tool is not in use. When using a jigsaw that has to be connected to an electric socket, make sure that the cord can extend into a comfortable length to reach your workbench. Once done, find the power trigger for the jigsaw which is usually located on its handle. Depending on the model, the jigsaw would come with a lock switch so that you would not have to hold the trigger the entire time that you are doing the cut.\nStep 7: Set the speed for the jigsaw.\nSimilar to choosing the appropriate blade for your jigsaw, setting the speed would depend on the material of your choosing. A lower setting would be appropriate for sturdier materials like metals; even if the job is done gradually, you are ensured that the process would be safe. Wood would not require a lower setting, but you can go with whatever you are comfortable with. If you are just a beginner with the jigsaw, going slow would ensure more accurate cuts. Check if your jigsaw comes with a variable-speed trigger so that you can squeeze as light or as strong as necessary.\nStep 8: Guide your jigsaw through the marks on the material to be cut.\nRemember the measurements and traces that were done earlier? This step is where they come in handy. Start by the material’s edge and then slowly follow the lines. Do not put too much pressure on the jigsaw regardless of the cut you are trying to achieve as this may result in a broken blade. This goes without saying, but keep a considerable distance between the blade and your fingers.\nStep 9: Apply finishing touches.\nAfter following the cuts you wanted to make, it would not hurt to remove any excess sections that do not follow your plan. This can be done with the blade of your jigsaw, or sanding materials. This should also help smoothen the rough edges of your work.\nStep 10: Store your jigsaw properly and clean your workspace.\nWhen you are sure when you are done for the day, remove your finger from the trigger and let the blade stop completely. Proceed to unplug the jigsaw from its power source or remove the battery pack if the model allows you to do so. Store the jigsaw in its proper place and away from sight, especially if you have children. Keep your workshop clean by promptly collecting the dust and debris scattered as a result of cutting with your jigsaw.\nCompared to other types of saws, the jigsaw falls on the safer side of the spectrum. Still, this is not an excuse to not observe precautions when using the tool, especially when it operates with an exposed blade. Perfecting the cut with it should be preceded by operating the machine safely. By placing importance on the proper blades and safety materials as well as using these general steps and studying the product manual closely, you should be able to encounter little to no problems with your jigsaw.', 'Choosing The Right Bandsaw Blade\nAll about Axcaliber blades\nNew bandsaw owner? The blade supplied on your machine will not last forever, so eventually you will need to take the plunge and purchase a new bandsaw blade. To save you time and money, take a look through this guide and make the right choice first time.\nWatch Axminster Expert Craig Steel talk through the production and manufacture of Axcaliber bandsaw blades. Manufactured in Axminster, using advanced CNC machining and specialised heat treatment, Axcaliber offers a wide range of high-quality bandsaw blades designed to meet all requirements.\nPoints to consider\nThe most obvious piece of information you need to know is “how long is my blade?” This should be on the spec label on your machine, or in the instruction book. If you have neither, please call us for advice.\nSecondly, you need to choose the width of blade. Always use the widest blade possible – it is stronger and will withstand greater feed pressures without flexing. Consult your machine manual for the maximum and minimum blade widths that it will accept.\nIf you are a woodturner, cutting bowl blanks with a bandsaw is both safe and effective. However, you will need to choose a blade that will cut the radius you need.\nThe minimum radius of curve for each blade width is as follows:\n|63mm (2 1/2″)\n|27mm (1 1/16″)\nAnd, don’t forget. A blade used for a batch of cutting bowl blanks will not be much use for straight cutting. Cutting curves will disturb the set of the teeth on the blade, consequently making it impossible to cut in a straight line. So we advise you to keep your bowl blank cutting blades separate from other blades. We also have a specialist curve cutting blade, the Back Tooth blade, for details see below.\nTooth form & pitch\nThe third area to consider is tooth form and pitch. This will depend on the type of work you intend to do, i.e. rip cutting (with the grain) or cross cutting (across the grain). Generally, a skip tooth blade is used for rip cutting, whereas a regular or triangular tooth blade is for cross cutting.\nThe skip tooth is provided on coarse tooth blades, those with 3, 4 and 6 teeth per inch; it has a wide shallow gullet with plenty of space for waste to collect. Please note that the quality of the cut can be adversely affected by sawdust packing between the teeth.\n3 tpi (skip form)\nUsed for deep cutting especially rip cuts. This blade will leave a rough sawn finish although slow feed rate and high tension will improve the finish of the cut.\n4 tpi (skip form)\nGood for general-purpose use with a degree of cutting across the grain and with the grain. A reasonable finish can be achieved with slower feed rates and good tension.\n6 tpi (skip form)\nThe ideal general purpose blade suitable for cross cutting up to 150mm and ripping in sections up to 50mm thick, although thicker sections can be cut using slow feed.\nThe regular, or triangular, tooth form is provided on blades with 10 or more teeth per inch where, because of the reduced material removal, there is less need for waste storage.\n10 tpi (regular)\nGood for cutting plywood and MDF as well as non-ferrous metals and plastics. The finish is good when cutting natural timbers, but the feed rate should be slow and maximum depth of cut should not exceed 50mm. When cutting metals, reduce the speed as much as possible especially when cutting ferrous metals or cast iron.\n14, 24 and 32 tpi (regular)\nA very clean cutting blade for plywood, plastics and MDF, although too fine for natural timbers unless they are very thin sections (sub 25mm thick). The 14tpi and above blades are very good to use at slow speeds when cutting non-ferrous metals. A slow feed speed should be used at all times with a blade tooth pitch this fine.\nBlades with variable pitch teeth (4-6tpi, 6-10tpi and 10-14tpi) are also available for wider ranging applications (see Premium Bandsaw Blades).\nNow you have made the three basic choices, we will guide you through the types of blades that we offer. Depending on the length of blade required, it can be an easy choice or a little more complex. For machines with a blade length up to 70 1/12”, we supply high carbon blades only. This is because small machines need a highly flexible blade to accommodate small diameter wheels and relatively low power motors. High carbon steel bandsaw blades are often known as “Standard Blades”. Standard blades are best described as general purpose and are fit for all those normal tasks in the workshop where a smooth, good quality, ‘no fuss’ performance is required, day in and day out.\nOur “Standard Blades” are the unique Ground Tooth (GT) design. This newly developed material is designed for the production user with high feed rates of cutting and is ideally suited to the rigours of running on two wheels. The diamond ground teeth are so unbelievably sharp (they stay sharper for at least 30% longer) that the blades work extremely well in all materials giving an exceptionally high quality finish and clean cut. The GT range is designed for general purpose board and cross grain cutting work.\nIts sister range for rip cutting is the Freshcut 37. The teeth are precisely diamond ground, before going through a hardening process, then annealed for flexibility and finally the stock straightened by a machine process. This produces a super sharp, hard tooth, with the benefits of a long cutting life and a smooth, quiet cut. The teeth have a light set which gives a narrow kerf and reduces the waste produced whilst the hook configuration provides maximum penetration. These blades are perfect for ripping all types of timber, producing veneers and boards, the ground teeth retaining their edge far longer than normal milled tooth blades - a unique bandsaw concept.\nIf you hit the occasional nail with your bandsaw blade, it invariably happens just after installing a new one! No longer a problem with these Premium Bandsaw blades! They use M42 High Speed Steel with 8% cobalt which has been welded to a spring alloy steel backing. This results in a material that has a far greater resistance to heat and abrasion, therefore giving improved cutting performance in those materials that might have proved troublesome with a Standard blade. All types of material can be cut with ease, including abrasive timbers such as teak as well as man-made boards like MDF and chipboard, where the glue used has little, if any effect on the life of the blade. M42 blades are so resilient that reclaimed timber presents no difficulties, as the blade will slice easily through the odd nail buried under the surface.\nFor woodturners, we have a unique blade concept, the Back Tooth bandsaw blade. Woodturners often prepare their own blanks, which is where the back tooth blade becomes particularly useful, as it has been specifically developed for curvature cutting. The teeth on the rear of the blade are not sharp to handle but have the effect of clearing the back of the cut by widening the kerf, enabling a much tighter curve to be cut making them an ideal choice for preparing timber for the lathe. Available only in 8mm 4 tpi configuration which is suitable for almost all machines.\nFor deep rip cutting work we offer the Ripper 37 blade. Specifically intended for wood processing and deep ripping tasks, fitting only a few larger machines where motors of sufficient capacity are able to handle the 32mm wide blade. The teeth are precision ground using CNC machinery and then induction hardened. Furthermore, to ensure a very long working life, each blade can be re-sharpened up to twenty times, offering the best possible cutting performance.\nWhere are Axcaliber bandsaw blades made?\nThe answer is, right here in Axminster. All Axcaliber blades are made from UK sourced stock, sized, welded, finished and packed in our own engineering production facility in Axminster. Carefully chosen production techniques and constant quality control checks ensure each blade will exceed your expectations. And if the weld breaks under normal use, we will replace the blade, no quibbles.']	['<urn:uuid:4c35ee9d-52d7-41ec-912c-db49291c7266>', '<urn:uuid:b0c9c057-1ddc-4ced-8a8f-6d2497dc018f>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	5	99	2713
94	How do investigators use patterns in dates and times to predict when future crimes might happen?	Investigators look for patterns in days of the week, days of the month, bi-weekly occurrences, and patterns around paydays or end of month. Even when patterns become irregular, they are still analyzed. For example, with mail theft, they check when checks are typically received. By examining these Modus Operandi patterns, analysts can make predictions about the dates and times of future criminal events.

95	sorting systems benefits facility space requirements	Sortation systems reduce manual labor and increase efficiency while lowering operating costs. For facility space requirements, some sorters like bomb bay sorters can fit into narrow spaces with sort locations positioned under the track, while the warehouse layout must effectively utilize available space by maximizing storage areas and ensuring proper flow of goods and equipment.	['Equipment 101: Sortation equipment\nCrossbelt sorters can typically handle product weighing up to 100 pounds and process up to 200 pieces per minute, regardless of their shape, size and surface characteristics.\nThere are many ways to automatically sort products as they move through warehouses and distribution centers. Sortation solutions range from basic pushers and diverters that sort fewer than 30 cartons per minute to sophisticated high-speed sorters that handle as many as 450 items per minute. The right sortation solution depends on the product you’re moving and your need for speed.\nSortation systems automatically sort products as they move through a facility. They reduce the manual labor needed to prepare for palletizing, packing, shipping and other industrial operations. In addition, sortation systems can increase efficiency and provide more accurate fill rates, lower return rates and operating costs. All of these benefits add up to lower prices and faster delivery to the consumer.\nSo, which sortation solution is right for you? “Not all sortation technology is ideal for all types of items,” explains Tim Kraus, product manager for Intelligrated. Among the factors to consider, says Kraus, are the types of items to be sorted, the packaging, item diversity and predictability. Most sortation systems can handle a variety of product, but aspects such as size, weight, balance or shape of product may rule out certain sortation technologies, adds Kraus.\nHere’s a look at some of the most common types of sortation systems.\nNot every facility needs to move product at vision-blurring rates. In many cases, slow-speed sortation is enough to meet the requirements.\nSlow-speed sortation systems, the slowest and least expensive sorters, work in conjunction with standard belt or roller conveyor lines. These sorters typically handle fewer than 30 cartons or totes per minute.\nOne example of a slow-speed sorter is a deflector arm. In this design, an arm or paddle sits alongside a conveyor line, opposite a divert point. As a carton approaches, the arm swings out across the conveyor, catching the carton and channeling it off at an angle.\nA generous amount of space is needed between cartons to avoid traffic jams behind a deflector arm sorter. These deflectors can be used in a “slug mode” with the arm staying in place to divert a string of cartons down the same divert point.\nAnother example of a slow-speed sorter is a pusher. A pusher is mounted at the side of a conveyor line, directly across from a divert point. When a product reaches the divert point, the pusher springs out across the conveyor, pushing the product off at a right angle.\nPushers are faster than deflector arms because they don’t require as much space between cartons. But fast pushers can pack too much of a punch, so they are not recommended for cartons with fragile contents.\nMedium-speed sortation handles about 30 to 200 items per minute. There are a number of styles of sorters available for sorting cartons or totes at these moderate speeds. Among the most popular are pop-up sorters. These linear sorters usually move products down the line on belt conveyor. When the product reaches its divert location, wheels or rollers pop up under the product, lift it slightly above the conveyor surface, and power it off the conveyor, usually at a 30 to 45 degree angle.\nA common style of pop-up wheel sorter uses a wide conveyor belt that ends at a divert point and begins again right after the divert point, creating a gap in the conveyor. The gap is filled with several rollers that extend the width of the conveyor. Between those rollers are powered, angled wheels that sit below the level of the conveyor.\nWhen a carton reaches the gap in the conveyor, one of two things happen:\n1. The angled wheels remain in place and the carton continues moving forward—across the rollers and onto the next section or conveyor, or\n2. The angled wheels rise up under the product, lifting it slightly off the conveyor. The wheels then rotate, diverting the carton off the line.\nAn alternate style of pop-up sorter uses multiple narrow conveyor belts instead of one wide belt. At each divert point, angled wheels are positioned in the gaps between narrow belts.\nThese wheels sit below the level of the conveyor until they’re needed to divert a carton. When a product reaches the divert point, the angled wheels rise up under the product and divert it.\nPop-up style sorters work best for sorting cartons or other items with firm, flat bottoms. Other items, like poly bags, that have inconsistent surfaces are better handled with sliding shoe sorters. Sliding shoe sorters are more expensive, but they are a better choice for fragile items and can be run at slower speeds if high throughput isn’t necessary.\nWhen speed is of the essence, high-speed sorters can divert about 150 to 450 items or cartons per minute, or up to 27,000 cartons per hour. Products can be inducted to the sorter manually or automatically using induction conveyor.\nWhen it comes to induction, the faster you go, the more exact you have to be with product placement onto the sorter, explains Kevin Thuet, director of systems development for TGW Systems. “If you don’t place that box exactly—or push that load exactly—it will spin and you could have an error and you won’t realize the desired rates.”\nHigher speed means a higher level of technology and sophistication, but speed, without consideration of other factors such as gapping, gentle handling and accuracy, can actually be an inefficient use of the technology, says Intelligrated’s Kraus.\nThere are four common types of high-speed sorters. Tilt-tray, crossbelt and bomb bay sorters are typically used to sort individual items to workstations such as packing stations or returns processing stations. The fourth type of high-speed sorter, a sliding shoe sorter, usually handles larger cartons and totes.\nTilt tray, crossbelt and bomb bay sorters operate under similar principles, and each type of sorter has the same foundation: a looped track with individual carriages riding on the track.\nIn a tilt tray sorter, each carriage holds a wooden or plastic tray. Items arrive at the sorter and are released one at a time onto the trays. An item moves around the track until it reaches its intended divert location. Its tray then tilts to one side and gravity pulls the item off the tray. Items usually slide onto a chute or onto a takeaway conveyor positioned at the side of the sorter. The tray then rights itself and is ready to accept another item for sorting.\nA crossbelt sorter works on the same basic principle, except instead of a tray, each carriage in the systems holds a 2- to 3-foot cell of belt conveyor powered by a small motor. When an item reaches the divert location, the motor moves the conveyor, discharging the item sideways off the sorter into a chute or onto a takeaway conveyor.\nIn a bomb bay sorter, each carriage on the track holds a flat tray that has a split down the middle. When an item reaches its intended location, the two sides of the tray swing down and apart, dropping the item into a chute or container positioned directly below the sorter.\nBomb bay sorters are generally less expensive than tilt tray or crossbelt sorters, but they also have the lowest throughout. And while tilt tray and crossbelt sorters can accommodate long items by allowing one item to span across two trays or two belts, bomb bay sorters are limited to small items. And, the items have to be able to tolerate the drop without being damaged.\nAdditionally, bomb bay sorters have unique benefits when there are space constraints in a facility. These sortation systems can fit into very narrow spaces because sort locations are positioned directly under the sorter track.\n“We’re seeing more and more bomb bay sorters in use,” says Mike Hahn, vice president of Knapp Logistics & Automation. “In certain applications they are very good performers. In terms of cost, they provide a good value to customers. In terms of space, this type of equipment is very good because the chutes are underneath not on the side. Bomb bay sorters are very space efficient when limited space is available.”\nWhile crossbelt sorters are the most expensive of these high-speed options, they also offer the most product control because they use their own power to divert products rather than relying on gravity. This means the sorter can go faster and the divert locations can be placed closer together.\nA tilt tray sorter requires more space between divert locations than a crossbelt sorter, but it also has fewer moving parts, making it less expensive and easier to maintain.\nSorting cartons at high speeds usually requires a sliding shoe sorter. Instead of being configured in a loop, a sliding shoe sorter is linear: products enter at the beginning of the line and are diverted before they reach the end of the line.\nThe bed of a sliding shoe sorter is essentially a length of metal slat conveyor with a small rubber clock (called a shoe) mounted on each slat. In most designs, the shoes line up along the side of the conveyor opposite the divert locations. The conveyor carries a carton along the line, and when the carton reaches its divert location, several shoes are activated. The shoes slide across the slats and push the carton off the side off the sorter, usually at a slight angle.\n“The number of shoes activated depends on the size of the item being transferred,” says Joe O’Connor, director of marketing for Automotion, a Wynright company. The rule of thumb, says O’Connor, is for the whole carton to be impacted by the shoes, with a shoe out front and a shoe behind, sometimes even two out front and behind, to prevent the product from spinning. The idea is as the shoe slides across the conveyor, it’s guiding the carton and changing its orientation at the same time.\nAn alternate design places shoes down the center of the conveyor and pushes cartons in either direction.\nA sliding shoe sorter usually sorts 200 to 300 cartons per minute, depending on the characteristics of the product and on how closely the induction system spaces the cartons.\nA key component of most sortation systems is a fixed-position bar code scanner. The scanner identifies each carton or item on the conveyor and sends that information to the sortation system controls. The controls have been pre-programmed with the destination of each product and can activate the sortation mechanism when the product arrives at its designated divert point.\nThe smaller the item, the more scanners or sensors you need to ensure the item is seen, explains Mark Wolkenfeld, vice president of GBI Data & Sorting Systems. This is also the case with items like polybags because a sensor can go right through it, he adds.\nSensors and scanners can go a step further, says Wolkenfeld. If the product being sorted is particularly valuable, or if there’s a question about product movement, sensors can even be put in the chutes themselves to confirm that the item was accurately diverted.\nAs systems have been pushed to continually increase rates, sortation system suppliers have worked to increase throughput without increasing machine speed, explains Intellgrated’s Kraus. This makes the machine control system much more critical on sliding shoe and pop-up wheel sorting technologies, and it reduces wear, energy usage and noise while extending equipment life.', 'Warehouse Layouts Can Improve Efficiency\nPlanning a warehouse layout design can be a complex process due to the various factors involved. This process includes strategically planning a facility layout that can properly utilize the space available, facilitate the smooth functioning of operations, and increase efficiency.\nDesigning a practical warehouse layout is a crucial process as it has a direct impact on the efficiency and productivity of your warehouse. The planned layout should arrange the processes in a logical sequence that can help streamline operations, boost productivity, and reduce expenses. A well-executed warehouse layout design can provide easy access to stored goods, minimize travel time, and improve order fulfillment rates.\nAdditionally, it is vital to consider all the requirements according to your business needs during the planning phase itself. This is because altering the planned layout once the construction of your facility starts is costly due to the additional material and labour costs involved.\nPrinciples to Consider While Designing Your Warehouse Layout\nConsidering the principles below can help you design an efficient layout and streamline warehouse operations. Here are some of the most crucial factors to consider:\nBefore starting with the design of your warehouse layout, it is essential to assess all your business requirements, review associated budgets, and then plan the layout accordingly. During this process, you might come across some layout designs that are more comprehensive and expensive than others, but it is recommended that you consider the most suitable and cost-efficient solution for your warehouse.\nEffectively utilizing the warehouse space available can help improve inventory visibility, reduce travel time, and increase overall operational efficiency. When designing your warehouse layout, it is crucial to allocate maximum space to storage and inventory processing purposes while minimizing space for office areas, empty pallets, charging stations, etc. Additionally, how you decide to allocate space will impact shelving designs, installation capacity, and placement of goods inside your facility.\nEnsuring the uninterrupted flow of goods, personnel, and equipment is vital to consider in the design layout for the smooth functioning of your warehouse. You can avoid inefficient routes and disruptions by strategically planning your warehouse layout design so as to facilitate each operation in a sequential manner.\nTo learn more about the different warehouse layout options for the flow of goods, watch the video below:\nWhile planning your warehouse layout, it is crucial to ensure easy accessibility to all the areas and products in your facility. The layout should be designed in a way that makes it easy for personnel to navigate throughout the facility while conveniently locating and picking items without having to move other products. As a result, your productivity can be enhanced and orders can be fulfilled at a faster rate.\nThe use of different types of equipment in your warehouse, such as lifting & packing tools, pallet racks, or conveyors, can influence the layout design. By identifying the equipment needed, you can evaluate and design the most suitable layout according to your requirements and boost the productivity of your facility.\nThroughput in a warehouse refers to the number of products that are processed and moved through various warehouse processes such as receiving, putaway, storage, picking, packing, and shipping. By collecting and analyzing this data, you can design a layout to ensure an efficient flow of goods and accommodate the necessary equipment for your warehouse.\nKnowing the number of people required, their current levels of training and shift timings, and other related factors can help you design your warehouse layout in a way that doesn’t limit your workforce’s productivity. Also, the layout must be planned in a manner that can safely accommodate new employees and their needs in the future.\nWhile designing your warehouse layout, it is critical to comply with the guidelines provided by the local authorities. Abiding by these guidelines not only ensures the safety of your workers, equipment, or other valuable assets but also helps you avoid fines and legal problems for your business.\nSelecting the most suitable warehouse layout design for your facility is crucial to ensure the optimal utilization of resources. The best way to make sure that this task does not get overwhelming for you is to consider the factors mentioned in this article. This can help you design your layout in an efficient manner, which in turn lets you utilize your warehouse space better, boost productivity, and improve order fulfillment rates.']	['<urn:uuid:f6a66bf5-1150-47b7-a445-6fc08158f669>', '<urn:uuid:aa012823-7e99-4f1b-823f-7b5bef3898e8>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	6	55	2638
96	Why do slow storms cause more destruction?	Slow-moving hurricanes cause more damage because the longer a storm lingers over an area, the more time it has to pound that area with storm winds and drop huge volumes of rain, which leads to flooding.	"['Human-caused warming will cause more slow-moving hurricanes, warn climatologists\nHurricanes moving slowly over an area can cause more damage than faster-moving storms, because the longer a storm lingers, the more time it has to pound an area with storm winds and drop huge volumes of rain, leading to flooding. The extraordinary damage caused by storms like Dorian (2019), Florence (2018) and Harvey (2017) prompted Princeton’s Gan Zhang to wonder whether global climate change will make these slow-moving storms more common.\nZhang, a postdoctoral research associate in atmospheric and oceanic sciences, decided to tackle the question by using a large ensemble of climate simulations. He worked with an international team of researchers from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory on Princeton University’s Forrestal campus and the Meteorological Research Institute in Tsukuba, Japan. The results of this work appear in the April 22 issue of Science Advances.\nZhang and his colleagues selected six potential warming patterns for the global climate, then ran 15 different possible initial conditions on each of the six patterns, resulting in an ensemble of 90 possible futures. In all 90 simulations, they told the computers to assume that global carbon dioxide levels have quadrupled and the planet’s average temperature has risen by about 4 degrees Celsius — a level of warming that experts predict could be reached before the turn of the century, if no action is taken to curb fossil fuel use.\n""Our simulations suggest that future anthropogenic warming could lead to a significant slowing of hurricane motion, particularly in some populated mid-latitude regions,” Zhang said. His team found about the storms’ forward motion would slow by about 2 miles per hour — about 10 to 20% of the current typical speeds — at latitudes near Japan and New York City.\n“This is the first study we are aware of that combines physical interpretation and robust modeling evidence to show that future anthropogenic warming could lead to a significant slowing of hurricane motion,” he said.\n“Since the occurrence of Hurricane Harvey, there has been a huge interest in the possibility that anthropogenic climate change has been contributing to a slow down in the movement of hurricanes,” said Suzana Camargo, the Marie Tharp Lamont Research Professor at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, who was not involved in this research. “In a new paper, Gan Zhang and collaborators examined the occurrence of a slowdown of tropical cyclones in climate model simulations. They showed that in this model, there is a robust slowdown of tropical cyclone motion, but this occurs mainly in the mid-latitudes, not in the tropics.”\nWhy would the storms slow down? The researchers found that 4 degrees of warming would cause the westerlies — strong currents blowing through the midlatitudes — to push toward the poles. That shift is also accompanied by weaker mid-latitude weather perturbations. These changes could slow down storms near populated areas in Asia (where these storms are called typhoons or cyclones, not hurricanes) and on the U.S. eastern seaboard.\nUsually when people talk about hurricane speeds, they’re referring to the winds whipping around the eye of the storm. Those wind speeds are what determine a storm’s strength — a Category 5 hurricane, for example, has sustained winds of more than 157 miles per hour. By contrast, Zhang and his colleagues are looking at the “translational motion,” sometimes called the “forward speed” of a storm, the speed at which a hurricane moves along its path. (The term comes from geometry, where a figure is “translated” when it slides from one part of a graph to another.) No matter how fast its winds are, a storm is considered “slow-moving” if its translational speed is low. Hurricane Dorian, which battered Grand Bahama Island from Sept. 1 to 3, 2019, was a Category 5 hurricane with wind gusts reaching 220 miles per hour, but it had a translational speed of just 1.3 mph, making it one of the slowest hurricanes ever documented.\nAre storms already slowing down?\nSome researchers have suggested that tropical storm translation speeds have slowed over land regions in the United States since 1900. Zhang and his colleagues used their climate models to see if human-caused warming was responsible for the observed slowdown, but they couldn’t find a compelling link, at least based on trends since 1950 in their simulations. In addition, they noted that observed slowing translational speeds reported in recent studies could arise primarily from natural variability rather than human-caused climate changes.\nZhang used the metaphor of dieting to explain the ambiguity of hurricane observations.\n""If I go to the gym and eat fewer sweets,"" he said, ""I would expect to lose weight. But if I’m only using a bathroom scale to weigh myself, I’m not going to get convincing data very soon, for many reasons including that my bathroom scale isn’t the most accurate,"" he continued. “Assume after two weeks, I see some weak trend,” he said. “I still can’t tell whether it’s due to exercise, diet or just randomness.”\nSimilarly, the observed slowdown trend in hurricanes or tropical storms over the past century could be due to small-scale local changes or could just be random, he said.\n“In the debate between ‘Everything is caused by climate change’ and ‘Nothing is caused by climate change’ — what we are doing here is trying to offer that maybe not everything can be immediately attributed to climate change, but the opposite is not right, either,” Zhang said. “We do offer some evidence that there could be a slowdown of translational motion in response to a future warming on the order of 4 degrees Celsius. Our findings are backed by physics, as captured by our climate models, so that’s a new perspective that offers more confidence than we had before.”\n“Tropical Cyclone Motion in a Changing Climate,” by Gan Zhang, Hiroyuki Murakami, Thomas Knutson, Ryo Mizuta and Kohei Yoshida, was published in the April 22 issue of Science Advances (DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.aaz7610). The research was supported by Princeton University’s Cooperative Institute for Modeling the Earth System through the Predictability and Explaining Extremes Initiative.']"	['<urn:uuid:25aab777-17b8-4d84-b544-96c45480109a>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	7	36	1007
97	salesforce security best practices and crm analytics benefits	Salesforce security best practices include implementing multi-factor authentication, restricting access through role-based controls, encrypting data, and conducting regular audits. On the analytics side, CRM systems provide valuable data analysis capabilities that help businesses gain insights into customer behavior, improve decision-making, and develop effective marketing strategies through customer data collection and centralization. This combination of security measures and analytical capabilities ensures both protected and actionable customer data.	"[""Salesforce is a cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform that has revolutionized the way organizations manage their customer data. With Salesforce, businesses can access data from anywhere and leverage it to make informed decisions. As an organization's largest container of data, Salesforce is also a target for cybercriminals. In this blog, we will explore the threats to Salesforce data and the steps organizations can take to safeguard their most valuable asset.\nUnderstanding Salesforce Data Threats\nSalesforce data threats come in many forms, including:\n- Malware and Ransomware: Malware can infect Salesforce accounts through email phishing or by downloading malicious software. Ransomware can encrypt files and demand payment in exchange for the decryption key.\n- Data Leakage: Data leakage occurs when sensitive information is disclosed to unauthorized parties. Data breaches can occur due to human error, such as misconfiguration, or malicious attacks.\n- Account Hijacking: Account hijacking occurs when an attacker gains unauthorized access to a Salesforce account. This can be done through password cracking, social engineering, or exploiting vulnerabilities.\n- Insider Threats: Insider threats occur when employees, contractors, or partners with access to Salesforce data misuse or leak data. Insider threats can be accidental or intentional.\nBest Practices for Securing Salesforce Data\nTo protect Salesforce data, organizations should implement the following best practices:\n- Use Multi-Factor Authentication: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to Salesforce logins. With MFA, users must provide additional authentication factors, such as a one-time password or biometric authentication.\n- Restrict Access: Limit access to Salesforce data to only those who need it. Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) to restrict access based on job function.\n- Encrypt Data: Encryption is the process of encoding data to protect it from unauthorized access. Salesforce offers encryption at rest and in transit, which ensures that data is protected both while it's being stored and when it's being transmitted.\n- Implement Monitoring and Alerting: Monitor Salesforce activity for suspicious behavior, such as failed login attempts, and set up alerts to notify administrators of potential threats.\n- Conduct Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits of Salesforce data to ensure that access is restricted appropriately and that sensitive data is not being leaked.\n2Partnering with a Salesforce Security Expert\nPartnering with a Salesforce security expert can help organizations protect their data by:\n- Conducting Risk Assessments: Salesforce security experts can assess an organization's security posture and identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.\n- Providing Guidance on Best Practices: Salesforce security experts can provide guidance on best practices for securing Salesforce data, such as implementing MFA, restricting access, and encrypting data.\n- Implementing Security Controls: Salesforce security experts can help organizations implement security controls, such as RBAC and monitoring and alerting.\n- Providing Incident Response: In the event of a security breach, a Salesforce security expert can provide incident response services, such as containing the breach, investigating the incident, and restoring data.\nAdditional Considerations for Salesforce Data Security\n- Data Backup and Recovery: While preventive measures are essential for protecting Salesforce data, it's also critical to have a data backup and recovery plan in place.

98	forest management benefits impacts environment	Sustainable forest management aims to ensure goods and services from forests meet current needs while securing long-term development, focusing on timber supply and environmental values. At the forest level, poor forest utilization can negatively impact plant and animal resources, ecological functions, biodiversity, and carbon cycles through activities like timber extraction and road construction. At the macro level, environmental impacts are influenced by policies and programs, with growing attention to environmental services markets and compensation for environmental benefits.	"['Liberia: Sustainable Forest Management\nAccording to the Liberia Social Audit Report of 2011, more than 1,084,912 hectares of forestland have been allocated by the Liberian government to logging operations as indicated by available statics. In addition to areas allocated to logging operations, other concessions allocated to agribusinesses will have impacts on the nation’s forests as well, given the overlaps with forestlands in different conditions.\nSustainable forest management aims to ensure that the goods and services derived from the forest meet present-day needs while at the same time securing their continued availability and contribution to long-term development. In its broadest sense, forest management encompasses the administrative, legal, technical, economic, social and environmental aspects of the conservation and use of forests. It implies various degrees of deliberate human intervention, ranging from actions aimed at safeguarding and maintaining the forest ecosystem and its functions, to favoring specific socially or economically valuable species or groups of species for the improved production of goods and services.\nMore to this, sustainable forest management refers to the management of our private and public forests to ensure they continue to provide not only a sound supply of renewable timber for present and future generations, but also maintain their environmental values and social services. It is dependent on credible science and professional commitment to improving the nature of forest management by responsible agencies and forest managers. In Liberia, governments set policies and targets to guide the application of sustainable forestry; particularly on public land but not much detailed on private land.\nNationally, the government of Liberia to a greater extent has adopted principles and measures that are based on international level criteria widely agreed among nations with strong, long-term forestry industries, which include conservation of biological diversity, maintenance of productive capacity of forest ecosystems and their health and vitality, conservation and maintenance of soil and water resources, and enhancement of long term multiple socio-economic benefits to meet needs of societies.\nState forest and land management agencies and corporate forestry organizations often use the term “ecologically sustainable forest management”, to describe the approach outlined above. A reputable forest and environmental consultant recently proclaimed, “The language of sustainability is now being spoken from the boardroom to the bush”, suggesting that the message of Sustainable Forest Management is now widely accepted. What this means is that ecological sustainable forest management strongly aims at achieving a continuing balance of timber supply, economic and social benefits, while retaining a range of environmental values.\nWhile we hope that that the government of Liberia is applying the various policies and principles in managing the forest sustainably, we wish that we consider Our indigenous communities that still have a wealth of awareness and knowledge on how to look after woodlands and forests in a sustained way for a variety of values. Indigenous people lived in balance with their wooded environment, drawing on only as many resources as it would sustain, for many years. In parts of Liberia for instance, forests are still being cut down without proper management to ensure their regeneration, sometimes illegally. They are not regarded as being sustainably managed and natural forest resources are being greatly diminished and, in some cases, continue to decline. Unfortunately, in a least developed country such as Liberia, forest management should be highly evolved with our forest managers and practitioners constantly striving to improve and apply sustainable forestry practices.\nMany of the world’s forests and woodlands, however, especially in the tropics and subtropics, are still not managed in accordance with the Forest Principles adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED, 1992). Many developing countries have inadequate funding and human resources for the preparation, implementation and monitoring of forest management plans, and lack mechanisms to ensure the participation and involvement of all stakeholders in forest planning and development. Where forest management plans exist, they are frequently limited to ensuring sustained production of wood, without due concern for non-wood products and services or social and environmental values. In addition, many countries lack appropriate forest legislation, regulation and incentives to promote sustainable forest management practices.\nFAO helps member countries overcome these constraints through the provision of information and policy advice and through institutional and technical capacity-building activities. FAO collects, analyses and disseminates information; prepares manuals and guidelines; and organizes workshops and seminars that facilitate the dissemination of best practices and the exchange of experiences. Field projects are implemented in all types of natural forests. They also address emergency situations caused by natural disasters or the adverse effects of human activities, and offer opportunities for hands-on training.\nAt the national level, FAO supports initiatives for the development and implementation of criteria and indicators to define clearly the elements of sustainable forest management and to monitor progress towards it. At the field level, FAO helps identify, test and promote innovative forest management approaches and techniques, e.g. through support for model and demonstration forests.', 'Environment and forest utilization\nAssessing environmental impacts of forest use\nFOREST UTILIZATION can have impacts on the environment both at the forest level and at the macro level.\nAt the forest level, several activities can have direct and indirect negative impacts on plant and animal resources and on ecological functions of the forests (including conservation of biological diversity and carbon and water cycles). These include poorly planned and implemented extraction of timber and non-timber products, the construction of logging and transport roads, the construction of facilities for logging camps or for recreational activities in the forests and waste accumulation. Active forest utilization can also have direct and indirect impacts on human health and on cultural and social foundations in nearby areas. Different forms of forest utilization vary in the severity, irreversibility, probability of occurrence and significance of their impacts. They range from low-impact activities such as occasional collection of non-wood forest products (NWFPs) to high-impact ones such as commercial timber harvesting or conversion of natural forest to plantations.\nAt the macro level, environmental impacts are determined by policies, plans and programmes. These impacts need to be assessed and mitigation measures promoted when necessary. Specific issues include, for example:\n- the linkages between environmental concerns and forest products trade;\n- the effects of the application of environmental standards in forest operations and industries;\n- ways of considering the environmental costs of forest operations and of compensating for environmental benefits of sound forest utilization;\n- increased recognition of the economic potential of national and international markets for the environmental services provided by forests;\n- promotion of policy tools to capture the value of these services.\nPolitical pressure by environment-conscious groups is at the root of policies influencing forest use, such as logging and log export bans, and the implementation of legally binding international conventions such as those on biological diversity, climate change and international trade in endangered species. These environmental conventions are the platform for policies and practices aimed at maximizing the local and global environmental benefits of sustainable forest use.\nFAO\'s work: awareness raising and capacity building\nFAO aims to promote forms of forest utilization that improve the livelihoods of people without compromising the environmental functions of forests. The objective is to address, in a systematic way, key environmental and social issues related to forest utilization and to promote best practices to maximize positive impacts, as well as mitigation measures for identified negative impacts. Awareness raising among a variety of stakeholders, including the public and private sectors (including industry) and civil society organizations, is a fundamental aspect of this work.\nFAO¿s work in environmental impact assessment and mitigation is related to the Organization¿s work in environmentally sound forest harvesting and operations, but with a wider scope, including issues such as the integration of biodiversity and carbon management considerations in environmental impact assessment; the role of green-market-driven mechanisms (certification and ecolabelling) in the adoption of environmentally sound forestry practices; ways to compensate for the environmental benefits of these practices; and developing markets for environmental services provided by forests. This area is thus also closely linked with FAO¿s work in forest products trade and marketing, forests and climate change, and wildlife and protected areas.\nMain activities include the following:\n- training, publications and workshops, and provision of technical and policy guidance and expertise, to help member countries maximize the positive contributions of forest utilization and reinforce their capacity to assess and mitigate negative environmental impacts of forest activities and policies;\n- seminars and networking about the environmental consequences of forest activities among a variety of stakeholders;\n- collecting and sharing of information and technical knowledge on the impacts of forest utilization activities through case studies and comparisons of country experiences;\n- developing indicators of environmental impacts of forest utilization, and participation in international initiatives in this area;\n- establishing partnerships and exploiting synergies with other organizations working in environmental impact assessment, such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Secretariat, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF);\n- facilitating access to sources of funding for environmental assessment and to financial mechanisms for transfer of funds for environmental benefits of appropriate forest utilization.\nA central theme of this work is the environmental impact assessment (EIA), which is widely used as a tool to assist in decision-making. In several countries EIA is mandatory for forest activities. An important feature of EIA is public participation and transparency throughout the assessment process.\nAt the macro level, a tool called strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is used to assess the environmental impacts of policies and programmes. Such assessments help unravel the complexity of linkages between policies affecting forest utilization and environmental conditions.\nFAO¿s work on environmental impact assessment includes the following publications: Environmental impact of forestry (FAO Conservation Guide No. 7, 1992), Economic assessment of forestry project impacts (FAO Forestry Paper No. 106, 1992), Assessing forestry project impact: issues and strategies (FAO Forestry Paper No. 114, 1993), Valuing forests: context, issues and guidelines (FAO Forestry Paper No. 127, 1995), Environmental impact assessment and environmental auditing in the pulp and paper industry (FAO Forestry Paper No. 129, 1996) and A training manual for environmental assessment in forestry (Report for the FAO regional project ¿Forestry Planning and Policy Assistance in Asia and the Pacific"" 1996). Recent concern about environmental impacts of forest utilization at both the local and global levels has created new demand for assistance, and FAO is now renewing emphasis on this area.']"	['<urn:uuid:5dceb884-7cb3-48e6-af09-8acece207063>', '<urn:uuid:9aa021a7-ff88-4de0-9320-95f9eeb8b02a>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T12:28:02.910291	5	77	1729

100	How did missionary efforts progress in German New Guinea, and what were their notable achievements and setbacks?	Missionary efforts in German New Guinea achieved mixed results. Seven missions, including a French order, worked to spread Christianity and European mentality among the natives. They focused particularly on orphans whose parents were victims of tribal conflicts, often purchasing these children from tribes with the hope they would become multipliers of the European way of life. Some children were even sent to Germany for this purpose. By 1914, the missions had achieved some success, with around 30,000 regular churchgoers in New Guinea. However, they also faced serious setbacks, notably the massacre at the mission station of St. Paul on New Pomerania on August 13, 1904, where all ten mission members, including mission leader Matthias Rascher, were killed by their own followers. The missionary influence was largely limited to coastal regions, with the interior remaining largely untouched.	['Part IV – German New Guinea\nAt the beginning of the 1880s, the German government was still skeptical about some businessmen around Adolph von Hansemann, a Berlin business counselor and director of the Disconto Bank, to found a German colony in the South Sea. At best, the Berlin Foreign Office promised consular protection. Undaunted, Hansemann founded the New Guinea Company (NGC) in May 1884 with the ambitious goal of establishing a territory in the South Sea with its own sovereign rights territory under the protection of the German Empire. He commissioned the German Trade and Plantation Company, headed by the Bremen naturalist Dr. Otto Finsch, to carry out the project. In the meantime, election tactical reasons had led the Reich Chancellor to a cautious rethinking of colonial issues. Also, Great Britain did not seem to have any claim to the territories in question. Therefore, the German consul in Sydney was informed by the foreign office informed the German consul in Sydney by telegraph on August 19, 1884. The intention was to raise the imperial flag on the still independent territories in the northeast of New Guinea. However, by the time the Finsch expedition actually raised the German flag on the island of Matapui and at other points in November 1884, the British government had changed its mind. In the meantime, the ‘World Empire also claimed the islands lying to the north of Australia, so that a conference in London had to settle the differences at the beginning of March 1885. The German Empire finally received the northeastern part of New Guinea (Kaiser-Wilhelms-Land) and the “Bismarck Archipelago” north of New Pomerania, New Hanover, Neu Mecklenburg, and the Admiralty Islands. The Solomon Islands Bougainville and Buka were added a year later. Colony German New Guinea\nThe South Sea was not a paradise\nThe German letter of protection of May 17, 1885, had given Hansemann’s company possession of a territory of no less than 240.000 square kilometers. The first main town was Finschhafen, later Herbertshoehe on New Pomerania, since 1910, finally Rabaul. Berlin promised the investors military protection, but the development and administration of the huge area were to be and administration of the huge area at the NGC’s own expense. Their initial hopes of quickly finding enough settlers for the planned plantations were dashed by the climate, which was unsuitable for climate dashed their hopes. Above all, malaria was a stubborn threat that also affected officials, business people, and missionaries who were often forced to cut short their stay in the colony prematurely. In this climate, the stomach remained eternally spoiled by disease and quinine”, noted Stefan von Kotze, a relative of Bismarck. Bismarck wrote in his diary in 1905. And so, even after 30 years of existence on the eve of the First World War – a total population of 480,000 people – there were no more than 1,000 Europeans in the whole of German New Guinea. The real South sea world hardly corresponded to the ideas circulating in Europe of a paradisiacal Southland. Problematic was the relationship between the new colonial rulers and the natives. The letter of protection of 1885 had still spoken hopefully of a “civilization” of the indigenous population. Whose pronounced cannibalism was part of their animistic was part of their animistic death cult. Colony German New Guinea\nMissioning with limited success\nA total of seven missions, including even a French order, tried to reach them with various missions, to pave the way for a European mentality through Christianity. Especially the orphans, whose parents were victims of the countless tribal conflicts, concentrated on the education and conversion efforts of a European style. The missions often bought them from the tribes and hoped that children would become multipliers of the white way of life one day. Some of them were even sent to Germany for this purpose. In the long term, the missionary efforts of the Europeans were indeed successful. After all, in 1914, there were already in New Guinea around 30,000 regular churchgoers. Rather to the clumsiness and the anger of the mission leader Matthias Rascher was to thank for the fact that on August 13, 1904, in the mission station of St. Paul on the island of New Pomerania came to a massacre, when all ten mission members, including the head of the mission, were brutally killed by their own followers. In general, the efforts of the customs and habits of the natives, at least, to some extent, we’re limited to the coastal regions. The interior of the islands belonged only theoretically to the protected area. At most, in the course of isolated expeditions, which were carried out to map or mapping or finding archaeological of the archipelago, people came to these remote areas of the protected area. December 1912 saw the last major undertaking of this kind with the steamer “Kolonialgesellschaft” on the “Kaiserin-Augusta River” (Sepik). With some disappointing findings concerning the economic findings on the area’s economic viability. Colony German New Guinea\nUnsuccessful plantation economy\nThe concept of the New Guinea Company was based primarily on the exploitation of the labor force of the natives. But their willingness to work on the new coconut plantations remained rather low. The pay was meager and usually only at the end of the three-year commitment period. Cash was rarely paid out. In disciplinary action, prisoners were threatened, and the neighboring villages were obliged to send out to deliver workers who were – as usual – killing and eating them. During the recruitment, which was mostly carried out from the ship, the agents of the NGC had to expect armed resistance regularly.\nThe physician Wilhelm Wendtland described a typical recruitment trip in 1897: “While we landed with the first boat, the second boat stayed 20 to 30 meters from the beach, to cover our retreat in the event of an attack. When the group was entering the interior of the island, spears and arrows flew without killing anyone. The ‘Whites then began the retreat.” Better off than the plantation workers were the volunteer native police soldiers, who since the beginning of the 1890s have been trained by a German police master. They also came as expeditions and received better pay and good rations. Before the First World War I outbreak, the native force numbered 650 men, commanded by barely two dozen police masters. If there were actually major riots, such as the one that occurred in 1910 on the eastern island of Ponape, German naval forces intervened. In addition to Chinese and Javanese, there were also native servants in German households and expert hunting companions with experience. Colony German New Guinea\nWith the acquisition of the Spanish Islands in 1899, the Reichskolonialamt organized the conditions in the South Sea colony. The NGC and its frustrated financiers were glad that the imperial government gave them the vested rights in exchange for a payment of four million Reichsmarks and put the island kingdom under a unified administration with a governor at the head. The protagonists of a new world policy like Kaiser Wilhelm II and his then State Secretary Bernhard von Buelow were disturbed by their Pacific straddle holdings’ miserable economic balance sheet. In any case, the colony was not defensible.\nWhen, on September 12, 1914, 3,000 Australian Australian soldiers marched into Rabaul, the German dream of the South Sea was finally over. Out of about 700 Germans were interned in Australia for several months. From there, they returned to Germany via the United United States. Colony German New Guinea\nPassports of German New Guinea\nThe two documents are extremely rare and are real treasures of German (passport) history.
