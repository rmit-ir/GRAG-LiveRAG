1	How do the mechanisms of oxbow lake formation differ from the processes that influence storm hydrographs in vegetated drainage basins?	Oxbow lake formation occurs through a five-step process where river meanders become increasingly curved until the river cuts through the meander neck, creating a separate lake formation. In contrast, storm hydrographs in vegetated drainage basins are influenced by different mechanisms: vegetation intercepts precipitation and slows water movement into river channels, increasing lag time. Additionally, vegetation causes water loss through evaporation and transpiration, which reduces the peak discharge of the river. While oxbow lake formation is a result of physical channel migration and erosion processes, storm hydrograph patterns in vegetated areas are modified by the biological interaction between plants and water movement, demonstrating how different natural processes affect river systems in distinct ways.

This is the total volume of water flowing through a channel at any given point and is measured in cubic metres per second (cumecs). The discharge from a drainage basin depends on precipitation, evapotranspiration and storage factors. Drainage basin discharge = precipitation – evapotranspiration +/- changes in storage.\nWhat is a hydrograph?\nHydrographs can be used to illustrate discharge. These can be used to show annual discharge patterns of flow in relation to climate. Over the short term, a flood or storm hydrograph (figure 1.) can be used to show short term variations. They cover a relatively short time period, usually hours or days rather than weeks or months. Storm hydrographs allow us to investigate the relationship between a rainfall event and discharge.\nFigure 1. A storm hydrograph\nThe starting and finishing level show the base flow of a river. The base flow is the water that reaches the channel through slow throughflow and permeable rock below the water table. As stormwater enters the drainage basin the discharge rates increase. This is shown in the rising limb. The highest flow in the channel is known as the peak discharge. The fall in discharge back to base level is shown in the receeding limb. The lag time is the delay between the maximum rainfall amount and the peak discharge.\nThe shape of a hydrograph varies in each river basin and each individual storm event. The hydrographs below show two contrasting environments.\nThe storm hydrograph before urbanisation\nThe storm hydrograph after urbanisation\nRural areas with predominantly permeable rock increase infiltration and decreases surface runoff. This increases lag time. The peak discharge is also lower as it takes water longer to reach the river channel.\nPhysical Factors Affecting Storm Hydrographs\nThere is a range of physical factors that affect the shape of a storm hydrograph. These include:\n1. Large drainage basins catch more precipitation so have a higher peak discharge compared to smaller basins. Smaller basins generally have shorter lag times because precipitation does not have as far to travel. The shape of the drainage basin also affects runoff and discharge. Drainage basins that are more circular in shape lead to shorter lag times and a higher peak discharge than those that are long and thin because water has a shorter distance to travel to reach a river.\n2. Drainage basins with steep sides tend to have shorter lag times than shallower basins. This is because water flows more quickly on the steep slopes down to the river.\n3. Basins that have many streams (high drainage density) drain more quickly so have a shorter lag time.\n4. If the drainage basin is already saturated then surface runoff increases due to the reduction in infiltration. Rainwater enters the river quicker, reducing lag times, as surface runoff is faster than baseflow or through flow.\n5. if the rock type within the river basin is impermeable surface runoff will be higher, throughflow and infiltration will also be reduced meaning a reduction in lag time and an increase in peak discharge.\n6. If a drainage basin has a significant amount of vegetation this will have a significant effect on a storm hydrograph. Vegetation intercepts precipitation and slows the movement of water into river channels. This increases lag time. Water is also lost due to evaporation and transpiration from the vegetation. This reduces the peak discharge of a river.\n7. The amount of precipitation can have an effect on the storm hydrograph. Heavy storms result in more water entering the drainage basin which results in a higher discharge. The type of precipitation can also have an impact. The lag time is likely to be greater if the precipitation is snow rather than rain. This is because snow takes time to melt before the water enters the river channel. When there is rapid melting of snow the peak discharge could be high.\nHuman Factors Affecting Storm Hydrographs\nThere is a range of human factors that affect the shape of a storm hydrograph. These include:\n1. Drainage systems that have been created by humans lead to a short lag time and high peak discharge as water cannot evaporate or infiltrate into the soil.\n2. Areas that have been urbanised result in an increase in the use of impermeable building materials. This means infiltration levels decrease and surface runoff increases. This leads to a short lag time and an increase in peak discharge.\nHydrograph – a graph that shows river discharge and rainfall over time.\nFlood – when the capacity of a river to transport water is exceeded and water flows over it’s banks.\nBase flow – The base flow of the river represents the normal day to day discharge of the river and is the consequence of groundwater seeping into the river channel.\nStorm flow – storm runoff resulting from storm precipitation involving both surface and through flow.\nBankfull discharge – the maximum discharge that a particular river channel is capable of carrying without flooding.\nPeak discharge – the point on a flood hydrograph when river discharge is at its greatest.\nPeak rainfall – the point on a flood hydrograph when rainfall is at its greatest.\nLag time – the period of time between the peak rainfall and peak discharge.']"	['<urn:uuid:63cf13c4-f11b-4f4c-9e9b-fb48539b8c17>', '<urn:uuid:d6078f09-bcde-4292-94dc-46a8ddb134dd>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	20	112	1550
2	What innovations are transforming smart city transportation systems?	Smart city transportation systems are being transformed by several key innovations. High-resolution digital lidar technology, as developed by companies like Ouster, combined with real-time processing software enables precise monitoring and measurement of vehicles, pedestrians, and infrastructure. These systems are being integrated with new traffic management platforms that use IoT sensors and AI algorithms to collect and analyze mobility data, helping cities make data-driven decisions for infrastructure development. The transformation includes deployment of new mobility services, connected vehicle technologies, and intelligent traffic systems. Cities are implementing these solutions through partnerships with automotive manufacturers and startups, as seen in initiatives like Smart Columbus Operating System and Ford's City Insights platform, to create more efficient and adaptable urban transportation networks.	"[""businesswire | January 21, 2021\nOuster, a main supplier of superior advanced lidar sensors, and Outsight reported today the previously incorporated arrangement in the lidar business with installed pre-preparing programming.

What’s left out of the discussion is the security concerns surrounding manufacturing and industrial facilities and remote work. However, the pandemic have intensified the security risks to operational technology (OT), industrial internet of things (IIoT) and IT in factories.\nThreats to OT aren’t new. They tend to come through the IT network, malware or a breakdown of administrative privileges—just like any other type of system. But remote access has added a new wrinkle.\n“A top threat vector for targeted attacks on OT systems is individuals who have access directly through OT networks,” said Galina Antova, co-founder of Claroty. “Traditionally, OT engineers in many cases have shared admin access since they might need access to the process immediately. That practice is that much more challenging at a time when many of them are logging into OT environments remotely.”"", 'Digitizing Traffic Management for Smart Cities – From Moving Vehicles to Moving People\nFrom electric scooters and bikes to ride-hailing and car-sharing, the way humans move around cities is markedly different than it was 100 years ago. Over the next decade, the proliferation of connected, autonomous, shared and electric (CASE) vehicles will usher in a new era of mobility and further change the way we move people and goods. However, transportation infrastructure and management systems have been slow to adapt, creating a bottleneck in mobility innovation.\nEvery city has a traffic policy regarding how vehicles and actors (pedestrians, cyclists, etc.) are organized and prioritized, and use traffic lights to implement the policy. Current traffic management systems operate traffic lights on fixed time frames and in-road sensors to extend or shorten green lights when needed. This system was created in an era dominated by passenger vehicles and designed to move as many vehicles, not necessarily people, as possible.\nBy 2030, 1 billion more people are expected to live in cities. Today, 55% of the world’s population lives in urban areas and this percentage is expected to rise to 68% by 2050. Additionally, freight volumes are expected to grow by 40% during this time period. Uncoordinated deployment of new mobility services has overwhelmed aging infrastructure which was designed only for private vehicles and public transit. Although CASE mobility promises to provide a transportation system which is safe, efficient and emissions-free, the path to get there is currently unclear and will require simultaneous innovation in infrastructure and management.\nToday, 55% of the world’s population lives in urban areas and this percentage is expected to rise to 68% by 2050.\nNext gen mobility will require next gen infrastructure and management\nDigitization and advancements in enabling technologies, including artificial intelligence, IoT sensors, computer vision and computing technology has allowed for the development of new traffic management tools for cities. Traditional in-road sensors at traffic lights collect limited data on traffic (mainly, the presence of a vehicle) and can only be used to shorten or extend green lights. This system operates on fixed time frames and can’t adapt to dynamic traffic demand. IoT sensors and machine learning technology in cameras deployed at intersections collect granular data on vehicle, pedestrian and cyclist movement and traffic volume at intersections. This data can then be used for multiple applications:\n- Remote monitoring and real-time traffic flow data.\n- Building complex models of a city’s transportation system to help city planner’s make informed, data-driven decisions for infrastructure development and investment.\n- Leverage AI and cloud computing to adjust traffic light patterns dynamically and in real time.\n- Provide the building blocks for connected vehicles and intelligent traffic systems (ITS).\nIn recent years, early stage startups leveraging these technology advances designed to create value for cities have received significant investment. Since 2017, urban mobility and mobility service startups have received over $44 billion in venture funding across 380 deals, while seed investments have increased from $26 million in 2017 to $101 million in 2019, nearly half of which occurred in October 2019 alone. In addition, automotive OEMs are developing mobility services and solutions for cities to establish their place in the new service-based value chain of the next generation of mobility, where mobility services may overtake vehicle ownership.\nFor cities, it’s time to adapt\nThe value of digitized traffic management will accelerate in coming years as cities become more and more overwhelmed by increasing populations and new mobility services. In fact, some measures, such as the Future Mobility Competitive Index (FMCI), have identified a city’s ability to adapt to the mobility revolution and integrate disruptive technology into legacy traffic systems as a critical factor for future economic growth. In addition, emissions reductions targets for 2030-2050 will require a large scale shift to low-emissions and intelligent forms of transportation over the next 5 years.\nTraffic systems will need to move more people, not just vehicles, and accommodate dynamic demand. Cities are becoming more proactive in leveraging technology advancements to manage mobility solutions, working with startups and automotive OEMs to digitize urban transport systems. Ford recently announced expansion of its City Insights platform to Austin, Indianapolis, Detroit, Miami, Pittsburg and Grand Rapids after the successful completion of a pilot project in Ann Arbor. Columbus, OH has developed a Smart Columbus Operating System to collect and transmit data related to Smart Columbus projects and to serve as an open data platform. Singapore recently announced plans to develop a next-generation Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system that will leverage advanced technology to provide more flexibility in traffic management.\nFrom data analytics to command and control\nInnovators are developing sensors and proprietary AI algorithms to gather traffic flow, traffic light and mobility service data and provide insights to city planners. Some automotive OEMs and mobility service providers are also building out their own data collection and analysis platforms as new business arms to provide insights for cities. In the near term, and as companies expand deployment of sensors and data analysis capacity, the main value proposition for cities will be providing low-cost data to influence decision making and, in turn, develop more efficient traffic patterns and systems.\nTraffic data analytics\nNumina, a Brooklyn-based startup founded in 2014, provides a purpose-built sensor to gather street-level flow data, conducts spatial analytics and provide insights on the data collected. City planners then use that information to redesign infrastructure to better accommodate pedestrians and cyclists. Streetlight Data, founded in 2011 and based in San Francisco, collects geospatial data from smart phones and connected vehicles and then processes the data to calculate traffic patterns. The patterns are augmented with transit, mobility service and IoT data provided by cities to improve accuracy.\nFord’s City Insights platform is a suite of software tools to help cities develop traffic solutions. The platform gathers parking, transit, traffic, safety and census data to develop a computer model of a city, gain insights into accidents, parking, commutes, transit efficiency and coverage and livability and predict the impact of policies and pricing on transportation patterns.\nIn January 2018, Didi Chuxing launched Smart Transportation, leveraging access to anonymized route data from its own mobility services and big data and artificial intelligence capabilities to develop an integrated solution for smart traffic management. The solution includes a big data platform that displays real-time traffic conditions, congestion and safety analysis, reversible lanes, smart traffic signals, traffic information for drivers and bus dispatching. pop\nMobility service analytics\nPopulus Technologies, founded in 2017 and based in San Francisco, offers a mobility service analytics platform on a subscription basis, through which Populus receives and hosts usage and operation data from mobility service operators. The company offers mobility services analytics to both cities and mobility service operators, helping cities utilize mobility data and incentivizing data sharing.\nWunder Mobility, a growth stage startup based out of Germany that recently expanded to the United States, offers its own carpooling app and powers third-part apps via a white-labeled service. The company is leveraging this access to mobility service operators to develop Wunder City, a tool that helps cities evaluate, plan and regulate mobility operators. The service develops reports from mobility services to assist in planning and strategy around mobility services.\nRide Report, founded in 2015 and based in Portland, offers a ‘mobility data specification (MDS) auditing service’ that helps cities measure performance and rate compliance of mobility operators. The service reduces staff time and increases revenue by scaling the number of trips offered by mobility operators.\nTraffic system command and control\nNoTraffic, a startup founded in 2016 with operations in Tel Aviv and the United States, has developed a solution involving AI-enabled plug-and-play sensors, edge computing embedded in the sensors to process the data within the IoT device, and communication models using V2X communication to send data to the cloud for further processing. The system then optimizes traffic lights in real-time by sharing data through the cloud to and between intersections. NoTraffic has a unique offering in that the system operates completely autonomously – from data collection to traffic light operation.\nThe broader market\nRelationships with cities will be a key differentiator for players in the traffic management space. Automotive OEMs can build upon existing relationships to develop and deploy traffic management solutions. However, startups can leverage innovative capabilities to develop novel, lower-cost solutions. Low cost and ease of deployment will allow companies to provide a strong business case for cities and scale their technology rapidly. More sensors deployed means a higher volume of data and, in turn, better insights. However, large amounts of data will strain cloud computing capabilities. Innovative solutions, such as edge computing in sensors and quantum computing can offer increased computing capacity and scalability.\nLook out for…\n- Shifting value proposition from providing data to advanced analytics and autonomous command and control capabilities. As more cities require mobility service providers to share operating data and sensors become ubiquitous, the real value will lie in what is done with the data, rather than just access to data.\n- Innovation in sensor and computing capabilities for more accurate and less expensive data collection and faster, more accurate processing at scale.\nLooking for more insight into the future of urban mobility?

3	As someone working with different lighting materials, I'm wondering how the durability concerns of elastic bands in the flat pack lamp design compare to the battery requirements in emergency lighting systems?	The elastic bands in the flat pack lamp have significant durability issues as they tend to either dry up and flake or melt into a gooey mess over time. Emergency lighting systems, on the other hand, have strict battery requirements specified by NFPA 70 National Electric Code, and must reliably provide 90 minutes of illumination during power failures, with batteries requiring a 24-hour recharge time for full emergency operation.	"['[Matt] was looking for a project for his senior industrial design studio at Wentworth Institute of Technology. He ended up designing a clever lamp that can be flat packed. [Matt] started by drawing out designs on paper. He really liked the idea of combining curves with straight lines, but he wanted to translate his two-dimensional drawings into a three-dimensional shape.\nHaving access to a laser cutter made the job much easier than it could have been and allowed [Matt] to go through many designs for the lamp frame. The two main pieces were cut from acrylic and include mounting pegs for the elastic bands. The two plastic pieces are designed to slot together, forming a sort of diamond shape.\nThe final version of the lamp required that the elastic bands had holes punched in them for mounting. The holes were placed over the small pegs to keep the bands in place. [Matt] used 3/4″ industrial elastic bands for this project. He then used a 120V 15W candelabra light bulb to illuminate the lamp. The final design is not only beautiful, but it can be flat packed and manufactured inexpensively.\nIf you want more inspiration for artistically designed lamps check out this one that uses the corrugation in cardboards as a shade pattern.\n13 thoughts on “Flat Pack Elastic Band Lamp Is A Thing Of Beauty”\nWell done! A piece of art!\nElastic bands tends to leave a mess after a long while. It either dries up flakes or melts into a gooey mess.\nThat’s why he should have used Sour Apple Laffy Taffy instead of rubber bands.\nI recently had that with an enclosure with a rubberized coating, after many years it suddenly turned into a sticky unpleasant goo.\nAnd I recall having that before. And it’s funny because it happens rather suddenly after quite a few years.\nNow I need to find how to get rid of the rubber but leave the plastic onto which it is applied nice and intact, which isn’t as easy as it sounds, I tried various compounds and it either is bad for the underlying plastic or it doesn’t do anything to the goo.\nI’m trying to find a concise way to query a search engine so I get some relevant ideas.\nLooks very nice. What does it look like when folded?\nFlat. Very, very flat.\nThe chnese already invented flat lights thousands of years ago of course https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_lantern\nThis is very cool!\nstring drawings for the 21st century!\nThe final version of the lamp required that the elastic bands had holes punched in them for mounting.\nWhy did it require holes to be punched? Was there no better or easier way to do this?\nWhy not use LEDs instead of a 15W bulb?\n>Why did it require holes to be punched? Was there no better or easier way to do this?\nAt first I thought you meant his prototype version that has holes on the outer edges, but it looks to be how he chose to terminate each section, two holes on the front and back edges, figure out a better mechanism and you could do away with that requirement, but it makes sense why. With any sort of full bar clamp, have fun holding 9 rubber bands under tension all in the right position then screwing it together.\nThis is a really amazing design and use of materials. :)\nGreat open documentation. AND showcase of construction and assembly!\nThe rubber bands seem to give a nice warm glow, I don’t know if I’m seeing some opaque diffusion of light through them or reflection of fresh new rubber bands but it looks awesome.\nThrift store raid? Some empty picture frames? and Flat Braided Wire or maybe a roll of Decorative Metallic Ribbon? Maybe even cloth elastic used for underwear (spray paint something glossy after assembly for a nice finish).\nNice, and pleasing design to the eye.\nI’m rather worried though on the longevity of the elastic bands.\nRubber tends to deteriorate with time, and accelerated by light and heat.\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent. (Comment Policy)', 'Valuable Information About Emergency Lighting\n- An emergency light or dual light emergency lighting fixture is a battery-backed fixture that turns on in the event of a power outage. It is also known as ""egress lighting.""\n- U.S. Code Regulations\n- Emergency lighting fixtures in commercial buildings and high-occupancy residential buildings must comply with local building codes, which typically follow regulations set by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) for emergency lighting fixtures. Listed below are performance requirements from the NFPA\'s Code for Means of Egress for Buildings and Structures.\nFor more information on the standards for emergency lighting products, see the NFPA website.\n- All emergency lights must provide 90 minutes of illumination in the event of a power failure.\n- The initial level of illumination during that 90-minute period must be at least 1 foot-candle, measured at the floor level along the exit path illuminated by an emergency light fixture.\n- During the 90-minute period, the light level may decline to an average of 0.6 foot-candles, but it may never drop below 0.06 foot-candles when the indoor emergency lights are shining.\n- The emergency lighting system and dual light emergency lighting fixtures must turn on automatically in the event of any interruption of normal lighting.\n- Installation of emergency generators and other stored electrical energy systems must comply with NFPA 110 and NFPA 111.\n- Batteries used in emergency lights must comply with standards for indoor emergency lighting from NFPA 70, National Electric Code.\nTroubleshooting Tips for Emergency Light Fixtures\n- Problem: The emergency unit does not light up and the LED indicator does not come on in your emergency light fixture.\n- Suggestion: Check to see if the power supply wires inside the unit are properly connected. If you have 277 volts of input power, connect the orange (277V) wire from the fixture to the black (hot) wire from the supply circuit. If you have 120 volts of input power, connect the black (120V) wire from the fixture to the black (hot) wire from the supply circuit. Also, in some cases, there might be a gap between the input clip and the circuit board of your indoor emergency lights. Make certain that the input clip is connected correctly and securely to the circuit board.\n- Problem: The emergency lights do not come on when the power supply is cut off to our emergency light fixtures.\n- Suggestion: The battery in the emergency unit needs to be connected right after AC power is supplied to the unit. Then, the battery needs to charge for at least a couple of hours before doing any initial tests of your emergency light fixtures. A 24-hour recharge time is required for a full 90-minute emergency operation. If the battery has been connected and properly charged, make sure all the light bulb connections are tight and secure and that the light bulbs in your emergency lighting products are in good condition. If you\'re still having problems, contact the manufacturer for further assistance. The battery might need to be replaced.']"	['<urn:uuid:dabdbc43-d964-4ec2-a031-703ee20b93b8>', '<urn:uuid:1c0e5295-5ddb-4763-a09b-d58b3f8510cf>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	31	69	1196
4	biodegradable plastic dumps methane release effects	While biodegradable plastic is often marketed as eco-friendly, it can actually have negative environmental impacts when disposed of in landfills. According to studies, including one from Germany's Federal Environment Agency, biodegradable plastic offers almost no environmental advantage over traditional plastic in landfill conditions. This is because landfills are kept dry and air-tight, which inhibits biodegradation. When biodegradable materials do break down in landfills, they release methane and carbon dioxide - both greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. The methane emissions are particularly concerning as landfills contribute 36% of human-caused methane releases, with methane being 20 times more effective at trapping atmospheric heat than carbon dioxide.	['Over 31 million tons of plastic waste is produced each year, of which just 8% is recycled, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Biodegradable plastic made from materials ranging from bacteria to orange peels has been touted as a solution to the global plastic-waste problem and a way to lessen our impact on the environment. However, a closer examination reveals that biodegradable plastic may not live up to its eco-friendly image.\nBiodegradable plastic was once a classic greenwashing scheme that often tricked consumers into purchasing products that were not, in fact, biodegradable. However, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has cracked down on these dubious claims and now defines what can and cannot be marketed as biodegradable plastic.\nTo qualify as biodegradable, a material must be scientifically proven to break down completely and return to nature within a short time, the FTC says. Don’t be fooled, though: Not all biodegradable plastic is made from bio-based products like plants and food waste; some is derived from synthetic polyesters and other non-bio-based feedstock.\nIs it really eco-friendly?\nBut even plastic certified as biodegradable may not be as environmentally friendly as it appears. In fact, according to a recent study released by Germany’s Federal Environment Agency, biodegradable plastic offers almost no environmental advantage over traditional plastic.\nWhy? Unless plastic is composted or recycled, it ends up in landfills, which are designed to be kept dry and air-tight conditions that actually inhibit biodegradation. According to the Canada-based Environment and Plastics Industry Council (EPIC), even though more than two-thirds of the garbage that goes into landfills may be purported to be biodegradable, little change occurs once it gets there.\n“Nothing has as popular an image as biodegradability in landfills unfortunately, though, it just doesn’t happen,” says Dr. William Rathje, an archaeologist at the University of Arizona and author of the book “Rubbish!: The Archaeology of Garbage.”\nAccording to Rathje, if plastic were able to degrade in landfills, the environmental impact would be even worse. When biodegradable plastic breaks down in landfills, he explains in his book, it releases two greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and methane, exacerbating climate change. Moreover, it could contribute to unstable sub-soil conditions and storm-water pollution.\nThere are also concerns about how biodegradable plastic is produced. For instance, much of the feedstock used to create biodegradable plastic comes from corn and other plants that have been treated with fertilizers and/or been genetically modified, the Sustainable Biomaterials Collaborative notes.\nWhat you can do\nIf biodegradable plastic is not really degradable after all, then what can you do to reduce your plastic footprint? The good news is that biodegradable plastic will degrade if composted properly. The Biodegradable Products Institute maintains a list of products that have been independently verified as compostable.\nIf composting is not your thing, recycling and reusing are also generally sustainable options. Another good practice is to reduce your plastic use overall, the EPIC recommends. Less plastic is better than biodegradable plastic, so make smart decisions.\nRelated biodegradable stories on MNN:', 'Environmental Impacts Of Solid Waste Landfilling\nInevitable consequences of the practice of solid waste disposal in landfills are gas and leachate generation due primarily to microbial decomposition, climatic conditions, refuse characteristics and landfilling operations. The migration of gas and leachate away from the landfill boundaries and their release into the surrounding environment present serious environmental concerns at both existing and new facilities. Besides potential health hazards, these concerns include, and are not limited to, fires and explosions, vegetation damage, unpleasant odors, landfill settlement, ground water pollution, air pollution and global warming. This paper presents an overview of gas and leachate formation mechanisms in landfills and their adverse environmental impacts, and describes control methods to eliminate or minimize these impacts.\nTable of Contents\n- Title Page\n- Table of Content\n- 1.1 Background of the Study\n- 1.2 Statement of the Problem\n- 1.3 Objective of the Study\n- 1.4 Research Hypotheses\n- 1.5 Significance of the Study\n- 1.6 Scope and Limitation of the Study\n- 1.7 Definition of Terms\n- 1.8 Organization of the Study\nReview of Related Literature\n- 2.1 Introduction\n- 2.2 Types of Solid Waste\n- 2.3 Methods of Managing Waste\n- 2.4 Theoretical Review: Integrated Sustainable Waste Management\n- 2.5 Stakeholders and Participation\n- 2.6 Conceptual Reviews; Wastes and Solid Wastes\n- 2.7 Management and Solid Waste Management\n- 2.8 Obstacle to Waste Management\n- 2.9 Landfill Development, Operations and Management in Lagos\n- 2.10 Municipal Waste Disposal and Landfill\n- 3.1 Introduction\n- 3.2 Sources of Data Collection\n- 3.3 Population of the Study\n- 3.4 Sample and Sampling Procedure\n- 3.5 Instrument for Data Collection\n- 3.6 Validation of the Research Instrument\n- 3.7 Method of Data Analysis\nPresentation Analysis Interpretation of Data\nSummary Conclusion and Recommendation\n- 5.1 Introduction\n- 5.2 Summary\n- 5.3 Conclusion\n- 5.4 Recommendation\n1.1 Background of the study\nThe Solid wastes comprise all the wastes arising from human and animal activities that are normally solid, discarded as useless or unwanted. Also included are by- products of process lines or materials that may be required by law to be disposed of (Okecha 2000). Solid waste can be classified in a number of ways, on the basis of sources, environmental risks, utility and physical property.\nOn the basis of source, solid wastes are again classified as: Municipal Solid Wastes, Industrial Solid Wastes and Agricultural Solid Wastes. Nigeria’s major urban centres are today fighting to clear mounting heaps of solid waste from their environments. These strategic centres of beauty, peace and security are being overtaken by the messy nature of over flowing dumps unattended heaps of solid wastes emanating from household or domestic or kitchen sources, markets, shopping and business centres. Solid Waste Landfills.\nCity officials appear unable to combat unlawful and haphazard dumping of hazardous commercial and industrial wastes which are a clear violation of the clean Air and Health Edicts in our environmental sanitation laws, rules and regulation. Refuse generation and its likely effects on the health, quality of environment and the urban landscape have become burning national issues in Nigeria today. All stakeholders concern with the safety and the beautification of our environment have come to realise the negative consequences of uncleared solid human wastes found in residential neighbourhoods, markets, schools, and central business districts in our cities. These solid wastes have become recurring features in our urban environment. It is no longer in doubt that our cities are inundated with the challenges of uncleared solid wastes. As a result, urban residents are often confronted with the hazardous impact to their collective health and safety. The hue and cry over the health consequences of exposed and fermenting rubbish have not been quantified, although their impact is noticeable, especially in times of epidemic in congested activity nuclei civic centres, CBDS, neigbhourhoods, etc.\nA United Nations Report (August 2004) noted with regret that while developing countries are improving access to clean drinking water they are falling behind on sanitation goals. At one of its summit in 2000 (Uwaegbelun 2004) revealed that The World Health Organization- (WHO 2004) and United Nations International Children Education Fund- (UNICEF 2004) joint report in August 2004 that: “about 2.4 billion people will likely face the risk of needless disease and death by the target of 2015 because of bad sanitation”. The report also noted that bad sanitation – decaying or non-existent sewage system and toilets- fuels the spread of diseases like cholera and basic illness like diarrhea, which kills a child every 21 seconds. The hardest hit by bad sanitation is rural poor and residents of slum areas in fast-growing cities, mostly in Africa and Asia . Solid Waste Landfills.\nAlthough there is no immediate danger from the methane emitted in atmosphere from landfills, over time it could accumulate inside the landfill mass, thus increasing its concentration with attendant potential to modify the Earth’s climate. 36 percent of human caused methane releases come from our municipal solid waste landfills (USEPA, 1999). A ton of municipal solid waste land-filled produces 123 pounds of methane- a potent greenhouse gas, 20 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (EA, 2008). Hulme et al. (1995) list the adverse impacts of the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to include: a threat to disrupt the diversity of habitats and the life dependent on them. In particular, our health, agriculture, water resources, forests, wildlife, and coastal areas are vulnerable to the changes that global warming may bring. It further state that a rise of only a few degrees in the Earth’s average temperature could result in more frequent and intense storms, flooding of beaches, bay marshes, and other low-lying coastal areas; more precipitation in some areas and not enough in others and wider distribution of certain infectious diseases. Such significant changes, note NEST (1991), Hulme et al. (1995) and Nicholson (2001) could damage communities and national economies as well as alter the natural world.\nDeveloping countries like Nigeria are particularly at risk because of her bad waste management system and unhealthy disposal practices. The problem of solid waste disposal is one of the most serious environmental problems facing many cities in Nigeria. Waste management plays an integral role in human activities. Various ways of managing solid waste includes disposal by either burying or burning, reduce or reusing, recycling and energy generation. Solid waste management differs in developing countries like Nigeria and in industrialized countries of the world like Germany. Several factors are responsible for the differences, a good example of these are the types of waste generated in developing countries. Contreau (1982) submitted that, in developing countries, there is much high proportion of organic and considerably less plastic waste such that the large amount of organic material makes the waste denser with greater moisture and smaller particles.\n1.2 Statement of the Problem\nDeveloping country like Nigeria is particularly at risk, because of her bad waste management system and unhealthy disposal practices. Global temperature will continue to increase causing further disruption to climate patterns. Ultimately, all this can only be brought under control by engaging in sustainable waste management practices, and stabilizing greenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere. It is on this backdrop that the researcher intends to investigate the impact of solid waste on land fill in Nigeria.\n1.3 Objective of the Study\n- To investigate the effect of solid waste management practice on the environment.\n- To determine the effect of solid waste land fill on the environment\n- To appraise the strategy for effective solid waste land fill management practice\n- To determine the management practices of Nigeria for effective solid waste management land fill\n1.4 Research Hypotheses\nFor the successful completion of the study, the following hypotheses were formulated:\n- H0: solid waste land fill has no significant impact on the environment\nH1: solid waste land fill has a significant impact on the environment\n- H0: there is no significant relationship between solid waste land fill emission and environmental pollution\nH2: there is a significant relationship between solid waste land fill emission and environmental pollution.\n1.5 Significance of the Study\nThe study shall provide a structural study on solid waste\nIt shall investigate the effect of solid waste on the environment\nThe study shall analyze strategies for effective waste management practice. It shall provide a reference source of information for environmental experts. It is believed that at the completion of the study, the findings will be of great importance to the ministry of environment in ensuring that the environment is devoid of pollution. The findings will also be of great benefit to the waste management agency in ensuring that the waste are properly disposed to ensure that it does not constitute a major air pollution in the society. The study will also be of importance to researcher who wishes to carry out investigation in similar topic. Finally, the study will be of importance to lecturers, students, teachers and academia’s as the findings will add to the pool of knowledge.\n1.6 Scope and Limitation of the Study\nThe scope of the study covers the impact of solid waste land fill in Nigeria but in the cause of the study, the researcher encounters some constrain which limited the scope of the study;\n(a) Availability of Research Material:\nThe research material available to the researcher is insufficient, thereby limiting the study.\nThe time frame allocated to the study does not enhance wider coverage as the researcher has to combine other academic activities and examinations with the study.\nThe finance available for the research work does not allow for wider coverage as resources are very limited as the researcher has other academic bills to cover.\n1.7 Definition of Terms\nA landfill site (also known as a tip, dump, rubbish dump, garbage dump or dumping ground and historically as a midden) is a site for the disposal of waste materials by burial and the oldest form of waste treatment (although the burial part is modern; historically, refuse was just left in piles or thrown into pits). Historically, landfills have been the most common method of organized waste disposal and remain so in many places around the world.\nLand, sometimes referred to as dry land, is the solid surface of the Earth that is not permanently covered by water. The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture, habitat, and various natural resources.\nWaste is any substance which is discarded after primary use, or it is worthless, defective and of no use. Examples include municipal solid waste(household trash/refuse), hazardous waste, wastewater (such as sewage, which contains bodily wastes (feces and urine) and surface runoff), radioactive waste, and others\nThe American Public Liquid Association in 1975 defined solid waste as unwanted and useless material with insufficient liquid content to be free flowing, because of its sticky nature, solid waste has the ability to accumulating and physically insulting and degrading the environment if not well managed.\n1.8 Organization of the Study\nThis research work is organized in five chapters, for easy understanding, as follows.\n- Chapter one is concern with the introduction, which consist of the (background of the study), statement of the problem, objectives of the study, research questions, research hypotheses, significance of the study, scope of the study etc.\n- Chapter two being the review of the related literature presents the theoretical framework, conceptual framework and other areas concerning the subject matter.\n- Chapter three is a research methodology covers deals on the research design and methods adopted in the study.\n- Chapter four concentrate on the data collection and analysis and presentation of finding.\n- Chapter five gives summary, conclusion, and recommendations made of the study.\nSummary Conclusion and Recommendation\nIt is important to ascertain that the objective of this study was to ascertain the land use policy and tourism development in Nigeria.\nIn the preceding chapter, the relevant data collected for this study were presented, critically analyzed and appropriate interpretation given. In this chapter, certain recommendations made which in the opinion of the researcher will be of benefits in addressing the challenges of land use policy and how to develop tourism in Nigeria.\nWaste management plays an integral role in human activity. The overall view of solid waste management is to collect, treat and dispose solid waste by urban dwellers in an environmentally and socially satisfactory manner. Until recently, Nigerians have not been particularly concerned about proper waste management, open dumping and open burning in unapproved locations has been the norms. The constraints to effective solid waste management are not limited to lack of policy or laws, but poor infrastructure, education, social awareness of problems and solutions, and lack of institution promoting sustainable environmental actions.\nFire incidents on landfills and dumps in Nigeria, especially those involving burning tyres will continue to pose a serious risk to the health of nearby residents through prolonged or repeated exposure to the toxic chemicals they emit and the contamination of groundwater. Some of the hazardous chemical compounds emitted by burning tyres are capable of causing severe health conditions such as reproductive and developmental disorders, and cancers in humans. Effective landfill management by the operators is therefore necessary to prevent the occurrence of these fires in order to protect the environment and human health. The disposal of waste tyres should be prohibited at all landfills by thoroughly inspecting and controlling incoming waste. Buried waste should also be compacted on a regular basis to prevent hot spots from forming. Since methane is highly flammable and can pose a fire hazard, gas collection and control systems should be installed at the sites to collect landfill gas which can be flared to convert methane to gases less harmful to the environment or converted to energy. This research examines landfill emission and their impact on the environment in Nigeria and therefore calls for the need to improve on waste management practices and construct well engineered sanitary landfills to ensure the protection of human health and the environment.\nHaven successfully completed the study, the following recommendations are put forward by the researcher:\n- Strategic environmental planning of waste management practices should be put in place\n- There is need to ensure strict adherence to guidance and cost analysis of solid waste options in the area.\n- Community participation in collection, selection of sites and design of facilities is inherently essential for sustainability.\n- There is need to strengthen the work force, by recruiting more personnel in the Waste Management Authority.\n- Government should provide adequate funds for waste management personnel for the purchase of more evacuating vehicles and waste disposal containers.\n- There is need for environmental and public health education on the danger of indiscriminate waste disposal in the study area.\nEnvironmental Impacts Of Solid Waste Landfilling\nThe complete material will be sent to you in just 2 steps.\nQuick & Simple…\nMake payment of ₦3,000: through USSD Transfer, Bank Mobile App, ATM Transfer, or POS Transfer to:\n|Account No.: 0811003731|\n|Name: Samphina Academy|\n|Account Type: Current|\nOr Click Here to pay with Debit Card\n|FOR CLIENTS OUTSIDE NIGERIA:|\n|Click Here to pay with Debit Card ($15)|\n|GHANA – Make Payment of 60 GHS to MTN MoMo, 0553978005, Douglas Osabutey|\nSend the following details through Text Message or WhatsApp Messenger | +234-8143831497\n- Payment Details\n- Email Address\n- Environmental Impacts Of Solid Waste Landfilling\nThe complete material will be sent to your email address after receiving your payment information | T & C Apply\nYou may also like:\nThis research material “Environmental Impacts Of Solid Waste Landfilling” is for research purposes and should be used as a guide in developing your research project / seminar work.

5	miami npp model output units conversion hectares	In the Miami NPP model, 1000 gDM/(m^2.day) is equivalent to 10 tons DM/Ha over one year, which would be approximately 3 tons of grain/Ha, considering that biomass is partitioned into 50% roots and 50% above-ground biomass, of which 50% can be assumed to be grain.	['Routine crop monitoring is done with indices which indirectly describe or capture the effect of environmental variables on crop condition and yield. Among the indicators that indirectly “capture” crop condition, NDVI is certainly one of the most popular and most easily available from a variety of sources. The word “indirectly” refers to the fact that, depending on pixel size, NDVI includes a mix of crop and natural vegetation and the practitioners of crop monitoring usually consider that the factors that affect crops do affect natural vegetation in a similar way, so that NDVI provides a good quantitative or semi-quantitative indicator of crop condition. See, for example, the following websites for typical examples: EC/MARS, USDA/FAS, FAO/GIEWS and CropWatch, to mention only the major international systems.\nRecently, CropWatch has published a bulletin where an old biomass indicator (the “Miami” NPP potential) was used as a monitoring tool, with rather interesting results, as it assesses the combined effect of two important crop production factors (as opposed to descriptors such as NDVI). It was found, however, that NDVI-based indicators and Miami NPP efficiently complement each other.\nThe original Miami NPP (more details below) is based on total annual rainfall and average annual temperature data from meteorological stations. Strictly, it should thus be used only for monitoring complete seasons. The present post examines to what extent the method can be used for monitoring shorter periods (groups of dekads). Althouh the description below refers mostly to ground-based (station) data, the CropWatch implementation was based on a combination of satellite-derived rainfall and temperature.\nThe standard Miami NPP described\nIn the mid 1960s and seventies, after decolonization, countries where rediscovering the global dimension of the world; international organizations launched studies aiming at assessing the production potential of the planet, including natural vegetation (Unesco), crops (FAO’s Agroecological zones project; FAO 1978-81, FAO 1980) and soils (the FAO/Unesco soil map of the world). This is also the period when the Club of Rome published Limits to Growth, another study aiming at matching resources availability and requirements and which was to become the first of a long series of similar studies and scenarios published over the last 40 years (Meadows et al, 1972).\nThis was also a time when computing power was still limited and when plant and crop simulation models where still very much confined to the academic world, especially the pioneering “school of Wageningen” in the Netherlands developed around CT de Wit (de Wit et al 1972, Bouwman et at 1996). As a result, relating environmental factors to biological production potentials was still assessed mainly using empirical equations, such as the Miami model of Helmut Lieth (1972, 1973).\nLieth proposed the following equations, which constitute the basic Miami model. They are referred in this context as NPP_1: NPP based on annual climate variables for year y, Rain(y) and Temp(y), the total annual rainfall (mm) and the annual average temperature (deg. C)\nwith NPP_1 expressed in grammes of dry matter per square meter per year. The resulting curves are shown below in figure 1.\nBoth curves will eventually reach a (conventional) value of 3000 gDM/(m^2.day); they express the maximum production that can be achieved a a function of temperature (basically a proxy for solar energy) and water availability, two dominant limiting factors. For a given location, the minimum value of rainfall-imited and temperature-limited biomass accumulation is taken as the actual local production potential. Note that this is supposed to represent maximum annual biomass accumulation, which is different from standing biomass for perennials, including crops. The values expressed in gDM/(m^2.day) can easily be converted to tons biomass DM per Hectare: 1000 gDM/(m^2.day) is equivalent to 10 tons DM/Ha over one year, which would be about 3 tons of grain/Ha, considering that biomass is approximately partitioned into 50% of roots and 50% of above-ground biomass, of which, again, 50% can be assumed to be grain. This would be 2.5 tonnes DM. Making provision for some residual moisture, a value of 3 tonnes/Ha is probably an acceptable order of magnitude.Needless to say, actual values would depend on several additional factors, both crop specific and conditioned by the environmental conditions of growth such as water stress. Additional information can be found in Gommes et al 1999, 2009, 2010 as well as from the provided link. Global maps of Miami NPP are also available in GIS format from FAO or from here.\nIt is stressed that, while simple equations have gradually been superseded by satellite indices and model-based calculations, there is relatively little fundamental difference between the Miami model and and other well known and reputable approaches such as the CASA model of Potter et al (2007): both are empirically calibrated. There is more: both are basically potential production methods meant for planning rather than real-time or near real-time monitoring. In other words, regardless of the considerable variability that affects calibration data, the models can be used short-term monitoring. It is also stressed that there are several other empirical equations basically similat to the Miami “model”. Some are based on ETP, others on the length of growing season, on radiation etc. Some equations are very meaningful, for instance when they combine radiation (as source of energy to evaporate water) and water supply, as in the “Chikugo model”, but all have there shortcomings too. For instance, the Miami model pays no attention to the actual length of the growing season, relying on the statistical observation that long seasons are associated with larger amounts of precipitation than short ones. On the other hand, the mentioned Chukigo model, while very attractive because it incoporates latent heat of vaporization, rainfall and radiation, is not applicable in areas where frost occurs as temperature is not considered limiting. Another famous equation by Monteith combining radiation with a a cascade of “efficiences” has remained popular in many circles. The fact that all those more or less empirical equations as still fourty years after their first publication is a clear indicators of their usefulness. Refer to Gommes (1999) for additional examples and a short discussion of the empirical biomass indicators and their uses.\n14 sample points to compare Miami NPP approaches in monitoring\nBefore focusing on the different behaviours of “annual” and “dekad” Miami NPP, 14 points were selected across continents and climates to intuitively illustrate orders of magnitude of NPP and other indices in relation to climate and lanscape. They are shown in the table below, together with several classical climatic indicators: the Köppen climate class, Budyko Radiation Dryness Index (RDI; dimensionless), Miami NPP (Net Primary Production potential in grammes of dry matter per square meter per year, gDM/(m^2.year)), Gorczynski continentality index (dimensionless), total annual rainfall (mm) and annual average temperature (deg. C) are all computed using the New_LocClim, software developed by Jürgen Grieser for FAO in collaboration with the German Weather Service, DWD. See this link to download the software and find out additional details about the listed indices. The pictures on the left were taken from the Degree Confluence project. The second “areal photograph” is a satellite image from GoogleEarth, corresponding to a view from an altitude of about 2000m. The views are clickable and provide also (Bottom right corner) the elevation of the area. The last column (climatic diagramme) was prepared with Gnumeric using data generated with New_LocCLim, i.e. resulting from a double interpolation: (1) spatially interpolated to the points of integer coordinates (2) dekad values estimated using Fourier interpoation from monthly averages.\nNote that the value of “Miami NPP” corresponds to the value of NPP_1 described above. Also note that the values shown in the left column for NPP_1, Rain total (in mm) and Temp. average may slightly differ from those shown in the climatic diagramme of the last column due to rounding errors. The two NPP values given under “Miami NPP dek.” are both dekad based and will receive additional attention below.The first corresponds to NPP_2 and the second to NPP_3.\nComputation of Miami NPP with annual Vs dekadal data\nTwo approaches (NPP_2 and NPP_3) were explored to compute Miami NPP based on dekadal data. Both start with the calculation of “dekadal NPP”, which can be interpreted – ideally – as the contribution of each dekad to the annual NPP. NPP_2 and NPP_3 are both based on dekad climate variables for dekads dek=1 to 36 (one complete season, or sometimes a shorter period), Rain(dek) and Temp(dek). First compute the contribution of each dekad to annual NPP\nThe equations below explain the difference between NPP_2 and NPP_3.\nIn the case of NPP_2, for each dekad compute\nFigure 2 compares NPP_1, NPP_2 (in blue) and NPP_3 (in red) for the 14 sample points of the previous section. Correlations appear to rather good but the regression coefficients do markedly differ from 1 (0.805 for NPP_3 and 0.774 for NPP_2). In other words both NPP_2 and NPP_3 understimate NPP over the annual vegetation and climate cycle. This is, however, a minor issue in monitoring terms, as we are not considering NPP in absolute terms but as an indicator capable of integrating both rainfall and temperature. The absolute value of the indicator is of little relevance.\nThe table below shows NPP_2 and NPP_3 as well as other indices for the 14 locations. It provides some additional information about the order of magnitude of the difference between NPP_1, NPP_2 nd NPP_3 over a wide spectrum of environmental conditions. NPP_2 and NPP_3 systematically underestimate NPP_1 by about 0 to 20% (the two last columns express the % error which results from using NPP_2 or NPP_3 instead of NPP_1. One point differs markedly from all the others: 132E 61N (Eastern Siberia) in a location where birch and lark apparently make up the sparse woody vegetation. The point provides a good illustration of the need to consider both standing biomass and NPP. The area is characterised by a very cold climate (Dfd) with an average annual temperature close to -10 degrees. Obviously a very fragile ecosystem where biomass replacement (and decay) occur very slowly. It is obvious that, in this case, the dekadal temperature curve is too optimistic, as no growth is certainly to be expected at below zero temperature.\nComparison of NPP_1, NPP_2 and NPP_3 using randomly simulated data\nIt appears that some additional exploration of the relative behaviour of NPP_1, NPP_2 and NPP_3 is required, to better understand the role of rainfall and temperature, in particular the differences to be expected as a function of the relative timing of high temperatures (i.e. growth compatible temperatures) and the rainy season. Obviousy, a lot of empirical knowledge went into the standad Miami NPP equations (NPP_1). For instance, it could be assumed that whenever precipitation coincides with the cold season (mostly as snow), with no additional rain falling during the warmer season, the outcome should be no production potential and no vegetation. This is not so, however… at least not statistically: moisture is stored above the ground as snow and below the ground in the root zone, and becomes available during the time of snow melt, even if the growing period is very short. This explains why the curves selected by Lieth differ markedly at low values, in order to account for non-zero NPP at negative temperatures. This makes perfect sense with annual data, but becomes meaningless when considering dekadal NPP. The observation also explains why, as will be shown below, NPP_3 provides more meaningful and consistent data than NPP_2: the summation somehow restores the statistical validity that is inherent in NPP_1.\nA simple model was built using the Gnumeric spreadsheet to test the effect of the relative timing of rainfall and the warm season on the validity of NPP_2 and NPP_3 as biomass monitoring tools. The figure below shows two different and contrasting simulation runs.\nMiami NPP can be computed based on dekad values of rainfall and temperature. Correlations between the standard Miami NPP based on annual rainfall and temperature and two variants of dekad-based calculations are very high, confirming that, statistically, the dekads values can be used since NPP is used as an indicator: spatial variations and inter-annual variations are preserved. In general, dekad-based NPP underestimates NPP by about 20%, except in very cold locations where crop agriculture is unlikely to be practiced. For a given location, the ratio between dekad-based NPP and annual-data-based NPP varies as a function of rainfall: high ratios are associated with high temperature values. Finally, the variant of dekad-based NPP described as NPP_3 is generally a better choice that variant NPP_2. It is, therefore, recommended for crop monitoring with the Miami equations when dekad data are used.\nBouman BAM, Van Keulen H, van Laar HH, Rabbinge R, Van Keulen H 1996 The ‘School of de Wit’ crop growth simulation models: a pedigree and historical overview.

The spreadsheet also contains two sheets explaining how to compute series of statistical data following the Weibull and the normal distribution. The original intention was to use the Weibull distribution for both rainfall and temperature, as this would have allowed to simulate the positive skew affecting rainfall (especially low values) as well as the the positive skew that is often observed with temperatures. Eventually, to simplify and accelerate things, a normal distribution was adopted; it is suggested that the simulation would only have been marginally improved using the Weibul distribution.\nThe sample outputs illustrated in figure 3(A) and (B) correpond to the same input values. The figures are based on a number of random numbers used to simulate climate data. The random numbers where reactivated between the two runs. A rotal of 50 runs was carried out, as a larger number would require a different tool.\nA note follows about the derivation of the equation that was used to estimate standard deviation of rainfall as a function of total rainfall. Figure 6 was prepared based a dekadal Ethiopian data between 1991 and 2009 in 9 stations. The fact that Etiopia was selected is irrelevant, as the intention was just to derive a typical relation between average rainfall and standard deviation at the dekadal scale. The relation was subsequently fitted with CurveExpert which indicated that the Vapour pressure equation was the second best.\n(*) See the provided links to download Gnumeric for Linux or for Windows.

6	snow load calculation factors and roof drainage system requirements construction	Snow load calculations must account for multiple factors including recent ground snow data, building shape, wind exposure, thermal values, and occupancy. A single inch of snow can weigh between 1/4 to 3/4 pounds per square foot, while ice weighs about 5 pounds per square foot. For proper drainage, a building needs reasonable drain openings, adequate pitch from high points to drainage components, and overflow scuppers in different areas to prevent water accumulation. The drainage system design is crucial as improper drainage can lead to sediment and water accumulation that will eventually destroy roofing materials.	"[""How To Do Shed Roof Framing Yourself\nLearn how to build your own shed roof frame...\nAnyone who has ever stood and watched professional carpenters frame in a house or roof has probably stood in awe of the “amazing” skills it takes to put all the pieces in place perfectly.\nThe reality is that shed roof framing is nowhere near as complicated as you might think. If you are like me, you probably have a reasonably good idea of how to build most of your shed. That is except for the crowning glory, the shed roof.\nIn truth framing in the foundation and the walls, adding doors and windows, these are all relatively straightforward, simple tasks.\n- For many people, the idea of having to do the shed roof framing is a little bit on the scary side.\n- What gables, gambrel style roofs, how do you calculate the angle for the trusses, and what about the rafters?\n- Should you build a “stick frame” roof, make your own trusses, or buy them ready built?\n- What type of roof is going to provide the necessary strength?\n- How do stick built and truss style roofs differ?\nThe most important thing to remember is that if you can frame in the foundation and the walls of your shed, there is no reason why you can't also handle the shed roof framing.\nTo be sure using pre-built trusses is the easiest way to go, but with a little practice, you can create a jig that can be placed on the floor of your garage or your back deck that can be used to build a set of trusses for your shed that will be perfect.\nIt All Starts with the Right Tools and Equipment\nNo matter whether you are talking on baking a cake, changing the oil in your car, or shed roof framing, it all starts with having the right tools and equipment for the job.\nIn most cases, simple hand tools are good for most of the work, but there are going to be a few power tools that will either be necessary or will make the job much easier and go more quickly.\nLet's take a look at the tools you are going to need:\n- Safety goggles or glasses for each person working on the project\n- Leather gloves to protect your hands\n- Ear plugs for use with power tools\n- Knee pads\nTools You MUST Have\nThere are just some tools you can't build anything without. This list is only to get you off to a good start, I am sure there are a few I haven't listed or you have your own favorites to add to the list.\nThe most important thing to remember is to use the tools you are most comfortable with as this will make the project go much more quickly.\n- Tape Measure\n- 4 or 6-foot level\n- Circular saw\n- Power drill\n- Sawhorses (at least 2)\n- Nail set (punch)\n- Speed Square\n- Extension ladder\n- Step ladder\n- Heavy duty shears or scissors\nTools it Would be Nice to Have\nWhile hand tools are all well and good, they are not the most efficient way to get the job done. It can take hours to hammer in all the nails needed to take care of all the foundation, wall, and shed roof framing, not to mention the number of blisters you are likely to end up with if you try.\nYou can pick up a small pancake compressor for under a hundred bucks from Amazon or your local discount home improvement store. Framing and roofing nail guns can be found for around the same price.\nIf you are going to use pneumatic nail guns, be sure to read all of the safety warnings and instructions before using them. You should never use a pneumatic tool without the proper safety equipment (goggles or safety glasses) and take a little time to learn how it works on scrap wood before you try to take on your shed roof framing.\n- Air compressor\n- Air powered framing nail gun\n- Air powered roofing nail gun\n- Air powered staple gun\n- Electric miter saw\nMaterials You Will Need\nWhile this might seem obvious, there are certain materials needed to build any kind of shed roof framing. For the most part, your shed plans should come with a list of the materials needed for each part of the shed from the foundation to the roof.\nOne of the most important things to consider when buying your lumber is to take a little extra time and check each piece for straightness, excessive knots, holes, chips out of the edges, and cracks that can and will have a detrimental effect on your finished roof.\nHere is a short list of common materials you might use in building your roof:\n- 2 x 4\n- 2 x 6\n- Plywood or chipboard sheathing\n- Roofing felt\n- Shingles or metal roofing\n- Drip edging\n- Ridge or gable vents\n- Truss plates (used to connect the individual truss pieces together)\n- Hurricane tie-downs (metal plates designed to solidly connect the trussed to the walls)\nDifferent Types of Roof\nBeyond the standard flat roof or single sloped roof, the most common styles of shed roof are gable, gambrel, skillion, and salt box.\nEach of these styles has their advantage both in design and construction. All of them make a good choice for your garden shed.\nThe Gable Style Roof\nA gable style roof is considered to be the easiest type of shed roof framing to work with.\nEssentially you will be building a series of triangular shaped trusses based on the pitch of your roof. You will need to build a number of trusses based on the length of your roof.\nThis roof style is similar to those seen on the average house with a single peak in the center and one slope on either side\nThe Gambrel Style Roof\nThe gambrel style roof is a lot like the old “barn” style roof. It has two slopes on each side of the peak.\nThe main idea behind this type of roof is that it provides you with a huge amount of storage space, especially when the walls are six feet tall.\nIt is one of my favorite roof styles and is also perfect for adding a cupola to for added ventilation and appearance.\nThe Saltbox Style Roof\nThe saltbox style roof is also a dual slope roof like the standard gable roof in that it only has two slopes. The big difference is that the front slope is shorter than the rear slope. It adds a lot of style and charm to your garden shed.\nThe Skillion Style Roof\nThis is a single slope roof with a peak at either the front or rear of the shed. It is simple to construct and considered to be quite strong.\nThese are typically the easiest types of roof to build and take the least amount of materials and time. Watch a skillion roof being built here.\nAll of these common roof styles require some form of truss to be built in order to support the covering and any load such as snow weight.\nThe one good thing is that once you have decided on the roof pitch all you have to do is built the first truss and use it to create a jig you can use to build the rest of the trusses so that they all match.\nThe Basic Step-by-Step Construction Process\nIf you have never built a shed before, let alone worked with any type of shed roof framing, you might be surprised at just how easy it really is.\nThe first step is to determine the desired pitch of your shed roof. As complicated as this might seem and as many places that will try to tell you that you need to fully understand complex geometry, the reality is much simpler.\nRoof pitch is the angle of slope of your roof based on the amount of rise versus the distance from the edge of the roof to the center.\nYour roof must have a minimum pitch of at least 3-12. What this means is that for every 12 inches of horizontal run your roof needs to rise at least 3 inches.\nYou can use a roof pitch calculator to determine your pitch and make the necessary adjustments to your design.\nBear in mind the steeper the pitch the more likely your shed roof will be able to shed rain and snow.\nBuild the Trusses\nNow that you have the roof pitch calculated, it's time to measure the lumber and build your first truss.\nThis is where you need to understand basic trigonometry in that in an equilateral triangle there are 3 sides, let's call them a, b, and c. Basic Pythagorean theory states that the length of a² + b² = c². Thus, if side a is 3 feet and side b is 4 feet then the length of c should be 5 feet.\nYou can substitute any numbers into this equation and figure out the length of side c which is the longest run.\nOnce you have created the basic truss pattern, you can cut and lay out the first truss, which you will use as a pattern to build the rest.\nThere are two ways to connect the pieces together, the first is to overlap the boards and either screw or nail them together. The other is to use metal plates available at most hardware stores and home improvement stores to join them in a single flat truss.\nBoth methods will get the job done, however, the metal plate butt joint method tends to be stronger and is better suited to areas with a lot of snow or high winds.\nThis cool video will show you how to build gable style shed roof framing.\nHow the Weight is Supported\nThe way in which the weight of the roof itself and any rain or snow load is supported varies based on the design of your roof and trusses.\nIn a skillion style roof, the lumber provides most of the support with the use of spacers placed between the long run of roof beam and the rafters. These roofs are relatively strong and inexpensive to build.\nIn a standard two slope roof, the weight can be distributed in a couple of ways. For the most part the weight is supported by the triangular shape, however, one the ends there are supports running from the beams or rafters up to the top angled board of the truss.\nThe same can be said of the gambrel style roof. But the skillion style used supports like this across the entire structure, making it exceptionally strong.\nUnderstanding Snow Load\nAccording to roofing experts, snow load is the amount of additional force or weight of the snow and ice that is pressing down on the roof. There are several factors that must be taken into consideration when trying to calculate snow load, including:\n- Variations in temperature\n- Mixed moisture\nBear in mind that a single inch of snow can weigh from 1/4 lb. to 3/4 lbs. per square foot. A single inch of ice comes in at just under 5 pounds per square foot, this is approximately 5 times the average weight of the same amount of snow.\nDoing the calculations can be extremely confusing unless you are an expert in the field. The person doing the calculation has several factors to consider:\n- Recent ground snow information provided by the National Weather Service\n- The shape of the building including the roof and any obstructions on the roof\n- How much wind the roof is exposed to\n- The application of the building and how many occupants it has\n- The thermal values of the building\nYou should use a snow load calculator to help you get in the ballpark and ensure your shed roof framing is going to be strong enough to take on your worst winter weather.\nInstalling the Trusses\nAll roof trusses must be properly installed, but don't worry this is not as difficult as it seems. In this video, we see standard gable roof trusses being installed.\nThe most important thing to remember is that all trusses must be installed perfectly vertical for them to be effective.\nInstalling the Sheathing\nOnce the trusses are built and in place, the next step is to install the sheathing.\nThis is done by installing a number of sheets of either plywood or particle board over the top of the trusses. Not only does this give you somewhere to attach the roofing felt and shingles, it also adds to the structural integrity of your shed roof.\nFollow the steps in this video to learn more about installing the sheathing.\nFinally, the Shingles\nNow you are ready to finish your shed roof using standard asphalt roofing shingles. The shingles will keep rain and snow at bay, help to reflect the sun's UV rays, and put the finishing touch on your garden shed.\nIn this video, we see how to install the roof felt, the drip edge, and the shingles to create a complete roof that will last you for many years.\nTo Top It Off\nI hope you have enjoyed this brief tutorial on shed roof framing and that you have learned something from it.\nThe most important things to remember are that you need to follow your shed plans to the letter, everything needs to be square, use plenty of nails or screws, and most of all be confident in your ability to get the job done.\nYou don't have to be an expert carpenter to build roof trusses or install a solid functional roof for your shed, just have the patience to take your time and get the job done.\nI have tried to give you the information I found useful during the construction of my garden shed, much of which I wish I had had when I started to build my shed. Some of which I learned by trial and error.\nThe good news is that in the end this information along with the videos can help you build a garden shed that can stand up to years of rain and snow and will serve you well.\nI hope you have enjoyed reading this and it has helped you learn how to build the best possible shed roof framing for your shed.\nIf you liked what I have put together for you here, please let me know.\nLet everyone know you enjoyed reading this on Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest.\nThank you for reading this."", 'Many contractors are assigned with one difficult task to accomplish: How to identify roof problems. Here is our list of common areas on where to inspect and discover those roof problems. Although there could be different areas that you have to investigate, these are the most repeated scenarios.\nRoof material deteriorates with direct exposure to weather inclemencies. Inorganic roofing materials are less susceptible than organic materials. Exposure to pollutants or industrial atmosphere may accelerate the decay of your roofing material.\nLack of Maintenance\nIt is most common on flat or low-sloped roofs. Failure to correct an uneven roof will cause the accumulation of sediments and water that will eventually destroy your material.\nDesign-related problems are expensive to correct, and normally the corrections must be done while the replacement of the roofing material is undergoing. Some examples are:\n- The weak structure supporting the roof that might deflect excessively under active loads.\n- Improper roof slope, sagging roof, or inadequate drainage system, resulting in accumulation of water.\n- Incorrect system to allow expansion and contraction of changes in deck material or changes in direction.\n- Incompatible roof materials.\nThe vacuum and the uplifting pressure created by wind, blowing over the edge of the roof, can partially rip the roofing membrane or system that has been applied. To counteract the forces that are exerted on the roof, the roofing and insulation must be fastened and secured to the perimeter and the main roof structure.\nThe function of the flashing is to provide a seal, a watertight seal, between roofing materials, roof sections, and other parts of the building. It is an area that should be carefully inspected prior to any other area. Incorrect installation procedure or attachment, and improper sealing of the flashing will allow the water to enter between the roofing systems and the roof structure. Sometimes, installing a flashing over a joint or cap will eliminate the problem if it is detected early in the construction.\nBase-flashing problems also present some serious and important areas that you must inspect. Some common causes are:\n- An insufficient number of base-flashing piles.\n- Improper height.\n- Insufficient overlaps.\n- Poor adhesion.\n- Incorrect fastening to the surface.\n- Insufficient coating.\n- Loose insulation below.\nEither small or large penetration flashing can fail in several ways. As a matter of example:\n- Improper design.\n- Broken seams in metal curbs due to building movement.\n- Deteriorated counter flashing.\n- Improper finishing of metal surfaces.\n- Standing water behind penetration curbs.\nIt is not as simple as installing lots of drain openings. The building’s drain system should consist of reasonable drain openings, an adequate pitch from high point to drainage components. It is a good practice to include overflow scuppers through different areas to avoid the accumulation of water in case of an emergency. Proper maintenance should be given to all of these areas.\nIt is very easy to install the A/C compressor, the satellite antenna, and other components directly to the surface. Proper attention should be given when this kind of equipment is installed. They should never be mounted or placed directly to the top of the roof membrane. They should be mounted to a support structure or raised curb-type supports. Flat flange or curb flashing can then be used to keep the roof watertight, and roof replacement and recovery can be done without disturbing or removing the equipment.\nMetal Base Flashings\nThese types of flashing will separate easily from bituminous materials. The expansion and contraction rate of these two materials will produce cracks and openings that will allow the water to enter and damage the surface. For these reasons, metal base flashing should be replaced with a bituminous base flashing whenever possible.']"	['<urn:uuid:51131021-e55f-4c46-81ee-42b8b8192d1e>', '<urn:uuid:bb65e101-c883-4650-8f35-62093a9401af>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	10	94	3082

['There are many Police services across Canada that are looking to hire. If you are ready to become one of Canada’s Police officers, decide which organization is right for you and then get your application package by linking to their website.\nRequirements – Basic\nThese are the basic requirements for most police services:\n• Canadian citizen, landed immigrant or legally able to work in Canada\n• Age 18 – 65\n• Canadian secondary school diploma or equivalent\n• Proficient in English or French\n• Valid Canadian driver’s license – no restrictions\n• No criminal record\n• Excellent health and physical fitness\n• Meet visual acuity tests\nRequirements – Preferred\nThese are the preferred requirements for most police services:\n• 2 years post secondary education\n• computer skills (working knowledge of Word, Windows)\n• good typing skills\n• first aid certificate including CPR for infant, child, and adult\n• community involvement, volunteer experience\n• strong credit rating\nThese are the documents typically required by most Police services across Canada:\n• proof of citizenship (Birth certificate or passport)\n• valid Canadian driver’s license – no restrictions\n• school certificates and transcripts\nVisual Acuity and Hearing Standards\n• uncorrected visual acuity should be at least 6/12 (20/40) binocularly (both eyes open).\n• corrected visual acuity should at least be 6/6 (20/20) binocularly.\n• there are typically additional minimum requirements regarding refractive surgery, farsightedness\n(hyperopia), colour vision, depth perception and peripheral vision.\n• hearing standards: normal hearing at frequencies of 500 to 4000 Hz measured by audiometer.\nThe Selection Process typically includes the following steps, order may vary:\n• information session and registration\n• written exams\n• physical test\n• video simulation\n• vision tests\n• application submission\n• polygraph test\n• background investigation\n• psychological testing\n• medical test\n• selection decision\nInformation Session and Registration\nYou can attend an information session or register for the selection process on line. Check the Police services’ website of your choice to find out details about the information sessions, including where and when – this information is updated often. You can also use most websites to register.\nThe registration begins the selection process and may cost up to $300.00. Once you are registered, you will be informed of the dates and times for your written, physical, and vision tests. For those in Ontario, once you have completed Pre-Interview Assessment Testing (written, physical, video simulation, and vision testing) you will be given a Certificate of Results which will allow you to proceed to Application Submission.\nTypically applicants are required to write “suitability” tests. The written tests include cognitive tests, written communication tests, and/or personality questionnaires. The cognitive tests are designed to assess a candidate’s ability to reason, recall information, and perform simple math calculations.\nThese are skills necessary to performing as a police officer. The written communication tests assess your communication skills. The personality questionnaires assess your attitudes related to competencies required for policing. There is not any preparation work that can be done to help you perform on these tests.\nYou must prove that you are physically fit. This is done through a standardized fitness test designed specifically for police related activities. Each police service requires this test to be conducted close to the application process. The name of test may differ for each organization (POPAT, PARE, PREP), but the tests are similar.\nPARE: Physical Abilities Requirement Evaluation\nPOPAT: Police Officer Physical Ability Test\nPREP: Physical Readiness Evaluation for Police\nThey involve a timed run with obstacles, a push/pull exercise, and carrying a weighted torso bag a certain distance. These tasks are done to simulate an officer’s duties in a critical incident: chase, control, and apprehend a suspect. The test results are valid for 6 months and there may be a fee for taking the test (approx $60).\nYou may also be required to perform a Video Simulation Test – view a scene on a TV screen and be required to interact with the people in the scene. No prior knowledge of policing is necessary to perform this test.\nA vision test is required to indicate you have the ability to see well enough to perform the duties of a police officer. Standards for visual acuity are used.\nOnce you have completed the written testing and demonstrated your physical fitness capabilities you will be given an application package with various forms. Complete and submit all forms – be thorough and ensure you have included all documents.\nYou will be interviewed – maybe a number of interviews conducted by one interviewer or a panel of several interviewers. Interviews are usually structured – meaning that all candidates are asked the same questions and their responses are evaluated using the same criteria.\nYou may undergo a polygraph test. This test will explore the background information you provided about yourself in the application forms. Instructions will be given to you prior to taking the test but honesty is the key.\nThorough background investigations are conducted for all police candidates – typically centered on: character, friends and associations, education, past employment, finances, drug and alcohol use, and criminal activities.\nYou will undergo psychological testing – administered by a professional psychologist and the results will not likely be shared with you. If considered suitable, you will move to the next stage of the selection process.\nYou must show that you are healthy enough for Policing duties. This will require a medical exam.\nA panel will review all stages of the selection process and decide whether you will be selected for hire. If you are successful you will be given instructions about your training.\nOnce you have advanced through the selection process you become a cadet and for most police services receive a salary at the cadet or lowest constable level. Cadets enter the training process – typically including recruit training and field work training.\n• cadet or recruit training (17 weeks to 24 weeks)\n• field training work with field coach/field training officer\nRecruit training refers to the basic and advanced training given to recruits to prepare for work as a police officer. This type of training involves academic instruction and physical skills training – conducted at an academy or learning center. For 17-24 weeks recruits are physically and mentally challenged. They are given instruction in such things as:\n• legal studies\n• driving skills\n• firearms safety and use\n• communication skills and conflict management\n• investigative techniques\n• public and police safety\n• community policing\n• tactical training\n• physical training\nAll aspects of this training are evaluated and recruits are expected to meet or exceed standards to continue in the program and graduate successfully.\nField training refers to the on-the-job coaching for recruits – once recruits have successfully completed the basic training they begin work as a police officer and work with a field coach or field training officer who guides and supports their work on the job. All aspects of this phase involve supervision and evaluation.\nAre You Ready?\nThis checklist is designed to help you decide whether a policing career is right for you. It is a questionnaire that you fill out.

what! at the dear price\n- Of all my happiness! it cannot be;\n- ’Twere infamous and base, the worst of crimes.\n- But wherefore is the prince thus hateful to you?\n- Why in these days of discord, war, and tumult,\n- Whilst faction reigns, and of our royal race\n- Brother ’gainst brother arms, and every hour\n- Brings new afflictions, wherefore should Amelia,\n- Whose gentler stars for other purposes\n- Had formed her soul, to love and to be loved,\n- Why should Amelia, with such sentiments\n- Of scorn and hatred, meet a hero’s vows\n- Who had avenged her cause? The prince, thou knowest,\n- Amongst his ancestors can boast the blood\n- Of our first kings, and is himself a lord\n- Of rich domains, and wide-extended power.\n- He loves you, offers you his hand: can rank\n- And title, objects that are envied still\n- By all mankind, pursued with eagerness,\n- And gained with rapture, can these only fill\n- Thy heart with sorrow, and thy eyes with tears?\n- Because he saved me once, has he a right\n- Now to oppress me? Must Amelia fall\n- A victim to his fatal aid? I know\n- I’m much indebted to him, would I were not!\n- Thou shalt know my heart,\n- My miseries, my duty, and my fate:\n- I will no longer keep the secret from thee,\n- ’Twere cruel to distrust thee; when thou knowest\n- My story, thou mayst justify thy friend.\n- I must not listen to the prince’s vows,\n- For know, my heart is given to his brother.\n- Yes, my friend:\n- With mutual oaths we sealed our mutual faith,\n- And at Leucate I expected him,\n- There to confirm it at the holy altar,\n- When by the cruel Moors that rushed upon us\n- I was surprised, and made a captive; then\n- The prince, to these unconquered savages\n- In firm alliance bound, appeared, and saved me;\n- There’s my distress: the life another saved\n- Must be devoted to the faithful Vamir.\n- But why then thus conceal thy passion? why\n- Nourish a hopeless flame thou shouldst extinguish?\n- He would respect this sacred tie, and check\n- His fruitless passion.\n- O I must not tell him:\n- The brothers, to complete my sorrows, armed\n- Against each other, have taken different parties\n- In this destructive war; the faithful Vamir\n- Fights for his king. Thou knowest the violence\n- Of his proud rival: all I can oppose\n- To his fierce rage is melancholy silence;\n- Even yet he knows not that in happier times\n- The gallant Vamir had engaged my heart:\n- To tell it him would fire his jealous soul,\n- And only make Amelia more unhappy.\n- ’Tis time to quit this fatal place, the king\n- With pleasure will receive me: let us hence.\n- The prisoners, Thais, from these walls even now\n- Are breaking forth, and meditate their flight:\n- They will conduct us: I defy all danger,\n- Will hazard all for freedom and repose.\n- I cannot speak to him,\n- The starting tear would soon betray me: what\n- Would I not give forever to avoid him!\nduke of foix, lisois, thais.\n- [To Thais.\n- Avoid me! fly me!

9	I'm planning a long flight next week and heard about blood clots being dangerous during travel. What steps can I take to prevent them during the flight, and what medical treatments are available if someone gets a clot?	To prevent blood clots during flights, you should stay mobile by lifting your knees, rotating your ankles while seated, and walking when possible. It's important to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, avoid crossing your legs for long periods, and consider wearing compression stockings to prevent blood from pooling in your legs. If a blood clot does form and travels to the lungs (pulmonary embolism), treatment options include blood thinners (anticoagulants) like heparin or warfarin to prevent new clots from forming, and in life-threatening situations, clot dissolvers (thrombolytics) may be used. For very large clots, doctors can remove them using a catheter, or install a filter in the main vein to prevent clots from reaching the lungs.	"[""Treatment is aimed at keeping the blood clot from getting bigger and preventing new clots from forming. Prompt treatment is essential to prevent serious complications or death.\n- Blood thinners (anticoagulants). These drugs prevent new clots from forming while your body works to break up the clots. Heparin is a frequently used anticoagulant that can be given through the vein or injected under the skin. It acts quickly and is often overlapped for several days with an oral anticoagulant, such as warfarin, until it becomes effective, which can take days. A newer class of anticoagulants has been tested and approved for treatment of venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism. These medications have the advantage of being given by mouth, without the need for overlap with heparin. Also, they work quickly and have fewer interactions with other medications. All blood thinners have side effects, with bleeding being the most common.\n- Clot dissolvers (thrombolytics). While clots usually dissolve on their own, there are medications given through the vein that can dissolve clots quickly. Because these clot-busting drugs can cause sudden and severe bleeding, they usually are reserved for life-threatening situations.\nSurgical and other procedures\nMarch 18, 2015\n- Clot removal. If you have a very large, life-threatening clot in your lung, your doctor may suggest removing it via a thin, flexible tube (catheter) threaded through your blood vessels.\n- Vein filter. A catheter can also be used to position a filter into the body's main vein — called the inferior vena cava — that leads from your legs to the right side of your heart. This filter can help keep clots from being carried into your lungs. This procedure is typically reserved for people who can't take anticoagulant drugs or when anticoagulant drugs don't work well enough or fast enough. The catheter with the filter in the tip is usually inserted in a vein in your neck, and then into the vena cava. Some filters can be removed when they are no longer needed.\n- Pulmonary embolism.

Accessed Feb. 16, 2015."", 'NYU Langone doctors offer advice on how to prevent pulmonary embolism, a serious blockage in the arteries of the lungs. This condition is usually caused by blood clots that develop in the deep veins of the legs, called deep vein thrombosis.\nIf not treated quickly, these clots can break loose and travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, leading to pulmonary embolism. This starves lung tissue of blood, making it difficult or impossible for the lungs to provide oxygen to the rest of the body. Pulmonary embolism is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment with medication, surgery, or both.\nThe best way to prevent pulmonary embolism is to minimize the chance of developing blood clots and deep vein thrombosis. Risk factors include prolonged immobility, having a family history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, being older than age 60, having certain cancers, being a smoker, and using oral contraceptives or hormone therapy.\nLeading an active lifestyle, quitting smoking, and staying as mobile as possible can decrease your risk of developing pulmonary embolism.\nIf you regularly remain inactive at a desk for many hours a day, NYU Langone doctors advise you to stand frequently and stretch, take occasional walking breaks, and flex and move your legs and feet while seated. These small steps increase and promote healthy blood flow.\nLong car and plane rides may force you to sit in one position, but our doctors recommend that you find ways to move as much as possible. Avoid crossing your legs for long periods of time.\nIf you’re on a plane, lift your knees and rotate your ankles to get blood moving while sitting, and stand up and walk when possible. If you’re in a car, take regular breaks to stretch and move around.\nDehydration can increase the risk of blood clots. Drinking plenty of water is always important, but it’s especially necessary when you’ve been immobile for several hours. Drink as much water as possible and make time for bathroom breaks and to stretch your legs.\nOur doctors also advise wearing compression stockings on long trips to help keep blood from pooling in the legs.\nPeople who are at risk of developing blood clots may be given anticoagulant, or blood-thinning, medications before and after any surgery. This decreases the risk of blood clots forming during recovery, when you may be lying in bed for long periods of time. If you’re having surgery, our doctors and nurses encourage you to get up and walk and move around as soon as it’s safe to do so.\nBeing obese puts additional pressure on the veins in the legs, which can contribute to poor blood flow and the development of blood clots. If you’re overweight, losing even a few pounds can lower blood pressure and increase blood flow. NYU Langone doctors can direct you to our Weight Management Program to help guide you to a healthier weight.\nToxic chemicals in cigarettes harm blood cells and blood vessels and make you more susceptible to deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Our specialists know that quitting isn’t easy. NYU Langone offers effective Tobacco Cessation Programs.\nHormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptives increase the risk of developing blood clots and pulmonary embolism, especially if you smoke or are overweight.\nEstrogen, which is often found in hormone replacement and oral contraceptives, raises the risk of deep vein thrombosis by increasing the production of certain chemicals that help blood to clot. It can also increase the number of platelets, which are blood cells that stick together and form clots.\nProgestin has been shown to cause the blood vessels to widen, allowing blood to pool in the veins, which also increases the risk of clot formation. Your NYU Langone physician can discusses with you in detail whether these treatments are right for you and suggest alternatives, if needed.\nNYU Langone specialists provide care and support throughout your entire healthcare journey.Browse Doctors']"	['<urn:uuid:ac594f0b-c850-4958-9484-8bcd3a916dd4>', '<urn:uuid:563784fd-52f4-4b49-8423-fd97ce902931>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	38	118	1251
10	i want to know how many people lack toilets and how can ecoloo help them	Over 2.5 billion people lack access to proper toilets, often practicing open defecation in spaces like riverbanks and streets. ECOLOO helps address this by providing a waterless toilet system that can be installed in remote areas without sewage infrastructure. It uses special bacteria to break down waste and convert urine into organic fertilizer, while being odor-free and easy to maintain.	"['For those who missed it, or those who want a refresher, here are the notes from ‘From The Bottom Up: The Fantastical World of Human Waste’ delivered at Loncon on 17 August, 2014.\nDisclaimer: The words that actually came out of my mouth may or may not bear any resemblance to the original plan!\nHello and thank you to everyone who has not only stuck it out until 9pm but also chosen to come to a talk about toilets over going to the Hugo Awards Ceremony!\nI expect this makes you all extremely intelligent interesting and classy people, so I hope we’ll eventually get on to a rousing discussion about the role of science fiction in inspiring new real world innovations. But first I’m going to speak for a bit about why I pitched this talk, and my own research into the subject.\nI currently run London Loo Tours, which is a walking tour of public toilets. The whole thing started as a joke. If you have been around London you’ll know that a lot of the public toilets here cost anywhere from 20 to 50p to use… which if you are a poor and miserly student like I was when I moved here can sometimes be dinner money! I thought the tour might last a month and that would be that, but a year and a half later it is more or less my full time job, and I have found the topic more bottomless than I could have imagined. It encompasses such a wide range of topics; health, history, sociology, anthropology, psychology… (and many other things ending on –ology!)\nBut when a friend suggested I pitch a talk on the subject for Loncon even I was initially a bit stumped. In my experience science fiction and fantasy tend to be about space ships and dragons… Not sewer systems and poo!\nBut then I came across the following quote from the website of the Bill and Melinda Gates re-invent the toilet challenge which was launched in 2011 to encourage engineers to find new solutions to global sanitation:\n“Although we can fly people to the moon, 40 percent of the world’s population - 2.5 billion people - practice open defecation or lack adequate sanitation facilities.”\n~ Dr. Doulaye Kone\nI want you to picture the scale of the problem for a moment… imagine that a third of you aren’t allowed to use the toilets in the ExCel centre. When you have to go, you’re going to have to go outside and find as private a place as you can. Most of you are going to end up practicing open defecation (which in laymens terms means having a shit on the side of the road.)\nIn 2002 the United Nations set a series of development goals meant to be achieved by 2015. The most off-track of these is 7c: to halve the number of people without access to a toilet. While sanitation is often the under-valued ugly duckling compared to it’s much sexier cousin ‘access to clean water’ it is one of the best investments a country can make.\nA lack of sanitation is the number one killer of children in developing countries, and leads to decreased productivity and higher school drop-out rates, particularly among young women.\nComing back closer to the world of Science Fiction: several months back I saw an interesting headline in the Evening Standard:\n‘Young engineers more likely to be inspired by Iron Man than Brunel’.\nA study carried out by Career Academies UK on students ages 16 to 19 had found that the young people tended to cite films such as Transformers, The Matrix and Star Wars rather than historical figures having inspired them to pursue STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects.\nThe article took a sort of despairing doom and gloom tone… what a world are we coming to when young people care more about fantasy than their history.\nBut I thought “AWESOME!!!” At last some validation that two degrees and tens of thousands of dollars spent on learning how to entertain people might be justifiable from the perspective of social good after all!!!\nScience fiction tends to look outwards towards the stars, and not back. But anyone who is suitably nerdy has probably at some point asked themselves where the toilets are on the star trek enterprise.\nThere is a whole wiki page devoted to this subject! A couple highlights:\n“The brig aboard Starfleet ships included facilities such as a sink and toilet, which were enclosed behind the wall until needed. A sign above the toilet read ""do not use while in spacedock."" (Star Trek V: The Final Frontier)”\nAccording to Jonathan Frakes during the ""Journey\'s End: The Saga of Star Trek: The Next Generation"" special in 1994, the Enterprise-D had only one bathroom and he proceeded to point to it on the large cross-section of the Enterprise-D in the main engineering set.\nOr on the TARDIS… this one is harder to find answers to on forums, but there have certainly been plenty of parodies due to the similarity of the shape of the Police Box and the portable toilet! In fact there was an interesting investigation in September 2013 on Tardis Toilet Hire… a company which had been trading for 15 years. BBC carefully protect their logo and the name, which they trademarked in 1976, but the company argued that his logo was not in any way meant to resemble the time and space traveling machine (okay, maybe it had a light on top and windows, but it was orange so couldn’t possibly be copyright infringement.)\nIn Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey a zero gravity toilet was included, complete with instructions for use. Descriptions include devices such as a “Sonvac cleanser” and “the uroliminator.”\nIn researching this talk I also stumbled across several forum threads on the flushable toilets in Mass Effect. (see here)\nBut toilets are usually thrown in as light relief. They rarely take center stage.\nWhile humans or aliens couldn’t function the same without them, they are either too taboo to talk extensively about, or too mundane a part of every day life to be included as key points in the story. So we have to be content with the fact that they are there somewhere and function exactly the way they are supposed to (as evidenced by the fact that there isn’t poo sitting in the hallways or - in zero gravity contexts- floating through the ship!)\nOne notable exception to this rule of sidelining sanitation in the world of Science Fiction and Fantasy is of course Terry Pratchett. Pick up any of his disc world books and you will almost without fail find some reference to a lavatory, cesspit, or dung-heap. He has even written ‘The World of Poo” (a companion to Snuff) which features young Geoffery’s adventures learning about the wonderful world of human waste.\nThe Pratchet character with whom I have the strongest affinity is, of course Harry King… Piss Harry to his friends and King of the Golden River to most others.\nHarry’s fortunes are based from enterprises dealing in human waste. To quote from The Truth:\n“The real foundations of his fortune came from when he started leaving empty buckets at various hostelries around the city… he charged a modest fee to take them away when they were full [… ] in a small way, making the world a better smelling place.” (The Truth, 107)\nBut Harry doesn’t stop there. The passage goes on to say:\n“There is very little, however disgusting, that isn’t used somewhere in some industry. There are people who want large quantities of ammonia and salt petre.” (ibid)\nIt’s a model not dissimilar to the Roman urine collectors who used to leave pots at the corners of streets, which they could then sell on for tanning, dying and whitening teeth (there is excellent Latin poetry about how if someone had a very white smile you knew exactly what he had been gargling!) The practice was so common that the Roman Emperor Vespasian actually imposed a tax on Urine in the year 70AD.\nPratchett’s sources are reasonably grounded in History. I pestered his publisher awhile back to see whether he could enlighten me on the matter and he very kindly wrote back to tell me that sources included Henry Mayhew’s Labour and the London Poor and Dorethy Hatley’s Water in England (Not Vespasian as far as he knew… but I still think there is some resemblance in the business model!)\nAnyone who has read the Diskworld books will be aware that Ankh Morpork bears a striking resemblance to 19th Century London. This is, coincidentally or not, about the time when the flush toilet started becoming popular. While the flushing toilet was in many ways one of the greatest life-saving devices ever invented it also served to divorce humans to some extent from their excrement.\nHave you ever stopped to think about how cool toilets actually are? You go for a poo or a wee in a porcelain bowl (and how often do you even eat off porcelain), push a button and it magically disappears never to be seen again (at least by you!) We do this five or six times a day, flushing over a third of the clean drinking water in the UK!\nWe can do this largely because in the year 1858 London faced the Great Stink, when the pollution of two and a half million humans became too much for the city to handle. It was a very hot June and the Thames heated up and smelled so bad that the problem could no longer be ignored. The man called upon was engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette who built London’s Sewer System, which carried all the waste out of London to the east (where they still actually dumped it directly into the Thames, but at least not in the city centre, and it could be washed out by the tides.) This is the same system we still use in London today, though it is now treated before it is released back into the wild.\nIt was the beginning of a new revolution and sanitation as we know it today, but the end of night soil men, gong farmers and urine collectors, and in some ways the end of a natural and practical recycling loop.\nThere is a second reason I am fond of Terry Pratchett in addition to his un-squeamishness when it comes to the scatological. It is the way he constructs his worlds, and the rules which they follow.\nA key idea Pratchett often speaks about is Narrativium.\n“Humans add narrativium to their world. They insist on interpreting the universe as if it’s telling a story. This leads them to focus on facts that fit the story, while ignoring those that don’t.”\n(Science of Diskworld I:233)\nNarrativium is how we make sense of which facts of our world to take into account. In Diskworld things happen in particular ways because that’s how it makes sense for them to work. A commonly cited example is that dragons breath fire not because they have asbestos lungs (or similar such nonsense) but because everyone knows that’s what dragons do.\nI find it singularly appropriate therefore that such a practical approach is taken to bodily functions and what happens to the waste. It makes a good kind of sense. It is a harmonious recycling loop, where nutrients come back round.\nAs a general rule this sadly cannot be said of our round-world narrative. Re-using our own waste is no longer seen as a natural idea, but something rather odd and a bit gross.\nThis may well be changing over the next few decades.\nThough no entrepreneurs have yet plumbed the depths of Harry King’s monopoly on the market entrepreneurs are beginning to show an increased interest in the subject. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s ‘Re-invent the toilet’ challenge not only focused on finding new non-waterborne means of waste disposal includes a remit to:\n“[Remove] germs from human waste and [recover] valuable resources such as energy, clean water, and nutrients.”\nA current example of award winners are a group of researchers at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory who have developed a means of charging mobile phones using urine. The researchers say:\n“One of the problems is going to be people’s perception to actually using their own waste as a potential source of fuel. There is a definite yuk factor.”\nI wonder whether story telling might serve as inspiration not only for engineers and inventors but for influencing our every day behavior.\nThere are over 7 Billion people living on earth. On average it is estimated that the world’s population can produce 2.8 billion gallons of urine in a day: enough to fill up 4,200 Olympic swimming pools! So whoever can find a way to harness that resource and reuse it will be onto something fantastic indeed!\nI leave you with the following question, though of course our discussion may take many additional directions!\n1) How has science fiction inspired you?\n2) What role do you think stories, films, games and fantasy worlds might have in influencing real life behavior?\n3) And of course just for fun… any favorite science fiction toilet moments?\nThere followed a hugely engaging 45-minute discussion with many contributors from the audience. I was not able to transcribe most of it, but have included a very few highlights and notes below (and may add more as time allows.) A tremendous thank you to all who shared stories!\nDo feel free to continue the discussion in the comments section, on twitter (@londonlootours #lonconloos) and over the dinner table!\nFurther mentions of toilets/scatological in Science Fiction:\nBabylon 5 includes a scene at a urinal.\nRobocop includes a toilet scene (viewable here)... note the CCTV in the toilet!\nThe Martian by Andy Weir stars an astronaut, botanist and engineer stranded on mars who must improvise with the available resources (including human waste) to survive.\nThe Dark Light Years by Brian Aldiss deals with human encounters with Aliens called the Utods who worship their own feces.\nA further Terry Pratchett influence is The Specialist.\nThe mysterious origins of the word \'Loo\':\nThe origins of the word “Loo” are frequently attributed to the Medieval cry of “Gardy-loo” (derived from French “Gardez-l’eau… the polite thing to shout before emptying a chamber pot out the window.)\nThis was called into question, and an audience member supplied a link suggesting more recent origins.\nMuseums and Exhibitions worth visiting:\nGladstone Pottery Museum in Stoke on Trent\nNational Air and Space Museum in Washington DC', ""brought to you in part by\nSwedish Start-up ECOLOO’s Solution For Cleaner Water & Sustainable Sanitation\nAward-winning Sustainable Toilet Technology that benefits health, water and the environment\nBy Suzanne Forcese\n“We are going to change the world by installing as many indoor and outdoor ECOLOO toilets as possible. Saving water. Saving the environment. Saving millions of lives.” -- Imad Agi, CEO, ECOLOO Group\nMore than half the world’s population uses unsafe sanitation facilities.\nPoor sanitation and a lack of sewage infrastructure in low-income and off-grid communities expose individuals to water-borne diseases which kill thousands every day.\nTo help reverse this alarming trend ECOLOO has developed an innovative way to treat human waste by breaking down excreta into ashes and converting urine into an organic liquid fertilizer that is pathogen-free, yet rich in nutrition. All this without water.\nECOLOO has developed a waterless toilet installation which is odour-free, energy- free and easy to set up. Its main innovation comes from the bacteria which treats the waste and creates a natural fertilizer. Malaysian entrepreneur and environmentalist, Zuraina Zaharin, collaborated with Swedish entrepreneur, Imad Agi to launch the ECOLOO waterless toilet system that is a hygienic sustainable way to combat disease and water scarcity.\nWATERTODAY learned more from Imad Agi, CEO of ECOLOO Group.\nWT: There’s an interesting backstory for both you, and your partner/ co-founder Zuraina Zaharin. What was the story behind a ‘problem’ that Zuraina encountered on Mount Everest? And you already had a ‘solution’ just waiting for an entrepreneur to appear. What was your solution?\nAgi: Zuraina encountered a problem finding a dignified toilet near Mount Everest while on a climb. The toilets available there were very dirty and full of human waste. ECOLOO could solve this problem by treating the waste onsite biologically and terminating the odor simultaneously.\nWT: What was the impetus for founding ECOLOO? Where is your company based?\nAgi: The ECOLOO development journey started from a TV documentary on Swedish TV showing the actual situation in India of people who were suffering from poor sanitation. Kids and women practised open defecation whilst the lowest caste Indian women collect excrement from door to door without gloves or shoes – just to earn a few rupees.\nThis loo story was the motivation behind the creation and R&D of ECOLOO. We are very passionate about this project.\nThe first ECOLOO pilot project was done for the Municipality of Stromstad, Sweden in 2008 and the toilet is still up and running until this date with great testimonials\nThe project was implemented next to a lake to protect the freshwater that this Swedish community uses for drinking water. The objective was to protect the water from being polluted by human waste the tourists might cause. The public eco toilet was built manually so we decided to design a technology in a box and prove the concept.\nIn 2013, the mass production of ECOLOO for outdoor use began in South Korea.\nWT: Please describe your invention and the technology.\nAgi: ECOLOO’s award winning and patented biological sustainable sanitation solutions are based on the principle of Simplicity, Scalability, Environmental Responsibility and Economic Vitality.\nIt employs a special formulated bacterial culture to treat and vanish human waste; transform the urine into natural liquid fertilizer that is odor free, pathogen free and full of nutrients-- perfect for organic farming.\nECOLOO is environmentally friendly, odor-free, water-free (water can still be used for hygiene purposes), sewage-free, energy-free. It is easy to install, uninstall, move and maintain.\nThe ECOLOO base is made of a 2-tier chamber; the upper chamber is where human waste including urine (not a urine diversion system) is collected and treated by specially formulated bacterial culture whilst the lower chamber is where the organic fertilizer in liquid form is rendered by gravity, using zero water to flush.\nThe lower chamber is built with a special indicator and outlet for end-users to collect or drain out the ready-to-use by-product each time the lower chamber is full.\nECOLOO can be installed in rest areas, schools, mosques, deserted areas, tourist destinations, beaches, events, festivals, and construction sites and is unaffected by weather conditions\nThe bacterial culture dissolves and vanishes the solid waste plus other degradable waste such as toilet paper in this water-free environment within 3-4 days.\nThe nitrification process that is built in the system converts the liquid waste into the by-product of value-added fertilizer that is odour-free, pathogen-free and yet full of nutrients within 30 minutes.\nWT: Zuraina’s experience on mount Everest was a pressing problem for her and no doubt for Mount Everest, but there’s a much larger problem worldwide – please comment on the global environmental issues of toilets or lack thereof.\nAfi: There are over 2.5 billion people who do not have access to proper toilets and hygiene, mainly remote rural and slum communities (what we call BOPs –Bottom of the Pyramid) who lack water due to water scarcity or drought or geographical conditions.\nAlso – victims of natural disasters such as floods, typhoons, cholera outbreaks, the refugees and homeless, and those who live in remote areas or off-grid areas with no access to sewage treatment plants or septic tank systems – are the unfortunate populations without access.\nOpen spaces, riverbanks, road and street sides and the open fields are some of the common places people use to relieve themselves. Water sources are badly affected by both pit/ring and modern flush toilets.\nThe sewage from the flush toilet has badly affected the fragile environment. These practices not only pollute the environment but have contaminated the land and water resources. This will eventually affect human health.\nSanitation is an urgent issue and number one priority in many countries.\nAccording to UNICEF, 5.7 billion gallons of potable water are flushed in toilets each day in the U.S.; 5.5 billion gallons per day in the U.K and Canada, while 2.1 billion people globally lack safe drinking water at home.\nIn 2015, NASA’s satellite data revealed that 21 of the world's 37 large aquifers are severely water-stressed.\nWT: How does the ECOLOO toilet solve these issues?\nAgi: ECOLOO’s patented sustainable sanitation system serves as an onsite biological treatment solution, particularly in areas with water shortages and that have no access to sewage treatment plants.\nA totally enclosed energy-free system (preventing pollution and contamination), and waterless (preventing sewage generation and environmental contamination) is our solution with the added benefit of producing organic fertilizer.\nWT: You have said that sustainable toilets eliminate poverty. Please explain.\nAgi: ECOLOO’s tagline – eliminate poverty through sustainable toilets – describes our commitment to achieve the related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through our sustainable solutions that lead to huge social, health, economic and environmental impact.\nOur business model is developed to integrate underserved populations into supply chain by creating business and job opportunities for the local community from production to distribution, installation, training, maintenance, collection and reuse of fertilizer from the toilet, which may lead to organic farming.\nBesides the poor, farmers can also benefit from free organic liquid fertilizer generated in the ECOLOO system which will reduce the use of expensive chemical fertilizer, thus improving the financial situation of that demographic.\nWT: Where may the different toilet models be installed?\nAgi: ECOLOO can be installed indoors and outdoor as a stand-alone sustainable solution.\nOur beneficiaries are mainly the underserved, rural communities which have no access to a proper toilet or lack toilet facilities. Also, people who lack water or where water is scarce due to drought or geographical conditions may benefit.\nVictims of disasters such as floods, typhoons, cholera outbreaks, refugees or the homeless may also be served.\nBut even floating houses, chalets, public rest stops, pilgrims, devotees, tourists, construction workers can be served. There are also possibilities for bus/ferry/boat/ RV/train passengers, event participants, off grid and owners of tiny homes, military, police, navy, oil and gas workers...and the list goes on.\nToday, ECOLOO has been exported to over 25 countries including UNDP, UNSOS, UNHCT and used by millions of people around the world, especially in the developing countries, including Malaysia, the Philippines, Mongolia, Cook Islands, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Somalia, Senegal, Sudan, South Africa, Nigeria. Jordan, Bahrain, Germany, Chile, Peru, India, Canada, USA and more resulting in a great impact on people, water resources and the environment\nWT: Are extreme weather conditions an issue?\nAgi: ECOLOO is suitable for all purposes in any weather condition. We have installations in Canada, Sweden, and Mongolia where the weather is extreme.\nWT: What are some of the most interesting and rewarding projects you have been involved with?\nAgi: The first pilot project was done for the municipality of Stromstad in 2008 and the toilet is still up and running. The project was done next to a lake which is the source of drinking water for that Swedish community.\nOur second is a Biodiversity Project with UNDP for UNESCO World Heritage Sites My team has successfully solved the environmental problem at the heritage sites by installing 20 units of ECOLOO at the famous Heritage sites in Jordan, in collaboration with UNDP Jordan. This project saved them from losing the title given by UNESCO. The result also revived the tourism industry and the business within the sites. Plus, over 10 million litres of water were saved within one year!\nWe solved the open defecation at two girls' schools in Sierra Leone, in collaboration with Hope2Overcome NGO.\nThis provides the students with safe places to exercise sanitary hygiene with dignity resulting in better education and performance.\nA 35% attendance increment of the girls was realized as they are no longer worried of their “time of the month” problems at schools with hygienic toilets provided by ECOLOO.\nInstallation of 10 ECOLOOs at Kuala Lumpur 2017 SEA GAMES, in collaboration with Malaysian Ministry of Youth & Sports, helped the Government save around 15,000 litres of water and protect the dignity of women.\nInstallation of 50 units for the UNSOS in Somalia used by military officers and 10 units for the UNHCR in Mali used by refugees as pilot projects.\nWT: You have received awards and global recognition by the United Nations, UNWTO, CNN, Swedish Energy Agency, Confederation of Indian Industries, International Federation of Inventors’ Association, WSSCC, OFEED, Solar Impulse Foundation, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Energy Globe, MaGIC, China Tourist Association, GCIP, Mercy Mission, World CST Congress Council in India, World Invention Forum in China – among many others.\nWhat has this meant for you?\nAgi: Receiving these amazing awards humbles us and encourages us to do more for those in need, the environment, and our next generation.\nWT: Moving forward...what’s your mission...what’s next?\nAgi: We believe prevention is better than cure and that we have to protect our water resources by preventing water from being flushed/mixed with waste. The flush toilet is the worst invention of all time according to WASH experts, creating diseases and killing people.\nOur vision is to scale up to the next level and contribute to sustainable living and ecological tourism by offering sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene to every development project and nature.\nECOLOO provides a smart sustainable sanitation solution a totally enclosed system that prevents contamination of groundwater while reducing carbon emissions from transportation and sewage treatment. It separates black water from gray water, and it doesn’t consume water for flushing.\nCities would not only save water, energy and expenses on construction, maintenance, treatment, transportation, cost of sewage and its treatment but they will also create a circular economy.\nThe organic fertilizer would ensure food security. Cities would eventually become low carbon and climate resilient.\nThe huge impact of the whole supply chain is our way to measure our success. We would see this by:\n- the number of people using our toilets will impact the amount of water and energy we save,\n- the health that we keep improving,\n- the decrease in infant, child, and maternal mortality,\n- the number of farmers using organic fertilizer,\n- the number of Bops (Bottom of the Pyramid) who are able to come out of the poverty cycle due to healthier and more productive life,\n- the number of business and job opportunities created through our social business model,\n- the improvement of societies or communities or the whole country in general and the savings on public expenses such as waste treatment, sewage treatment plants and maintenance costs, environmental impact and decrease in pollution and carbon footprint\nWT: And one last drop … something for us all to think about.\nAgi: Why are people stuck in the poverty cycle?\nAs per the survey, a person living in an open defecation or pit latrine area unknowingly consumes 10 grams of fecal content every day because of the water sources that are badly affected by those practices.\nThis is causing 80% of diseases like Dysentery, Typhoid, Polio, Cholera, Hepatitis E, Gastroenteritis, Cysticercoids, Diarrhea, Ascariasis, Trachoma, and others.\nOne gram of human feces could contain 10,0000,000 Viruses, 1,000,000 Bacteria, 1,000 Parasite cysts, 100 Parasite eggs, and Coronavirus.\nThis can be changed...with dignity.""]"	['<urn:uuid:52a12d8f-dd0a-4e14-9b66-d7a8692472f7>', '<urn:uuid:59f31a73-ab69-4fcd-8071-1c8e9642d9b6>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	15	60	4600
11	protective policies cultural invasion foreign films korea	The Republic of Korea has a quota policy that requires for every foreign film shown in the country, a domestic film must be produced to limit cultural invasion.	['Viet Nam News\nNguyễn Khánh Dương, Comicola’s founder and script writer for the Phong Dương Comics duo, has been pioneering the Vietnamese historical comic movement with the ongoing hit series Holy Dragon Imperator (Long Thần Tướng). His passion for the country’s cultural restoration reaches beyond his artistic trade, as Dương continues to advocate for widespread celebration of cultural and aesthetic values once lost to time and conflict.\nSpeaking with Việt Nam News’ reporter Phương Uyên last weekend, Dương expressed high hopes for the younger generation’s ardent interest in the matter. He considers such awareness to be a stepping stone towards defining a solid national image, going from historical preservation to modern innovation based on traditional elements.\nWhat motivates you to pursue this cause?\nSince the application of the Berne Convention in 2004, there is now a growing community of Vietnamese authors working on making distinctly Vietnamese products. But still, it is very difficult for Vietnamese people to accept and purchase their creations, especially cultural and artistic ones with clear national impressions.\nPersonally speaking, the Vietnamese creative industry is facing a market vacuum, or a gap, waiting to be filled by domestic creators. And due to the fact that the national branding in this field is llimited, my biggest wish in the past five years has been to let readers in the country understand that good domestic intellectual properties do exist, just waiting to be discovered.\nIt was not until my own historical comic series was lauded with international recognition that I realised a common desire amongst our native authors for Vietnamese readers to have the habit of consuming cultural products made by Vietnamese people. We want people to be willing to spend money on Vietnamese crafts.\nAnd what has been done so far?\nFor the past three years, many creators and I have constantly tried to branch out, using the crowd funding model to become efficient and effective in bringing unpublished work to the public.\nWe have come to believe that what we need now is national branding in terms of distinct cultural and aesthetic imprints. The matter is self-positioning, which stems from the soul of our people and a common self-awareness of the Vietnamese nationality towards the outside world’s recognition.\nUnfortunately, Việt Nam’s national brand status is not complete and still rather backward, despite being the invisible and intangible ambassador of the country, for every aspect of economy and society.\nNonetheless, I can safely say that there are many positive signs. Recently, many independent projects related to traditional patterns or folk arts, with a modernised breath, have been warmly welcomed by consumers.\nI can safely say that these projects, though yet to have the impact we intended, will soon strongly influence the way our products are made. For example, we will develop packaging with a distinguished Vietnamese touch, the likes of which has helped Japan to make a name for themselves on the global market.\nWhat do you suppose is needed to accomplish this goal?\nAgain, whether it is comic books, films or theater productions, authors must be able to act as entrepreneurs, able to compose, able to work and have their work brought to the correct demographic, because I strongly believe that without consumers, readers, or appreciators willing to pay for good content, the intellectual industry just won’t work.\nI can say that Việt Nam’s authors can weave interesting materials for domestic and international readers, and yet there are a lot of our creators struggling to advertise their works outside of the country, because even at home they have to fight other nations’ so called cultural invasion, or soft power.\nAs such, we need the help and intervention of state management agencies, similar to those enabled in Japan, the Republic of Korea (RoK), or China, where a great deal of public administration is needed to protect their cultural products against foreign influence.\nTo give an example, there should be protective policy akin to RoK’s quota, which requires that for every foreign film shown in the country, a domestic film must be produced to limit any possible cultural invasion.\nChina has also been doing the same by setting limits on the number of foreign films it imports and the remaining slots are reserved for domestic cinematic products.\nIn the future, besides state investment, favourable policies and determination, the drive force to promote Vietnamese culture will definitely be each and every creator’s personal endeavor to develop their own creative thoughts, and each reader’s desire to support homemade intellectual products.\nWhat expectation do you have for domestic cultural reinstatement and creativity?\nAccording to my assessment, events showcasing results from private organisations’ research and restoration process regarding historical values have attracted unpredictable attention from the public of all ages and social background.\nI understand that in developed countries, there is such a cultural ecosystem based on the Intellectual Property core, which we still lack here in Việt Nam. I suppose that by investing in such a system, we may soon have a huge data warehouse, ready to be utilised by our creators.\nMy hope is that no matter how much longer it takes, we may be able to craft cultural products of significance and impact that can make viewers think deeply and be proud of their cultural heritage.\nI cannot say exactly how many years it will be until that day, but what each of us in the creative industry is doing now is to create a foundation for the next generation and contribute their strength to give future authors a reliable and accurate source of information and reference materials to cling to. — VNS']	['<urn:uuid:677ff73e-4d7a-4c55-8c8a-0d1a6207efe6>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	7	28	933
12	compare internal management external reporting differences cost financial accounting	Cost accounting is used internally by management for decision-making and budgeting, focusing on capturing production costs and cost control programs. In contrast, financial accounting is designed for external stakeholders like investors and creditors, presenting the company's financial position through standardized financial statements including income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. While financial accounting classifies costs by transaction type, cost accounting classifies them according to management's information needs.	['Cost Accounting – Meaning, History & Types: Hi, Friends Today I am going to share some interesting information on the topic of Cost Accounting – Meaning, History & Types.\nPlease go through the article and enjoy reading it.\nCost Accounting – Meaning, History & Types\nIt is a form of managerial accounting. It aims to capture a company’s total cost of production. By assessing the variable costs of each step of production. As well as the fixed costs, like a lease expense.\nUnderstanding the Cost Accounting\nIt is used by a company’s internal management team. To identify all the variable and fixed costs that are associated with the production process. It will first measure and also record these costs individually.\nThen compare the input costs to output the results to aid in measuring the financial performance. Also making future business decisions. There are many types of costs that are involved in this type of accounting. Which are defined below as well.\nThe Types of Costs\nFixed Costs are costs that don’t change depending on the level of production. These are usually things like the mortgage or lease payment on a building. A piece of equipment that belittles at a fixed monthly rate. An increase or decrease in the production levels would cause no change in these costs.\nVariable Costs are costs that tied to a company’s level of production. For example, a floral shop provides a ramp-up of their floral arrangement inventory. Valentine’s Day will incur higher costs. When it purchases an increased number of flowers from the local nursery or garden center.\nOperating Costs are costs that are associated with the day-to-day operations of a business. These costs can be either fixed or changes depending on the unique situation.\nDirect Costs are Costs particularly related to producing a product. If a coffee roaster spends five hours roasting coffee. The direct costs of the finished product. That includes the labor hours of the roaster. And the cost of the coffee beans.\nIndirect Costs are Costs that cannot be directly linked to a product. In the coffee roaster example, the energy cost to heat the roaster would be indirect. Because it is inexact and also difficult to trace to the individual products.\nThe Cost Accounting vs. Financial Accounting\nWhile Cost Accounting is frequently used by the management within a company. To aid in the decision-making. Financial accounting is what the outside investors or creditors can typically see. Financial accounting presents a company’s financial position.\nAlso the performance to external sources through the financial statements. It includes information about its revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Cost accounting can be most beneficial.\nAs a tool for management in budgeting. In setting up the cost control programs. It can improve the net margins for the company in the future.\nOne key difference between cost accounting and financial accounting is that. But in financial accounting, the cost is classified which is depending on the type of transaction. Cost accounting classifies the costs according to the information.\nThe needs of the management. Cost accounting, because is used as an internal tool by the management. It does not have to meet any specific standard like generally accepted accounting principles. That is GAAP and, as a result, changes in use from the company to the company. Or department to department.\nStandard costing assigns standard costs. Rather than its actual costs. To its cost of goods that are sold COGS and inventory. The standard costs are based on the efficient use of labor and materials. To produce the good or service under the standard operating conditions.\nThey are essentially the budgeted amount. Even though standard costs are assigned to the goods. The company still has to pay the actual costs. Using the difference between the standard that is efficient cost. The actual cost incurred is called Variance Analysis.\nIf the variance analysis determines that the actual costs are higher than the expected ones. The variance is unfavorable. If it determines the actual costs that are lower than expected. The variance is favorable.\nTwo factors can contribute to a favorable or unfavorable variance. There is the cost of the input, like the cost of labor and materials. This is considered to be a rate variance. Additionally, there is the efficiency or quantity of the input that is used.\nThis is considered to be a volume variance. If, for example, XYZ company expected to produce 400 widgets in a period. But ended up producing 500 widgets. Then the cost of materials would be higher due to the total quantity produced.\nThe Activity-Based Costing\nActivity-based costing that is ABC identifies the overhead costs from each department. Assigns them to the specific cost objects, like goods, or services. The ABC system of cost accounting is based on the activities.\nWhich is any event, unit of work, or task with a specific goal. Like setting up machines for production, designing products, distributing finished goods, or operating the machines. These activities are also considered to be cost drivers. They are the measures that are used as the basis for allocating the overhead costs.\nTraditionally, overhead costs are assigned based on one generic measure, like machine hours. Under ABC, an activity analysis is performed where the appropriate measures are identified as the cost drivers.\nAs a result, ABC regularly to be much more accurate. It is helpful when it comes to managers reviewing the cost and profitability. Of their company’s specific services or products.\nFor example, the cost accountants using ABC that might pass out a survey to production line employees. Who will then account for the amount of time that they spend on different tasks?\nThe Lean Accounting\nThe main aim of lean accounting is to improve the financial management practices within an organization. Lean accounting is an extension of the philosophy of lean manufacturing and production. It has the stated intention of minimizing waste while making the best productivity.\nFor example, if an accounting department is able to cut down on the wasted time. The employees can focus that saved time more productively on the value-added tasks.\nWhen using lean accounting, traditional costing methods are replaced by value-based pricing. The lean-focused performance measurements. Financial decision-making is based on the effect on the company’s total value stream profitability.\nValue streams are the profit centers of a company. Which is any branch or division that directly adds to its net figure profitability.\nThe Marginal Costing\nMarginal Costing sometimes called cost-volume-profit analysis. It is the impact on the cost of a product by adding one additional unit into the production. It is useful for short-term economic decisions. Marginal costing can also help the management to identify the impact of varying levels of costs.\nAlso the volume on operating profit. This type of analysis can be used by the management to gain insight into potentially profitable new products, and sales prices to establish for the existing products. The effect of marketing campaigns.\nThe break-even point, which is the production level. Where the total revenue for a product equals the total expense. It is calculated as the total fixed costs of a company. Which is divided by its contribution margin.\nThe contribution margin, that is calculated as the sales revenue minus variable costs. It can also be calculated on a per-unit basis. In order to determine the extent to which a specific product contributes to the overall profit of the company.\nMany of the Scholars believe that cost accounting was first developed during the industrial revolution. When the emerging economics of industrial supply and demand forced the manufacturers. To start tracking their fixed and variable expenses in order to optimize their production processes.\nThe Cost accounting allowed railroad and steel companies. To control the costs and become more efficient. By the beginning of the 20th century. Cost accounting had become a widely covered topic in the literature of business management.\nSo, this is the important information on the topic of Cost Accounting. Here I have mentioned Cost accounting meaning, Its different types, and also the history of cost accounting.\nIf any Queries or Questions are persisting then, please feel free to comment on the viewpoints.', 'What is Financial Accounting?\nFinancial Accounting refers to the Bookkeeping of the Financial transactions by classifying, analyzing, summarizing, and recording financial transactions like Purchase, Sales, Receivables and Payables and finally preparing the Financial Statements which includes Income Statement, Balance Sheet & Cash Flows.\nThe main objective of financial accounting is to showcase an accurate and fair picture of financial affairs of the company. To understand the fundamentals of financial accounting well, first, we should start with double entry system and debit & credit, and then gradually should understand journal and ledger, trial balance, and four financial statements.\n- Double Entry System\n- Trial Balance\n- Financial Statements\nLet’s start with the double-entry system.\nThis is the essence of financial accounting.\nIn financial accounting, every financial transaction has two equal aspects. That means if cash is withdrawn from the bank, in the company’s book under the double entry system, both cash and bank would be affected.\nUnder the double entry system, we call these two aspects debit and credit.\nDebit and credit\nUnderstanding debit and credit is easy. You need to remember two rules –\n- Debit the increase of assets and expenses and the decrease of liabilities and incomes.\n- Credit the increase of liabilities and incomes and the decrease of assets and expenses.\nHere’s an example to illustrate debit and credit –\nLet’s say that around $20,000 worth of capital is being invested into the company in the form of cash.\nUnder double entry system, there are two accounts here – cash and capital.\nHere cash is an asset and capital is a liability.\nAccording to the rule of debit and credit, when an asset increases, we will debit the account and when a liability will increase, we will credit the account.\nIn this example, both the asset and the liability are increasing.\nSo, we will debit the cash since it is an asset and we will credit the capital since it is a liability.\nJournal entry is based on the debit and the credit of the accounts. Taking the previous example into account, here’s how a journal entry will look like –\n|Cash A/c ………………….Debit||$20,000||–|\n|To Capital A/c…………………………….Credit||–||$20,000|\nOnce you know the essence of double entry system, journal, and ledger, we need to look at ledger entry.\nA ledger entry is an extension of the journal entry. Taking the journal entry from above, we can create a T-format for ledger entry.\nDebit Cash Account Credit\n|To Capital Account||$20,000|\n|By balance c/f||$20,000|\nDebit Capital Account Credit\n|By Cash Account||$20,000|\n|To balance c/f||$20,000|\nFrom ledger, we can create a trial balance. Here’s a snapshot and the format of a trial balance of the example we took above.\nTrial Balance of MNC Co. for the year-end\n|Particulars||Debit (Amount in $)||Credit (Amount in $)|\nThere are four financial statements that every company prepares and every investor should look at –\n- Income Statement\n- Balance Sheet\n- Shareholders’ Equity Statement\n- Cash Flow Statement\nLet’s understand each of them briefly.\nThe purpose of the income statement is to find out the net income of the company for the year. We take into account all the financial transactions (including non-cash ones) and do a “revenue – expense” analysis to find out the profit for the year. Here’s the format of income statement –\n|Cost of Goods Sold||(*****)|\n|General & Administrative Expenses||(**)|\n|Operating Income (EBIT)||***|\n|Profit Before Tax||***|\n|Tax Rate (% of Profit before tax)||(**)|\nBalance Sheet is based on the equation – “Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders’ Equity”. Here’s a simple snapshot of balance sheet so that you can understand how it is formatted.\nBalance Sheet of ABC Company\n|2016 (In US $)|\n|Plant & Machinery||45,000|\n|Total Stockholders’ Equity||230,000|\n|Total liabilities & Stockholders’ Equity||320,000|\nShareholders’ equity statement:\nShareholders’ equity statement is a statement which includes shareholders’ equity, retained earnings, reserves, and many such items. Here’s a format of shareholders’ equity statement –\n|Additional Paid-up Capital:|\n|(-) Treasury Shares||(**)|\n|(-) Translation Reserve||(**)|\nCash flow statement:\nThe objective of cash flow statement is to find out the net cash inflow/outflow of the company. The cash flow statement is a combination of three statements – cash flow from operating activities (which can be computed using a direct and indirect method of cash flow), cash flow from financing activities, and cash flow from investing activities. All non-cash expenses (or losses) are added back and all non-cash incomes (or profits) are deducted to get exactly the net cash inflow (total cash inflow – total cash outflow) for the year.\nAs financial accounting is solely prepared for the right disclosure of financial information of a company, the statements, and reports a company produce should be valid and credible. That’s why companies need to follow certain rules as per the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or accounting standards.\nGAAP covers basic principles of accounting that must be followed by companies. These principles include going concern concept, full disclosure concept, matching principle, cost principle and many others to produce the most accurate and reliable reports for the audience of the company.\nHowever, GAAP doesn’t remain same always. GAAP is updated based on the complexities that arise in the world of accounting.\nFinancial Accounting Video\nThis is a guide to what is Financial Accounting, definition and fundamentals of financial accounting. Here we discuss debit credit, journals, ledgers and four financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow and shareholders equity statement).

13	maximum possible gamete combinations dairy cattle genetic diversity decline	In mammals like cattle, there are 8,324,608 possible gamete combinations due to 23 chromosome pairs (2^23). However, this diversity is being threatened, as exemplified by Holstein cattle which have become the dominant dairy breed worldwide. While Holsteins have improved milk production, this has come at the cost of declining genetic diversity within the breed, affecting disease resistance and environmental adaptation capabilities.	"['How many unique gametes could be?\nThe number of different possible gametes produced by the diploid genotype (AaBbCcDdEe) is 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32 (2 for each pair of heterozygous genes).\nWhat are the types of gametes that can be produced by an individual with the genotype?\nAn individual with the genotype Aa can make two types of gametes: A and a. Since this is a random process, the individual will, on average, make equal numbers of each gamete. (Frequency of 1/2 for each gamete). A second individual with genotype Aa can make two types of gametes: A and a.\nHow many unique gametes will there be for a Dihybrid cross?\nThere are four possible combinations of gametes for the AaBb parent. Half of the gametes get a dominant A and a dominant B allele; the other half of the gametes get a recessive a and a recessive b allele.\nWhat is the number of possible gametes that can be formed due to independent assortment?\n32. Since humans have 46 chromosomes or 23 homologous pairs, what is the number of possible gametes that can be formed due to independent assortment of chromosomes? The number of possible combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes in the resulting gametes is 223, or about 8.4 million.\nHow do you identify the different types of gametes?\nTo calculate the total number of gametes that are produced by a particular genotype, a specific formula 2n is used, where n= number of heterogeneous alleles that are found in the genotype. Here, the given genotype consists of two heterogeneous alleles Bb, and Cc while one homozygous allele is AA.\nHow many possible gamete combinations are there?\nThere are 8,324,608 possible combinations of 23 chromosome pairs. As a result, two gametes virtually never have exactly the same combination of chromosomes. Each chromosome contains dozens to thousands of different genes.\nHow do you calculate the number of possible combinations of a chromosome?\nThe possible combinations are equal to 2n, where n is the haploid number. For the organism in Figure 9-18, n = 2, so the number of chromosome combinations is 22, or 4. For a human, n = 23, so there are 223, or about 8 million, possible chromosome combinations!\nHow many different types of gametes would be formed in an individual who is heterozygous for four different loci?\nIf a diploid organism is heterozygous for 4 loci then it will have four contrasting traits Aa, Bb, Cc, Dd and during meiosis 16 different kinds of gametes will be formed.\nHow many different kinds of gametes will be formed by an individual who is heterozygous for four gene pairs?\nHints For Biology 101 Exam #4\n|No. of homologous chromosome pairs (heterozygous genes)||No. of different gametes from each parent|\n|1 (Aa X Aa)||2 (21)|\n|2 (AaBb X AaBb)||4 (22)|\n|3 (AaBbCc X AaBbCc)||8 (23)|\n|4 (AaBbCcDd X AaBbCcDd)||16 (24)|\nHow many different types of gametes can be formed by individuals of the genotype AaBb quizlet?\nAn individual with the genotype AaBb produces four different gametes in equal proportions.', 'Genetic diversity of livestock is being lost. The number of breeds has markedly declined over the past half century. Up to 30% of global mammalian and avian livestock breeds (i.e., 1,200 to 1,500 breeds) are currently at risk of being lost and cannot be replaced.\nBreeds become rare, either because their characteristics do not suit contemporary demand or because their qualities have not been recognised. When a breed population falls to about 1,000 animals, it is considered rare and endangered.\nExamples given in Thrupp, L.A. (1998) serve to emphasise the extent of the problem.\nLocal breeds are better adapted to their environment\nCauses of genetic erosion in domestic animals\n|Inappropriate Aid||Lack of appreciation of the value\nof indigenous breeds and their importance in niche adaptation.\nIncentives to introduce exotic and more uniform breeds from industrialised countries\n|Product-focused selection||Undue emphasis placed on a specific product or trait, leading to the rapid dissemination of one breed of animal at the expense of others|\n|Changes in land use||Conversion of rangelands and mixed farming systems for agriculture, game parks, and industrial use|\n|Changes in knowledge||The idea that ""modern/imported is best"" has led to the loss of knowledge about traditional livestock husbandry practices and to the erosion of domestic animal diversity|\n|Change in Technology||Replacement of animal draught and transport by machinery, leading to permanent change of farming system, artificial insemination and embryo transfer leading to rapid replacement of indigenous breeds|\n|Change in Economy||Decline in economic viability of traditional livestock production systems|\n|Intensification||Livestock populations that rely\non veterinary services and on improved feeding conditions. Heavy investment\nin preventative and curative veterinary measures, and in feeding, housing\nMultipurpose local species and breeds replaced by those with higher milk, meat, egg production (including cross-breeds and pure-bred exotics)\n|Cross-breeding||Predominance of sires from a few selected breeds in widespread cross-breeding programmes can lead to loss of features expressed by specialised breeds|\n|Storage||Failure of cryopreservation equipment (used to freeze semen, ova and embryos) or lack of refrigerant, inadequate maintenance of frozen semen from breeds that are not in demand|\n|Conflict||Wars and other forms of socio-political instability can lead to livestock owners moving their stock out of their usual area, thus increasing the possibility of mixing with other breeds thereby potentially losing a location-specific breed|\n|Disaster||Natural disasters such as floods, drought or famine can result in whole breeds dying out|\nThese trends are supported by:\nIronically, the loss of indigenous breeds that are able to exploit vegetation in the more extreme environments also seriously affects the capacity of human society to live in large areas of the world in a sustainable manner.\nDeclining livestock diversity has serious consequences for current livestock production and future capacity to meet unforeseen challenges and opportunities. Livestock diversity is being lost partly because of commercial production.\nFor instance, commercial production of egg chickens, meat chickens, and turkeys is dominated by fewer than 10 multinational breeding companies. Breed-level diversity within egg and meat-producing types is low because common breed origins and intense selection for similar production goals have promoted genetic uniformity. Similarly, China possesses at least 50, and perhaps over 100, unique pig breeds, but many of these are becoming endangered as they are replaced with western breeds.\nExamples given in Thrupp (1998) also serve to emphasise the current status of livestock diversity. ""FAO estimates that somewhere in the world at least one breed of traditional livestock dies out every week. Many traditional breeds have disappeared as farmers focus on new breeds of cattle, pigs, sheep, and chickens. Of the 3,831 breeds of cattle, water buffalo, goats, pigs, sheep, horses, and donkeys believed to have existed in this century, 16 percent have become extinct, and a further 15 percent are rare. Some 474 of extant livestock breeds can be regarded as rare. A further 617 have become extinct since 1892. Over 80 breeds of cattle are found in Africa, and some are being replaced by exotic breeds.""\nTraditional pastoralists have often tended to foster biodiversity, in both plants and animals. Many pastoral societies have developed elaborate systems that result in the preservation of genetic resources. Pastoralists have deliberately developed livestock to meet different needs and conditions. For example, a least 12 breeds of camel are known from southern Sudan alone. However, wealthier sectors of society are now accumulating large livestock holdings through purchase of animals from different areas and tribal groups - with the resulting cross-breeding making camels of one generic type.\nIt is clear that livestock breeds are not biological taxa but rather represent the outcome of social processes. They are therefore unlikely to survive outside the social contexts and production systems that formed them. However, these losses weaken the potential of breeding programs that could improve hardiness of livestock.\nCommercial breeds of livestock possess greater genetic variability than most crop varieties do. This diversity allows intensification of selection within breeds to be a fruitful approach for improving livestock productivity. However, if continued emphasis on breed replacement and increasing selection intensity (e.g. for greater productivity) take place at the expense of maintenance of genetic diversity, including the advantages of disease resistance and environmental adaptation, there may be significant long-term costs. As an example, Holstein cattle have become the pre-eminent dairy breed world-wide and have enjoyed sustained improvements in milk production potential, but only at the cost of declining genetic diversity within the breed.\nDespite significant advances in the preservation of genetic diversity of crop varieties, for example through ex-situ preservation of germplasm and seed banks, little attention has been paid to conserving the genetic diversity of livestock species. The current dependence on in situ conservation by hobbyists is inadequate. Moreover, this form of breed preservation is currently largely limited to Europe and America. The significant livestock diversity in Africa, Asia and South America is largely unprotected.\nState is therefore characterised by:\nIt is important that the genetic diversity of rare and endangered livestock breeds and their wild relatives and ancestral lines be preserved as insurance for future needs.\nFormal government-sponsored international programs for in-situ and ex-situ preservation of livestock genetic diversity need to be established. In addition, the native habitats of the wild relatives of livestock species must be preserved.\nInvestments in preserving this natural capital could yield net payoffs in both agricultural productivity and profitability. Such investments should be considered in any economic cost-benefit analyses of alternative production regimes.\nA move towards sustainable agriculture requires changes in production methods, concepts, and policies, as well as the participation of local people. Scientific advancements in genetics and ""improved"" varieties can have important roles. However, these need to be reoriented towards conserving and using diversity in farming systems - rather than replacing diversity with uniformity. The following principles are important:\nReferences and Further Reading:\nCattle Diversity Database. http://www.ri.bbsrc.ac.uk/cdiv_www/accessdb.htm\nCollins, W.W. & Qualset, C.O. (1999).

14	mosquito fever climate urbanization impacts	Vector-borne dengue fever is significantly influenced by environmental and social factors. Climate change is the primary driver of increasing dengue cases, as mosquitoes thrive in warm temperatures and humidity, enabling them to expand their geographical range northward. Additionally, urbanization contributes to the spread as Aedes mosquitoes are well-adapted to human environments and dense populations, particularly utilizing standing water in urban settings for breeding. These factors make vector-borne diseases like dengue more virulent than directly transmitted diseases, as the vectors (mosquitoes) can effectively transmit the disease between immobilized victims, leading to more severe outcomes and higher mortality rates.	['Next tuesday, we are going to discuss the evolution of virulence, using the mosquito borne dengue fever as an example. (Handout and readings are at the end of this post)\nThe dengue virus causes dengue fever, aka breakbone fever. As the name suggests, sufferers of breakbone fever are typically laid up in bed. Immobility is usually associated with high virulence (pathogen replication within its host). Immobility is also a trait that benefits the transmission of vector-borne diseases. An immobile victim cannot effectively swat a blood-sucking insect. Caretakers might also be at risk from bites from vectors because they have to stay in close quarters with the victim.\nThe virus that causes the common cold generally is transmitted better when its victims are not immobile. This is because it is transmitted by direct contact, not vectors. Pathogens that are transmitted by direct contact are generally less virulent than those that are vector-borne. If the cold virus made its victims unable to move and leave the house, then it would be less likely to spread like wildfire through offices and schools and universities!\nThree main modes of transmission of pathogens include, direct, vectors, and environmental.\n1) Direct contact diseases (like colds) are transmitted best when the victim is active. These are generally the least virulent.\n2) Vector-borne diseases usually require the victim to be alive but are better transmitted if the victim is not moving. These are usually more virulent.\n3) Environmentally transmitted diseases can be the most virulent. These do not require the victim to be active. Some are like vector borne diseases (cholera), in which the attendants who wash the soiled bedclothes in the river promote transmission of the bacteria. Some do just fine even after they kill the victim (anthrax), when the corpse releases infectious spores! In general, environmentally transmitted diseases might have very high virulence.\nHospital-acquired infections are like vector borne diseases. Doctors and nurses act like mosquitos. This is not because we are always drawing blood (although we are), but because our stethoscopes and hands are in contact with an immobile victim and then we often touch another patient. Pathogens that are quite virulent and serious may attract even more attention from doctors and nurses (buzzing around the sicker patients like mosquitos!). So for the hospital acquired pneumonia, there is no downside to becoming more virulent and making the patient more immobile. Transmission of the hospital acquired pathogen depends on interaction with vectors: hospital workers who do not always wash their hands! This is in contrast to the community acquired pneumonia. Community acquired pneumonia might require direct contact (like the cold virus) for its transmission between patients. For this reason, a hospital acquired pneumonia is generally much more serious than a community acquired pneumonia.\nKey points that we will cover in lecture:\n1) Pathogens do not always evolve towards commensalism.\n2) Pathogens that exclusively use vertical transmission – mother to baby – will evolve to a more benign state than those transmitted horizontally.\n3) The mode of transmission matters: directly transmitted pathogens are less virulent than vector borne pathogens, and environmentally (or waterborne) illnesses tend to be the most severe.\n4) Opportunities for transmission affect pathogen evolution – increased transmission selects for more virulent pathogens with a decreased duration of infectivity (and greater mortality). Decreased transmission selects for less virulent pathogens.\n5) Competition between pathogens in a single host or single population can select for increased virulence.\n6) Humans may be able to affect the evolution of pathogen virulence with some public health measures – but the definitive test awaits!\nReadings for 10/12/10:\nPay special attention to the Ewald and Brown readings for your writing project. Be sure to read ALL carefully prior to lecture.\nHandout is here:\nSuppose the New Mexico Legislature is taking up the following bills for consideration. Bill #1 promotes the use of hand sanitizer before every handshake; it would be illegal for somebody to not use hand sanitizer before shaking hands with another person. Bill 2 promotes the use of condoms; it would be illegal under Bill 2 to engage in sexual intercourse without a condom, except at specially designated times reserved for procreation. Suppose that both bills would be accompanied by a massive public information campaign and incentive program, e.g free condoms and hand sanitizer. Explore the effects of these initiatives on the evolution of Rhinovirus, the virus that causes the common cold, and B) Neisseria gonorrhea, the bacteria that causes the sexually transmitted disease Gonorrhea. Assume that both bills, after enactment, result in a change in behavior of New Mexico citizens. Could Bill #1 or Bill #2 change virulence, the duration of infectivity, transmission rates, and mortality of Rhinovirus or Neisseria gonorrhea in New Mexico?\nWriting project is due, in hardcopy, in class at 5:30pm 10/12/10\nIf you have questions, email Megan or me.\nEmergency Physician, Educator, Researcher, interested in the microbiome, evolution, and medicine', '5 things we now know about the tropical disease dengue\nAs global temperatures continue to rise, so too does the incidence of this mosquito-borne virus. For World Neglected Tropical Disease Day, learn the latest about this growing health threat and how Johnson & Johnson is working to combat it.\nIf someone asked you what the most deadly animal in the world is, you might first think of lions or crocodiles.\nMosquitoes can spread serious diseases, including Zika, malaria, West Nile and dengue, the last of which the World Health Organization (WHO) named a top 10 global health threat in 2019. Worldwide, dengue causes up to 400 million infections and 20,000 to 25,000 deaths are attributed to dengue each year, making it the most common viral infection caused by mosquitoes. The virus can cause fever, headaches, pain—and in severe cases, serious illness and death. Outbreaks can further strain healthcare systems that are facing existing challenges in capacity and resources.\nAlarmingly, the number of dengue cases reported to the WHO increased more than eight-fold in the past two decades, and nearly 4 billion people in over 129 countries are currently at risk for infection.\nFor more than a decade, Johnson & Johnson has been committed to fighting neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) like dengue; in 2012, the company joined leading global health organizations to sign the landmark London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases, which has helped drive meaningful progress in the control, elimination and eradication of NTDs. And Johnson & Johnson is continuing to push this work forward. This month, the company announced a new commitment to the Kigali Declaration on neglected tropical diseases, which aims to put commitments to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 target on NTDs into action. Johnson & Johnson’s commitment will include—among other efforts to fight NTDs—expanded research into dengue.\nFor World Neglected Tropical Disease Day, we spoke to two Johnson & Johnson experts to learn more about this NTD and the work underway that may help curb its spread.\nYou can get dengue more than once.\nThe dengue virus is primarily transmitted by the bite of the infected Aedes species of mosquito, which also transmits Zika, chikungunya and other viruses. When a mosquito feeds on blood, it ingests any viruses or parasites living there—which are then transmitted via saliva to the next person the mosquito bites. Once infected with dengue, mosquitoes can transmit it during their life span.\nRight now, more than 50% of the human population is living in dengue virus endemic areas, and that percentage is expected to rise worldwide.\n“The mosquitoes that transmit dengue are really adjusted to the human environment and love areas with an increased population density,” says Tine De Marez, Ph.D., Compound Development Team Leader, Dengue, Johnson & Johnson. This may be because after the rainy season, the mosquitoes must survive a long, dry spell but need water to breed—and humans are a good source for it, since they often have outdoor items that collect standing water.\nThis may also be why Aedes mosquitoes have adapted to bite humans, rather than animals; they also tend to bite more than one person during a feeding, which further drives the rapid spread of dengue.\nThere are four serotypes (or strains) of the dengue virus: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4. “It’s possible to get infected by each serotype, so a person can get dengue up to four times,” says Olivia Goethals, Ph.D., Associate Director, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson and Project Leader for Johnson & Johnson’s Dengue Compound Discovery Program. During a second infection with another serotype, you may experience what’s called antibody-dependent enhancement, which can lead to more severe disease, she explains.\nInfections range from asymptomatic to deadly.\nMany people infected with the dengue virus don’t experience any signs or symptoms, but asymptomatic dengue still contributes to the transmission and further spread of the disease. And symptomatic dengue can be serious, and sometimes fatal.\nWhen symptoms occur, they usually begin three to eight days after the bite by the infected mosquito, and can include a high fever along with severe headache, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands, rash, pain behind the eyes and muscle, joint or bone pain. The fact that these symptoms can be mistaken for other illnesses such as flu, along with the existence of asymptomatic dengue infections, means incidence is likely under-reported.\n“In some cases, people develop severe dengue, which is also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever,” says Goethals. It can cause extreme abdominal pain, fatigue, persistent vomiting, bleeding from the nose or gums, blood in the stool and vomit. Severe dengue is a medical emergency and can lead to internal bleeding, shock and death.\nDengue incidence is on the rise.\nDengue is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates—mainly in Southeast Asia, Latin America and the Pacific Islands. But local transmissions have been reported in the U.S. and its territories, as well as in parts of Europe. They typically rise during the rainy season but infections can happen anytime.\n“Right now, more than 50% of the human population is living in dengue virus endemic areas, and that percentage is expected to rise worldwide,” says Goethals.\nGlobal warming is the biggest driving force for the increase. “Mosquitoes, especially the ones that transmit dengue, love warm temperatures and humidity, and with the warming climate they’re now able to travel farther north than they could before,” says De Marez.\nIn addition to climate change, Goethals also cites urbanization and intercontinental travel as contributors to the growing dengue problem.\nAs dengue cases increase, so too will their impact on the healthcare system. “Major dengue outbreaks burden healthcare systems because all at once you get large numbers of hospitalizations, similar to what happened with COVID-19,” says De Marez. This can be especially difficult for resource-limited settings, she adds.\nThe virus presents several challenges to researchers.\nThis month, Johnson & Johnson launched the J&J Satellite Center for Global Health Discovery at Duke-NUS in Singapore. The Satellite Center will focus on researching flaviviruses, including dengue fever.\nCurrently, there is only one approved vaccine for dengue, but there are strict restrictions for its usage.\nThere’s also no cure; only the symptoms can be managed.\nThe reasons for so few preventive and treatment methods are myriad. With dengue—as with other NTDs, which tend to occur mainly in resource-limited settings—research and development tends to be underfunded, says De Marez (hence why they’re called “neglected”).\nAnother complication, she notes, is that for preventives and therapeutic treatments to really make a difference, they must work against all four serotypes of dengue.\nNew ways to prevent and treat dengue are on the horizon.\nJanssen’s Dengue Compound Discovery Program, in collaboration with KU Leuven Rega Institute and the Centre for Drug Design and Discovery, both in Belgium, has developed a compound with a novel mechanism of action that could potentially protect against and treat all dengue serotypes.\nThe molecule works by blocking the interaction between two viral proteins that are necessary for the replication of the virus, Goethals explains.\n“We’ve completed a first-in-human Phase 1 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study,” says De Marez. Results showed that the compound, when administered orally as single or multiple doses, was safe and well-tolerated and had no serious adverse events reported. Currently, Janssen is evaluating the antiviral in Phase 2 clinical studies.\nThis month, Janssen scientists presented research at the Asia Dengue Summit in Singapore and discussed the potential role of antivirals in the prevention and treatment of dengue. “So far the dengue research world is dominated mostly by potential vaccines, and our compound is really the first small-molecule antiviral that is moving forward and being developed for prevention as well as treatment,” De Marez says.\nAlso this month, Johnson & Johnson launched the J&J Satellite Center for Global Health Discovery (Satellite Center) at Duke-NUS in Singapore. The Satellite Center will focus on researching flaviviruses, which refer to single-stranded RNA viruses, including dengue, West Nile virus, Zika and others.\nCollaborations like this, with Duke-NUS’ expertise in flaviviruses and Johnson & Johnson’s legacy in drug discovery and development, can only be beneficial for the quest to combat diseases like dengue, says Goethals.\nDe Marez agrees. With dengue cases increasing even more in already endemic areas and spreading farther north, it’s more important than ever to accelerate research, she says. For its part, “Johnson & Johnson is well-placed to play a role in developing a compound that can be one of the tools used to successfully fight dengue globally.”']	['<urn:uuid:4b030ba8-b7ff-4c0c-8ae3-d03f18c2c050>', '<urn:uuid:39d60568-c26c-4b80-b7b5-d002124a7de5>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	5	97	2226

For example, with a 12ft high screen, the front row should be 12ft away and back row no further than 72ft. Viewing angles should stay within 45 degrees from screen edges, maximum 60 degrees in extreme cases. Regarding venue host preparations, it's essential to meet in advance to discuss audience demographics, seating layout, and lighting arrangements. During this meeting, speakers should also inquire about refreshment availability and local catering options to ensure audience comfort and engagement.	['- Set the stage for energy and interaction\n- Ensure effective visuals and audio\n- Tips to make your speakers more comfortable\nThere is no way to ensure that every presentation will be well received by an audience. As a meeting professional all you can do is give the presenters the tools to succeed. Fortunately, there are some simple considerations that can increase the chances of a positive experience for both presenter and attendee.\nWhen setting up a stage for presentations there are many options. Sometimes there will be a single presenter, sometimes there will be multiple presenters at one time and other times you may need to set the stage for a panel discussion to engage in a conversation with each other or the audience.\nIt is important to think about how the stage is set for each of these configurations to increase intimacy, ensure ideal sightlines for the audience and encourage energy from the presenters. For example, if you have a single presenter on stage must there be a podium? I have found that by eliminating the podium you encourage more energy and audience interaction.\nWhen a panel discussion is necessary we often see the typical table set on stage where panelists are seated in a row with microphones in their faces. This type of setup separates the panelists from the audience much like a podium. I would suggest the panelists wear lavaliere microphones and be seated in comfortable chairs or stools on stage with no table between them and the audience. Once again, this will increase intimacy and energy.\nThe reality is that data and pictures are often at the center of a topic so we simply must have the ability to display visual elements. To give these visuals the best chance of being effective we need to ensure they are large enough, clear enough and bright enough.\nIn the AV industry we have some basic guidelines to estimate how large a screen should be. As a general rule no audience member should be further than six times the screen height from the screen when text is the primary content and none should be seated closer to the screen than the actual screen height. So if you have a 12 ft. high screen the front row should be at least 12 ft. from the screen and the back row should be no further away than 72 ft. Of course, this is just a guideline but you should consider this formula when you are planning your room set and try to stay as close to these parameters as possible.\nAnother important factor is viewing angle. The rule here is to try to keep every attendee within a 45 degree angle of the outside edge of the screen. In extreme circumstances this angle can be as much as 60 degrees, but I would not recommend more than that. If you find that some seats will be outside of this field you may need to reconsider your setup.\nThe simple fact is, if the audience cannot clearly hear the presentation then nothing else matters. It is critical to invest in the best audio equipment your budget will allow because poor performance or a failure could be catastrophic for the event. It is also incredibly important to have a competent audio engineer because even the best equipment is worthless in the hands of someone who does not know how to use it effectively.\nOne of the most important factors in a successful presentation is the comfort level of the presenter. Even professional speakers get nervous if they don’t know exactly what they will encounter on stage. I have found great value in making sure every presenter has an opportunity to stand on the stage and get a feel for the room prior to their presentation. I always take each presenter on stage to familiarize them with everything. I show them the slide advancer, confidence monitor and even where the water will be. When possible, I let them try out the actual microphone they will be using so they can hear how they will sound.\nThere is nothing you can do about the actual content of the presentations and some presenters won’t be successful no matter what you do. There will always be the presenters that stand behind a podium and read their PowerPoint slides word-for-word in a monotone voice.\nBy following these best practices, you can rest easy knowing you’ve done your part to ensure a successful presentation for your speaker and your attendees.', 'Good rehearsal techniques can make all the difference between presentation heaven and convention suspension. Here we outline some of the most effective ways to practise and prepare for your big show…\nIn an ideal world, every presentation would be preceded by a comprehensive “test flight” at its designated venue. Such rehearsals generally allow the speaker an advanced sense of the task at hand, and help to prevent a last-minute attack of stage-fright. And whilst it may not be feasible to visit the actual venue every time you need to give a talk, it is almost always possible to re-create the presentation environment using a room of similar size, shape and appearance.\nOnce you’ve found a similar room, place a trio of recording devices at different locations in the room, and recite your presentation in its entirety. Listening to the rehearsal afterwards will enable you to identify and correct any less articulate sections of your talk. Better still, the recordings will give you a good idea of the area’s audio-dynamics, and allow you to adjust your vocal mannerisms accordingly. You’ll want to make sure that your every word is sharp, lucid, and available to your entire audience from start to finish.\nUnless you’ve an eidetic memory, attempting to learn your entire presentation by heart is almost certainly inadvisable; if you dedicate a disproportionate amount of energy to memorising your pitch, the chances are that you’ll be left sounding bored and lifeless at the main event. Even worse, you could become so rigidly attached to your “script” that you’ll be unable to respond to unexpected questions or adapt to sudden changes in the audience’s mood.\nInstead, try using memory aids to fix your pitch structure and major talking points into your mind’s eye. Spidergraphs, radial trees and prompt cards are all invaluable crutches which will lend your presentation a genial, natural flow and help you to keep your footing on the big day.\nMeet the Host\nAs far as rehearsal tips go, convening in advance with the venue’s host is difficult to beat. In doing so, you could gain a handy insight into a number of vital and easily overlooked matters.\nFrom the audience’s tastes and demographics to the seating layout and lighting in the auditorium, even the briefest of meetings will shed a valuable new light on your viewers’ expectations and allow you to perform at your best when presentation day rolls around.\nWhile you’re at the meeting, don’t forget to enquire as to the availability of refreshments for your audience. Providing your viewers with free snacks and beverages will not only set the foundations for a healthy rapport, it will ensure that your audience is physically charged to absorb your content, too. And while the venue itself may lack the facilities to provide such a service, its host should at the very least be able to recommend a good local caterer.\nAs obvious a rehearsal technique as it may seem, a worrying amount of speakers continue to take to the podium without first properly testing their presentation equipment. Needless to say, such carelessness can lead to an alarming assortment of extremely embarrassing situations.\nWhether this is your first of thousandth presentation, it’s only sensible to play it safe by carrying out at least two complete technical rehearsals. The first of these should be performed solo: facing the projection screen, keep a subjective eye on your equipment’s performance whilst you recite your pitch in its entirety. Without an audience present, you should be able to ensure that any errors concerning your apparatus – from your microphone to your slides to any audio or video sections you’ve decided to include – are ironed out once and for all.\nYour second tech-run should be carried out in the vein of a polished beta test, with a handful of trusted friends and colleagues making up your assembly. Since any problems with your equipment should already have been corrected by this point, the goal here is to ensure that your real audience will find your slide layout and technical content to be clear and relevant. Invite your test audience to interrupt you wherever confusion arises, and take care to implement their feedback in your final presentation. This will help to ensure that, at least so far as the technicalities are concerned, your pitch is delivered as smoothly and coherently as possible.\nIf you feel there’s still room for improvement after making your amendments, don’t be embarrassed to invite your test audience back for a third or even a fourth tech-run. Like many things, perfection comes in stages, and any colleague worthy of the name will be pleased to sacrifice some of their time if it means you’ve a greater chance of success.\nWhen you’re able to anticipate your audience’s post-pitch queries in advance, you’ll be in a great position to give the kind of informed, articulate responses that will keep your viewers satisfied and, perhaps more importantly, leave you looking polished and professional.\nTo get a decent idea of the questions you can expect to receive, you’ll first need to acquire an understanding of your audience’s level of familiarity with the subject at hand. This can be achieved easily enough during a brief interview with the event’s organiser. Next, compile a selection of the topic’s most common discussion points, from the amateur to the quite obscure; if you find yourself short for time, there’s no shame in using your final tech-run to collect some final ideas from that hapless audience of yours.\nFinally, rehearse giving your answers in the fluent, eloquent manner which audiences so crave. To ensure that your responses are both understood and remembered, practise mirroring the questioner’s tone and rate of speech. Lay emphasis on your most significant points by using clear, jargon-free language, and take care to repeat each question out loud before proceeding with your answer; this can help to prevent you from digressing off topic and, under the guise of restating the question for the benefit of those who may not have heard, lend you a few extra moments to construct a more orderly, intelligible response.\nListen and Learn\nThe beginning of your presentation really is the perfect opportunity to seize your viewers’ attention and paint yourself as the polished, inspirational speaker you are. And, since body language will play a key role in the audience’s evaluation of you, the less time you spend hunched over your notes during your opening period, the better.\nTo master your intro the easy way, create a recording of yourself reading it out. Then, listen to the recording frequently during the days running up to your presentation. Whether over breakfast, whilst driving or just before going to sleep, your content will become more and more familiar to you each time you hear it. And before long, you’ll be able to recite your introduction with the kind of effortless enthusiasm that will leave your audience itching for more.\nGeorge A Dixon']	['<urn:uuid:983d308b-148a-46d8-9c11-e45c0366c81e>', '<urn:uuid:1431b566-55f7-4d5c-b1d7-aa6192ae1f7e>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	18	108	1910
16	How do colors and spacing work together in making websites easy to understand, and what are the key principles for arranging content effectively?	Colors and spacing work together through strategic implementation. For colors, brighter hues with high contrast against the background are used to grab user attention, particularly for important elements like call-to-action buttons. However, it's recommended to use monochromatic color schemes and limit different hues to no more than 5 to maintain clarity. As for spacing, instead of using borders to separate elements, white space and subtle color contrast are more effective. Free space around elements is crucial - important details should be isolated from redundant components to attract more attention. Cluttering space with too many elements can cause users to leave without seeing core content. The arrangement should follow a clear visual hierarchy where elements are ordered by priority and importance, making it easier for users to find what they need within seconds of viewing the interface.	['Whether you are creating a dashboard or static report, regardless of the tool, these visual tips will help you improve its presentation and create a more intuitive and professionally-looking user interface.\nAvoid Borders. Use space to separate different elements.\nIt is a common habit to put a box around all the visualization. These solid borders can make your design look rigid as well as cluttered (like the canvas is sliced into different pieces). While the intention, which is to separate or group elements together, should be retained, the means should be slightly tweaked. Let’s look at a simple example here:\nWhile the interface looks clean and organized, the black borders are too bold on white background, therefore stealing steal users’ attention from the first glance. Remember that user’s visual attention is limited, and it is your responsibility to guide their eyes to the right visual element. Because the borders are not the focus of this report, they should not be that noticeable. So instead of using ‘lines’ to separate and group elements, we can use space and subtle color contrast.\nBy removing the borders and creating a consistent distance around each box, you can separate each element more efficiently. The contrast between the chart’s white background and the report’s light gray is enough to draw this distinction. Note that if the background is darker, the contrast might be too much and can again steal the attention from other visualizations – subtlety is the key. For example:\nI have also removed the borders around navigation labels on the top left corners because they don’t serve any purpose. The distance between the words is enough to tell them apart.\nUse only a few contrasting elements but signify the contrast.\nContrast or difference between elements not only makes your dashboard look more interesting, but also plays an important role in creating a visual hierarchy for your interface. A visual hierarchy is how we organize and prioritize the information presented in an interface. So before applying any visual property, you need to think about what information is more important than others. For example, in the context of a chart, chart title is the most important, then go data label, legend, axis title, axis label and gridline. These texts should have different property that let user easily read chart title first, then focus on data label without the noise of axis label or gridlines.\nThe first rule is the same type of elements should have the same properties (For example: all chart titles and KPI title should have the same font size and font-weight) and there should not be too many groups with different properties. The second rule is to make the contrast prominent: exaggerate the different between groups to help users see the difference more clearly. To establish a visual hierarchy, for example, we use bigger, bolder font, brighter colors and for less important elements, we use much more subtle colors.\nHere the dashboard looks more interesting and is easier to read because I have increased the contrast by bolding the important text and using light colors for less important elements such as the unselected tabs, axis labels and gridline on the charts. On the navigation tab, I also change the selected tab to a brighter hue so that the difference is much more prominent.\nConsistently Align Text Left\nThis rule is very simple but often overlooked. Intuitively we read from left to right, therefore it is easier for users to receive the information from your text elements if they are left-aligned. Another reason to consistently align text left is that we can have all text starts from the imaginary vertical line, which makes the content much more compact and organized.\nAn additional tip is to never align text center (except for dashboard title)\nUsing colors: only use different color (hue) when it has a unique purpose\nA hue is a specific shade of color that we usually assign a name to it such as green, red, blue and orange. The general rule is to avoid using more than 5 different hues on an interface and to use as few hues as possible. As a good example, each pie chart below uses the color turquoise with variations in lightness. This is monochromatic color scheme. This scheme is highly recommended for data visualization because it gives clarity without using different hues. Furthermore, it will also look good when printed in grayscale because the difference in lightness can be easily accommodated by black ink.\nWhile each of the three pie charts uses monochromatic scheme, the three are based on different hues. Let’s think about what these colors do for the chart – they represent different values of Store Name, Age Group and Class Name. Because we already have the chart titles and data labels, it is redundant to use a different hue for each chart. Therefore, we can use the same color scheme for all pie chart to reduce the number of different hues used in the dashboard.\nThink about the purpose of every single visual element on your canvas.\nWhen it comes to the final review, think about the role every single element plays in communicating information. Whether it’s text, lines, border, shadow or color, it needs to help user focus on the right material or access information quicker. No element should be there for decoration. A ‘good-looking’ report or dashboard is the one that uses visual elements efficiently to deliver the business insights in the most clear and concise manner. Any element that does not help you achieve this is noise and should be removed. Happy Dahsboarding!', 'Creating interfaces that captivate users at first glance is a challenging task. The secret to building a truly powerful user experience lies in a unique combination of creative flair and strategic insight. A great deal of psychological analysis is put into practice by UX UI design agencies when implementing a design idea, and visual hierarchy stands at the foundation of it.\nWhat is a visual hierarchy in UI/UX design?\nVisual hierarchy refers to putting elements in order of priority and importance. It can be thought of as the initial strategy that a designer lays out before placing elements in their places. Quite naturally, the most important elements need to attract the user’s attention quickly so that the product can achieve its purpose. For instance, if an app development service develops a shopping app, they’ll have to prioritize the USPs so that users can always see them. Users are more likely to buy products if they see the products frequently.\nImportance of Visual hierarchy in UX/UI design\nA user merely takes a few seconds to look at a website, and the decision to stay or leave is based on the web page’s purposefulness. However, no matter how important the information a website may have, if the data can’t reach the user quickly and effectively, its effect is the same as the information being absent completely. By prioritizing certain elements over others and strategically arranging them, designers at any UI UX designing company can create a more intuitive and streamlined user experience. This approach reduces friction, making it easier for users to interact with a product and ultimately improving their satisfaction and engagement.\nVisual hierarchy entails certain key principles that designers need to keep in mind.\n1. Size and scale are the key components that shape a user’s perspective.\nThe important elements typically are bigger or scale – be it a text or image. While enlarging some elements can help catch a user’s attention towards it, keeping its size too big or keeping other, less important elements at a similar size can abolish the intended effect the designer is trying to achieve.\n2. Contrast and color:\nUnderstanding color psychology is crucial to deciding what color to give to the elements in your product. Brighter colors with high contrast, when placed against the background, are typically used to grab the user’s attention. A good example of this is any website’s call to action buttons. Keeping their color brighter is more likely to result in a viewer converting into a customer.\nWhile designing, keeping space free of elements is just as important as adding elements to your canvas. Important details that need more user attention are usually placed in isolation from other redundant components. Cluttering the space with too many elements can result in a user bouncing off the product’s page without seeing the core product displayed.\nTo conclude, at the heart of UX design lies the idea of optimizing usability and minimizing obstacles for the user. A major strategy for achieving this is by implementing an effective visual hierarchy. The art of visual hierarchy is all about putting the right pieces in order so users can effortlessly find what they need. Key principles such as size, scale, contrast, color, and whitespace are crucial to determining and achieving effective visual hierarchy. With the right combination of creativity and strategy, designers can optimize usability and improve navigation for users, ensuring they have a positive experience with the product.']	['<urn:uuid:3cab5982-7155-42f8-a715-4bcf44af4c27>', '<urn:uuid:22e673a0-0b35-4746-abe1-5c91b719040c>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	23	136	1506
17	Which is older: Eastern Rebellion or Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers?	Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers is older, as Eastern Rebellion was released in 1976 while Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers was recorded in the mid-1950s during the development of hard bop.	"['A1 Bolivia 10:10\nA2 Naima 8:37\nB1 5/4 Thing 7:53\nB2 Bittersweet 6:54\nB3 Mode For Joe 7:51\nOriginally released in 1976\nAll-Star players team up on this classic Jazz collaboration\nFirst vinyl reissue since 1985\n45th Anniversary edition\n180g Black Vinyl Edition Limited to 500 copies, comes with obi strip\nIn 1975, four legends teamed up and gave birth to one of THE best rhythm groups of the 1970s…four musicians that had played music at the highest level all their lives and gained their status as both stand-alone artists and important sidemen. Each of them had participated in many of jazz’s great moments and all four shared the ability, documented on many albums, to inspire their fellow musicians to even greater heights. In 1975, the EASTERN REBELLION collective was born.\nOn saxophone, we have GEORGE COLEMAN (born in 1935) the self-taught saxophone maestro from Memphis who (after working with Ray Charles) played in B.B. King’s band in the 1950s and in Miles Davis’ quintet in the 1960s. Coleman played on four historical Miles albums (including ‘My Funny Valentine’) within one year. George Coleman went on to perform and record with legends such as Charles Mingus, Ahmad Jamal, Idris Muhammad, Melvin Sparks, Nina Simone…and was an essential member of many more noteworthy groups throughout his freelance career. He was named a NEA Jazz Master, inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2015 and received a brass note on the Beale Street Walk of Fame\nOn the piano, we have CEDAR WALTON (1934-2013) who was also the bandleader & producer of the Eastern Rebellion collective. He was a Dallas-born Hard bop jazz pianist virtuoso who came to prominence as a member of Art Blakey’s The Jazz Messengers before establishing a long career as a bandleader, arranger and composer (several of his compositions have by now become much-played jazz standards). Walton was known for his fantastic recordings and performances and of course for being part of the in-house rhythm section at Prestige Records. Cedar Walton arranged and recorded for Etta James, helping her win a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album in 1994.\nOn bass, we have SAM JONES (1924-1981) who originated from Florida, but his career primarily revolved around the New York City Jazz scene. Jones was a well-respected bass player (and since the 1950s regarded without reservation as THE master of his instrument), cellist and composer who was part of performances and recordings of renowned acts and artists such as Dizzy Gillespie, Chet Baker, Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk…and many others for key-labels such as Blue Note, Strata East and Prestige.\nOn drums, we have BILLY HIGGINS (1936-2001) one of the in-house drummers for Blue Note and a well-known Hard bop & Post-bop freelancer who played on Ornette Coleman’s first records. Higgins played and recorded with greats such as John Coltrane, Wayne Shorter, Donald Byrd, Steve Grossman, Herbie Hancock, Sonny Rollins, Milt Jackson, Pharoah Sanders, Max Roach, Freddie Hubbard, Toots Thielemans & Sun Ra…listing them all would be futile because in his career Billy Higgins played on over 700 recordings, transcending most genres.\nThe Eastern Rebellion album was recorded in New York City in December 1975 and released on the Dutch label TIMELESS in 1976. Timeless was (and is) ran by Ria and Wim Wigt who are patrons of the arts and very close with key jazz musicians around the globe…this was an important album for Timeless because it would become their first-ever release. Now 45 years later, the label is still standing strong after a long and prosperous career of releasing top recordings from all THE big names within the jazz genre.\nOn Eastern Rebellion (Vol.1) you’ll find four band-penned originals and an excellent John Coltrane cover-tune. The album was produced by Cedar Walton and Wim Wigt and is a remarkable outing of advanced musicianship by four jazz giants in their prime, delivering a gem containing five inspired and straight-ahead tracks. Three more volumes (depicting the same front-cover artwork) of the Eastern Rebellion jazz collective would follow between 1976 and 1984, and later another four on different labels (between 1992 and 1994). Some of those (at different times) would also feature other remarkable jazz players, but all albums included the winning Walton-Higgins combination.\nTidal Waves Music now proudly presents the 45th-anniversary vinyl reissue of this historical and collectible album. Originally released in 1976, and out of print on vinyl since its last pressing back in 1985, these classic recordings are now finally back available as a limited 180g vinyl edition (500 copies) complete with the iconic original artwork & photography by Martin Bough.', ""I didn’t want to end the year without doing at least ONE jazz review, and out of the hundreds of jazz albums on my to-do list, I chose the one I would characterize as “most exuberant.”\nHorace Silver was a pretty exuberant guy, with a smile to match. When you read descriptions of his piano style, you see words and phrases like “crisp,” “chipper,” “idiosyncratic,” “colorful,” “upbeat,” “exciting,” “uplifting,” and “generous good humor.” I suppose how you react to that last tag depends upon your sense of humor. Monk is the only pianist who makes me laugh, but Horace does make me smile.\nHorace Silver and the Jazz Messengers was an important and influential album, but before I get to that aspect of the work, I have to stress that it’s also an extremely enjoyable album. Jazz critics turn a lot of people off to jazz by droning on and on about the technical aspects of major developments in jazz, placing the aesthetic experience on the back burner. I will now harken back to the vernacular of the time and tell you that Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers is an absolute gas.\nIts influence owed a lot to perfect timing. The post-war years of jazz involved the sharp departure from the rhythmic emphasis of swing to the harmonic emphasis of bebop. In simple terms, you can dance to swing but you can’t dance—at least in the conventional sense—to bebop (and because a lot of bebop is played at breakneck speed, you’d probably die of a coronary). Bebop made things even more complicated because the harmonies the beboppers created were complex, non-standard harmonies—harmonies that sounded strange to the ears of anyone raised on classical music or The Andrews Sisters. In a muted response to bebop, some jazz musicians (particularly on the West Coast, but also Miles Davis) decided they wanted to slow the tempo and ease up on the intensity to produce a lighter sound while still embracing the harmonic connections bebop made possible. The critics named this style cool jazz (and in a fit of classification madness, later “discovered” a sub-genre of cool jazz called “West Coast Jazz.”) If you’re familiar with Dave Brubeck’s Time Out, that record is allegedly a marriage of cool jazz and West Coast Jazz (said the critics, ignoring the Turkish influences).\nThe thing with bebop and cool jazz is that both had moved jazz a long way from its rhythmic origins, particularly blues and gospel. Jazz lost a good chunk of its audience during these years in part because the music lacked what the average person would identify as rhythm. “Fer chrissakes, can’t ya gimme somethin’ I can at least snap my fingers to?” cried frustrated jazz fans.\n“Sure thing!” said Horace Silver and Art Blakey, the masterminds behind a newly-formed jazz combo called the Jazz Messengers (the name had been around for a while, in Art’s possession). What Horace and Art did is inject contemporary R&B along with the early rhythmic underpinnings of jazz (gospel and blues) into their music. Horace (who composed most of the work) also shifted the emphasis from harmony back to melody, giving the average listener patterns they could easily recognize and recall. They didn’t abandon all the lessons from bebop, but integrated those lessons into compositions characterized by melody and rhythm to make the music more appealing to an audience.\nThe critics had to name it something, so they called it hard bop.\nIf you’ve never heard Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers, I’m going to tell you right now that you’re wrong. I am 100% positive you have heard snippets of several of the songs on this album—maybe in a film, maybe on television, maybe in the background music that accompanies your shopping spree if you’re lucky to shop in a place that doesn’t buy the cheapest muzak available. I would guess the two you’ve heard are “Doodlin'” and “The Preacher,” but “Creepin’ In” is also a safe bet. When Horace Silver set out to create memorable songs, he did not fuck around. The melodic phrases will stick in your head forever.\n“Room 608” kickstarts the album with a high-speed swing (240bpm) that certainly fits the bop paradigm. After a memorable introduction heavy on bluesy major and minor seventh chords (with some fascinating 6/9 variations and a loaded G7 at the finish), the quintet takes flight in a classic unison arrangement. A thunderous—and I mean fucking THUNDEROUS—drumroll from Art Blakey announces the shift from unison playing to soloists, and first up is the amazing and classically underrated Kenny Dorham on trumpet. With Horace Silver pushing him with assertive rhythmic support, Kenny flies like an eagle, completely in command of his instrument despite the breakneck speed. Combining bright clear notes with high-speed trills isn’t easy, but Kenny makes it all sound like a walk in the park. I hate to see him go, but the disappointment is fleeting as Horace Silver takes us on a solo loaded with bright melody and spiced with a short series of intensely played blue notes that certify the piece as hard bop. Although a pianist can’t bend notes, you can achieve a similar effect with a quick run that ends on a flattened fifth or seventh (or a flattened sixth if you’re really evil), and Horace had the speed, discipline and percussive ability to pull it off with gusto. A stop time unison segment follows with a saxophone teaser in the middle, indicating Hank Mobley is next up. I’ve always felt that Hank should have taken the first solo, saving Kenny for last, simply because Hank was from the laid-back school while Kenny Dorham had greater dynamic range and command. I do notice that Horace seems to intensify his playing during Hank’s solo, placing himself closer to the center of attention by focusing on the upper end of the keyboard. Hank gives way to Art Blakey, who restores the balance with a thumping drum solo that only hints at his virtuosity but successfully restores the intensity of the piece. All’s well that ends well as the quintet returns in tight unison, the last note going to bassist Doug Watkins, who has matched Art beat for beat to keep this sucker moving. “Room 608” is a knockout opening piece that displays the talents of the soloists and the absolute commitment of the band to the music.\n“Creepin’ In” is a late-night mood piece that seems to begin as a minor blues but expands to include a larger chord palate as it moves forward, with A-flat minor serving as the anchor. Here Hank Mobley comes first after the unison introduction, his mellow tone reinforcing the smoky bar ambience. Kenny follows his lead by restraining his blow, happy to explore the myriad possibilities inside and outside of the baseline chord progression. Great contributions by both gentlemen, but throughout the piece I’ve had one ear focused solely on what Horace Silver is doing, and while it may be pianist favoritism, I find his work absolutely riveting. During the introduction, he serves as call-and-response to the main theme, providing a rather loping counterpoint that inspires a picture of a patron who’s had a bit too much of the sauce. Every now and then, though, he throws in a riff that strengthens the progression at just the right moment. During Hank’s solo, Horace turns up the brightness while shifting from chords in the pattern to slight variants that are complementary only within the larger harmonic palette of bebop. All brilliantly connective, but when it’s turn for his solo, he shifts to Count Basie minimalism with a series of eventually descending blue note duplets before latching onto the main chord pattern. His next descent sounds almost classical, with formal-sounding trills that magically lead back to a more bluesy feel. His last descent combines a daring run down the keyboard before he reinforces the theme and ends in one beautiful flurry of blue. Although Monk is my favorite pianist, on the rare but pleasant occasions when I sit in with a jazz combo, I use Horace Silver as my model for sustaining an unbroken connection with the theme. While “Creepin’ In” is the longest piece on album, clocking in at 7:27, it never drags thanks to the combination of discipline and diversity of the combo and Horace Silver’s ability to pull it all together.\n“Stop Time” ratchets up the tempo and gives everyone in the band a place in the spotlight, where they all shine. Art Blakey’s solo is framed within brief phrases from Dorham and Mobley on the first few rounds, but when they break the frame and let him go, he pounds those skins like there’s no tomorrow. Critics and fans have noted the relative restraint Art Blakey displays on this album, making moments like this solo all the more special. It’s followed by “To Whom It May Concern,” an interesting piece incorporating flamenco rhythm influences in the “chorus” and “urban cool” in the “verses.” “Hippy” gives the combo another chance to display their tightness in unison and the soloists another chance to riff off a straightforward chord pattern and the Blakey-Watkins rhythm section. Blakey’s solo here features one of his marvelous drum rolls, leading to a strong finish.\nMy first reaction to “The Preacher” is usually disorientation—something along the lines of “What the fuck?” Here I am digging the hard bop sounds mid-50’s America and all of a sudden I’m yanked back in space in time to Dixieland in the 1920’s. What the hell is “The Preacher” doing here?\nMy reaction is understandable and supported by precedent: producer Alfred Lion didn’t want the song on the album either. Horace Silver held his ground, and lo and behold, “The Preacher” became the album’s hit: another entry in my “What the fuck do I know?” journal.\nInterestingly, the song did not originate anywhere near the bayou, but on an English train. Silver took the chords from a 1926 novelty hit called “Show Me the Way to Go Home,” written by two enterprising gents who wrote under the synonym “Irving King.” They were on a train heading out of London one evening, got likkered up and wrote a song about the numbing effects of alcohol. Back in the days when sheet music still held sway with the music-purchasing public, “Show Me the Way to Go Home” sold over two million copies, making the fake Irvings rich and respectable. The song has been recorded by many artists over the years, and modern listeners probably know the song from the movie Jaws.\nJazz composers often borrow chords from old songs as a starting point for new compositions, so it wasn’t unusual that Horace Silver found inspiration in this bit of Vaudeville. Where he differed from his contemporaries was in his straightforward approach—instead of deconstructing the piece à la Charlie Parker, he changed the rhythm to a good old Dixieland strut . . . well, kinda sorta. The first two passages are positively prehistoric, classic New Orleans jazz à la the Jazz Preservation Hall Band. After that, it’s smooth sailing on a looser rhythm where the soloists pay due respect to the melodic structure of the song while removing the starch, creating in effect a delightful tribute to the origins of jazz that clearly establishes the genetic connection to this newfangled hard bop stuff. When the combo returns to the main theme, the reaction is a smile instead of a jerk, and you appreciate the ingenuity that went into the arrangement.\nThe only non-Silver composition on the album is Hank Mobley’s piece, “Hankerin’.” This nice, breezy uptempo piece is a good intro to hard bop for the neophyte because of its cheerful major key melodic lines. Hank’s solo is relatively brief but helps temper the speed of the piece through his “no sweat” approach to the sax. Kenny Dorham absorbs the cue and delivers his solo without a lot of drama. Horace gets the bulk of the attention with a nimble, melodic solo that might sound sweet in a slower tempo. All through the piece, Art Blakey has expressed a certain restlessness, adding unexpected thumps and rolls in spots. When he finally gets his turn, you can hear him muttering to himself as enters the drummer’s trance and lays out a series of rolls and combinations over an ever-steady hi-hat beat. Blakey was Monk’s favorite drummer, and his versatility and ability to immerse himself in the flow demonstrated here shows how he earned that status.\nThe album closes with the familiar sounds of “Doodlin’.” Ira Gitler’s liner notes emphasize the inherent humor of the piece, an effect achieved by Mobley and Dorham playing in unison separated by an octave and a series of staccato notes in the third segment of this twelve-bar blues. When I hear the dominant line, I hear echoes of the Dizzy Gillespie-Kenny Clarke-Charlie Parker derivative piece, “Salt Peanuts,” an equally humorous morsel of music. “Doodlin'” also features Horace Silver’s slickest solo—urbane, confident and minimalistic. Once he leaves the spotlight, he remains in the perceptual field with superb rhythmic support that varies between chords, extended riffs and strong punctuation. Mobley follows Silver with an elegant passage, perfectly setting up Kenny Dorham’s sexy-as-fuck solo. He could have gone on forever as a far as this chick is concerned, but he graciously gives way to Art Blakey’s multifaceted attack, and I forget all about Kenny. Yes, I’m a musical slut! The record ends and you think to yourself, “Man, what a great combo!”\nToo bad they only recorded the songs you hear on this album and a couple of live gigs. While The Jazz Messengers lived on for decades in various configurations under Art Blakey, this group lasted less than two years. Both Blakey and Silver achieved the status of jazz legends; in Horace’s case more for his compositions than his piano, but I still consider him one of the best who ever put fingers to a keyboard. His joyful expressiveness—his exuberance—shines through in every performance. When you listen to Horace Silver, you may not hear a man who could play with the dexterity of Art Tatum or delight you with surprising choices like Monk, but you hear the sound of a man who couldn’t be happier to be alive and making music.""]"	['<urn:uuid:1fa26dbe-9b59-4524-9b50-6810c2debfa0>', '<urn:uuid:7a164752-b323-4365-b7ef-7c54de348fa8>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	12	33	3147
18	basketball rebound drills training intensity recovery time prevent ankle injuries	Basketball rebounding drills like the War Drill and Get to the Basket Drill are highly intensive contact drills that focus on aggressive movements. To prevent ankle injuries while doing these drills, proprioceptive training should be implemented, which involves stability and postural control exercises. Additionally, after ankle sprains, external support should be used for 12 months as the ligaments need time to heal properly and regain normal strength and proprioceptive ability.	"['Basketball Rebounding Drills\nThese Rebounding Drills came from the Arizona Men’s February Basketball Newsletter. If you are interested in subscribing to their newsletter, please give me your:\n2) email address\n3) school or team\n4) coaching position\nWar Drill (8 minute drill)\n(1 basketball. 6. 8 or 10 players. Full Court)\nDefense is in the paint and matches up. On the shot by the coach. their goal is to go meet the offense outside of the paint and keep them out of it.\nThe offensive players are set up behind the three point line and except for the point guard, (who gets back on defense), are going hard to the rim. The defender on the point guard should look to help on boxing someone else out.\nThis is a highly competitive drill with a winner and loser. If the offense gets the rebound they get a point and can try to score a 2 or 3 pointer. If they score we set the drill back up. If the defense gets the rebound or forces a turnover, there is no point scored but they push the basketball down court (transition offense) and try to score on the other end. On a score or turnover by them, play stops and we set the drill back up.\nThe ball will only go from one end to the other end one time and then the drill would be reset. If we don’t reset the drill it becomes a transition drill and not a contact drill.\nThere are no points on a made shot by the coach but it is still played like a rebound.\n(1 or 2 basketballs. 6 or more players)\nOn the shot by the number 3 (could be a coach), Xl and X4 come out and box out (they start with one foot on the baseline). Offensive players 1 and 5 are going hard to the rim. Numbers 2 and 4 are there for the outlet pass. If the defense gets the rebound they are going to pivot to the outside and outlet the ball. If it’s a made shot. they run out of bounds to outlet the basketball. The offense players try to stop the outlet pass. You could have one player deny the inbounder and the other denying the player receiving the pass.\nIf the offense gets the rebound they go 2 on 2 and try to score or the drill can be reset (coach’s option).\nOffensive players switch between being offense or outlet players. The defense remains defense until you switch them out.\nTry to match up the lines with perimeter players in one line and post players in the other.\nThis could be a competition drill with sprints for the losers. A defensive rebound is one point. a successful outlet pass is one point, an offensive rebound is two points and a made basket is one point.\nThe Defenders can cross and block out opposite line to vary the drill.\nGet to the Basket Drill\n(1 basketball, 3 or more players)\nPlace two defenders side by side facing the offense (if you have football pads, use them). On the shot, the offense has to bust through to the basket. This teaches them to never surrender going to the basket and being aggressive.\nOnly drill this from the wings. If we have an offensive player at the top, we would normally want him to get back on defense.\nWithout the pads, the defense gives a little pressure, just enough to make them push through.', '- Prevention -\nAlthough some may perceive sports-related injuries to be unavoidable and simply a part of the game, these occur in predictable patterns and many are preventable through the implementation of targeted interventions. As detailed previously, the two most problematic injuries in basketball are related to the ankle and knee. As a result, numerous studies had been conducted to evaluate different intervention strategies and different protective equipment in preventing injuries of these body parts.\nThere is no standardized intervention program established to prevent lower limb injury. The common traits of alternative effective protocols include a combination of the following elements: 1) preseason conditioning, 2) education, and 3) proprioceptive balance training programmes (functional training). The use of protective equipment in injury prevention is still partially inconclusive and requires further assessment. \n1) Preseason conditioning\nPreseason conditioning is used to develop flexibility, strength, power, sport-specific fitness and training technique (e.g. to learn how to avoid common injury mechanism). The benefit appears to be optimized when the preventive programme is continued throughout the playing season.\nUsing a sample of female soccer, volleyball and basketball players, it was found that 6 weeks of preventive intervention (three sessions a week) decreased the number of serious knee injuries over the next sporting season.  Furthermore there is evidence that showed significant reductions in ankle sprain also, after introduction of preventive programmes in volleyball. Similarly preventive programmes in football (soccer) produced a 50-75% reduction in injuries in general and a significant reduction in ACL injuries. \nEducation to athletes, coaches and sports federations is very important. Effectiveness of injury prevention strategies and safety promotion in sports depends on the compliance to advice from sports medicine specialists. Important challenge is to convince coaches and athletes to accept existing knowledge and to put it into practice. They sometimes show scepticism in the field with questions ‘‘Are the exercises really worth doing? It takes 20 min; is it necessary to do this program every training session?\'\' These and similar doubts should be decreased showing evidence based data that prevention of some injuries is possible\n3) Proprioceptive training\nProprioceptive training has been used to prevent ankle sprains since this form of prophylaxis was first proposed in 1965. Most functional training protocols consisted of stability and postural control exercises.  It is a unique method of training, because it stimulates multiple planes of ankle movement on a weight bearing foot, an activity that would occur infrequently otherwise. Proprioceptive training often involves the use of devices such as tilt boards, ankle disks, balance boards, and so on, which demand use of the muscles that pronate and supinate the feet.  It was shown that proprioceptive training was more effective prophylactic measures for ankle sprains in basketball than orthosis. [3, 4]\n|Spain center Marc Gasol has his ankle taped before the game|\nThe prophylactic devices\nThe prophylactic devices, like taping and bracing/orthosis, is the most common preventive method used among athletes. The similarity of these devices is to wrap the ankle joint from the foot segment to the shank segment. Some studies suggested that these devices provided a mechanical support to resist the ankle inversion moment, but some suggested that it instead improved the proprioception and joint position sense and thus maintained a proper anatomical position during landing. Bracing and taping may have negative side effects (uncomfortable if not fitted properly, skin irritation, relatively high costs, etc.). \nThe effectiveness of these devices in reducing the ankle sprain injury rate was reported in numerous studies and its main merit is the improvement of the proprioceptive function of a previously injured ankle. [2, 5] Randomised clinical trials have reported that orthosis reduces the incidence of ankle sprains in previously sprained ankles, but not in previously uninjured ankles. The use of external support should be recommended for a period of 12 months after an ankle sprain, because the risk of reinjures is increased during the first year and the ligaments need about a year to heal properly and to regain their normal strength and proprioceptive ability after an ankle injury. \nPragmatists argue that the potential benefits of knee taping and bracing are related to enhancing sensorimotor control rather than providing mechanical constraint, but the evidence to support this remains contradictory. There is some evidence to show that knee bracing can enhance sensorimotor control in subjects with a history of knee injury, but the effect is lessened with more demanding functional tasks, and the clinical benefits of such small changes have also been questioned. It was found that the application of an elastic bandage can enhance joint positional sense in knees with an ACL tear, and it supports the use of knee bracing in preventing re-injury. Generally there is no consistent evidence of effectiveness for knee bracing in reducing knee injury in adult and adolescent athletes. \nWhen to start prevention of injuries?\nMany preventive programs are targeted toward athletes aged from 15 to early twenties. It is possible that the implementation of injury prevention programs would be more beneficial at an earlier age; according to some authors we should put most effort into prevention from 12-14 years. From a motor learning aspect even age 6-12 might be important in relation to develop ‘‘good habits\'\' (good warm-up routines and movement patters) and to establish correct playing technique.\nFor more detailed information you can download the fact sheet ""Preventing injuries in Basketball"" here\n1.

19	I've been reading about threatened bird habitats and was wondering how the vegetation in Rodrigues Island compares to the wetland habitat in South Africa's Free State region?	The Rodrigues warbler's habitat consists of dense thickets and woodland dominated by introduced trees and shrubs, including rose-apple, mahogany, tecoma, and Norfolk Island pine. In contrast, the South African wetland habitat is characterized by extensive beds of Phragmites up to 2.5m tall, mixed with other plant species such as Carex, Cyperus, Typha, Schoenoplectus, and Leersia. The wetland also features extensive patches of Typha and mixed sedges with grass, as well as small depressions and inlets with combinations of sedges and grasses around the edges.	"[""Rodrigues warbler (Acrocephalus rodericanus)\n|Also known as:||Rodrigues brush-warbler|\n|French:||Fauvette de l'Ile de Rodrigues|\n|Size||Length: 13.5 cm (2)|\n|Weight||11 – 13 g (2)|\nClassified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List 2007 (1) and listed on Appendix III of CITES (3).\nAn unfortunate inhabitant of one of the world’s most ecologically degraded tropical oceanic islands (4), the Rodrigues warbler is a small bird with a relatively long, mostly flesh-coloured bill, and a long, graduated tail (2). Olive-brown plumage covers the upperparts, while the underparts are pale lemon-yellow in fresh plumage, turning greyish with a slight wash of yellow as the plumage becomes more worn. Above the eye runs a yellowish line, like an eyebrow, and a dark stripe extends through the eye. The relatively long legs are grey (2). A fairly unobtrusive bird, the Rodrigues warbler is infrequently heard, but has a soft, melodic song and a harsh chattering alarm call (2) (5).\nThe Rodrigues warbler occurs only on Rodrigues Island, the smallest of the Mascarene Islands, situated in the Indian Ocean, where it is restricted to just a few valleys in the centre of the island (2).\nSince human inhabitants destroyed nearly all native vegetation on Rodrigues Island, the Rodrigues warbler is now found in dense thickets and woodland dominated by introduced trees and shrubs, preferably close to clearings or the forest edge. The majority of the population is found in areas dominated by rose-apple (Syzygium jambos), but areas of mahogany (Swietenia mahogoni), tecoma (Tabebia pallida) and Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria cunninghami) are also inhabited (2) (5).\nThis small, inconspicuous bird feeds primarily on insects and spends its days quietly foraging high in the dense forests, plucking its prey from the foliage, while habitually jerking its tail up and down (2) (5). Pairs of Rodrigues warblers appear to remain together in a territory throughout most of the year (2) (5).\nDuring the breeding season, which extends from late September to March, pairs of Rodrigues warblers construct a nest. Usually this is a small cup structure, with a deep inside lined with a few feathers, that is situated up to nine metres off the ground, supported in the fork of slender branches. Two or three eggs are laid in each clutch, with possibly two broods being raised each breeding season. Both sexes share the responsibility of incubating their precious brood (2).\nDuring the 1950s and 60s, the natural habitat of Rodrigues Island was extensively cleared for timber, firewood, and farming (5) (6), leaving it one of the most degraded tropical oceanic islands in the world (4), and significantly decreasing the warbler population (5). Then, in 1968, one of the most severe cyclones to ever have hit Rodrigues struck and, with a search in 1969 failing to find any warblers, it was thought to have wiped out one of the island’s endemic birds (5). Thankfully the species had not gone extinct and numbers have since recovered slightly, primarily due to an increase in forest cover through habitat protection and afforestation (5).\nHowever, many threats to this species still remain. Introduced predators, particularly rats, may be limiting the Rodrigues warbler’s ability to recover (5), and cyclones and droughts are a continual potential threat, particularly given the warbler’s restricted location and small population (2) (5). In addition, any further destruction or degradation of the remaining suitable habitat may seriously threaten this species’ existence (2) (6).\nThe slow recovery of the Rodrigues warbler since 1969 has been the result of efforts to protect the island’s watersheds, which allowed the surrounding forests to mature and recover, and a switch to the use of bottled gas for cooking, lessening the demand for firewood (5) (6). Nature has also played a role in this species’ recovery, with a recent absence of catastrophic cyclones allowing populations to increase (6). While much of the reforestation has involved exotic trees, native species are being replanted in some areas, including two Conservation Management Areas, where grazing animals and woodcutters are kept out and exotic plants are removed (6). Exotic plant species are a major cause of the lack of native habitat on the island, but these introduced trees and shrubs also provide a vital haven for the Rodrigues warbler in the absence of native forest. For the native forest to regenerate, it is considered necessary to remove all exotic tree species, but this may have a short-term detrimental impact on warbler populations. Hopefully, the long-term benefit, to the island and to the Rodrigues warbler, will outweigh this short-term loss (5). To mitigate the potential catastrophic effects of another introduced predator, catastrophic cyclone or drought, the possibility of introducing the warblers to a small predator-free island has also been considered and feasibility studies have been undertaken (5).\nThis information is awaiting authentication by a species expert, and will be updated as soon as possible.

The farms consist primarily of flat grassveld plains, most of which are used for growing maize, wheat, soya beans and pasture grass, while most of the remaining natural grassland on the slopes is grazed by sheep and cattle. A very large, impressive wetland is situated on the properties. This wetland is minimally disturbed or modified, and is possibly only grazed lightly for part of the year. The vlei has three major arms, which unite in a main channel running below a steep ridge on the wetland’s northern border. On sections of the vlei adjacent to the steeper slopes, there are extensive, broad beds of Phragmites, up to 2.5 m tall, which often contain a rich mixture of other plant species such as Carex, Cyperus, Typha, Schoenoplectus and Leersia. On the side of the wetland adjacent to the shallow slopes, the vegetation comprises extensive patches of Typha and mixed sedges, with some grass. Around the edges there are numerous small depressions and inlets with combinations of sedges and grasses, which further increase the diversity of the vegetation.\nKey Biodiversity See Box for key species. Sarothrura ayresi has been recorded at the site. There is enough habitat to support between 30 and 50 birds, a higher estimated total than for any other single site in South Africa.

20	fabric care professional seeking effective methods prevent minimize pilling polyester garments	To minimize pilling in polyester garments, several preventive measures can be taken: washing garments inside out, using gentle cycles, and avoiding excessive heat. Using fabric shavers can also help manage existing pills. Additionally, choosing higher quality polyester fabrics and blends can reduce the pilling problem. These measures can effectively extend the lifespan of polyester clothing and maintain their appearance.	"[""Polyester, with it’s myriad advantages such as durability, affordability, and versatility, has emerged as one of the most popular synthetic fabrics in the modern world. An inevitable consequence of continuous wear and friction, pilling occurs when loose fibers become entangled and form small, unsightly balls on the fabric's surface. While polyester is generally known for it’s resistance to pilling, it isn’t immune to this phenomenon. Understanding the factors that contribute to pilling and adopting preventive measures can help you prolong the lifespan of your polyester garments and maintain their immaculate appearance. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the world of polyester pilling, exploring it’s causes, prevention methods, and ways to treat existing pills, equipping you with the knowledge needed to keep your polyester fabrics looking as good as new for years to come.\nWhat Type of Cotton Does Not Pill?\nWhen it comes to preventing pilling, choosing the right type of cotton is crucial. Pima cotton, also known as Supima cotton, is one variety that stands out in this regard. Unlike many other types of cotton, Pima cotton is renowned for it’s resistance to pilling. This is mainly due to it’s long fibers which make it less prone to tangling and forming those annoying little balls on the surface of your clothing.\nGarments made from Pima cotton tend to remain pill-free even after numerous washes, ensuring their longevity and durability. This is particularly beneficial for items that are frequently worn, such as t-shirts, bedding, and linens. Whether youre looking to furnish your home or update your wardrobe, opting for Pima cotton guarantees a superior quality fabric that resists pilling and holds up well over time.\nIt’s known for it’s exceptional softness, making it incredibly comfortable against the skin. Additionally, Pima cotton exhibits enhanced breathability, wicking away moisture and preventing excessive perspiration. This makes it an excellent choice for warmer climates or those who tend to overheat easily.\nIt’s always recommended to follow the care instructions provided by the manufacturer to minimize the risk of pilling. Washing your Pima cotton items on a gentle cycle with mild detergent and avoiding rough surfaces or excessive agitation can help prevent pilling even further.\nDifferent Types of Cotton and Their Properties: This Topic Can Explore the Characteristics of Various Types of Cotton, Including Pima Cotton, Egyptian Cotton, and Organic Cotton, and Compare Their Resistance to Pilling.\nCotton is a popular fabric known for it’s comfort and versatility. There are different types of cotton, each with it’s own unique properties. Pima cotton is known for it’s long and durable fibers, making it less prone to pilling compared to other types of cotton. Egyptian cotton is also highly regarded for it’s quality, softness, and resistance to pilling. Organic cotton is grown without the use of synthetic chemicals, resulting in a fabric that’s gentle on the skin and less likely to pill. By understanding the properties of different types of cotton, you can choose a fabric that’s less likely to pill and maintain it’s quality over time.\nAdditionally, fabric treatments and finishes such as mercerization or brushing can also help reduce pilling.\nWhat Fabrics Are Less Likely to Pill?\nFabrics made from long fibers such as silk and linen are generally less likely to pill compared to fabrics made from wool, cotton, polyester, and other synthetic threads. The length of the fiber plays a significant role in determining how prone a fabric is to pilling. Longer fibers tend to be more durable and less likely to form pills.\nNatural fabrics like silk and linen are known for their long, smooth fibers, which contribute to their resistance to pilling. Silk, in particular, is recognized for it’s strength and ability to maintain it’s appearance over time. Linen, on the other hand, is highly durable and has a natural resistance to pilling due to the longer length of it’s fibers.\nWhile synthetic fibers like polyester are more prone to pilling, there are variations within the synthetic category. It’s essential to pay attention to the composition and construction of synthetic fabrics to determine their durability and pilling tendencies.\nAdditionally, investing in higher-quality synthetic fabrics can reduce the chances of pilling.\nComparing the Pilling Tendencies of Different Synthetic Fibers Such as Nylon, Acrylic, and Rayon.\nIn this comprehensive guide, we explore the pilling tendencies of various synthetic fibers like nylon, acrylic, and rayon. Understanding how different materials such as polyester may pill up over time can help you prevent and manage pilling issues in your clothing and textile products.\nIn conclusion, after a comprehensive exploration of the topic, it can be confidently stated that polyester does have the tendency to pill up. However, by following a few preventive measures, such as washing garments inside out, using gentle cycles, avoiding excessive heat, and utilizing fabric shavers, it’s possible to minimize pilling and extend the lifespan of polyester clothing. Additionally, opting for higher quality polyester fabrics and blends, as well as considering alternative materials or fabric finishes, can further reduce the pilling problem.""]"	['<urn:uuid:198de5ea-d995-401d-9f7f-5a37a293b381>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	11	59	831
21	how both werd radio station atlanta and wfaa dallas morning news station started operating timeline	WFAA in Dallas began operating in 1922 as part of the Dallas Morning News media empire. WERD in Atlanta started much later, launching on October 3, 1949, when Jesse B. Blayton Sr. purchased it for $50,000. While WFAA was part of an established media company, WERD made history as the first radio station owned and operated by African-Americans. By 1951, WERD had become notably successful with 'Jockey' Jack Gibson becoming the most popular DJ in Atlanta.	['Early Dallas Radio & “Verified Reception Stamps”\nby Paula Bosse\nby Paula Bosse\nChances are you’ve never heard of “Verified Reception Stamps” which were issued in the 1920s by a company in Chicago called EKKO. I certainly hadn’t. The stamps (referred to by collectors as “Cinderellas”) were enthusiastically and obsessively collected in the mid-’20s — people were really into it. Basically, it seems to have been a clever form of advertising which banked on both the public’s fascination with early radio and the then-very popular hobby of stamp collecting.\nHow did it work? Briefly (see below for links to much more involved articles about this), the EKKO company printed these stamps for subscriber radio stations around the country (and later for stations in Canada, Mexico, and Cuba). Once the radio stations received them, they issued them to listeners who wrote in to affirm that they had, in fact, picked up their station on the wireless. The listener had to prove it by stating the time he or she had tuned in and then give a short synopsis of the program they had heard. Oh, and they had to enclose a dime. (The dime was probably the most important part of this whole fad — at least for the broadcasters.) In return, the station would check their logs and “verify” that the dime-sender probably DID hear the station, and one of these little stamps would be sent out post haste. The EKKO company also conveniently printed up albums for collectors to paste the stamps into. I’m not sure how one was expected to fill up the book (with pages devoted to each state), since there’s no way you’d be able to pick up the signals of all those stations, but I guess that’s what gets collectors’ blood racing. It’s the thrill of the chase. The verified reception stamp-collecting fad died out as the Depression set in, and it became hard to justify spending one’s precious hard-earned dimes on a frivolous hobby.\nVerified reception stamps were issued by the five main stations in the Dallas area in the 1920s. WRR, at the top, was the first radio station in Dallas and one of the earliest stations in the country. It began broadcasting as a sort of early police radio in 1920 and received its official broadcasting license in 1922. It remains an oddity in the radio world as it is a commercial radio station that is owned and operated by the City of Dallas.\nWFAA signed on in 1922 and was part of the nascent Dallas Morning News media empire.\nWBAP, a Fort Worth station, also signed on in 1922. Someone thought it might be cute if “WBAP” stood for “We’ll Be At the Party.” More serious-minded station people went with “We Bring a Program” which, really, isn’t much better.\nKFJZ (another Fort Worth station) came along in 1923. Its founder sold the station five years later for a good chunk of change and then went to work for WBAP.\nKRLD began broadcasting in 1926 and was acquired by The Dallas Times Herald a year later.\nA sample page the “Texas” portion of the official EKKO stamp album.\nThe EKKO company had some competition in the PM Bryant Co. Bryant stamps required no “verification” — you just sent them your dime and got a stamp. Their stamps had no eagle, but they DID have transmitter towers and the essential lightning bolts.\nAnd now you know!\nAll of the above stamps come from a bewilderingly jam-packed page of thousands of these stamps. It’s pretty cool, but the page takes FOREVER to load. Find it here. (There is a page with with links only — no pictures. It loads a lot faster. Find it here.)\nAn incredibly comprehensive history of Dallas radio is the DFW Radio Archives site — its main page is here. The pages dealing with the stations broadcasting in DFW in the 1920s are here and here. I highly recommend reading the very interesting account about how WRR evolved from an experimental police communication transmission tool to a full-fledged entertainment station.\nCopyright © 2014 Paula Bosse.

22	soldering heat shrink differences application safety	Soldering wires requires a soldering iron to heat the wire and apply solder to create a solid electrical connection, while heat shrink tubing is used to protect the splice and requires a heat gun to shrink. While soldering needs temperatures hot enough to melt solder, a heat gun operates at dangerously high temperatures specifically for shrinking materials like heat shrink tubing. For safety when soldering, proper tools and protection from heat are needed, and for heat guns, they should never be used on people unlike hair dryers which are designed for safe use on humans at lower temperatures.	"['Our Community is 705,000 Strong. Join Us.\nThe basics of how electricity works and why you need to solder wires together\n04-18-2009, 05:14 PM\nA lot of people have problems when it comes to electrical installations or repairs. The electrical system is one of the most difficult to understand on a car. It can be simplified significantly by thinking of electricity as water and the wires as pipes. Voltage is water pressure, the amount of water flowing is amps, and any restrictions in the pipe is resistance. The battery is a pump, and the electrical load is a turbine. For the pump to spin the turbine, you need pressure and flow. It won\'t spin without enough of both. If there are restrictions in the pipe, there will be a loss of pressure after the restriction, but full pressure before it. The restriction will also cause less water to flow. There may just be a trickle trying to spin the turbine, which won\'t work. OK, the water analogy\'s gone. It\'s all volts, amps, and resistance now.\nThe most important thing you need to understand when doing anything electrical is resistance. Every conductor has resistance. An ohmmeter will read zero or close to zero on any wire as long as there is some conductor throughout. You can cut all but one strand on a battery cable, and guess what? It will show zero ohms from end to end. This is because an ohmmeter uses almost no current to measure resistance, so just about any load will draw more amps than the ohmmeter uses. That cable isn\'t going to run much more than a dome light, but your meter won\'t tell you that. If you are having a problem and suspect a bad wire, don\'t use an ohmmeter. Connect the leads of a volt meter to each end of the wire and operate the circuit. It should read less than .5v on very high amp circuits (starter, winch, offroad lights, etc). .5v is the MAX, not what you want. Usually it will be closer to .1-.2v, but ""they"" say .5v won\'t cause problems. For low amperage circuits, the max is .1v. This is also why you need to select the proper wire size. Too small a wire will have a volt drop across it, which turns the wire itself into an electrical load. This makes the wire very hot and can cause a fire. The hotter a wire gets, the more resistance it has, so it just keeps getting hotter and hotter. It also drops the voltage to what you are running, which can cause improper operation in electronics, can cause some motors to go bad prematurely, and will make lights dimmer. A lot of people don\'t give any consideration to the ground side of the circuit, but it is just as important as the power side because all the current has to flow back to the battery. I can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve seen 4-0 cable going to an amplifier with 4-0 cable for the ground screwed to some body sheet metal. What\'s wrong with that? Take a look at your battery cables. The ground usually has a ~10 gauge wire that bolts to the body. The body ground on the car is intended only to give a ground to some sensors, headlights, taillights, and other fairly low amperage accessories. This means essentially that the amp has 4-0 going to it, but only 10 gauge going back to ground, which electrically speaking is the same as having 10 gauge going through it because the curent can travel back to the battery only as the smallest wire in the circuit allows.\nThe most important thing to do when you install something electrical is solder the wires together (this is assuming you selected the proper wire size, if your project didn\'t come in a kit (http://www.rbeelectronics.com/wtable.htm)). Many people will simply twist the wires together and then wrap electrical tape around the twist. This is a very bad thing to do. The wire will loosen and you will have an intermittent open wire. Whatever that wire powers will turn off. Solder is also needed because if all you do is twist the wires, you have very little contact between the two which will cause high resistance if there is enough load (amp demand). This is why sometimes it will work for a while and sometimes it wont. The larger the strands, the truer this is. The solder fills in the gaps and gives you one solid wire, electrically speaking. Solder also makes the wire as strong as a solid section of wire. If something pulls on a wire that is only twisted together, it will pull apart. A soldered wire will break on the wire, not where it is soldered, and it takes a lot of force to do that. Before you solder something, plan what you are going to do. Heat shrink tubing is the best way to protect the solder joint, from here on out, called a ""splice"". The heat from soldering will shrink the tubing if it is too close to the splice. If you can, give yourself some extra wire so you can slide the heat shrink to one end, 4"" is usually enough to keep the heat away. If heat shrink is impossible for some reason, use good electrical tape. The cheap stuff cracks and will let moisture into the splice which will cause corrosion which will cause resistance. ""Crimp only"" connectors should be avoided whenever possible. The ONLY time you should even consider using them is on the interior of the vehicle where they cannot get wet. Even there humidity can cause a problem over time. Under dash work will sometimes require the removal of the dash to solder a wire. In that case, I will use a crimp connector, but be sure you use one that comes with heat shrink already on it! To summarize, if at all possible, solder it!\nHow to solder: Follow the tool manufacturers safety instructions! Strip approximately 3/8"" to 1/2"" of insulation off each wire to be soldered. Place the heat shrink tubing over the wire and as far away from the splice as possible, at least 4"". If the strands in the two wires are roughly the same size, flare out the strands on each wire and push them together. Push the strands back flat once the wires are together. Unless your skin is thicker than mine, use pliers or you will puncture your fingers. It is very important to be sure you don\'t have any conductors pointing out that will pierce the heat shrink tubing. Using a soldering iron, heat the wire from the bottom and hold the solder on the top of the wire. When the solder starts to melt, keep feeding it into the splice until you can see solder all the way around the joint. Don\'t use so much that it forms a drop on the bottom or it flows into the wire inside the insulation. Do not feed the solder onto the iron, feed it directly into the wire. Feeding it into the iron will let it start flowing into the wire before the whole wire is hot enough for the solder to flow, and possibly causing it to not flow throughout the splice. If the insulation starts to burn before the solder melts, you need a hotter iron, one that will heat the wire hot enough before the heat dissipates further down the wire. Once the splice is cool enough that you can hold it with your bare hands, slide the heat shrink over the splice and shrink it using a heat gun. Of course, for more than one wire, solder them all, then heat shrink them all. Or wait for each individual wire to cool, I guess it\'s really up to you.\nHere are some pictures, I have all my good tools at work, so the way I did it is not entirely right. All I could find at home was needle nose pliers and sidecutters. You should really use wire strippers to strip the wires. The best set I have is Gardner-Bender that I got from Menards, they cost $14 and are better than my $40 Snap-on strippers. Lacking the proper tool, I used a very sharp knife and rolled the wire over the blade to cut the insulation and then pulled it off. That\'s a good way to cut yourself, and not always possible in a real-world scenario, so use the right tools! Having forgot my heat gun at work as well, I used a lighter, not the best way, as explained later.\nThese are some of the tools you need. Not pictured are wire strippers and a heat gun.\nA- Soldering iron set. This one cost about $75, but worth the investment for me. You can get a cheap electric one for about $7, but as always, you get what you pay for. Butane is also more expensive than electricity, but it heats up so much quicker that it\'s worth it. The heat is also infinitely adjustable, opposed to even the best electric that have only a few heat settings. That little can of butane cost $2.50 from a gas station... normally I buy big cans in bulk and get a can 4x that big for 1/2 the price but I also forgot to fill the soldering iron before I left work.\nB- Butane for the iron, not needed for electric, of course\nC- Wires to be soldered. Having forgot automotive wire too, this is part of an old power cord. Similar enough for a demonstration, just thicker insulation than typical automotive wire\nD- Needle nose pliers\nF- Heatshrink butt-connector\nG- Heatshrink tubing\nH- Electrical tape (won\'t be using it, but it was already sitting on my ""workbench"" when I started)\nI- Finished stereo adapter I made last summer\nThat black cap looking thing next to the electrical tape is the cap from the soldering iron\nHere I am holding the wire, so far so good!\nUsing a sharp knife to cut the insulation and pull it off. Don\'t use a knife! Always use the proper tool.\nThe wires are stripped and the strands flared out slightly\nFlared wires pushed together and flattened again.\nReady to solder the wires together. Note that I am resting the wires on the open needle nose pliers. This will (hopefully) prevent my improper work surface (upside-down plastic storage container) from melting or catching on fire! If soldering inside a vehicle, have something on the carpet to protect it from possible damage. A damp rag has always been sufficient for me.\nThe wires are now soldered together. I couldn\'t take a picture of the actual soldering because I need both hands for that.\nThe heatshrink is in place. Remember to slide it at least 4"" from the splice while soldering.\nThe heatshrink is now shrunk over the splice, keeping out any moisture that will cause corrosion.\nThat\'s all there is to soldering. Anyone with two hands can do it, but it may take a bit of practice on scrap wire before you dive into the real thing. Now, if you cannot solder the wire, here is the ""most proper"" way to use a heatshrink butt-connector:\nStrip about 1/4"" of insulation off the wire and twist the strands together tightly.\nHere is the heatshrink butt-connector, notice the heatshrink already around it.\nInsert the twisted strands into the butt-connector and crimp it using the crimping part of the wire strippers. Repeat with the other wire. I used pliers to ""crimp"" it, but I wouldn\'t trust that in a live circuit. Once you have both wires crimped, pull fairly hard to be sure the crimp is solid. You will be unable to pull the wires out if the crimp is good. If a wire pulls out, cut the connector out and try again.\nHere it is crimped and shrunk. Notice the melted part on the right side. That\'s because lacking a heat gun, I used a lighter. An open flame is not good for shrinking the tubing. This particular one has two layers of heatshrink. The outer layer is just regular heatshrink, but there is a glue-like inner layer that melts and fills in any gaps, such as if you had two wires going in one side. That is what you should do if you ever need to ""T"" into a wire, DO NOT use scotchlok connectors, they damage the original wire and provide no protection from corrosion.\n04-18-2009, 10:26 PM\nNow we just have to hope the people who come to ask use the search button =P.\nNice comparison though, to water. If they only knew how much more there actually is to it all\n04-19-2009, 01:14 AM\nThe what button? Sadly, I can\'t say I\'ve ever heard anyone ask how to solder anyway... it\'s easy money making a minimum of $32.15/hr fixing something that almost anyone could have soldered to begin with... everyone remember that when the proper tools seem too expensive. And that\'s my pay, the shop gets the other half. I just wish I could get 8 hours of work in a day. The message here: buy the tools, save money. Someone could have almost bought my nice butane soldering iron set for what they\'ll pay to have me fix it.\nI cannot take credit for the water analogy, I heard that from one of my electronics instructors. I started thinking about it more in-depth after he said that, and there\'s a surprising number of things that work until you get into transistors, logic gates or AC stuff. Switch=valve, diode=check valve, capacitor (in a DC circuit)=one of those vertical things that traps air to keep the pipes from banging when you shut the water off.\nI originally typed a bunch about ohms law, watts, and got more in depth on what\'s in the post. I figure what\'s there is all most people need to know for most things, and can easily research if they need more. I started out only writing about soldering only and then had to add on, then took a lot out when it started looking like a book. I\'m hoping people read it, not scroll though and decide not to :)\n04-19-2009, 11:59 AM\nExcellent post. You have demonstrated at length and with graphics what I have been preaching for years.\nThe only difference is that personally, I don\'t even trust the compression connections in the long term. I\'ve worked on far too many older vehicles, machine tools, and installations to have any faith in compression alone, except in HV installations. Even those are somewhat suspect, especially on aluminum and nickel. Cold flow happens, no matter the material. It occurs faster with aluminum and annealed copper, but happens to all materials eventually.\n04-19-2009, 10:11 PM\nThanks for bringing that up, I didn\'t mean to imply that I trust them, in fact you will never see one on any of my vehicles. Ultimately it\'s the customers decision, and when there\'s no room to get both hands in there without hundreds of dollars for removing part or all of the dashboard, they\'ll pick the cheap route every time. If I were the service writer that would change, but I\'m not. It\'s never an option except for underdash work. I haven\'t seen the heatshrink crimp connectors fail, I think the inner glue layer might hold the wires and reduce the cold flow by keeping tension off the conductor a bit :dunno:\n04-19-2009, 10:56 PM\nI tin both sides before butt soldering two wires together. In tight places this is my go to connection!\nI also like doing the twist and solder connection on easier to get to wiring jobs\nIf you use a self sealing butt connector make sure you see the ""ooz"" squeeze out the ends when you heat shrink them!\nAutomotive Network, Inc., Copyright ©2013', ""A hair dryer, or blow dryer, is a device that uses electric heat and forced convection to apply hot air to a mass of hair (usually on a human head) for the purposes of quickly drying it. Hair holds moisture well and takes a long time to dry on its own, unless assisted with a towel or a hair dryer.\nHair dryers are available in two basic designs with a great deal of variation seen in each one. The first, and older, design is a slightly cone-shaped hood attached to the back of a chair with a hinge or pivot, designed to fit over someone's head without making contact. Typically they will have a level switch, such as a mercury switch, which turns on the heater and fan when it is lowered over the head. These large and expensive machines are rarely seen outside of professional beauty salons, and are increasingly rare even there. The handheld design is much more popular.\nThe handheld hair dryer uses the same basic concept, an electric heater and fan, in a much smaller, cheaper, lightweight package. Although it does not dry the entire head at once, this is its major appeal. Using a smaller nozzle gives more control over the drying area, and varying the distance at which it is used helps control the temperature and force of the drying air. Also, by not covering the head, it allows access to the hair for brushing and shaping during the drying process. The standard design uses a pistol grip with one or two switches on the handle to control temperature and fan speed.\nRegardless of design, the basic principle is the same. Electricity is passed through a NiChrome wire, which heats the wire and thus the air around it. A fan behind the heater blows the hot air across the hair to facilitate drying, aiding evaporation. Brushing or combing the hair during this process also helps by increasing the affected surface area.\nThe heating wire has a low resistance so that a high current passes through it, which causes the heating, rated in Watts. The lower the wire's resistance, the higher the current and the more power is heating the wire. A 120 Volt, 1875 Watt hair dryer uses a 7.5 Ohm NiChrome wire to pull 15.5 Amps of current – enough to trip a standard 15A circuit breaker. The National Electrical Code requires 20A circuit breakers to be installed in bathrooms, where hair dryers are most likely to be used. The typical range for hair dryers available today is about 1200 Watts to 1875 Watts, although there is concern that higher powered hair dryers could cause damage to the hair and scalp. Temperature can be controlled with a switch which adds or removes more resistive wires to the circuit.\nThe chair mounted hair dryers are large and self-supporting, so they can use heavy AC motors to drive their fans. Handheld hair dryers must be lighter and use much smaller DC motors. Very small DC motors, however, complicate the process in two ways: the hair dryer is powered by a wall outlet, which is AC power and at a much higher voltage than the small DC motor requires. To reduce the voltage, the motor is put in the circuit with the resistive heating elements, which bleed off much of the voltage before it gets to the motor. Small diodes provide the AC to DC conversion. It should be noted that since the motor is in the circuit with the heating elements, adding more resistance to lower the temperature also lowers the available voltage to the fan motor, slowing it down.\nHair dryers can be dangerous because of the very hot resistive heating elements, the fan blades, and the high levels of current they require to operate, so a number of safety devices are built in to modern designs to make them safer. The heating wires are protected by a screen of some sort that will allow air to pass out but keep foreign objects, such as fingers, from coming into contact with the heating elements. Additionally, a thermal fuse is installed with the heating elements that will automatically cut off the power if the temperature gets too high. The fan motor which blows the hot air out of the hair dryer is protected by a screen or filter to prevent anything from clogging or becoming entangled in the fan blades. Finally, the latest models have a ground fault circuit interruptor unit built right in to the power cable so that any ground faults, such as those caused by dropping the hair dryer into the bathtub, will quickly shut off the power.\nEven with these safety features, it is best not to press your luck. I understand that an episode of the popular Discovery Channel series MythBusters recently confirmed that a hair dryer is capable of killing a person if dropped into a bathtub if the GFCI protection is missing, not working properly, or slow to cut off the power. Never use a hair dryer in or near standing water.\nA hair dryer is very similar to a heat gun, except that a heat gun operates at a dangerously high temperature and is not designed to be used on a person. Heat guns are typically used for heat shrinking things such as heatshrink tubing.""]"	['<urn:uuid:a1f88cdb-529e-4e45-8471-f4ad1d91e931>', '<urn:uuid:ff6025c4-bf1c-4a7e-acbd-05d12253c16d>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	6	98	3542

Students should be advised that delay in making their requirements known may result in services not being available on time. Depending on the situation, notification of the lecturer may be sufficient, but it may be necessary to notify the disability adviser or administration. Notification of disability is usually required if students seek reasonable adjustments to their educational program. Once the implications of the student\'s disability have been clarified you can discuss any adjustments to the course design or delivery that may be required.\nThe DDA Disability Standards for Education allow for detailed assessment that might include an independent expert assessment in order to determine what adjustments are necessary for a student. Students are generally required to demonstrate or supply certification of the functional implications of their disability (rather than the details of the disability itself) to inform the provision of support services and adjustments. This can then inform the development of a Learning Action Plan or similar tool.\nThe post-secondary institution should implement procedures to ensure that:\n- documentation is sought only when needed\n- verification processes are equitable\n- student privacy is protected\n- relevant information is subsequently disseminated (with student permission) to staff who need it; this assists in ensuring students are not required to repeat the verification process.\nIf there is an indication that a student may have a disability that is impacting on their studies, there may be the requirement to undertake reasonable adjustments. Reasonable adjustments refer to a “measure or action taken to assist a student with disability to participate in education and training on the same basis as other students”1. An adjustment is considered reasonable if it achieves this purpose while taking into account student\'s learning needs and balancing the interests of all parties affected including those of the student with disability, the education provider, staff and other students. The Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) through the Disability Standards for Education requires institutions to take reasonable steps to enable the student with a disability to participate in education on the same basis as a student without a disability. An adjustment is reasonable if it balances the interests of all parties affected.2\nReasonable adjustments can encompass a range of areas including the physical environment, teaching delivery and format, utilisation of assistance equipment and reduction of study load. They are based on reducing the impact of the student’s disability on their studies. Examples of adjustments include:\n- provision of information or course materials in accessible format, e.g. a text book in in braille\n- changes in teaching practices, e.g. wearing an FM microphone to enable a student to hear lectures\n- supply of specialised equipment or services, e.g. a notetaker for a student who cannot write\n- changes in lecture schedules and arrangements, e.g. relocating classes to an accessible venue\n- changes to course design, e.g. substituting an assessment task\n- modifications to physical environment, e.g. installing lever taps, building ramps, installing a lift\n- modifications to computer equipment in the library\nReasonable Adjustments and Assessments\nReasonable adjustments in the context of assessments should be made flexibly, as the result of negotiation between the teaching staff, disability service staff and the student, and in consideration of the following:\n- The impact the disability on the assessment\n- The nature of the assessment task, including the skills and abilities required\n- The nature of the course or subject; what skills and knowledge does the particular subject demand and in what ways does the student’s disability impact on their capacity to demonstrate them?\n- The student’s usual work methods which should be available during assessment activities\nThe aim is to ensure that there no other reasonable adjustments that would be less disruptive and intrusive and no less beneficial for the student. As a result, what constitutes ""reasonable"" varies on a case by case basis and the balance is sometimes difficult to strike. Alternative assessment minimises the impact of students’ disabilities on their performance and allows the marker to see beyond the disability to the student’s knowledge and skills. It is designed to place students with disability on a more equal footing, and not to give them any kind of advantage. These alternative assessment approaches are often more effective when they are offered to the whole class rather than just the student with disability, possibly as a ""smorgasbord"" from which the student is required to choose say three:\n- oral presentations or viva voce exams\n- additional assignments and coursework\n- dot-point assignments marked for content rather than for structure\n- multiple-choice questions\n- practical demonstrations or production of models or displays\n- class presentations or role plays\n- alternative or supplementary assignments such as taped interviews, slide presentations, photographic essays or hand-made models\n- a combination of any of the above\nAlternative assessment should aim to simultaneously respect the student’s learning needs, defend academic integrity, and promote equity and consistency for all. However, it is clear that education providers are not required to lower academic standards or disregard the needs staff or other students. In more complex cases discussion with the disability service will be useful. It may be useful to examine previous judgements in relation to the DDA.\nWhat if a student is not be able to meet the core course requirements?\nStudents should be given as much information as possible to enable them to make an informed decision about whether they can undertake a course with or without reasonable adjustments. Ensure that the core requirements are are clearly stated. This makes it easier to determine the reasonableness of any requests for adjustments that may be required.\nThe academic standards of the unit/course should not be lowered in order to accommodate the needs of any student but there is a requirement to be flexible in relation to the way in which it is delivered or assessed. The Disability Standards for Education requires institutions to take reasonable steps to enable the student with disability to participate in education on the same basis as a student without disability. An adjustment is reasonable if it balances the interests of all parties affected.\nAfter reasonable adjustments have been negotiated a student and/or teaching staff/disability practitioners may believe the student will be unable to participate successfully in a course due to the impact of their disability. In this situation, teaching staff should consult with disability practitioners so that the student can be advised of these concerns and may decide not to enrol in the course as a result. If the student decides to continue with the enrolment in this context, they may fail the course as a result of being unable to meet the course requirements, despite the provision of ‘reasonable adjustments’. The student may be able to complete an alternative course of study more appropriate to their abilities. Your organisation\'s disability service can assist in making this assessment.\nWhat if I believe a student will not be able to be registered or employed?\nIt is unlawful under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) for a post secondary education provider to refuse to admit a person to a course on the basis that the person is unlikely or unable to gain work because of their disability. A qualification may lawfully be withheld if the person’s disability means that inherent requirements of the profession or trade cannot be met3, but educational authorities are not permitted to pre-empt this. If the student’s enrolment raises legitimate safety concerns, the institutions policies may prevent the student from enrolling on that basis. Remember, it must be demonstrated that there has been have consultation with the student, all possible adjustments have been considered and expert assistance in coming to a decision has been sought.\nBecause of your knowledge of the profession you may be aware of limitations of opportunities for students with disability. It may be useful to discuss this with them and provide information that can help them make an informed decision about their future. The disability service may also assist the student to meet their career goals, and may know of other students with disability working in their chosen field illustrating the professional versatility and diversity of people with disability. If a student undertaking studies in a health field has an impairment (includes physical, mental and substance abuse or dependency) that affects or is likely to affect their ability to practice, there may be legal requirements regarding reporting and/or facilitating the safe practice of the student; it is best to undertake discussions with the Disability Services, faculty, registration body and student regarding this.\n1 Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) 2013.

25	home vs cruise diy towel animal craft supplies needed	For towel animals both at home and on cruises, you generally need bath towels and hand towels. A basic towel pig requires one bath towel, one hand towel, one washcloth, and decorative elements like eyes. Similarly, for cruise favorites like the towel elephant, you need one bath towel and one hand towel of the same color.	"['SUPPLIES NEEDED TO MAKE A TOWEL PIG\nOne bath towel, one hand towel, one washcloth, two eyes (paper, felt, googly eyes, whatever works for you.) Any other desired embellishments such as felt or paper nostrils.\nHOW TO FOLD A TOWEL PIG\nMaking the towel pig body\nStarting with the bath towel, make the standard towel animal body. Lay the towel out flat, and from the short sides roll each end to the middle. Start each roll with just a small amount of towel folded over. Make the rolls tight reasonably tight, but not so tight you won’t be able to pull the ends out of them later.\nFold the rolled towel in half, with the rolled part on the outside.\nPull the tips out of the end of each roll.\nHold the tips you just pulled out of the ends of the rolls with the two tips from one roll in one hand and the two tips from the other roll in the other hand. Pull all four at once until the rolls pull into legs and the towel becomes a body.\nPlace the body into a sitting position.\nHow to fold the towel pig’s tail\nUse the washcloth to make the towel pig’s tail. Start by folding the washcloth in half like a very sloppy triangle in which the end points totally missed each other.\nRoll from the straight end so the points end up on the outside of the roll.\nTuck one end of the tail under the body and position as desired.\nHow to fold the towel pig head\nNow comes the hard part for this towel animal, making a towel pig head. Use the hand towel for this step. First fold the towel in half crosswise (not too hard yet…)\nNext fold down the corners of the folded end so that end has a pointy tip.\nTuck a fair portion of the pointy tip down under the towel.\nNow it starts getting a bit harder. Roll in both sides to the middle.\nPick the towel up and turn it to see the other side. The pointy tip previously folded under will sort of resemble a pig snout at this point. Sculpt it a bit rounder with your hands until it actually looks like a pig snout.\nNow the really hard part. The back of the head has two rolls. Bring the top of each one over a bit toward the side of the head it is on, as those bits will become ears.\nThen fold both layers down to the snout at the middle. Sculpt the snout and ears as desired and place the head on the body.\nDecorate as desired.\nTo add more stability to the head if you want the pig to be easily transportable a safety pin or tape could be added to the back, or a pipe cleaner wrapped around it under the fold. Of course the tail isn’t attached either.\nClick link for a list of blogs with instructions on how to fold a variety of other towel animals.\nNext up in this series on how to fold towel animals is: Towel Elephant\nCopyright My Cruise Stories 2012', ""Towel animals are fun to fold and make cute surprises for visitors to your home. Once you learn how to make a few of these fun creatures, you are sure to impress your family and friends with them.\nTowel Origami Swan\nA towel swan is the perfect introduction to towel origami. To get started, you'll need a white bath towel, a white hand towel, and a smooth folding surface.\nSpread the bath towel out so one of the long sides is facing you. Start rolling the left and right sides of the towel towards the mid point of the towel.\nKeep rolling until you reach the middle of the towel. Rotate your shape 90 degrees.\nThe point becomes the beak of the swan. Gently shape the towel back on itself to make a swan shape. Roll the hand towel lengthwise. Fold it in half, and put it on top of the body of the swan. This provides the support needed to prop up the neck of your creation, which gives it a more realistic looking appearance. Without the extra towel, your swan is easily mistaken for a duck.\nFolded Towel Cat\nCat lovers will enjoy making this towel origami folded cat. You will need one bath towel and two hand towels. The towels should all be the same color.\nTo get started, open a large bath towel wide on the floor. From one of the shorter ends, begin to roll the towel up until you reach the center. Repeat with the other side, making tight rolls. They should meet in the center.\nHolding both rolls in your hands, turn the end closest to you under so the bottom third is underneath the rest of the length. This will be the body of your cat.\nPosition a hand towel in front of you so that the shorter edges are closest to your body. Fold it in half lengthwise. Begin to roll the towel into a cone shape, starting at the upper right hand corner and stopping about half of the way down the towel. Try to keep the roll as tight as possible.\nNext, take the unfolded edge and begin to roll it towards the center. Now, you should be rolling the towel towards the other roll. Continue to roll until they come together.\nPick up both rolls together and check that the hand towel is tightly rolled up. Position the cone shape with the large end down in between the rolls of the first towel. Position the cone at the end of the towel right above where you folded it under. This should help to hold it in place. This completes your cat's tail.\nTake a third bath towel and fold in half. Take the edge with the flaps and fold towards the middle. However, extend the fold about 2/3 of the way over. Pick up the towel by placing your fingers at both points on the edge, where you just folded it. This will allow the extra portion to fold back, behind the original fold.\nLay the towel on the floor again. Then pick up one of the corners and fold inward, creating a triangular shape. It should extend past the folded edge. You are creating the cat's ears here. Do the same thing on the opposite end.\nStart on one side of the towel and begin to roll towards the middle. Do the same on the other edge so that it meets in the middle. Pick up this third towel and tighten up the folds as necessary. Then, lay it on top of the first towel towards the middle. The ears should be pointing back towards the cone, which is the cat's tail.\nWhen completed, you end up with a cat that looks as though he is sitting with his front legs stretched out in front of him.\nA towel elephant is one of the most popular animals found on cruise lines and at luxury resorts. You will need one bath towel and one hand towel for this design. Both towels should be the same color.\nLay your bath towel out in front of you horizontally. Fold the left side over about six inches, then fold this folded end over another six inches. Repeat this process on the right side. This step is important because it creates the weight at the bottom of your elephant's feet, which is needed to make your finished model stand upright.\nRoll the top and bottom ends in towards the middle so you have a long scroll shape.\nFold this shape in half and stand it upright to make your elephant's legs. The flat side of the towel should be facing inward.\nPosition the hand towel in front of you horizontally. Roll the left and right rides in to the middle at an angle in the same way you did to form the base of your towel origami swan. This will form the head and trunk of your elephant.\nFlip the rolled towel over. Turn the pointed end up to make a trunk for your elephant. Fold the top layer of the end with the two rolls down to form a face for the elephant.

26	What are the key differences between straddles and futures contracts in terms of obligations and risk management, and how do they function as investment tools?	Straddles and futures contracts have distinct characteristics in terms of obligations and risk management. A straddle is an options strategy where a trader takes simultaneous put and call positions with the same expiration date and strike price, with no obligation to execute either option. In a long straddle, the maximum loss is limited to the cost of the two trades while potential profit is unlimited. Futures contracts, on the other hand, create an obligation where the buyer must purchase the asset at the specified future date and price (long position), and the seller must deliver at the specified price (short position). Futures operate through a clearing house system that guarantees delivery by requiring margin payments.	['What are Straddles?\nThere will always be situations in the financial markets when a trader knows that there will be a period when prices of underlying assets will experience either an upside or downside breakout, but the dilemma is: in what direction will this occur? A trader may bank on an asset heading upwards only for it to tank, or he may be bearish on the asset only for the asset to surge northwards with the strength of a bull. It is situations like this in the options market that call for the deployment of the straddle option. To straddle means to have one foot on either side of a reference point.\nSo to define a straddle option, it is an options strategy in which the trader takes a simultaneous put and call position, in the same financial instrument, with the same expiration date/time, and with the same strike price. This is different from a “strangle”, where the strike prices are different for the put and call options.\nThere are two variations of the straddle trade.\na) The trader can buy the put and call option, in which case, this is a long straddle.\nb) The trader can sell the put and call option; the short straddle.\nFor the purpose of illustration, we will base our trade example on the long straddle.\nFor this trade example, we have our stock XY, which is trading at $40 a share. Our trader, Mr John, purchases a long straddle put option contract at $100 ($1/share) at a strike price of $40, and a call option at $100 ($1/share) at a strike price of $40.\n– Long 1 XY 40 Put @ $1 per share ($100)\n– Long 1 XY 40 Call @ $1 per share ($100)\nThe net debit on this trade is the cost of the trade contracts, which is $200.\nIf the price of XY rallies to $50 on expiration, the put option will expire worthless, while the call option will expire in-the-money with a value of $10 per share (new price – strike price or 50 – 40) or $1000 for the contract. The trader will make a profit of $800.\nThe trader’s maximum profit is unlimited. Further increases in the price of the asset will increase the profits of the trader.\nThe maximum loss is restricted to $200 which is the cost of the two trades to John. So if the stock is unchanged at $40 on expiration, both the call and put options will expire worthless and John’s loss is limited to the $200 that was the combined cost of both trades.\nTwo break-even points exist at the following points:\n– Upper Breakeven Point = $45 + $2 (long call strike price + net debit) = $47\n– Lower Breakeven Point = $35 – $2 (long put strike price – net debit) = $33\nIf you are trading this option type, you can effectively play this by using a strategy that can predict breakouts. If you can use technical analysis tools such as pivot points to predict breakouts, then you could apply it to trade the strangle option. If the trader is able to get this right, then he will smile to the bank on payday.', 'UK Financial Services, regulations and ethics\n3.2 Financial services products - derivatives\nIn this section, we describe certain derivatives and consider their potential usage.\nDerivatives can be used either as a tool to red...\nShortened demo course.

For preparation, candidates should practice similar tests, brush up on numeracy and English skills through resources like BBC Skillswise, and familiarize themselves with different test types (numerical, verbal, non-verbal). During tests, work quickly but accurately, don't get stuck on single questions, and make educated guesses if running out of time. Poor preparation and test anxiety can significantly affect performance - studies show test anxiety affects grades of 45% of students and can lead to physical symptoms like increased heartbeat and stomach upset. However, with proper preparation and a calm mindset, performance can improve.

Try our on-line practice tests to gain familiarity. Make sure you are in a quiet place where you won\'t be disturbed and in a good frame of mind. If the test was taken unsupervised on the web you may be asked to sit a short test at interview to check you didn\'t get someone else to do it for you! Listen to the instructions and follow them precisely. Many people make errors because they\'ve misunderstood what they have to do. Check the time limit and the number of questions you have to answer in that time. Often there will be a lot of questions in a short time. Work quickly but pay attention to accuracy. Try not to get bogged down on one question: leave it until the end of the test, but remember that questions often get harder as you proceed. Don\'t panic if you can\'t complete the test as not everyone will be able to: most candidates find these tests hard! Do try to answer as many questions as possible though: you can only score points for questions you answer! If you have time left at the end, check your answers. Don\'t worry about worrying: you\'ll do your best if your adrenalin is flowing! But try to stay calm and focused and try to enjoy the experience.\nMore tips! Practice makes perfect. Some practice of similar tests may improve your performance by 5% on actual tests but don\'t spend too long practising. Brush up on your exam technique and become familiar with the types of test you may face. Before the actual test, you will be given practice examples to try: study these carefully and ask questions if anything is unclear. Get a good night\'s sleep, plan your journey to the test site, arrive on time and appropriately dressed. Tiredness and alcohol can affect your ability to do well! Take a calculator with you: many maths tests now allow a calculator. If so you will be given one, but may be allowed to use your own. Educated guesses are worthwhile if you are running out of time. In multiple choice tests, you may be able to quickly rule out obviously wrong answers and concentrate on those that are left. In maths tests you may be able to estimate the answer rather than working it out precisely, to save time. If you haven\'t done any maths since school then brush up on your numeracy. Try BBC Skillswise Practice your multiplication and division, ability to calculate percentages and rations, and to read graphs and tables. Similarly if your English is weak brush up on this.BBC Skillswise\nIf youre poor at tests …. Remember that few employers will look at test results on their own and will also look at you academic performance and personality. Some large companies and most smaller companies dont use tests – apply to these! Numerical scores can sometimes be much improved by practice. Others are harder to improve significantly.

It was so easy, quick and I learned a lot. Without realising, you have finished the course and have already put together a very good CV and covering letter. It really blew my mind with some ideas Ive never known before, such as portfolio working and working from home. I never thought about obtaining happiness from my work before. It would be mad to apply for a job or attend an interview without doing it! Before the course I had only a vague idea of my career path and opportunities. Now I am applying for summer internships and know how to effectively sell my skills to a prospective employer and have a much more focused plan for my future. The module is very, very useful! I really love how it makes you to think about your personality and helps you to identify your strengths and weaknesses. I found the module to be highly thought-provoking as it really encouraged me to consider how my degree will benefit my future and what I can be doing now to improve my graduate employment prospects. I enjoyed the depth of the module. It went far beyond some general tips on how to write a good CV and prepare for an interview. Rather it went in to detail about the whole process of graduate job search from the beginning to the end. It was very instructive. The amount of time put into this is astounding! I actually spoke to friends from other universities who said they wished they had something like this. It has made me feel a lot more confident when it comes to applications and interviews and has also made me think about skills that I didn\'t think I had before.

In such cases, it may be possible to move the employee to lighter duties, with appropriate retraining where necessary. Similarly, high-pressure, stressful work, even where it does not involve physical activity, should also be avoided.

It is an experience that is marked with a feeling of stressthat is manifested by symptoms like sweating, shaking, increasedheart beat, stomach upset as well as headaches. Regardless of thestudent’s level, anxiety is a serious problem that can affect theperformance of a student. There are various causes of test anxietywhich ranges from lack of proper preparation before an exam, previousexperience of failure and most importantly fear of failure. Theeffects of test anxiety are so serious that it affects a hugepercentage of students and affect their achievement significantly. Assuch there are concerns about this phenomenon not only in the UnitedStates but all over the world. Different approaches have been put inplace to deal with the phenomenon of test anxiety. Among the measuresthat students can take include studying ahead of exams, having apositive attitude towards exams, joining peer groups for motivationas well as guidance and counseling. These measures assist in boostingthe students’ self esteem and improve their understanding on whatleads them to anxiety during tests. This paper will focus on thecauses of test anxiety and the solutions towards the problem.\nTest anxiety is a feeling of stress or disturbance, which comes inform of sweating, shaking, stomach upsets, increased heartbeat, andheadaches (Freeman, Gittins, Pugh, Antley, Slater, & Dunn, 2008). In this case, students experience “butterflies in the stomach”which is a colloquial term for anxious reactions before taking atest. Text anxiety is common among students and happens even amongstthe most experienced ones from high school to college (Cizek& Burg, 2006). The paper explains the essentialityof the need to have an understanding of the causes of test anxietyand ways of reducing the nervous reactions that students experiencebefore taking tests.\nText anxiety can be either physical or mental depending on thereaction of an individual. In most cases, the mental state of thestudent affects their physical composition, which in turn results insubstandard performance or examination failure. Experts state that,there are many causes of test anxiety which differ according to thenature of the test, individual student and class environment. Assuch, parents, teachers, and students need to learn about the causesof anxious reactions towards examinations and their overallimplications on a student’s grades (Freeman et al., 2008).\nCauses of Test Anxiety\nFear of Failure\nNotably, one of the common causes of text anxiety is the fear offailure. Some students do not react well to taking tests despitetheir level of excellence or understanding of the topic at hand.Research shows that anxious reactions affect the grades of 45% ofstudents who take tests in the United States before the examination.For instance, tests account for almost 60% of a student’s overallgrade. Hence, if students fail their midterm exam or final exam, itmay have a significant impact on their overall performance. Studentsoften face anxiety a night before their exams because their gradesdetermine their acceleration to the next class. Hence, if teachers donot prepare their students on how to approach different tests, theyare prone to experience anxious reactions, which have a long-termeffect on their studies (Cizek& Burg, 2006).\nLack of Preparedness\nAnotherissue that influences test anxiety is the lack of preparedness forthe test. In most cases, students are aware of the contents, topics,and focus of the examination owing to their knowledge of the subjectcurriculum. While this serves as an advantage, some students mayrealize that they are not good particularly in Mathematics, History,Chemistry, and English topics. In turn, when students take a lastminute look at their class readings, assignments, and class books,they realize that they are not well prepared for the test.\nHistory of Failure\nSome students develop a pattern of failing exams owing to earlierexperiences. As a result, they get a negative attitude towardsexaminations. This issue affects students in that they get a lowself-esteem and a negative perception of examinations. This habitplaces students in a compromising situation whereby they do not knowhow to approach reading, test taking, and passing exams (Cizek& Burg, 2006).\nSolutions to Test Anxiety\nThemain solution involves reading in advance on topics that studentsfind challenging and difficult. Secondly, students who have a historyof failure should join groups of peers who have positive attitudetowards exams. This will improve their self-esteem and have an easiertime approaching reading and studying periods. Lastly, studentsshould get counseling from their teachers and students in higherlevels who have experienced the same issue. This will help themidentify the underlying cause of test anxiety and the appropriatesolution for solving the issue (Freeman et al., 2008).\nCizek, G. J.,& Burg, S. S.

28	ancient maya ruins space tech preservation methods	NASA and university scientists use space-based remote sensing technology to uncover Maya ruins in Guatemala by detecting chemical signatures of ancient building materials. These ruins are typically hidden by dense rainforest canopy, with trees 60-100 feet tall obscuring structures. Meanwhile, modern preservation efforts at sites like El Pilar Archaeological Reserve focus on maintaining traditional Maya forest garden techniques, which sustained larger populations than modern agriculture.	"['23 February 2006\nNASA, University Scientists Uncover Lost Maya Ruins from Space\nScience team will refine remote sensing tools to find other ancient sites\nWashington -- NASA and university scientists are using space- and aircraft-based remote-sensing technology to uncover Mayan ruins in Guatemala using the chemical signature of the civilization’s ancient building materials, NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center announced February 15.\nA chemical signature refers to the unique collection of chemicals that makes up a specific substance. Like a fingerprint, a chemical signature differentiates one material from another.\nRemains of the ancient Maya culture, mysteriously destroyed at the height of its reign in the ninth century, have been hidden in the rain forests of Central America for more than 1,000 years.\nNASA archaeologist Tom Sever and scientist Dan Irwin, both from NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, are teaming with William Saturno, an archaeologist at the University of New Hampshire, to find the ruins of the ancient culture.\nUnder a NASA Space Act Agreement with the University of New Hampshire, a science team will visit Guatemala every year through 2009, with the support of the Guatemalan Institute of Anthropology and History and the Department of Pre-Hispanic Monuments.\nThe team will verify its research and continue refining their remote sensing tools to help lead explorers to other ancient ruins and conduct Earth science research in the region.\n“From the air, everything but the tops of very few surviving pyramids are hidden by the tree canopy,” said Sever, a pioneer in the use of aerospace remote sensing for archaeology.\n“On the ground,” he added, “the 60- to 100-foot [18- to 30.5-meter] trees and dense undergrowth can obscure objects as close as 10 feet [3 meters] away. Explorers can stumble right through an ancient city that once housed thousands and never even realize it.”\nSever has explored the capacity of remote sensing technology and the science of collecting information about the Earth’s surface using aerial or space-based photography to serve archeology.\nHe and Irwin gave Saturno high-resolution commercial satellite images of the rain forest, and collected data from NASA’s Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar, an instrument flown aboard a high-altitude weather plane that can penetrate clouds, snow and forest canopies.\nThe resulting Earth observations have helped the team survey an uncharted region around San Bartolo, Guatemala. They discovered a link between the color and reflectivity of the vegetation in the images -- their signature -- and the location of known archaeological sites.\nThe Mayan civilization once extended to parts of what is now Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and most of Guatemala and Belize.\nFrom the third century to the ninth century, Maya civilization produced temples and pyramids, highly accurate calendars, mathematics and hieroglyphic writing and a complex social and political order.\nBut mounting archeological evidence indicates that the once vast Mayan civilization, with 10 million citizens throughout Mesoamerica a thousand years ago, might have collapsed due to colossal environmental problems.\n""The Maya had totally destroyed their forests,"" Irwin explains. ""That deforestation and local climatic conditions, we believe, led to such a severe drought that ... the entire Maya culture disappeared in just a few years.""\nThe more we know about the plight of the Maya, he added, “the better our chances of avoiding something similar.”\nAnother aspect of the research involved using climate models to determine the effects of Maya-driven deforestation on ancient Mesoamerican climate.\nThe goal was to determine whether deforestation can lead to droughts and if the activities of the ancient Maya drove the environmental changes that undermined their civilization.\nExtending benefits of remote-sensing technologies is part of NASA’s Earth-Sun System Division. NASA is conducting a long-term research effort to learn how natural and human-induced changes affect the global environment, and to provide critical benefits to society today.\nSever and Irwin conduct research at the National Space Science and Technology Center in Alabama, a cooperative science venture between NASA’s Marshall Center, Alabama universities, industry and federal agencies.\nAdditional information is available National Space Science and Technology Center Web site.\n(Distributed by the Bureau of International Information Programs, U.S. Department of State. Web site: http://usinfo.state.gov', 'Learning from the Ancients\nGazing at the famous Mayan pyramids of Chichén-Itzá, it’s hard not to be mesmerized by the colossal limestone structures rising out of an expansive green lawn. It makes for a great photo, although the scene is missing a key feature from when those pyramids rose: a tropical rainforest canopy.\nIn fact, that absent forest is the focal point of the widely accepted theory explaining the Maya’s downfall.\nTo the majority of archaeologists, anthropologists and Maya scholars, the collapse of the Maya civilization 1,000 years ago is best summed up by three words: slash and burn. According to the prevailing wisdom, by laying bare the resource-rich rainforests of the Yucatan Peninsula, the most advanced civilization in the Western Hemisphere destroyed its lifeblood, initiating a downward spiral of chronic food shortages that sent this once flourishing culture to its demise.\nThis thesis was a central part of UCLA scientist Jared Diamond’s bestseller, Collapse, which considers the Maya example — as well as the Anasazi, Easter Islanders and even the Vikings — an ecological warning for our civilization as it contemplates ecocide.\nBut Anabel Ford, an archaeologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, has an alternate view of the Maya experience. Writing in the Journal of Ethnobiology last fall, Ford and colleague Ronald Nigh suggest that the deforestation normally attributed to human agricultural practices is best explained by periods of alternating drought and floods. As evidence they point to local pollen and soil data they collected.\nAccording to Ford, not only did the Maya not raze the forests, they adapted to the climate by changing the vegetation’s makeup to enhance the productivity of certain plants. Ford argues that what was “previously interpreted as evidence of the Maya denuding the forest, can be reinterpreted as evidence of forest management in the form of the Maya Forest Garden.”\nEver since discovering the ancient city of El Pilar in 1983, Ford has been on a crusade to debunk the idea that the forest was most useful to the Maya when it was cleared for open farmland.\n“There was this notion that if you’re against cutting and burning, you’re just not going to survive. You’ve gotta cut or you’ve gotta burn. You’ve got to mark your space if you’re a human being living there,” says the director of the university’s MesoAmerican Research Center.\nFord prefers “select and grow.” The idea had been in her mind for some time but rose to the surface five years ago after heavy rains caused her personal forest garden to explode in growth.\n“That ’select and grow’ idea is so simple,” Ford says. “You see a tree with big green fruits (we call it avocado now) and you see another one with thorns, which would you choose? Just think logically.”\nUnlike the irrigated, industrialized farms of today, the Maya forest garden was a “tree-dominated agricultural field” cultivated to produce species able to sustain a diversity of human needs including food, shelter and medicine.\nFord’s simple yet elegant hypothesis is supported by local botanists and ecologists who point out that 90 percent of the plants in this forest are still useful.\nYou won’t need a time machine, just a sturdy vehicle, to see a forest garden in action today; one’s been developed at El Pilar Archaeological Reserve for Maya Flora and Fauna, an archaeological site on the Guatemala-Belize border.\nFord has said that at its peak, between A.D. 600 and 900, El Pilar — the name refers to a watering basin and reflects the unusual amount of groundwater in the vicinity — was home to at least 20,000. Inspired by that precedent and by drawing from the vast knowledge of modern-day Maya farmers, Ford’s nonprofit Exploring Solutions Past — Maya Forest Alliance is helping to halt deforestation and the expansion of ploughed fields and cattle pastures pushing deeper into the forest.\nA key component of the practice is known as “milpa,” a four-stage, 20-year agricultural cycle. At first, a section of forest is cleared to cultivate a low canopy of maize, beans and squash over herbs, tubers and other plants, which help reduce pests and enhance moisture retention. After two to three years, it gets replaced by quick-growing fruit trees like papaya and plantain, followed by slower growers like avocado, mango and citrus. When the fruit trees mature five years later, hardwood trees like cedar and mahogany are planted along side them, ultimately returning the land to its former glory.\nThis technique certainly is no quick fix, but Ford’s research has found that the ancient’s forest management practices succeeded in sustaining three to nine times the number of people as modern agriculture. This suggests that beyond serving as an example for the local communities of the Yucatan, the forest garden offers a conservation model for the rest of the world\nIn a world facing food and water crises, species loss and resource depletion, Ford says it’s just not enough to pin all our hopes on genetic engineering and other high-tech answers. Ford isn’t anti-technology, but believes our ultimate survival requires considering all the ways human beings have dealt with challenges to their existence.\n“The Maya offer a proven strategy completely different from the Western industrial mono crop technology. They have achieved a sustainable land-use system, demonstrating an agricultural approach that functions in accordance with nature — an alternative to the human-centered perspective — one that works with natural systems to produce a bounty of food and embraces conservation. And this is a system that underwrote the Maya civilization and survived 500 years after the Spanish conquest. What more reason do we need?”\nIn fact, there is one thing — a project launched by Ford herself, which may prove equally significant. In 1998, Ford managed to convince the governments of Belize and Guatemala to establish a peace park in the 5,000-acre El Pilar Archaelogical Reserve, a parcel of land that bridges their shared border – a line that’s been in dispute since the 1700s,\nThanks to her extensive lobbying with representatives of the two countries — she was named an associate laureate in the 2000 Rolex Awards for her efforts — Ford succeeded in getting both parties to sign an agreement in October 2008 promising to collaborate in the management of the park. The world’s first archaelogical peace park, El Pilar is a metaphor for collaboration — that might can inspire similar actions in other countries.\n“We tend to look to science to resolve current problems, but research cannot afford to ignore past successes when our world’s fate is at stake,” Ford says. “The El Pilar peace park would honor the one resource common to both nations – peace through archaeology.”\nWhat do you think?

29	Do both areas face threats from logging?	Yes, both regions face threats from logging. In Chimalapas, the area needs a Sustainable Forest Management Plan to avoid deforestation and over-extraction of natural resources. In Sierra Gorda, illegal logging is a threat that has led to land purchases for conservation, with over 3,500 hectares being purchased over 12 years to protect from loggers.	['Biodiversity conservation in the indigenous Chimalapas region, Oaxaca, Mexico\nBy Pronatura, Fri, 21/05/2010 - 14:24\nThe forests of the Santa Maria Chimalapas region, Oaxaca, Mexico are one of the most important areas for biodiversity in Mexico. Pronatura, the BirdLife Partner for Mexico, is working with local people to improve livelihoods while conserving biodiversity. By working with two indigenous communities with rights to the lands (San Miguel and Santa Maria Chimalapas) the project established a “community conserved area” for the forests. Through negotiations with the communities a consensus was reached to conserve 2,500 ha of tropical forest in Arroyo Pato, which is part of the Santa Maria Chimalapas community. The Arroyo Pato community was provided with advice and technical assistance on sustainable forest management activities in a further 25,000 ha. This provides a sound basis for the conservation of the globally important biodiversity in this area. A Sustainable Forest Management Plan will avoid the deforestation and gradual and consistent over-extraction of natural resources that has characterised previous patterns of use. Residents of Arroyo Pato were very active in the design of the management plan for their forest areas and will be the main stakeholders in their use and future management and decision-making. The forest contributes directly to the economy of local communities, and the conservation and management plans produced provide a basis for sustainable development, through harvesting of forest products (timber and non-timber) in the long term. This is significant since the area is classified nationally within Mexico as highly marginal in terms of its development status. This plan promotes sustainable use while maintaining the forest cover in the long term, with all the benefits inherent to biodiversity and environmental services. Most significant among these is water provision: “Water inflitration in the forest feeds the hydrological system that provides water not only to the communities of the whole Zoque Forest region for their own consumption, agriculture, cattle raising, forestry, etc., but also contributes greatly to the recharge of aquifers due to its location at the head of the hydrological basin. This water is used by communities, towns and cities in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Oaxaca and the Valley of Uxpanapa, Veracruz” (Claudia Macias Caballero, Project Manager). The project and the processes it has initiated is helping to address the lack of participation in decision-making that people in the area have suffered for many years - a result of centralised decision-making and the communities’ relative isolation and distance from the regional capital of Santa Maria Chimalapas where the local authorities and decision-makers are located. Biodiversity at Santa Maria Chimalapas The forests of the Santa Maria Chimalapas region, Oaxaca, Mexico are one of the most important areas for biodiversity protection in Mexico. To date 3,500 species of vascular plants, and 609 species of terrestrial vertebrates (99 mammals, 220 birds, 37 reptiles, 8 amphibians and 51 fish) have been recorded. The forest plays an important role as a stop-over and wintering site for neotropical birds that breed in North America, and it hosts several species deemed to be of “extreme importance” at the continental level, such as Wood Thrush, Kentucky and Worm-eating Warblers. 22 May 2010 - International Day for Biological Diversity This year’s International Day for Biological Diversity theme of “Biodiversity for Development and Poverty Alleviation” is a reminder of the unique contribution of biodiversity to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.

30	french germany partnership postwar europe impact	France made a historic act of reconciliation by forging the Franco-German partnership, which became the foundation of unity and stability in modern Western Europe.	"['Mr. President, distinguished Deputies, representatives of the people of France, it is a high honor for me to be invited here, along with my wife and our distinguished Ambassador, Pamela Harriman, to share with you this occasion. There is between our two peoples a special kinship. After all, our two republics were born within a few years of each other. Overthrowing the rule of kings, we enthroned in their places common ideals: equality, liberty, community, the rights of man.\nFor two centuries, our nations have given generously to each other. France gave to our Founders the ideas of Montesquieu and Rousseau. And then Lafayette and Rochambeau helped to forge those ideas into the reality of our own independence. For just as we helped to liberate your country in 1944, you helped to liberate our country two full centuries ago.\nYour art and your culture have inspired countless Americans for that entire time, from Benjamin Franklin to John and Jacqueline Kennedy. In turn, we lent to you the revolutionary genius of Thomas Jefferson, the fiery spirit of Thomas Paine, and the lives of so many of our young men when Europe\'s liberty was most endangered.\nThis week you have given us yet another great gift in the wonderful commemorations of the Allied landings at Normandy. I compliment President Mitterrand and all the French people for your very generous hospitality. I thank especially the thousands of French families who have opened their homes to our veterans.\nYesterday\'s sights will stay with me for the rest of my life: the imposing cliffs of Pointe du Hoc, the parade of our Allied forces on Utah Beach, the deadly bluffs at bloody Omaha, the rows upon rows of gravestones at our cemetery at Colleville.\nD-Day was the pivot point of the 20th century. It began Europe\'s liberation. In ways great and small, the Allied victory proved how democracy\'s faith in the individual saved democracy itself. From the daring of the French Resistance to the inventiveness of the soldiers on Omaha Beach, it proved what free nations can accomplish when they unite behind a great and noble cause.\nThe remarkable unity among the Allies during World War II, let us face it, reflected the lifeor-death threat facing freedom. Democracies of free and often unruly people are more likely to rally in the face of that kind of danger. But our challenge now is to unite our people around the opportunities of peace, as those who went before us united against the dangers of war.\nOnce in this century, as your President so eloquently expressed, following World War I, we failed to meet that imperative. After the Armistice, many Americans believed our foreign threats were gone. America increasingly withdrew from the world, opening the way for high tariffs, for trade wars, for the rise to fascism and the return of global war in less than 20 years.\nAfter World War II, America, France, and the other democracies did better. Led by visionary statesmen like Truman and Marshall, de Gaulle, Monnet, and others, we reached out to rebuild our allies and our former enemies, Germany, Italy, and Japan, and to confront the threat of Soviet expansion and nuclear power. Together, we founded NATO, we launched the Marshall plan, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and other engines of economic development. And in one of history\'s great acts of reconciliation, France reached out to forge the Franco-German partnership, the foundation of unity and stability in modern Western Europe. Indeed, the members of the European Union have performed an act of political alchemy, a magical act that turned rubble into renewal, suspicion into security, enemies into allies.\nNow we have arrived at this century\'s third moment of decision. The cold war is over. Prague, Warsaw, Kiev, Riga, Moscow, and many others stand as democratic capitals, with leaders elected by the people. We are reducing nuclear stockpiles, and America and Russia no longer aim their nuclear missiles at each other. Yet once again, our work is far from finished. To secure this peace, we must set our sights on a strategic star. Here, where America and our allies fought so hard to save the world, let that star for both of us, for Americans and for Europeans alike, be the integration and strengthening of a broader Europe.\nIt is a mighty challenge. It will require resources. It will take years, even decades. It will require us to do what is very difficult for democracies, to unite our people when they do not feel themselves in imminent peril to confront more distant threats and to seize challenging and exciting opportunities. Yet, the hallowed gravestones we honored yesterday speak to us clearly. They define the price of failure in peacetime. They affirm the need for action now.\nWe can already see the grim alternative. Militant nationalism is on the rise, transforming the healthy pride of nations, tribes, religious and ethnic groups into cancerous prejudice, eating away at states and leaving their people addicted to the political painkillers of violence and demagoguery, and blaming their problems on others when they should be dedicated to the hard work of finding real answers to those problems in reconciliation, in power-sharing, in sustainable development. We see the signs of this disease from the purposeful slaughter in Bosnia to the random violence of skinheads in all our nations. We see it in the incendiary misuses of history and in the anti-Semitism and irredentism of some former Communist states. And beyond Europe, we see the dark future of these trends in mass slaughter, unbridled terrorism, devastating poverty, and total environmental and social disintegration.\nOur transatlantic alliance clearly stands at a critical point. We must build the bonds among nations necessary for this time, just as we did after World War II. But we must do so at a time when our safety is not directly threatened, just as after World War I. The question for this generation of leaders is whether we have the will, the vision, and yes, the patience to do it.\nLet me state clearly where the United States stands. America will remain engaged in Europe. The entire transatlantic alliance benefits when we, Europe and America, are both strong and engaged. America wishes a strong Europe, and Europe should wish a strong America, working together.\nTo ensure that our own country remains a strong partner, we are working hard at home to create a new spirit of American renewal, to reduce our budget deficits, to revive our economy, to expand trade, to make our streets safer from crime, to restore the pillars of our American strength, work and family and community, and to maintain our defense presence in Europe.\nWe also want Europe to be strong. That is why America supports Europe\'s own steps so far toward greater unity, the European Union, the Western European Union, and the development of a European defense identity. We now must pursue a shared strategy, to secure the peace of a broader Europe and its prosperity. That strategy depends upon integrating the entire continent through three sets of bonds: first, security cooperation; second, market economics; and third, democracy.\nTo start, we must remain strong and safe in an era that still has many dangers. To do so we must adapt our security institutions to meet new imperatives. America has reduced the size of its military presence in Europe, but we will maintain a strong force here. The EU, the WEU, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and other organizations must all play a larger role. I was pleased that NATO recently approved an American proposal to allow its assets to be used by the WEU. To foster greater security cooperation all across Europe, we also need to adapt NATO to this new era.\nAt the NATO summit in January, we agreed to create the Partnership For Peace in order to foster security cooperation among NATO allies and the other states of Europe, both former Warsaw Pact countries, states of the former Soviet Union, and states not involved in NATO for other reasons. And just 6 months later, this Partnership For Peace is a reality. No less than 19 nations have joined, and more are on the way. Russia has expressed an interest in joining.\nThe Partnership will conduct its first military exercises this fall. Imagine the transformation: Troops that once faced each other across the Iron Curtain will now work with each other across the plains of Europe.\nWe understand the historical anxieties of Central and Eastern Europe. The security of those states is important to our own security. And we are committed to NATO\'s expansion. At the same time, as long as we have the chance, the chance to create security cooperation everywhere in Europe, we should not abandon that possibility anywhere.\nThere are signs that such an outcome may be possible. Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus have now committed to eliminate all the nuclear weapons on their soil. And by this August we may well see all Russian troops withdrawn from Eastern Europe and the Baltics for the first time since the end of World War II.\nDo these developments guarantee that we can draw all the former Communist states into the bonds of peaceful cooperation? No. But we would fail our own generation and those to come if we did not try.\nDo these arrangements mean we can solve all the problems? No, at least not right away. The most challenging European security problem and the most heartbreaking humanitarian problem is, of course, Bosnia. We have not solved that problem, but it is important to recognize what has been done, because France, the United States, Great Britain, and others have worked together through the United Nations and through NATO. Look what has been done. First, a determined and so far successful effort has been made to limit that conflict to Bosnia, rather than having it spread into a wider Balkan war. Second, the most massive humanitarian airlift in history has saved thousands of lives, as has the UNPROFOR mission, in which France has been the leading contributor of troops. We have prevented the war from moving into the air. We have seen an agreement between the Bosnian Muslims and the Croats. Progress has been made.\nWhat remains to be done? Today the United Nations has put forward the proposal by Mr. Akashi for a cessation of hostilities for a period of several months. The United States supports this program; France supports this proposal. We must do all we can to get both sides to embrace it.\nThen, the contact group is working on a map which can be the basis of a full and final cessation of hostilities there. We must do all we can, once all parties have been heard from, to secure that agreement.\nAnd finally, let us not forget what has happened to make that more likely, and that is that Russia has been brought into the process of attempting to resolve this terrible crisis in what so far has been a very positive way, pointing the way toward a future in which we may all be able to work together to solve problems like this over a period of time. We must be patient. We must understand that we do not have total control of events within every nation. But we have made progress in Bosnia, and we must keep at it, working together, firmly together, with patience and firmness, until the job is done. We can do this if we stay together and work together.\nThe best way to sustain this sort of cooperation is to support the evolution of Europe across the board. We must also have an economic dimension to this. We must support Europe\'s East in their work to integrate into the thriving market democracies. That brings me to the second element of our strategy of integration. Integration requires the successful transition to strong market economies all across broader Europe.\nToday, the former Communist states face daunting transitions. Our goal must be to help them succeed, supporting macroeconomic reforms, providing targeted assistance to privatization, increasing our bonds of trade and investment. That process invariably will proceed slowly and, of course, unevenly. It will depend in part on what happens within those countries. We have seen voters in former Communist states cast ballots in a protest against reform and its pain. Yet as long as these states respect democratic processes, we should not react with too much alarm. The work of reform will take years and decades.\nDespite many problems the economic reforms in Europe\'s East have still been impressive. Russia\'s private sector now employs 40 percent of the work force, and 50 million Russians have become shareholders in privatizing companies. In Prague last January, I said the West needed to support such reforms by opening our markets as much as possible to the exports of those nations. For if our new friends are not able to export their goods, they may instead export instability, even against their own will.\nWe can also support other reforms by stimulating global economic growth. One of the most important advances toward that goal in recent years has been the new GATT agreement. It will create millions of jobs. France played an absolutely pivotal role in bringing those talks to fruition. I know it was a difficult issue in this country. I know it required statesmanship. I assure you it was not an easy issue in the United States. We have issues left to resolve. But now that we have opened the door to history\'s most sweeping trade agreement, let us keep going until it is done. My goal is for the United States Congress to ratify the GATT agreement this year and to pursue policies through the G-7 that can energize all our economies.\nWe have historically agreed among the G-7 nations that we will ask each other the hard questions: What can we do to promote economic growth and job creation? What kind of trade policies are fair to the working people of our countries? How can we promote economic growth in a way that advances sustainable development in the poorer countries of the world so that they do not squander their resources and, in the end, assure that all these endeavors fail? These are profoundly significant questions. They are being asked in a multilateral forum for the first time in a serious way. And this is of great significance.\nIn the end, no matter what we do with security concerns or what we do with economic concerns, the heart of our mission must be the same as it was on Normandy\'s beaches a half a century ago, that is, democracy. For after all, democracy is the glue that can cement economic reforms and security cooperation. That is why our third goal must be to consolidate Europe\'s recent democratic gains.\nThis goal resonates with the fundamental ideals of both of our republics. It is, after all, how we got started. It also serves our most fundamental security interests, for democracy is a powerful deterrent; it checks the dark ambitions of would-be tyrants and aggressors as it respects the bright hopes of free citizens.\nTogether, our two nations and others have launched a major effort to support democracy in the former Communist states. Progress will not come overnight. There will be uneven developments, but already we see encouraging and sometimes breathtaking results. We have seen independent television stations established where once only the state\'s version of the truth was broadcast. We\'ve seen thousands of people from the former Communist world, students, bankers, political leaders, come to our nations to learn the ways and the uses of freedom. We\'ve seen new constitutions written and new states founded around the principles that inspired our own republics at their birth. Ultimately, we need to foster democratic bonds not only within these former Communist states but also among our states and theirs.\nThere is a language of democracy spoken among nations. It is expressed in the way we work out our differences, in the way we treat each other\'s citizens, in the way we honor each other\'s heritages. It is the language our two republics have spoken with each other for over 200 years. It is the language that the Western Allies spoke during the Second World War.\nNow we have the opportunity to hear the language of democracy spoken across this entire continent. And if we can achieve that goal, we will have paid a great and lasting tribute to those from both our countries who fought and died for freedom 50 years ago.\nNearly 25 years after D-Day, an American veteran who had served as a medic in that invasion returned to Normandy. He strolled down Omaha Beach, where he had landed in June of 1944, and then walked inland a ways to a nearby village. There, he knocked on a door that seemed familiar. A Frenchwoman answered the door and then turned suddenly and called to her husband. ""He\'s back. The American doctor is back,"" she called. After a moment, the husband arrived, carrying a wine bottle covered with dust and cobwebs. ""Welcome, Doctor,"" he cried. ""In 1944, we hid this bottle away for the time when you would return. Now let us celebrate.""\nWell, this week, that process of joyous rediscovery and solemn remembrance happened all over again. It unfolded in countless reunions, planned and unplanned. As our people renewed old bonds, let us also join to resume the timeless work that brought us here in the first place and that brought our forebears together 200 years ago, the work of fortifying freedom\'s foundation and building a lasting peace for generations to come. I believe we can do it. It is the only ultimate tribute we can give for the ultimate lesson of World War II and Normandy.\nThank you. Thank you very much.']"	['<urn:uuid:25a2a05e-6e14-4ea1-952a-9a9f3d12c9e9>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	6	24	2983

Likewise, I struggled when J. D. Bartoe and the International Astronautical Federation (IAF) challenged me to share my top ten research results from the International Space Station to present at this year’s International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Beijing, China. With so many notable investigations, it was hard to pare it down for this list.\nFor those who could not attend the event, I am counting down my choices with you here in a mini-blog entry per day for each of the ten research results. There were many strong competitors, and I chose these based on specific criteria—each of which could have its own top ten, based on those categories alone. For this collection I looked at the quality of the scientific journals, identification by peer scientists, the novel nature of the information, and the ultimate potential for human benefits.\nHumans explore to push our boundaries and make discoveries, but also to expand economic interests, obtain resources and develop cutting edge technology. When it comes to the space station, we can look back on the engineering feats of new technologies and achievements from development, assembly and operations. It is also important to reflect on the international achievements from peaceful cooperation in space—69 countries having participated in some aspect of station utilization to date. Finally we have the research realizations to acknowledge as we use this orbiting laboratory for results that could not have come about in any other way. Research is now at full speed in both science and technology development.\nWhile findings are inspirational, it’s the application—developed during the decades that follow—that leads to recognized value in our daily lives. Focusing on scientific discovery, Earth benefits and knowledge to enable future space exploration, this list shows that these areas are not mutually exclusive. Rather, the potential for overlap expands the benefits of the space station as they build on each other for generations to come.\nI hope you will enjoy this list and I challenge you to take home at least one item here that touches you.

33	roasted garlic compound butter vs baba ganoush ingredients	Both recipes call for roasted garlic and olive oil, but their main ingredients differ significantly. Roasted garlic compound butter primarily requires unsalted butter (1 stick) and a head of garlic, while baba ganoush main ingredients are eggplants (2 medium), tahini (1/3 cup), lemon juice, and spices.	"['This page contains affiliate links. For more information please read my Disclosure Policy.\nA simple compound butter can elevate any number of dishes, from cooked chicken and steak to roasted vegetables. Make a batch of roasted garlic compound butter and use it to amp up flavor for your recipes all week.\nEven though I’m a fan of intricate recipes that involve a lot of technique, there’s also plenty of days where I simply salt and pepper a chicken breast or steak and sear it in a pan. While even that’s delicious, it’s also the perfect opportunity to dress it up with a nice compound butter.\nThis roasted garlic compound butter is one of our favorites. I make it in the beginning of the week, and throughout the next few days we slice of little butter coins and let it melt lovingly over pretty much anything that sounds good. It’s really easy, and really delicious, so I highly recommend it for an easy ‘gourmet’ pop of flavor.\nWhat is a compound Butter?\nWhat you’re about to discover if you’ve never made a compound butter, is that they’re addictive, easy, and fun to make. All a compound butter involves is combining a set of flavorful ingredients in softened butter. Then you simply let if firm back up in the fridge to create a solid, flavored butter.\nI’m a fan of this roasted garlic version but you really can do a lot, from herbs, spices, citrus, sweeteners, and so much more.\nThis couldn’t be much simpler, the way I make this is by using these simple ingredients:\n- 1 stick of unsalted butter\n- 1 whole head of garlic\n- Olive oil\nPro Tip: Use unsalted butter to ensure you can control the level of salt in the finished butter.\nHow to Make Roasted garlic Compound Butter\nThere a lots of ways to make compound butter, this one involves the largely hands off process of roasting a bulb of garlic and then mixing it all together. Here are my best tips!\n- Pull your butter out before you start roasting your garlic, this will ensure your butter is soft and ready to go when your garlic is!\n- Find the best method for roasting your garlic, I found that placing it in a mini loaf pan and covering that with foil then roasting it at 350°F for 1 hour most evenly cooked it for me. A popular one is simply wrapping the whole head in foil, but here is a great article on roasted garlic methods if you want to try another!\n- Expose every clove of garlic before roasting by trimming off the tips.\n- Coat the entire bulb with olive oil, making sure each clove gets some.\n- Mush up the roasted garlic before adding it to the butter. It’ll turn into a paste very easily!\nPro Tip: Once your garlic is roasted and cool enough to handle, the roasted cloves will squeeze right out of the skin, it does get sticky, so wear gloves if that bothers you!\nOnce your garlic is all squeezed out of the bulb, mush it with a spoon and scoop it straight into the butter. Then just add salt and stir the softened butter around until its smoothly incorporated. Next, dollop it onto a piece of parchment or wax paper and roll it up into a log. Twist off the ends and pop it into the fridge to set up.\nThere really is no substitute for slow roasted, creamy garlic when that’s the flavor you’re aiming for. However, if you’re pinched for time, I would instead suggest carefully sauteing minced garlic for a brief period. Raw garlic is too intense. Take care not to burn it.\nNever fear! You can either microwave it for 10 to 20 second intervals on half power, or you can heat a glass bowl or cup with very hot water, drain the water, then flip the bowl or glass over the butter. The radiant heat should soften the butter. This won’t be instant, but it’s faster than waiting!\nOf course! I love fresh rosemary or thyme chopped very finely, or even just some chopped parsley is a lovely addition.\nI’ll be honest, you don’t even have to roll it all up! All that matters is the mixing part of it, then you can store it in a bowl with lid and scoop out what you need when you need it. I like it rolled up for easy slicing, then usually store it in an airtight container after it solidifies.\nAll that matters is that you keep it wrapped up or stored well to prevent any odors from getting at it, and prevent the butter from drying out.\nI would keep this no longer than a week in the fridge, but you can also freeze it if you prefer to make a larger batch and make it once!\nNow of course, the most important question of all – what to serve this one! There’s nothing better than a pan seared steak, but for more ideas, try it on homemade Asiago bread, freshly grilled summer squash, oven roasted potatoes, or homemade biscuits for a savory side. Whatever you serve it with, it’s addictive, you’ve been warned!\nIf you like this recipe, you may also enjoy these other sauces and toppings…\n- Asiago Cream Sauce\n- Maple Mustard Vinaigrette\n- Basil Balsamic Vinaigrette\n- Chimichurri Sauce\n- Chipotle Peach BBQ Sauce\n- 4 ounces unsalted butter 1 stick or 1/2 cup\n- 1 medium head of garlic\n- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n- 1 teaspoon oil\n- Pull your butter from the fridge to soften while the garlic roasts. Preheat your oven to 350°F.\n- Start by peeling as much paper from the garlic as you can, leaving the cloves intact to the root.\n- Trim off the tip of every clove of garlic to expose the clove.\n- Place in a small oven safe dish like a ramekin* and drizzle on the oil. Use your hands to make sure the garlic bulb is completely coated.\n- Cover with foil and roast for 1 hour, or until cloves are browned and soft. Allow to cool slightly.\n- When bulb is cool enough to handle, squeeze each clove from the bulb into a small bowl and use the back of a spoon to smash into a creamy paste.\n- Add the butter and salt to the garlic and stir until completely blended.\n- Place butter on a sheet of parchment or wax paper and roll into a log. Twist off the ends and store in the fridge to let it solidify.\n- Serve as needed. Store up to a week in the fridge or freeze.\nI’d love to hear what you think, feel free to tag me on Instagram @theflourhandprint so I can see how it went!

This “spoiled dad” dip is the creamier companion to hummus. Popular in Arab countries throughout the Middle East, it is also a common appetizer on the Sephardic Jewish table. In Israel, it is known as eggplant salad, or Salat Hatzilim. It is sometimes made with roasted bell peppers, and often mayonnaise is added for richness. I’ve even tasted sweet baba ghanoush with a touch of sugar in it. While I’ve provided a more classic version here, there are endless variations on this theme.\nI’ve made baba ghanoush many times for my family over the years, and it took me some time to find the correct balance of flavors. Every time I made it, I would offer my husband a taste. In the nicest way possible, he would tell me– “Mmm. Good, but a little more tahini.” Or, “Yes, it’s almost there– maybe a touch more lemon juice?” Over time, I discovered the right combination. I knew I’d hit upon it when his face lit up. He smiled and said, “Just like my mom made.” I consider that the highest of kitchen compliments. 🙂\nThat said, Middle Eastern dips and salads like baba ghanoush and hummus are subject to taste. Some families prefer “a little more of this” or “a little less of that.” When in doubt, taste and adjust seasonings according to your palette.\nFor this baba ganoush recipe recipe, you will need to roast both eggplant and garlic.

34	What are the key differences between active and passive hydroponic systems in terms of how they deliver nutrients to plants?	In passive hydroponic systems, nutrients are passed through the growing medium without any moving parts, and they draw water and nutrients from a standing solution at the root level of the plant. In contrast, active systems use a pump to deliver nutrients to the plants, which typically provides better growth because these systems provide more oxygen to the plants.	"['The history of hydroponics. A simple definition of Hydroponics would be working water (""hydro"" means ""water"" and ""ponos"" means ""labor""). Over the centuries many different civilizations have utilized hydroponic growing techniques. The hanging gardens of Babylon, the floating gardens of the Aztecs of Mexico and those of the Chinese are examples of \'Hydroponic\' culture. Egyptian hieroglyphic records dating back several hundred years B.C. describe the growing of plants in water."" Even though Hydroponics is hardly a new method of growing plants, giant strides have been made over the years in this innovative area of plant propagation.\nDifferent methods of hydroponics. There are two main types of hydroponic systems in use today. These systems can either be passive or active in nature. In passive systems, nutrients are passed through the growing medium.\nWith active systems, a pump is used to get the nutrients to the plants, which typically provides better growth because active systems provide more oxygen to the plants. Passive systems have no moving parts and draw water and nutrients from a standing solution at the root level of the plant.\nWick Hydroponics Systems - The wick hydroponic system is a passive hydroponic system, which works without the use of any moving parts. A simple wick is used to transfer the nutrients automatically out of a reservoir area and to the tray where the plants are.\nWater Culture Hydroponic Systems - The water culture system was the first of hydroponic systems developed and is made up of a floating plant tray, which floats on a reservoir containing a nutrients solution. The reservoir is flooded periodically immersing plant root systems contained within the floating plant tray.\nEbb & Flow Hydroponic Systems - The ebb and flow system has become a very popular method of hydroponic gardening because after the reservoir is flooded, it is drained away exposing plant root systems to the surrounding ambient air so they can take up oxygen which will improve plant growth.\nActive Recovery Hydroponic System - The nutrient film technique is an active recovery hydroponic system where a submersible pump delivers a nutrient solution to roots of the plants hanging in grow tubes. The solution travels back into a collection reservoir and is recycled over plant root systems many times.\nContinuous Drip Hydroponic Systems - With the continuous drip system the nutrient the gardener can adjust the drip emitter for each plant to make sure it gets enough nutrients.\nMore and more people are interested in gardening at home. Food safety, food security, food quality and rising prices are just some of the concerns that are causing an explosion in hydroponic gardening worldwide.\nFor home gardeners there are many advantages with a hydroponic gardening system. Not everyone has the time, physical capacity or space to garden on a large scale. Many people don’t have a garden at all, or live in areas with poor soils or challenging climates. Hydroponic gardening systems are a clean, efficient and low-cost way to enjoy gardening all year round, whatever the weather. And unlike traditional gardening, there are no pests to contend with, eliminating the need for harmful pesticides.']"	['<urn:uuid:7869fe79-8e26-4c6a-a6d8-9b9ae3418dcb>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	20	59	518
35	rheumatoid arthritis symptoms flat feet connection	Rheumatoid arthritis and flat feet are connected through joint and tendon problems. In rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation can affect the 30 joints in the foot and ankle, causing swelling, pain, and difficulty walking. Similarly, flat feet can develop due to tendon damage and cause pain in the ankle and foot area. Both conditions can lead to permanent deformities and altered walking mechanics, requiring treatments like orthotics, physical therapy, or surgery.	"[""Fairly common in infants and small children, but also prevalent in adults, flat feet becomes a problem if pain or discomfort is present in the foot or even around the knee and lower leg area. Pain around the knee and lower leg areas can arise because flat feet can alter proper foot and leg alignment, which will put unusual strain on the knee. Adults can develop the condition as the result of injury or even from normal wear and tear due to the natural aging process.\nTurning 40 doesn?t necessarily have anything to do with it, but over time you?ve likely engaged in certain activities or developed some unhealthy habits that led to this condition. If you are overweight, you are placing excess burdens on your feet, causing the tendons to strain. Some women experience fallen arches because of weight gain during pregnancy. You also may have damaged these tendons while exercising. If you suffered a serious injury to the foot, you may have weakened the tendons, which can also lead to this development.\nA symptom is something the patient feels and reports, while a sign is something other people, including the doctor may detect. An example of a symptom may be pain in the ankle, while a sign may be a swelling. Symptoms may vary and generally depend on the severity of the condition. Some have an uneven distribution of bodyweight and find that the heel of their shoes wears out more rapidly and more on one side than the other. The most common signs or symptoms of flat feet are pain in the ankle (inner side), there may also be swelling of the foot in general, swelling in the arch of the foot, the calf, knee, the hip, the back, the general lower leg area. People with flat feet may also experience stiffness in one or both feet. One or both feet may be flat on the ground (either no arch, or very slight arch). Shoes may wear unevenly.\nMost children and adults with flatfeet do not need to see a physician for diagnosis or treatment. However, it is a good idea to see a doctor if the feet tire easily or are painful after standing, it is difficult to move the foot around or stand on the toes, the foot aches, especially in the heel or arch, and there is swelling on the inner side of the foot, the pain interferes with activity or the person has been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Most flatfeet are diagnosed during physical examination. During the exam, the foot may be wetted and the patient asked to stand on a piece of paper. An outline of the entire foot will indicate a flattened arch. Also, when looking at the feet from behind, the ankle and heel may appear to lean inward (pronation). The patient may be asked to walk so the doctor can see how much the arch flattens during walking. The doctor may also examine the patient's shoes for signs of uneven wear, ask questions about a family history of flatfeet, and inquire about known neurological or muscular diseases. Imaging tests may be used to help in the diagnosis. If there is pain or the arch does not appear when the foot is flexed, x-rays are taken to determine the cause. If tarsal coalition is suspected, computed tomography (CT scan) may be performed, and if an injury to the tendons is suspected, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan) may be performed.\nWhat does it mean when you have flat feet?\nNon Surgical Treatment\nFlexible flat feet that are painless do not require treatment. If you have pain due to flexible flat feet, an orthotic (arch-supporting insert in the shoe) can bring relief. With the increased interest in running, many shoe stores carry shoes for normal feet and pronated feet. The shoes designed for pronated feet make long distance running easier and less tiring because they correct for the abnormality. Rigid or painful flat feet require evaluation by a health care provider. The treatment depends on the cause of the flat feet. For tarsal coalition, treatment starts with rest and possibly a cast. If this fails to improve the pain, surgery may be necessary. For problems with the posterior tibial tendon, treatment may start with rest, anti-inflammatory medications, and shoe inserts or ankle braces. In more advanced cases, surgery may be needed to clean or repair the tendon, or fuse some of the joints of the foot into a corrected position. Flat feet in older adults can be treated with pain relievers, orthotics, and sometimes surgery.\nGenerally one of the following procedures is used to surgically repair a flat foot or fallen arch. Arthrodesis. One or more of your bones in the foot or ankle are fused together. Osteotomy. Correcting alignment by cutting and reshaping a bone. Excision. Removing a bone or a bone spur. Synovectomy. Cleaning the sheath that covers the tendon. Tendon transfer. Using a piece of one tendon to lengthen or replace another. Arthroereisis. placing a small device in the subtalar joint to limit motion. For most people, treatment is successful, regardless of the cause, although the cause does does play a major role in determining your prognosis. Some causes do not need treatment, while others require a surgical fix.\nOrthotic inserts, either prescribed or bought over the counter, can help keep the arches fixed into position, but always wear them as although they support, they don?t strengthen, which is why some experts reccomend avoiding them. Gait analysis at a run specialist can help to diagnose overpronation and flat feet. Most brands produce shoes that will give support and help to limit the negative effects of a poor gait on the rest of the body. Barefoot exercises, such as standing on a towel and making fists with the toes, can help to strengthen the arches. Start easy and build up the reps to avoid cramping. Short barefoot running sessions can help take pressure off the arches by using the natural elasticity of the foot?s tendons to take impact and build strength to help prevent flat feet. These should be done on grass for only a few minutes at a time."", ""Walking. It's something many people take for granted. Most people don't even think about what it takes to simply walk around the house, let alone down the street, or to the car to go to work.\nSimply getting from the car to the intended destination can become an impossible task with rheumatoid arthritis.\nYou don't know what you have until you've lost it\nThen, one day, the pain is so bad that you find yourself completely disabled. When you're suddenly unable to walk, so many unforeseen challenges crop up. How do you get to the restroom from your bed? How can you make yourself breakfast? How can you stand to clean yourself after using the toilet? You weren't exactly expecting this sort of situation - just yesterday, and every day prior to that, you were just fine.\nPeople who have rheumatoid arthritis can find this to be a reality. One day they are doing great; the next they are completely knocked down by the pain. It's part of what it's like to suffer from this chronic, autoimmune disease.\nRheumatoid can attack your foot and ankle\nRheumatoid arthritis affects joints because the immune system sees your own body as an invader. Classically, the inflammation involves the joints, and these can include your foot and ankle. That's when it can become nearly impossible to walk.\nA swollen and painful ankle and foot make it hard to support your body weight while standing or walking. After all, these joints make up the supportive base for the rest of your body. Walking also involves having to move your ankle and foot, which could exacerbate any symptoms involving these joints. The swelling could also make your feet much bigger than they normally are, making it impossible to fit them into your shoes.\nMany people with rheumatoid will find their disease affecting their foot and ankle\nWithin the foot and ankle alone, we have 30 joints. That's a lot of joints that could be affected by RA. These joints are in fact particularly sensitive to inflammation, especially for people who suffer from rheumatoid arthritis. At least 90% of these patients will experience foot and ankle disease at some point in their lifetime. On top of that, about 65% experience foot and ankle flares within their first year of being diagnosed.\nFlares can leave permanent damage\nThough flares are usually temporary, the damage done can be permanent. The same is true for the foot and ankle. Though the pain may only visit for a few days, the inflammation can actually cause scarring and permanent deformity in the foot and ankle. The result is a deformed and damaged foot and ankle that may actually affect your walking in a permanent way. The dysfunctional walking mechanics can also exacerbate the problem, causing even more joint destruction.\nThere are many different joints in the foot and ankle\nSome of the symptoms of foot and ankle RA include involvements of the small joints within the feet, ankle, and toes. There are three main types that we will talk about today: the metatarsophalangeal joints, the interphalangeal joints, and the joints making up the ankle.\nThe metatarsophalangeal are the long, slender bones that connect your toes to your feet. These are the most frequently affected type of bone in rheumatoid arthritis. The interphalangeal joints are the small bones that actually make up your knuckles, where the bones of your toes meet with each other.\nWhat's going on when RA attacks your foot or ankle joint?\nAll the joints within the foot and ankle are actually surrounded by synovium, a thin membrane that gives the area flexibility. The membrane produces fluid which helps to nourish and lubricate the joint, much like oiling a hinge of a door. When rheumatoid arthritis attacks, the healthy tissue is destroyed by white blood cells that cause inflammation. The inflamed synovium starts to heal itself by adding more cell layers to itself rapidly, resulting in an abnormal layer of synovial cells that are referred to as a pannus.\nThe pannus in rheumatoid arthritis is actually another cause of many issues associated with the disease. It takes up too much space within the joint and causes destruction of the actual cartilage and bone within the joints. The pannus can also exacerbate fluid production, contributing to the swelling that we see in rheumatoid arthritis.\nBesides destroying bone, rheumatoid arthritis can also affect the tendons and ligaments too. When tendons become inflamed, it's referred to as tenosynovitis. It's not always painful when it happens, but it's serious because it can degenerate the tendon over time. This can compromise the connection between your muscles and bone, influencing your ability to move a joint permanently.\nLigaments can also become affected, and that poses a problem because they are responsible for holding your bones together. Loose or damaged ligaments mean unsupported joints.\nHow can you know if your rheumatoid is active in your feet?\nThe most common signs of foot and ankle involvement in rheumatoid patients are swelling, redness, warmth, tenderness, and stiffness. The pain and stiffness are usually present in the heels, balls of the feet, toes, or ankles. The stiffness is most noticeable in the morning, and may actually get better throughout the day with mild activity. Sometimes, patients can also find pain in their Achilles tendon, which is the tendon that is located at the back of the ankle. This can really make it difficult to squat or walk uphill, as these movements put extra tension on this particular tendon. When having a joint flare, you can sometimes get systemic symptoms too, such as weakness, fever, and fatigue.\nSymptoms can be long or short, damaging or non-damaging\nWhen it comes to rheumatoid arthritis, these symptoms are erratic. They can come and go as quickly as a few days or can persist for weeks on end. Length of disease activity sometimes doesn't correlate with the severity of the permanent damage either. The disease can be rapid and severe, resulting in deformity in just a few days.\nRheumatoid can leave many different deformities in the foot\nThe most common types of foot deformities in rheumatoid arthritis are disclosed toes, bunions, claw toes, and hammer toes. Flat feet and widened forefeet are also commonly seen as well. Dislocated toes happen when the metatarsophalangeal joints begin to degenerate. Usually, they start to angle outwards towards the little toe.\nBunions are a result of big toe misalignment. The big toe starts to turn towards the smaller ones and the base of the big toe starts to jut out away from the foot. The bunion refers to the bony bump that results at the side of the foot, which is the base of the big toe.\nClaw toes and hammer toes are those that are permanently bent incorrectly. These deformities all make it incredibly challenging to find fitting, comfortable shoes, and can also make you more susceptible to developing blisters or calluses from your footwear.\nSome non-medical treatments are available\nWhat can you do if you have foot and ankle complications from rheumatoid arthritis? There are several non-medical treatment options that can improve your situation as best as possible. Physical therapy is among the most important treatment regimens for foot and ankle RA. It helps to stretch and strengthen joints so you can maximize the function of your foot and ankle. Other effective treatments include massage, cold or warm foot baths, supportive orthotics or special shoes, splints, and braces.\nMedicines and surgeries can help in some cases too\nMedical treatments are available too. Steroid injections at the site of inflammation can help quickly calm active disease, effectively preventing any permanent damage from incurring. If deformities are already present, surgical options can also help too. These are usually reserved for those who are now disabled from either an inability to walk without pain or those who are unable to fit their feet into any sort of shoe or brace. Surgeries are available that can help correct deformities and improve foot biomechanics, ultimately relieving pain, improving function, and increasing shoe options.""]"	['<urn:uuid:4475464e-fb3c-447c-b2f7-df05ed3cd952>', '<urn:uuid:422c87cc-db2c-4762-abe1-3797872783ef>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	6	69	2371
36	effects of regular exercise and meditation on stress anxiety both mental physical health	Exercise and mindfulness meditation both have significant impacts on stress and health. According to research, even a single bout of exercise can improve mood and physiology an hour later, while regular exercise can help lower heart rate and cortisol levels during stressful situations. High cortisol levels from stress can impact memory formation, slow down the immune system, and cause inflammation. As for mindfulness meditation, it helps relieve chronic stress by allowing people to focus on the present moment rather than dwelling on past or future concerns. This practice reduces anxiety and depression, lowers blood pressure, and can even help manage chronic pain. Mindfulness achieves this by helping people slow down adverse thought processes, release physical tension, and view situations more realistically rather than through negative past experiences.	"['Stress: What it really is and how to handle it\nOriginally posted by Jordon Johnston on the UBC Life Blog.\nWhile, tragically, both puberty and phone calls seem to be facts of life for now, you don’t have to accept overwhelming stress as the status quo.\nI had the privilege of speaking to Dr. Eli Puterman, Assistant Professor in the UBC School of Kinesiology and Principal Investigator of the Fitness, Aging, and Stress Lab, about how stress affects our bodies and what we can do to manage it.\nWhat is stress?\nDr. Eli Puterman\n“If you’re a student that perhaps didn’t prepare as well, you may be threatened by the exam, and the physiology of that stress will become more heightened and might interfere with your performance.”\nWhat’s happening inside your body?\nYour body goes through these steps when you feel stress:\nStep 1: The fight-or-flight response\nYour sympathetic nervous system is activated, and the parasympathetic system withdraws. Your heart pumps faster and your blood vessels constrict to get you ready to engage in activity. Your body is essentially energizing you to deal with whatever you’re facing, from a sabre-tooth tiger to a presentation on Ulysses for English 110 (same diff).\nStep 2: Cortisol release\nCortisol, a hormone released by your adrenal glands, helps you feel more alert. But if cortisol levels get too high, you might actually perform less well on whatever challenge you’re facing (whether that’s a carnivorous feline or James Joyce).\nStress in the short term\nIf you complete a stressful event, like an exam, and feel that it went well, then your whole system will calm down. The fight-or-flight response withdraws, the parasympathetic system returns to normal, and cortisol levels decrease.\nShort-term stress once in a while is unlikely to cause any serious side effects. However, what if you didn’t do well on the exam, and continued to worry about it? Your system would stay activated, and this is where some more serious effects of stress begin.\nStress in the long term\nAccording to Dr. Puterman, too much cortisol can impact your ability to form new memories, slow down your immune system, and cause inflammation throughout the body that can lead to disease.\nFrequent stress over a long period of time can actually decrease your body’s ability to deal with stress. You can build up a resistance to stress for a while, but eventually it can become fatigued and make it harder to deal. (\nThis is obviously why I never finished reading Ulysses I easily finished reading Ulysses on time.)\nBefore you start quietly cursing me for bringing such a miserable topic into your life, note that this isn’t something a university student would deal with in a day or a month, and you might not necessarily notice the effects for a long time. However, stressors can build up over a 4+ year degree, and it’s important to be aware of how stress may affect you down the road.\nBut don’t get stressed about stress! There are simple things you can do to help manage your body and your mind’s ability to cope with stress, and stay healthy and happy.\nFight stress with exercise\nDr. Puterman specializes in the relationship between exercise and stress, and his research has provided a definitive link between the two. According to him, “Exercise is the best thing anyone can do for every single part of their body.”\nThough I wish that burying yourself in a mound of pillows while eating copious amounts of M&Ms was the best thing you could do for your body, Dr. Puterman’s research has shown that “one single bout of exercise can change our mood and physiology even an hour later.”\nFrequent exercise may even help lower heart rate and cortisol levels when stressed out over the long term!\nHere are some tips directly from Dr. Puterman on exercise:\nPractice mindfulness, avoid rumination\nAside from physical activity, Dr. Puterman also mentioned mindfulness, the concept of focusing on things in the present moment, as an effective way to combat stress. He said rumination and worry—dwelling on stressful events, both past and future—can lead to more stress and getting caught in toxic thought patterns. At the end of the day, overthinking too much keeps our systems activated at unhealthy levels.\nMindfulness can help this. Though it can be difficult to learn how to calm your mind, practicing mindfulness everyday can help you feel calmer. That’s because you’re creating new synapses and neurons that can change how you feel in a moment or in a day—pretty cool.\nDr. Puterman recommends Mindfulness for Beginners by Jon Kabat-Zinn as a place to start.\nIf you’re feeling stressed, anxious, or depressed, he also highly recommends speaking with a therapist. He shared his own experiences of how going to therapy helped him sit with his emotions and accept that sometimes, just like everyone else, he gets stressed out, too.\nIf you want to talk to someone, a good place to start is the Wellness Centre in the UBC Life Building or the 24/7 Empower Me helpline at 1-844-741-6389. For support and resources on a variety of topics—from academics to health—check out the Support page of the Student Services website.\nFind positive stress in healthy challenges\nDr. Puterman and I both agreed that positive stress exists, usually in the form of a challenge. A lot of events in our life—going to university, moving, facing down telemarketers at inconvenient times—are challenging, but we can handle them and gain a lot from our experiences.\nStress is a part of life, but there are many ways to manage it and lead a healthy, happy life. Don’t be afraid to take on those challenges, but make time to get moving and stay focused on the incredible present!', ""Mindfulness for Health\nPhoto credit: Alice Popkorn/Flickr.com\nMedical and mental health professionals have been discovering how mindfulness can be used to effectively improve health.\nFor decades professionals have known that chronic stress and anxiety can have profound effects on both physical and mental health.\nChronic stress can raise blood pressure, can cause memory loss, affects cognitive thinking, and contributes to depression.\nStress has also been linked to heart disease, diabetes, and increased accidents and injuries.\nPracticing mindfulness can help to relieve chronic stress helping people feel less anxious and depressed and lowering their blood pressure.\nIt can also help people become more aware of their bodies, and help them identify when something doesn't feel quite right.\nMindfulness can also help people suffering from chronic pain manage their pain more effectively.\n- Mindfulness for Better Mental Health\nDepression often occurs when an individual is subjected to stress for a long period of time.\nThis stress can cause a person to become anxious, view the world negatively, and lead to negative thoughts which they can't seem to escape from.\nMindfulness practice allows individuals to slow down those adverse thought processes by focusing their mind on simple functions of the here and now, such as breathing, walking, or listening to music.\nWhen you practice mindfulness activities, your focus shifts to one simple activity, you simply observe this activity without judgment.\nAs you concentrate on that one activity, your body begins to relax, tension flows from the body, and you begin to feel more relaxed, less overwhelmed, and free from stress and worry.\nPracticing mindfulness meditation on a regular basis can help to relieve stress and elevate your mood, which in turn helps to relieve depression, letting you feel more hopeful and happier.\n- Mindfulness For Better Emotional HealthMindfulness for Health\nWhen too much is going on in our minds we begin to feel overwhelmed, and this feeling of weight on our minds and shoulders, affects us emotionally.\nWe find ourselves unable to view situations clearly, often focusing on the negative rather than the positive. We become upset, easily frustrated, and irritable.\nSome people become tearful and overly sensitive. Others shut off emotionally or withdraw which can lead to all types of complications with family, friends, and relationships in general.\nPracticing mindfulness works to clear the mind. It relieves that feeling of being overwhelmed by allowing us to focus on the here and now, on a single moment in time instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.\nBy focusing on the moment, we are less likely to judge a situation based on past experiences, and are better able to view an event more realistically.\nThis allows us to deal with a current situation less emotionally, because we aren't viewing the situation with negative connotations based on past experiences.\nMindfulness practice allows us to control our emotions and reduce our tendency to become upset, hostile or irritable.\n- Mindfulness For Physical HealthMindfulness for Health\nPracticing mindfulness allows us to know and better understand how our bodies work.\nThis helps us to recognize when something is not quite right sooner than we otherwise would, which can result in seeking treatment faster, before a small problem becomes a big one.\nMindfulness mediation can also help people suffering from chronic pain manage their condition better.\nWhen people experience pain on a continual basis they tend to focus much of their attention on the pain they feel or the pain they experienced in the past.\nThey worry that the pain will worsen in the future.\nStudies show that focusing on pain can set up an emotional response where people actually feel more pain than just the physical pain.\nMindfulness practice can divert a person’s focus for a short period of time to something other than the pain.\nFor instance when you focus on your breathing, concentrating on how it feels to draw in each breath and release it, the way your chest and stomach expands, and the rise and fall of your shoulders, your mind lets go of the memory of past pain and the worry about future pain, and people find that the actual pain they are feeling diminishes.\nPart of the reduction in pain is due to do the fact that they relax. Their muscles become less tense.\nPart of the reduction in pain also has to do with the fact that by letting go of the memory of pain, and the worry of future pain, they only feel that pain that is here now, not the emotional pain that contributes to the physical pain.\nMindfulness practice can affect many aspects of our health, and when people feel healthier they can face the world more positively while experiencing less stress and anxiety.""]"	['<urn:uuid:7c463659-0074-4da6-8b3e-5b8ce5cf7e65>', '<urn:uuid:f9f9e11d-7996-4876-b2cb-bc7b6a5027bb>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	13	127	1749

38	traditional dropper rig vs swing streamers which gives better strike detection bottom fishing	The traditional dropper rig provides better strike detection for bottom fishing. With a drop shot rig, feeling the weight bounce and drag on the bottom provides a constant point of reference and greatly increases strike detection. In contrast, when swinging streamers, strikes can be more subtle and mainly occur during the fly's ascension phase when it reaches the quartering downstream position.	"[""Most of the best fly fishermen I know started off on traditional tackle, and many still look to their old gear for inspiration when putting together a solution to a fishy problem.\nFlies tied to look and act like lures, custom tips and heads, and purpose-built leaders are commonplace in a fly fishing culture that is steadily moving away from its tweed-clad roots. One of my favorite nuggets of wisdom adapted from outside of the fly fishing world is the drop shot rig.\nBass fisherman have been successfully jigging soft plastics on drop shot rigs for decades. Rigged for the fly rod, drop shotting works great for targeting trout and salmon in water that is too deep and fast for even the heaviest nymphs.\nA drop shot rig simply suspends your fly in the water column above a weight. Most importantly, this rig allows you to get deep quickly and fine tune the depth of your fly until you start getting hits. Similar to various contact nymphing methods, feeling the weight bounce and drag on the bottom provides a constant point of reference and greatly increases strike detection.\nHere are a few drop shot builds and how to fish them.\nTraditional Dropper Rig\n- Line up a 8-12 inch length of tippet material parallel to the end of your leader and tie them together using a triple surgeon’s knot at the top of the two pieces.\n- Cut off the top tag-end and shorten the fly-dropper by a few inches.\n- Tie a stop-knot to the bottom of the leader with several overhand knots.\n- Tie your fly to the dropper, and pinch your split shot above the stop-knot.\nYou can set the depth of your fly by the distance between your drop shot and fly dropper. Make sure the length of your fly-dropper is shorter than your drop shot, or expect to get tangled. The fly should flow along at the determined depth as the rig is dragged along by the current.\nWhat the traditional dropper lacks in adjustability, it makes up for in strength. If you want to change the depth of the rig, you’ll have to either retie it with a longer or shorter drop shot section, or use an adjustable dropper.\nAdjustable Dropper Rig\nAdjustable droppers are awesome for quickly changing fly depth, but make sure you tie a beefy stop knot — it's the only thing keeping the dropper from sliding off.\n- Tie a stop-knot at the end of your leader.\n- Tie a triple-surgeon’s or perfection loop at one end of your fly-dropper.\n- Lay the leader over top of your dropper perpendicularly, and pull the fly-end of the dropper through the loop around the leader.\n- Loosen and slide the dropper-loop up or down to adjust.\nK.I.S.S Dropper Rig\nWhen you’re having one of those days where you seem to get stuck after every other drift, keep it simple to minimize downtime between frequent re-riggings.\n- Use an unweighted nymph tied to your tippet with an improved clinch knot (or your preference).\n- Leave the tag-end of the knot a few inches longer than the distance you want your fly above the bottom.\n- Make a stop-knot at the end of the tag-end.\n- Pinch split shot above the stop-knot.\nI’ve fished this build pretty extensively on spring run landlocks and rainbows with egg patterns when high, fast water means there’s plenty of debris to lose flies on. It only takes about 20 seconds longer to put this build together than to tie on a new fly.\nGetting the fly down to the fish is the most important piece of the puzzle. You’ll need to adjust how much weight you use based on the water type, depth, current, etc.\nToo little, and the drift is over before you even hit bottom. Too much, and you’re more likely to get tangled, not feel a strike, or cause personal injury.\nInstead of just stacking split shot, try the snap method: tie a barrel swivel and snap to the end of you leader where your stop-knot would be, and simply clip on different size slinky weights or swivel-sinkers based on the water conditions.\nLeaders for drop shot rigs couldn’t be more simple. Use a standard tapered leader if you want, or even a straight section of mono will suffice. You won’t have to worry about delicate presentations, and the deep, dirty water you’re likely to use this rig in, means fish won't be too leader shy.\nIn general, your overall leader should be about 1 ½ times as long as the water is deep — and longer if the water is really moving. A good length of multicolored monofilament used as an inline indicator can help detect strikes and keep track of water depth. Using a tippet ring below your indicator mono allows you to quickly change setups or recover from snags without having to build an entirely new leader.\nYou don’t have to worry about being savaged by a pack of purists the next time you decide to try fishing a drop shot rig — nothing’s hatching when this bad boy is called for.\nWhile you can certainly fish this versatile rig throughout the year, it will be most effective over other methods in deep, fast water following winter run-off and heavy rains.\nThis rig will work for everything from tiny midge patterns to small streamers. On migratory fish, use egg patterns in the spring or fall to make the most of deep pools where fish are stacked up. For multi-fly rigs you can simply tie on an additional dropper higher up the tippet with a surgeon’s knot, or add a sliding dropper using the method described above.\nWhile they can be used with an indicator, drop shot rigs are meant to be fished tight line style — with your rod held high and parallel to the water as you follow the drift. Very little of the actual fly line should be out of the rod guides. Simply drop or cast the rig where you want it, give a little slack to let it sink, watch and feel for an indication that the fly has hit bottom, and lift your rod tip until your leader is almost taught and you can feel the weights bouncing. Now just follow the current until the end of your drift, and toss your rig upstream into the next section to repeat. You can detect strikes when your leader suddenly stops short, straightens out, twitches, or you simply feel the hit. Strikes can be subtle, so don’t be afraid to set the hook often and at the end of every drift. Like many other tight line methods, this is a pretty low impact rig, so don’t worry too much about spooking fish unless you happen to club them with it (oops).\nThere is a time and place for a more delicate and elegant approach to fly fishing, but sometimes catching fish is more important than looking pretty.\nTo paraphrase the great Kelly Galloup: the ideal nymph fisherman will hit bottom as quickly as possible with as little weight as possible. A drop shot rig allows a fly fisherman to accomplish this with the maximum tactile awareness, and opens up previously unfishable holes usually commanded by snaggers and poorly behaved weekend warriors dredging egg sacks. Drop shot rigs might not look dignified, but they just work. Fly anglers should take a page out of the gear-guys’ playbook and try one for themselves this season."", 'The traditional way to fish streamers and wet flies, and perhaps most common, is to swing them. This is probably how they were originally meant to be fished and can produce results with minimal amounts of effort. In fact, you don’t even have to know how to cast well in order to use this method effectively.\nWatch a group of minnows or other baitfish move about in a stream. They very rarely swim straight up or straight down in the current unless provoked. Rather, when moving downstream, in particular, they do so with their bodies turned at a 45 degree angle, noses pointing into the current. This is a controlled motion that allows them to seemingly glide to their next holding water. It’s also what triggers strikes from predatory fish.\nTo imitate this natural motion, stand at the head where faster water flows into a pool. Pull out enough line so that your leader connection clears your guides. Flick the leader and fly into the current and pull more line from your reel, allowing the current to carry your fly downstream.\nNext, squeeze the line against the rod handle with your index finger. Lift the rod tip until the fly reaches the surface directly downstream. Using the tension of the water makes it easier to now flick the fly directly across stream or quartering upstream, similar to a slingshot.\nAs the fly floats downstream, it will sink. By the time it reaches the quartering downstream position, it has bottomed out and will begin rising again. During this ascension, similar to that of a baitfish moving up off the bottom and gliding downstream, is when most strikes occur. There are reasons for this.\nFirst, in most streams and rivers, trout often feed on the bottom, nosing the substrate for nymphs, sculpins, and other food. They’re geared to look for food coming from below. It’s natural to them. This is also why swinging wet flies is so effective. When nymphs are ready to emerge, they swim up through the water column, and they’re vulnerable to trout.\nSecond, the angle at which the fly moves downstream provides a bigger target for predators. In some cases, it can signal a wounded baitfish, too, and an easy meal.\nMost times, the fly will be floating horizontally in the current until it reaches the quartering downstream position. At that point, it will begin to straighten out, and the tail end will “kick” into position. It’s a subtle movement, but the world of trout is full of subtleties, and these often mean the difference between failure and success.\nIf you’ve ever used a spinner on spinning gear, you can probably attest to the effectiveness of the downstream swing, especially at that point where the tail end flutters. The same concept applies to swinging streamers. This motion triggers a strike response in every species by tapping into a basic behavior of most predators – they’re most interested in attacking prey that looks like it might get away. In this case, the “kick” is akin to a wounded baitfish righting itself again.\nOnce the streamer has arrived directly downstream, you can then strip it in all the way back to your position. At this point, I like to work the fly back upstream through the seam where faster and slower water meet and trout are likely to hold.\nIf you’re new to fly casting, I’d recommend stopping your retrieve while the line is still 15 feet or so downstream, before your leader connection reaches the guides and while you still have several feet of fly line in the water to help you cast again. At this point you can slingshot the line out across or quartering upstream, or if you need more distance, throw a little line out into the faster current first. This will wash the fly back out into the pool’s current and provide more tension for getting the line out a little farther without having to utilize a more technical roll cast. For advanced casters, this technique works well in tight cover.\nSwinging streamers is done with both short or long lines. Generally speaking, I start with a short line, with the water closest to me, and gradually increase my range. Once I’ve identified the prime holding lies, I swing the streamer along the fringes first.\nOccasionally you can pick up a fish or two from the fringes. If you plunge right into the best stuff, though, you might still get a couple, but in the process might spook a few others that you also could’ve had.\nDepending on the mood of the fish, varying your retrieve can induce more strikes. Sometimes, as the fly reaches the quartering downstream position, I like to start stripping the line, just a few short, quick strips maybe four to six inches long. This will cause the fly to speed up, which can make trout strike impulsively rather than out of hunger. When fish are sluggish, or on highly pressured waters, this technique can be very effective.\nI believe most fly fishermen fish too fast with streamers and wet flies. Slow things down, make sure your fly gets to the bottom, and then gradually bring it up through the water column. Also, there’s no rule about how many casts you have to make. Sometimes, if the fish are really sluggish, I’ll just let the fly hang directly downstream, twitching it here and there, allowing it to flutter in the current for several minutes before making another cast.']"	['<urn:uuid:640e0ce9-0850-48be-81c8-ae286689fd59>', '<urn:uuid:1a4305e9-2c33-40ea-8b05-390d24b716db>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	13	61	2171
39	common design types decorative patterns afshar carpets persian	There are four main types of Afshar carpets: Afshar Dehaj featuring large geometric boteh motifs, Afshar Morgi with repeating geometric chicken motifs, Diamond Afshar with one to three diamonds and small designs showing Kerman's floral influence, and Floral Afshar with repeating floral motifs inspired by Kerman carpets. The most common ground colors are ivory and bright red, with light and dark blue and yellow used in designs.	['Afshars are handknotted Persian carpets made by the nomadic tribes of Afshar on ground looms utilizing wool or cotton warps and wool wefts with a single thread between the rows of knots. The piles are made of wool and there are between 40 to 105 Turkish knots per square inch. Afshars that are knotted in villages are created on vertical looms where both the warp and weft are in cotton, the knot is Persian, and the density is between 40 and 100 knots per square inch. In common with most other nomadic groups, the Afshar make very few large items, and the most frequently encountered items are of dozar and zaromin size (8’ x 5’/6’ and 6’ x 4’).\nThe Afshar tribe originated in Azerbaijan, a region to the north of Iran inhabited by Turks. During the reign of Shah Tahmasp (1524-1587) the Afshar tribe was driven south into the zone it now occupies in an attempt to diffuse their warlike tendencies, and a distinct Azerbaijan and Caucasian influence is still discernible in their design. As centuries passed, the Afshar rugs also came under the influence of designs used by the craftsmen of Kerman and by the neighbouring Fars tribe, and for this reason the decoration of Afshars are varied. The most common types of Afshar rugs are:\nAFSHAR DEHAJ – The decoration of these carpets consists of large geometric boteh motifs. These boteh cover the whole field of the rug.\nAFSHAR MORGI – Morgi in Persian means chicken. These Afshars are decorated by a repeating geometric motif resembling a chicken which covers the whole field of the carpet. This is far and away the most original and interesting Afshar decoration.\nDIAMOND AFSHAR – These Afshars are decorated with motifs taken from those used for Shirazs and Ghachgais. Usually there are two diamonds, or, more rarely, one or three. The whole field is tightly packed with small designs which often reveal the floral influence of nearby Kerman.\nFLORAL AFSHAR – These specimens are woven in villages near Kerman and the designs are inspired by the carpets from that town. The decoration is therefore floral, almost always in repeating motifs, rarely with a central medallion.\nThe most commonly found ground colours in Afshar carpets are ivory and bright red. These two colours also occur in the designs along with light and dark blue, and yellow. As is often the case in Persian carpets, the borders are limited in proportion to the whole carpet. They are classic borders with a central band and two flanking guards. The serrated-leaf border is quite common in Afshar Dehajs. This demonstrates once again the northerly origin of the Afshar tribe. The other motifs often include a decoration formed by a succession of diamond shapes in different sizes.\nThe price range of Afshar carpets are: LOW/MEDIUM\nAfshars are generally considered among the finest examples of nomadic weaving emanating from the south-east region of Persia. The diversity and inventiveness of their designs is legendary, and the finest Afshars possess an unparelleled primitive majesty. Afshars are exceptionally good buys, and the better, more finely knotted examples can almost be guaranteed to become collectables in the future. As with all oriental rugs, this is less true of poorer quality items, but nevertheless, all Afshars can be considered reasonably good investments.']	['<urn:uuid:5b999765-9a0a-45da-906d-ead9e812637e>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	8	67	550
40	workplace stress physical mental health prevention	Workplace stress affects both physical and mental health across various occupations. Physically, it can manifest in repetitive strain injuries, particularly in the hands and wrists, requiring interventions like stretching exercises, proper positioning, and the use of splints or cold compresses. Mentally, work-related stress affects 66% of people and can lead to conditions like depression, anxiety, and PTSD, especially in high-stress occupations like emergency services and public relations. Prevention and management strategies include both physical approaches (proper ergonomics, regular breaks) and mental health interventions (relaxation techniques, meditation, time management, and exercise).	['As a hair stylist, barber, esthetician, cosmetologist, makeup artist, massage therapist, tattoo artist, or other beauty or wellness professional, you work with your hands all day. More significantly, though, you engage them in highly repetitive ways and often hold your hands and wrists in somewhat unnatural positions for extended periods throughout the day. While repetitive stress injuries and related soft tissue problems are commonly associated with sports and exercise, certain careers create an increased risk too. For example, people who type on a computer and use a mouse all day are susceptible to carpal tunnel syndrome and developing other chronic hand and finger pain. So too are many types of health, wellness, and beauty professionals. Daily poor alignment of the fingers and wrists compresses the median nerve and can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome and other painful complications. And over time, repetitive motions strain the entire structure of the hands and wrists. Add in frequent use of personal technology devices, and the risk increases. Below is advice about hand care for beauty and wellness workers to help protect your livelihood and minimize the chances of developing chronic discomfort or pain in your upper extremities.\nFinger, Hand, and Wrist Stretches to Prevent Repetitive Strain Injuries\n- Extend your arms straight out in front of you one at a time with your palm facing away from you and your fingers pointing up; massage the three segments of each finger, then stretch each finger back towards you one at a time and hold it for 20 seconds\n- Extend your arms straight out in front of you one at a time with your palm facing away from you and your fingers pointing up; pull all four fingers back towards you and hold for 20 seconds to stretch the underside of your wrist and forearm; flip your arm over, face your palm towards you and make a fist, then pull your fist towards you and hold for 20 seconds to stretch the top of your wrist and forearm\n- Extend both arms straight out in front of you with your palms facing the floor and make a light fist; rotate both wrists 10 times in each direction\n- Interlock your fingers and stretch your arms out straight in front of you with your palms facing away from you, straighten your elbows, and hold for 20 seconds; then, keeping your fingers interlaced, stretch your arms straight up over your head with your palms facing the ceiling, engage your core muscles to prevent your ribs from sticking out, and hold for 20 seconds\n- Open and close light fists 20 times\nHand Care Tips for Beauty and Wellness Workers\n- Give your hands breaks throughout the day (real breaks—not breaks where they’re holding a phone and typing text messages)\n- Keep your forearms and wrists straight while doing nails, typing, and performing other tasks during which you might hold your hands at an angle\n- Use your entire hand, rather than just your fingers, while working, holding objects, opening containers, etc.\n- As much as possible, tailor work processes and alternate appointment types to vary the ways your hands are engaged over the course of the day (with the goal being to avoid prolonged periods of highly repetitive motions and positions)\n- Apply an ice pack or cold compress to your hands for 10 minutes to prevent or treat swelling\n- Wear an over-the-counter wrist splint at night as soon as you start experiencing any tingling, numbness, burning, itching, aches, or other discomfort in your wrist, palm, thumb, or hand\n- Use a cooling topical analgesic if you’re experiencing pain and swelling in your hands\n- Use NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like ibuprofen or naproxen to treat pain and inflammation', 'Mental health is closely linked to occupation, with work at the core of most adults’ lives. For instance, the American Institute of Stress (AIS) recently indicated that approximately 66% of people’s stressors are related to their jobs.1 A particular problem is the lack of work-life balance, which can trigger certain mental illnesses like depression and anxiety.2\nDo Specific Jobs Pose a Mental Health Risk?\nNumerous studies have explored the occupational characteristics related to mental health, such as job demands, supervisor support, and work stress,3 with the key finding being that people in certain occupations are more prone to mental disorders. Stress, in particular, has been found to be positively correlated with mental health.4\nThe 10 most stressful jobs in America tend to revolve around emergency services, transport control, public relations, and executive roles. 5\nEmergency and Rescue Services\nFirefighters, soldiers, police officers, and disaster response personnel are at high risk for mental health issues as a result of being involved in emergency situations and being exposed to varying degrees of violence. This population has an increased risk of being exposed to traumatic events through their daily work, often leading to work-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).6,7\nFor instance, a study found high rates of PTSD and depression in firefighters.8 Likewise, approximately 100,000 active police officers in the United States suffer from PTSD, and many also live with the comorbidities of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.9 Research from Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, confirmed that police and firefighters are at higher risk for mental illnesses compared with civilians, and that their exposure to trauma is related to the development of alcohol use and mood and anxiety disorders.9 In a study of military personnel, almost 25% of 5500 Army soldiers were diagnosed with a mental disorder such as depression or PTSD, with PTSD rates being approximately 15 times higher than the general public.10\nThe Germanwings Flight 9525 incident in 2015 brought airline personnel’s mental health status to the forefront. Indeed, the crash was reportedly caused by Andreas Lubitz, a pilot who had previously sought treatment for suicidal tendencies, depression, and psychosomatic illness. An international survey of 3485 pilots indicated that 12.6% of the sample population met depression thresholds and 4.1% were thinking about suicide.11 In addition to jet lag, the stressors experienced by pilots include long working hours, pressure from the responsibility of passenger safety, and cockpit conditions such as low oxygen levels and high noise levels. Some pilots may also be hesitant to seek treatment due to the impact this could have on career advancement.\nTaxi driving is another highly stressful occupation. One study of 508 taxi drivers found that 33% presented with at least 5 symptoms of depression, which was mainly attributed to lack of leisure activities.12 Another study found that, compared with the general population, public transportation drivers had higher rates of alcohol abuse, major depressive episodes, burnout syndrome, and anxiety.13 Drivers are often required to deal with long working hours and night shifts, which could explain some of these symptoms and unhealthy coping mechanisms. Traffic jams and air and noise pollution may also have a negative influence on their mental health.\nPublic Relations (PR)\nLike most people in PR jobs, newspaper reporters, broadcasters, and event coordinators face tight deadlines, managing unpredictable deals, covering violent social issues, and adapting to a hectic workplace environment. These factors may explain why approximately 34% of European PR professionals experience mental illness. Almost half of them reported that they perceive their colleagues as unaccepting of mental illness, and this lack of social support and taboo regarding mental illness is counterproductive to encouraging help-seeking behavior.14\nAn Australian study showed that 21% of 261 US-based senior executives are psychopaths.15 Furthermore, the antisocial characteristics often found in executives, such as deceitfulness and a lack of empathy, may further cause psychological turmoil for their subordinates. Indeed, middle managers, who often help senior executives, have higher stress levels than their bosses due to their job demands.16 Subsequently, managerial positions appear to be linked to high levels of depression and anxiety.17\nEvidence suggests that the key link between occupation and mental illness is high stress, which can increase the risk of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and mood and sleep disturbances. It is important for physicians to identify occupational stress as early as possible so that the appropriate interventions can be implemented before problems escalate. Tools such as the Job Stress Scale,18 Workplace Stressors Assessment Questionnaire,19 and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales20 can assist with this.\nOnce occupational stress has been identified, stress management interventions can be put into place. The physician can assist with secondary interventions by attempting to reduce the stress severity before it leads to serious health problems.21Such interventions are aimed at the individual and involve techniques like relaxation, deep breathing, meditation, time management, exercise, and goal setting.22 These techniques help individuals by encouraging them to monitor their stress levels, identify the causes of stress, and develop the necessary skills to manage the stress effectively.\n- The American Institute of Stress.

41	biggest explosions ww1	One of the largest explosions in World War I occurred during the Battle of Messines Ridge in June 1917. The British forces placed explosives in tunnels beneath German positions, and when detonated, the blast was so powerful it could be heard in London, over 150 miles away. The explosion created an enormous crater measuring over 100 feet deep and 300 feet wide.	['The year 1917 saw some of the most significant battles of World War I, known as the Great War. During this year, new tactics and technologies were introduced by both sides in an attempt for a decisive victory. Many of these battles were fought in the trenches, with both the Allied and Central Powers struggling to gain the upper hand. In this blog post, we will examine some of the key events and battles of 1917 warfare.\nThe Battle of Arras:\nIn the early months of 1917, the British Army planned a new offensive in the area around Arras, France. The goal was to break through the German lines and capture the town of Cambrai. This attack was launched on April 9th, and included a massive artillery barrage that lasted for several days. The bombardment was one of the largest to date in the war, and was meant to destroy the German defenses and create a gap in their lines that the British could exploit.\nHowever, the Germans were well-prepared for the attack. They had built deep underground bunkers and tunnels that protected their troops from the artillery barrage. Additionally, they had developed new tactics that allowed them to quickly move troops and supplies from one area to another. The battle quickly turned into a bloody stalemate, with neither side gaining much ground.\nThe Battle of Messines Ridge:\nIn June of 1917, the British launched an attack on Messines Ridge, a strategic position in western Belgium that was held by the Germans. The operation was meticulously planned and involved digging tunnels underground to place explosives beneath the German positions. The bomb was detonated on June 7th, and the resulting explosion was one of the largest ever seen up to that point in history. The blast was heard as far away as London, over 150 miles away.\nThe explosion created a giant crater in the ground that was over 100 feet deep and 300 feet wide. The British troops charged forward from their trenches and quickly captured most of the German positions. The battle lasted for several days, and the British were eventually able to secure the ridge. The success of this battle was due to the careful planning and use of new technologies, which allowed them to overcome the formidable German defenses.\nThe Battle of Passchendaele:\nThe Battle of Passchendaele, also known as the Third Battle of Ypres, began on July 31st, 1917. The objective was to push the Germans back from the Belgian town of Ypres and capture the high ground around Passchendaele. The Allied forces, mostly British, were led by General Douglas Haig. He ordered a massive artillery barrage that lasted for two weeks before the infantry advance began.\nThe battlefield was a quagmire of mud, which made movement difficult and slowed progress. The Germans had also built strong defenses, including concrete bunkers, pillboxes, and barbed wire. The British suffered heavy casualties and little progress was made. The battle degenerated into a series of bloody skirmishes, with neither side able to gain a clear advantage.\nThe battle ended in November, with the British holding much of the captured ground, but at a heavy cost. There were over 300,000 casualties on both sides, and the town of Ypres was left in ruins.\n1917 was a year of significant technological advancements that were used to change the course of the war. One of the most significant was the development of the tank. The British introduced the Mark IV tank in September of 1917, which was used to break through German lines. The tanks were heavily armored and had machine guns mounted on them.\nAnother important new technology was the use of aircraft in combat. Planes were used for reconnaissance, aerial combat, and bombing. Both sides developed more advanced planes, and many air battles were fought over the trenches.\nThe introduction of gas warfare was one of the most notorious events in 1917. Poison gas was used as early as 1915 but became more widespread in 1917. The Germans introduced a new gas, phosgene, which was more deadly than the previous gas attacks. The Allies responded by developing gas masks that could protect against a variety of poisons.\nThe year 1917 saw some of the most brutal battles of World War I. Thousands of soldiers died in the trench warfare, and new technologies and tactics were employed to try and break the stalemate. The British were able to make some gains with their use of tanks and explosives, but the Germans were also able to adapt and develop new defenses. The introduction of gas warfare was one of the most controversial events of the year, causing widespread terror and death. Overall, 1917 marked a turning point in the war, with both sides developing new strategies and technologies that would change the nature of warfare forever.']	['<urn:uuid:ed913625-76ad-4611-bb79-0b1ee22ad9ae>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	3	62	804
42	geological formations sandstone erosion weathering rainbow mountains pictured rocks causes	Both the Rainbow Mountains and Pictured Rocks were formed through complex geological processes involving sandstone. The Rainbow Mountains formed when previously flat sandstones were folded during the collision of Indian and Eurasian plates 55 million years ago, followed by weathering and erosion that exposed different mineral layers. At Pictured Rocks, the cliffs are continuously shaped by water, waves, wind and ice, with sea caves forming in softer sandstone layers through erosion.	"['Zhangye Danxia Landform is concentrated predominantly in Linze and Sunan counties in Gansu Province. It is both the largest and the most typical of China\'s arid area danxia landforms. Because of aridity, the Zhangye Danxia Landform differs from that of south China. It is very dry and desolate, without any vegetation, so geologists call this ""window lattice and palace-shaped Danxia topography”.\nZhangye Danxia Landform is surrounded by colorful hills, which seem to rise and fall like waves: with rock strata of different colors mixed in graceful disarray, it is an imposing and magnificent sight. The Zhangye\'s palace danxia formations and its colorful hills cover about 300 square kilometers. Its character is unique in China, so it was nominated by the ""China National Geographic"" as the top 7 Danxia Landforms in the country.\n""Danxia Landform"" is a broad term used to describe geological formations composed of limestone and conglomerate that have been molded through a series of specific, complex geological processes. These structures are unique to China and are characterized by their deep red hues, steep cliffs, and distinctive shapes.\nMagnificence is the first characteristic of it. Most mountains here are composed of precipitous cliffs, and many cliffs are several hundred meters high, giving people a strong sight shock.\nSingularity is the second characteristic. In the region, Danxia cliffs, stone walls, stone pillars, stone peaks, low mountains, hills are widely distributed, as well as stone bridges of various shapes. Some peaks are like “couple peaks”, whispering with each other; some are like Skyscrapers, standing straight to the sky; some other are like palaces, appearing splendid in its momentum.\nRisk is the third characteristic. There are high mountains with dramatic ups and downs, and deep valleys with ravines and gullies criss-cross. It is very daunting that many peaks are just like cut by the nature.\nIn addition, the Danxia landform has gorgeous colors due to the organic sediments. You can see various colors, like red, yellow, orange, green, white, black, gray, etc, making the place so colorful and splendid. In the day, the mountains are like brightly colored silks or colorful gemstones. Besides, with the changes of time and weather, the colors vary constantly, adding the visual shock of tourists.\nHow Did The Rainbow Mountains Form?\nThe Rainbow Mountains are cretaceous sandstones and siltstones that were deposited in China before the Himalayan Mountains were formed. The sand and silt was deposited with iron and trace minerals that provided it with the key ingredient to form the colors we see today.\nWhat was once a layered horizontal and flat stratigraphy was disrupted by the Indian Plate colliding into the Eurasian Plate approximately 55 million years ago. Much like when two cars get in a wreck and the bumpers fold and break, a similar process folded what was once flat sandstones into the Rainbow Mountains we see today. This process uplifted mountains and exposed sedimentary rocks that were otherwise hidden well below the surface of the earth. Weathering and erosion removed the overlying layers of continental siliciclastic rocks and exposed underlying formations with different mineralogy and chemistry. This causes the striking variation in colors seen across the Rainbow Mountains.\nhow they got the color we see today.\nPrecipitated groundwater moves through the sandstone grains and deposits trace minerals in between the grains. This precipitate can build up to a point where there is no longer an pore space between the individual grains, cementing them in place. This process is what imparts the trace minerals mentioned below and allows for the otherworldly coloring of sandstones around the world.\nThe primary color is a deep red sandstone, not unlike the Fountain Formation that outcrops in the Flatirons, Red Rocks Park, and the Garden of the Gods all in Colorado. The red coloring is due to an iron oxide coating and cementation, also known as hematite (Fe2O3), between the sandstone grains. This is the exact same process that takes place when a piece of metal is left out in the rain and forms a red layer of rust around the outside.\nWeathering, mixed with water and oxygen oxidizes elemental iron into iron oxide, which is notable for its dark red coloring. The Rainbow Mountains are largely characterized by this iron oxide staining of its sandstone Danxia formation.\nMost of the time iron oxides impart a dark red pigment, however, there are instances where oxides form different colors. For example oxidized limonite or goethite will produce brown or yellow staining of sandstones, magnetite can form black staining of sandstones. If there is iron sulfide present, you will get a metallic yellow color imparted by the sulfur. Meanwhile, green coloring is often due to chlorite or iron silicate clays. These are just some examples of how sandstones can be altered in coloring during diagenesis.', 'PIRO: The “Painted” Pictured Rocks\nFigure 1. Pictured Rocks Cliffs Photograph by: Beth Dondit\nWhy are the Pictured Rocks the “Pictured Rocks?” What caused the colors to form on the cliffs? How did it happen?\nThe Pictured Rocks cliffs span approximately 15 miles from the Beaver Basin west to Munising, MI. The cliffs are constantly being weathered and eroded by the powerful forces of the water, waves, wind and ice. A sea cave can form when a softer rock is affected by erosion. The Chapel Member of the Munising Formation of Sandstone is this softer layer. Waves, wind, etc. have slowly eroded “Rainbow Cave” over a long period of time. Inside this sea cave, you will see many colors along the rock walls/ceiling. The staining or nature’s painting, has left quite a canvas inside this cave. When groundwater seeps through porous rocks, the minerals in the groundwater also seep through, and leave behind colors to mark their presence. Green and blue colors come from copper; black from manganese, or tannins originating in the streams; orange and red come from iron; and white from limonite. Water follows the path of least resistance, and travels downwards (gravity). The water table here is higher than Lake Superior, thus water is moving to the lowest point possible. This is very evident inside the “Rainbow Cave.”\nFigure 2.

43	What protects endangered animals in Maryland?	Threatened and Endangered species in Maryland are protected under the State Nongame and Endangered Species Conservation Act.	"[""Maryland Plants and Wildlife\nSince Europeans first began cataloguing the plant species of Maryland in the early 18th century, over 3,000 woody and herbaceous species have been recognized. The most important, by necessity, were those which provided food and shelter. Once their basic needs were addressed, settlers began to explore and describe their finds to their brethren across the Atlantic. Because of its diverse geology, hydrology and land formation, Maryland was home to an abundance of plant species, creating unique natural communities and providing habitat to wildlife.\nEarly documents by botanists provide current researchers with a picture of the landscape at the time of colonization. Since that time, an estimated 300 plant species have become extinct. Declines in number are due to a variety of factors: loss of habitat through conversion to development or agriculture, changes in hydrology, fragmentation, pollution and even over-collection. The Wildlife and Heritage Service Natural Heritage Program tracks the status of over 1,100 native plants and animals that are among the rarest in Maryland and most in need of conservation efforts as elements of our State's natural diversity. Learn more about Rare, Threatened and Endangered Plants in Maryland as well as Maryland’s Natural Communities by clicking on the images below.\nMaryland is home to an estimated 90 species of mammals, 93 species and subspecies of reptiles and amphibians, over 400 species of birds and several hundred species of marine and freshwater fishes. An untold number of insect and other invertebrate species (crustaceans, spiders, mollusks, etc) also reside here. Of all of these thousands of creatures, over 300 are rare. One hundred and ten of these species are designated as Threatened or Endangered in Maryland and are afforded protection under the State Nongame and Endangered Species Conservation Act.\nAll of these creatures, regardless of how humans choose to categorize them – rare, common, game, nongame – offer us something valuable, whether tangible or not. Food, clothing, shelter, opportunities for recreation, clean water, all of these can be directly related to the existence of Maryland’s wide diversity of species. Check out the Maryland Wildlife page to see lists of Maryland species as well as fact sheets on different animals found in Maryland. Learn more about Game Birds, Game Mammals and Rare, Threatened and Endangered Animals in Maryland by clicking on the images below.\nAn increasing array of foreign invaders, plants and animals with no natural predators, are endangering Maryland's native habitats. These Invasive & Exotic Species out-compete native plants and animals, resulting in a loss of Maryland's biological biodiversity.\nWays to Get Involved\nOne way to help Maryland’s plants and wildlife is to create backyard wildlife habitat. To find out more information on creating backyard wildlife in Maryland then visit the Wild Acres Program website.\nIn addition, the Maryland Wildlife and Heritage Service offers a variety of Educational Programs. These programs include a variety of hunter education, educator professional development, outdoor experiences and hands-on materials.\nFor those who want to learn more about the biological diversity and ecosystems in your neighborhood, then consider connecting with some of the many non-profit Maryland Naturalist Organizations. Often, these organizations offer field trips, seminars, classes, and workshops to help budding naturalists and folks interested in their environment gain a deeper understanding of and greater appreciation for natural world in which they live.\nPlants and Wildlife\n- Natural Heritage Program\n- Guide to Marylandís Natural Areas\n- Maryland Natural Areas News\n- Maryland Wildlife Lists\n- Rare, Threatened & Endangered Species\n- Rare, Threatened & Endangered Plants\n- Rare, Threatened & Endangered Animals\n- Baltimore Checkerspot Recovery Team\n- Natural Plant Communities\n- Invasive and Exotic Species\n- Maryland's Wildlife Diversity Conservation Plan\n- Game Mammals\n- Game Birds\n- Wildlife Problems?\n- Digital Data & Products\n- Environmental Review\n- Birding in Maryland\n- The Migratory Bird Treaty Act\n- Maryland Naturalist Organizations\n- Maryland Master Naturalist Training\n- Contact Us""]"	['<urn:uuid:a7c397fd-1d69-4256-9e1c-ab94803663d6>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	6	17	649
44	What are effective ways farmers can save water in dry areas?	Farmers can employ multiple methods to conserve water in dry conditions. These include planting shade trees to protect plants from drying out and bring up deep water, using drip irrigation systems that deliver water directly to plants with 90% efficiency compared to 64% for furrow systems, and implementing field practices like furrow diking to prevent runoff. Additionally, farmers can plant crops close together to retain soil moisture, reuse wash water for gardens, and build stone walls across fields to slow water flow and prevent erosion. Management strategies like measuring rainfall, monitoring soil moisture with tools like tensiometers, and scheduling irrigation based on crop needs also help optimize water usage. Some farmers also practice dry-land farming techniques or participate in land retirement programs where they temporarily suspend farming in exchange for financial incentives.

If you live in a dry place, the best way to conserve water is to grow plants native to your area or plants that need water only during the rainy season. Green manure and mulch help hold water in the soil, and contour barriers save water by keeping it from running off. Other methods to save water on the farm are:\n- planting shade trees to protect plants and soil from drying out in the sun. Some trees bring water up from deep in the ground for shallow-rooted plants to use.\n- planting crops close together to shade soil so it does not dry out. The air between plants close together holds a little moisture so plants do not wilt. This can be done with green manure or by planting a variety of crops together in the same field.\n- drip irrigation from pipes laid on or under the ground, which uses much less water and does less damage to soil than water poured onto the ground from above.\n- strip-cropping (growing different crops together along contour lines) to help crops share moisture. A ground-cover crop is planted uphill from the contour line, and a crop that gives only a little ground cover is planted below it. Water collects on the ground cover and flows to the downhill crops.\n- reusing wash water to water gardens near the house.\n- protecting water catchment areas to provide more water for people and crops.\nMake planting pits\nPlanting pits collect rainwater to help plants grow even in very dry conditions. Planting several crops in the same pit makes the best use of water. The crops that need the most water grow best at the downhill end. Crops that can live with less water grow well on the higher side of the slope.\nIn the second year, plant in the same pits, or dig new pits between the old ones. If you dig new pits, over the years the whole area will be fertilized.\nStone walls prevent erosion and save waterThe central plateau of Burkina Faso is a mix of flat ground and gentle slopes. Rainfall has always been low, but there has been even less in recent years, and the land and people have suffered. To conserve water and prevent erosion, farmers build low stone walls across fields. The walls slow down the flow of water, allowing time for it to soak into the ground. The walls also prevent soil from blowing or washing away and catch soil that erodes from higher slopes.\nFarmers also dig large planting holes. They fill the holes with compost or manure to fertilize the crops and hold water.\nWhere gullies have formed, people fill them with stones. If a gully is too big to fill, they build a stone wall across it. Just as on the field, the stone wall slows water down and keeps the gully from getting worse. Over time, soil may fill the gully.\nBy using these methods, farmers in Burkina Faso are able to make the land richer and improve crop yields even with less rainfall. And with more food, people’s health has improved.', '|Deutsch - English|\nWith agriculture responsible for the largest water usage in the United States and with irrigation dams being the most common type of water supply dam, it is important to examine the way this industry uses water and how conservation methods can be used to increase efficiencies and thus possibly decrease the need for dams. In addition to some of the alternative diversion techniques (described above) to supply water for irrigation, the U.S. EPA has compiled water-saving irrigation practices into three categories:\n- Field Practices\n- Management Strategies\n- System Modifications\nWhen these practices are combined with the alternative diversion strategies above, the need for a diversion dam for irrigation could be eliminated in some circumstances.\nField practices are techniques focused on keeping water in the field, distributing it more efficiently, or achieving better soil moisture retention. These techniques are typically less expensive than management strategies or system modifications. When traditional field practices fall short of expectations and the management strategies and systems modifications discussed below are out of reach, the field practices of dry-land farming and land retirement are another avenue to explore. Examples of field practices include:\n- The chiseling of extremely compacted soils;\n- Furrow diking to prevent runoff;\n- Land leveling for a more even water distribution\n- Dry-land farming; and\n- Land retirement.\nFarmers can develop land management practices that will decrease the demand on water supplies. More than half of land used for agriculture is still irrigated via a gravityflow system. This system uses soil borders, furrows, or ditches in order to allow gravity to distribute water across fields. Gravity flow irrigation methods can result in up to 50 percent water loss due to evaporation, inefficiencies in water delivery to the crop-root zone and runoff at the end of the field.  The traditional gravity-fed system can be improved upon with the use of laser leveling or micro irrigation, though evaporation still leads to water loss. Laser leveling involves grading and precisely leveling the soil to eliminate any variation in the gradient and reduce slope of the field. This helps control the flow of the water and allows for more uniform soil saturation.  Another method of preventing runoff is furrow diking. Furrow diking is the practice of building small temporary dikes across furrows to conserve water for crop production, which may also aid in preventing erosion. \nIf the above land management practices are not decreasing water use enough and the system modifications described below are too cost prohibitive or not an appropriate technique for a particular crop, farmers can also consider converting to dry-land farming, switching to less waterintensive crops, or land retirement. Farmers practicing dry-land farming in arid regions use a variety of techniques and land management practices to minimize water loss and erosion. These techniques include coordinating seeding to the ideal soil moisture content, choosing crops more suited for arid conditions, and fallowing.  Fallowing refers to a number of practices used for well over a century, such as plowing a field in late fall or early spring to clear weeds and increase soil moisture. Initial plowing breaks up the land and allows the soil to absorb more water. It also eliminates moisture-sucking weeds and creates ridges in the land that limit runoff and better capture moisture from snow.  Fallowing can also involve choosing not to plant a certain field for one or more growing seasons.\nLand retirement refers to a common policy of permanently or temporarily suspending farming on a particular acreage of land in exchange for financial incentives. One of the best-known land retirement programs is the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Through CRP, farmers are paid annual rent per acre and an additional sum for providing land cover. While CRP has typically been utilized to control the agricultural market and keep prices and quantities stable, the added value of conserving land and water resources has been given more consideration in determining compensation for land retirement since the late 1990s.  This type of financial incentive is common among land retirement programs.\nPractices such as chiseling, furrow diking, and land leveling allow the land to absorb water more efficiently and results in less waste. It is also one of the most inexpensive methods of agricultural water conservation discussed in this report. Depending on the amount of land in need of irrigating and the alternative chosen, it might be possible to remove an irrigation diversion dam, particularly if used in combination with one of the alternative diversion methods described above. Dryland farming and land retirement, also discussed above, have the most to offer in terms of water savings, simply because they call for the use of little to no water, and the potential for dam removal.\nWhile chiseling, furrow diking, and land leveling help prevent runoff and allow the land to retain more water, they still do not address the overwatering that results from gravity-fed irrigation. Also, dry-land farming and land retirement practices can seem akin to suggesting that farmers go out of business. Discussions centering on these alternatives should take current use and compensation into consideration. Also, dry-land farming and land retirement practices are rarely, if ever, applied to the large agribusinesses that now dominate the industry.\nAs discussed above, furrowing and other land leveling practices are the least expensive irrigation alternatives discussed in this report. Actual project costs will vary depending on amount of acreage, topography of the land, and the region or country in which the farm is located. According to the 1998 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey, capital expenditures in the United States for farm improvements were $643 million for irrigation equipment and machinery, $138 million for construction and deepening of wells, $190 million for permanent storage and distribution systems, and $83 million for land clearing and leveling.  In order for dry-land farming and land retirement to be feasible for farmers, it often must be accompanied by financial incentives like conservation easements, which involves the transfer of development and/or land use rights to a government agency or non-profit providing tax benefits or direct payment for retirement of the land.\nManagement strategies allow the irrigator to monitor soil and water conditions to ensure water is delivered in the most efficient manner possible. By collecting this information, farmers can make informed decisions about scheduling, the appropriate amount of water for a particular crop, and any system upgrades that may be needed. The methods include:\n- Measuring rainfall;\n- Determining soil moisture;\n- Checking pumping plant efficiency; and\n- Scheduling irrigation.\nFarmers have to rely on a number of factors to monitor soil moisture, including temperature and humidity, solar radiation, crop growth stage, mulch, soil texture, percentage of organic matter, and rooting depth. A variety of tools for monitoring soil moisture, such as Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) probes or tensiometers, are also available to farmers.  The government of Queensland in Australia has done an effective job of compiling a fact sheet on a variety of irrigation scheduling tools, including the associated pros, cons, and costs of each.  Ensuring that pumping plants are running at their most efficient also guarantees that water is being delivered to the plant and not wasted. Efficiency can be checked by examining the volume of water pumped, the lift, and the amount of energy used. A pump in need of repair or adjustment can not only waste water but also cost money. \nThe management strategies described above allow for the correct amount of moisture to be delivered to the plant. When combined with system upgrades like the ones discussed below, farmers can maximize the amount of water savings and the efficiency of their land. While this is not an automatic replacement for a dam, there could be an opportunity for removal or the ability to delay construction a new barrier, depending on the size of the diversion.\nMonitoring the water needs of crops in the most efficient manner possible requires technological upgrades that require an initial outlay of capital. In addition to the cost of implementing these system upgrades, there may be training required to integrate new computer systems and other technologies.\nDepending on extensiveness of the system, costs can vary significantly for the management strategies discussed above. For example, the average price of a tensiometer ranges from $120 to $200, with the average field requiring a minimum of four stations containing two tensiometers each, while a cprobe system containing probes, training, and software can run as much as $9,120.\nThe Department of Natural Resources, Energy and Mines in Queensland (DNREM), Australia has put together a comprehensive fact sheet that provides cost estimates (in Australian dollars) for a wide range of irrigation scheduling tools. \nSystem modifications, often the most expensive of the three categories, require making changes to an existing irrigation system or replacing an existing system with a new one. Typical system modifications that allow for the most efficient delivery of water are:\n- Add drop tubes to a center pivot system\n- Retrofitting a well with a smaller pump.\nReplacement irrigation systems include:\n- Installing drip irrigation, microsprinklers, or solid set systems; or\n- Constructing a tailwater recovery system. \nMany farms still use inefficient irrigation techniques (e.g., traveling gun, center pivot)  that apply more water than crops require.  Modern irrigation technology, such as drip irrigation, micro sprinklers and solid set systems can deliver water much closer to the actual plant and achieve much greater water efficiency.  These irrigation tools are the most efficient in terms of delivering water to crops. They use the latest technologies to determine the exact amount of water a crop needs in order to grow and delivers the water directly to the plant. However, they often prove most efficient when used with vegetable and fruit tree crops and less so with dense grain crops.\nBecause of the considerable amount of water used in agriculture, improving efficiency in this sector offers an opportunity to achieve significant reductions in water use. By using the latest technology available to maximize the efficient use of water, the need for some water diversions and dams can be eliminated.\nSwitching to more efficient irrigation technologies is cost prohibitive for many farmers. Even though federal and state incentives exist, they are often inadequate to address the scope of the problem.\nAs mentioned above, initial costs of the latest irrigation technology can be quite high. For example, drip irrigation systems can cost on average $1,000 per acre to install necessary pumps and filters and $150 per acre per year for drip tubing.  A study done by Kansas State University Agricultural Experiment Station in October 2001 compared the costs of center pivot, flood and drip irrigation systems.  While the drip irrigation systems are typically more expensive to install, farmers are able to recoup some costs with savings from reduced water use.\nCase Study, Irrigation Methods Israel, a country with a semi-arid, Mediterranean climate, has developed a sustainable agriculture practice that allows them to stretch their limited water resources and meet both the growing demand for human consumption and increased crop production. Since the 1980s, Israel has been using drip irrigation and micro-sprinkler techniques to expand crop output (vegetables and fruit trees). Many of these irrigation systems are computerized and depend on plant moisture sensors to operate the system automatically. This technology, combined with the use of water-efficient crops and other dry farming techniques, has resulted in an irrigation efficiency of 90 percent, compared to the 64 percent efficiency of a furrow irrigation system. Between 1975 and 1998, water requirements fell from 2.85 acre-feet/acre to 1.78 acre-feet/acre. While water efficiency increased and water use continued to decrease, agricultural output increased twelve fold.  While these practices have not been used in Israel to replace water supply reservoirs, their implementation on a smaller scale in the United States could increase water efficiency to the level that the need for some dams could be eliminated.

In the 1940s, American GIs were widely welcomed as liberators of Nazi-occupied Europe. This positive reception continued into the 1950s, when Americans were seen as protectors against the Soviet threat. However, this sentiment changed shortly after, leading to the emergence of the 'ugly American' stereotype.	['Anti-Americanisms in World Politics\nPublication Year: 2006\nAnti-Americanism has been the subject of much commentary but little serious research. In response, Peter J. Katzenstein and Robert O. Keohane have assembled a distinguished group of experts, including historians, polling-data analysts, political scientists, anthropologists, and sociologists, to explore anti-Americanism in depth, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The result is a book that probes deeply a central aspect of world politics that is frequently noted yet rarely understood.\nKatzenstein and Keohane identify several quite different anti-Americanisms-liberal, social, sovereign-nationalist, and radical. Some forms of anti-Americanism respond merely to what the United States does, and could change when U.S. policies change. Other forms are reactions to what the United States is, and involve greater bias and distrust. The complexity of anti-Americanism, they argue, reflects the cultural and political complexities of American society. The analysis in this book leads to a surprising discovery: there are as many ways to be anti-American as there are ways to be American.\nPublished by: Cornell University Press\nDownload PDF (446.8 KB)\nTitle Page, Copyright\nDownload PDF (78.1 KB)\nDownload PDF (18.1 KB)\nDownload PDF (79.6 KB)\nTalking to friends and associates is an intriguing test of the interest people outside one’s field of research take in a book project.

46	Which causes more environmental damage, industrial farming or mining?	Both industrial farming and mining cause significant environmental damage. Industrial farming, while less visibly destructive than mining, leads to soil erosion, fertility loss, and water and air pollution. Mining causes more obvious damage including erosion, sinkholes, loss of biodiversity, soil contamination, groundwater pollution, deforestation, and destruction of landscapes. Mining leaves behind huge holes and can turn areas into lifeless wastelands, while industrial farming's damage is more subtle but extensive.	"['At the Union of Concerned Scientists, we have long advocated agricultural systems that are productive and better for the environment, the economy, farmers, farmworkers and eaters than the dominant industrial system. We refer to such a system as our Healthy Farm vision. Based on comprehensive science, we have specified that healthy farm systems must be multifunctional, biodiverse, interconnected and regenerative.\nThe scientific case for agricultural systems that renew rather than diminish resources is comprehensive, and research demonstrates the productivity and agronomic feasibility of such systems. Yet, economically viable real-world examples are necessary to spur acceptance and adoption of such schemes. Further, we need to overcome the limitations of economic thinking and measures that were developed in the 19th century—when it seemed that the Earth’s resources and its capacity to absorb waste were inexhaustible—and improve them to create more modern assessments, appropriate for the 21st century and beyond. A new report from our colleagues at Farmland LP, Delta Institute and Earth Economics will make a major contribution toward this end.\nHealthy Farmland Vision – Click the graphic for an interactive web feature.\nEconomists view agriculture as a primary sector of the economy, meaning that without the activity of that sector, the remainder of the economy (such as manufacturing and service) could not be developed. Together with other primary economic enterprises such as mining and forestry, agriculture has generally been practiced and acknowledged as an extractive industry. Whereas mining is visibly extractive, agriculture is less so, because degradative processes such as soil erosion, fertility loss, and water and air pollution are not as obvious as mountaintop removal and strip mining. Yet, as practiced industrially, agriculture is both extractive and more extensive than mining.\nExtractive agricultural practices are abetted by strategies such as importing nutrients to compensate for loss of native soil fertility and by the fact that we value the gains from the extraction but don’t discount the losses. For example, we measure crop and animal yield and translate that to sales and profit, but don’t subtract from the ledger the soil, nutrients, air and water quality lost to produce crops and livestock. One superficial reason for this is that we don’t know the “cost” of those resources, but that is simply a polite way to say that historically we don’t value them. This is a perfect example of the nostrum that we measure what we care about and care about what we measure.\nYet, agriculture need not be inherently extractive. Through practices that build soil, recycle nutrients and store water it can become a regenerative system while still providing abundant food and other agricultural products. A key to shift from extractive to regenerative mode is to build a more complete picture of the total benefits and costs associated with agricultural management. For nearly a decade, the investment firm Farmland LP has been managing thousands of acres with regenerative techniques, thereby providing an opportunity for scientists and economists to assess the value of these practices to soil, water, climate, energy and social sectors. The Delta Institute and Earth Economics, with grant support from the Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, worked with Farmland LP on just such a project.\nBased on a comprehensive review of scientific literature examining the value of various ecosystem services, the researchers applied the rigorous methodologies of Ecosystem Services Valuation and Greenhouse Gas Accounting to assess the effects of farm management on items such as soil formation and quality, water capture and quality, pollination and seed dispersal, climate stability, disaster risk reduction, air quality and biological control. Using Colorado State University’s COMET-Farm model, and the USDA’s Revised Universal Soil Los Equation, the researchers evaluated the effect of regenerative techniques on farmed and non-farmed land under Farmland LP’s management. They compared these model outputs with those from land managed conventionally to construct a comprehensive impact balance sheet.\nThe sums cited in this report are astounding, ascending into the millions of dollars of added ecological value from regenerative process—against millions of dollars of ecological losses due to standard industrial practices. The practices Farmland LP implements are well-known, backed by science and practice, and accessible to all farmers and farm managers with an interest in managing whole systems to increase returns to management. Examples include integrated crop and livestock production, crop rotation, biodiverse annual and perennial mixes, stream buffers, grassed waterways, organic fertilizers, biological pest control and uncultivated land to provide ecological services (erosion control, water capture, habitat and refugia for beneficial organisms.) The combination of these regenerative methods generated net value while industrial methods destroyed value—all while performing comparably on the dominant indicator of agricultural yield.\nEcological Service Value of farmed and non-farmed areas by impact metric – Delta Institute (see report for methods, context and further data.)\nThis assessment affirms the concrete value and effectiveness of multifunctional regenerative approaches. Since many of these ecosystem services are not currently quantified—much less traded—on markets that would remunerate farmers, the benefits are primarily experienced by way of cleaner environment, lower costs of production and added value of agricultural land. This is because land managed with regenerative practices will produce bountifully, at lower cost and for an indeterminate period of time, whereas the value of industrially managed land depends on false and brittle economies, such as access to government subsidies and the availability of cheap industrial fertilizer.\nIn fact, the main business of Farmland LP, a real estate investment trust, is to add long-term value to agricultural land for landowners and investors. A remarkable aspect of this strategy and business model, in addition to more faithfully reflecting actual ecological economics, is how quickly Farmland LP management has been able to produce results. In addition to demonstrating the effectiveness of regenerative methods, these findings indicate the kinds of practices that should be more broadly adopted across all of agriculture to assure our livelihood at present and far into the future.\nThe skilled agronomists and farm managers at Farmland LP, together with the rigorous scientists and economists who have developed and used the ecosystem evaluation technique, are demonstrating that regenerative agriculture is not an aspirational figment. It is real, it is possible, it is productive, it is profitable and it is environmentally beneficial. These things can all exist with one another. A successful business model is predicated on this. As long as reliable scientific information influences decisions and behavior, this report provides a beacon toward more viable, ethical and realistic agricultural practice for the long term.', ""Mining has several bad effects.

47	fictional future worlds in books compare early science fiction and Halo games	Early science fiction literature speculated about the future based on industrial revolution developments, while modern works like the Halo games present more complex visions of future civilizations. Early science fiction focused on how technological progress would affect human society and events. The Halo series expands on this by creating detailed artificial worlds with their own ecosystems, advanced alien civilizations like the Forerunners, and complex technologies like the Halo installations that serve as both weapons and research facilities. Both traditional science fiction literature and Halo's universe use scientific principles and vocabulary to create credible future narratives, but Halo's interactive game format allows for more immersive exploration of these concepts.

They are referred to as ""Installations"" by their AI monitors, and are collectively referred to as ""the Array"" by the installations\' creators, the Forerunners. The series\' alien antagonists, the Covenant, as well as Halo, also refer to the structures as the ""Sacred Rings"", believing them to form part of a greater religious prophecy known as ""The Great Journey"". According to Halo \'s fiction, the Forerunners built the rings to contain and study the Flood, an infectious alien parasite. The rings also act together as a weapon of last resort; when fired, the rings kill any sentient life capable of falling prey to the Flood, starving the parasite of its food. The installations are at the crux of the plot progression for the Halo series.\nThe Halos are massive ringworlds, which feature their own wildlife and weather. The constructs resemble Larry Niven\'s Ringworld concept in shape and design. The structure that Halo: Combat Evolved takes place on was initially to be a hollowed-out planet, but was changed to its ring design later in development; a staff member provided ""Halo"" as the name for both the ring and the video game after names such as Red Shift were suggested.\nDesign and development\nThe term ""megastructure"" refers to artificial structures where one of three dimensions is 100 kilometers (62 mi) or larger. The first use of a ring-shaped megastructure in fiction was Larry Niven\'s novel Ringworld (1970). Niven described his design as an intermediate step between Dyson spheres and planets - a ring with a radius of more than 93,000,000 miles (150,000,000 km) and a width of 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 km); these are dimensions far exceeding the ringworlds found in the Halo series, which feature radii of 5,000 miles (8,000 km) The Halos are closer in proportion to the Bishop Ring (habitat), an actual proposed space habitat first explained by Forrest Bishop, though the proportions of the Halos do not exactly match up with Bishop\'s idea, and do not sit at Lagrange points, as Bishop proposed. As seen in the games, Halo installations feature a metallic exterior, with the interior of the ring filled with an atmosphere, water, plant life, and animal life. What appear to be docking ports and windows dot the exterior surface, suggesting that a fraction of the ring structure itself is hollow and used for maintenance, living, and power generation.\nBefore the title for game developer Bungie\'s next project was announced and development of the game that would become Halo was in its early stages, the megastructure that Halo: Combat Evolved took place on was a massive, hollowed-out planet called ""Solipsis"". The planet became a Dyson Sphere, and then a Dyson Ring. Some Bungie staffers felt the change to a ringworld was ""ripping off Larry Niven"", according to Bungie artist Paul Russel. Bungie employee Frank O\'Connor wrote in a post on Bungie.net that ""the specific accusation that we swiped the idea of a ring-shaped planet wholesale is not accurate,"" explaining that Bungie used a ringworld because ""it\'s cool and therefore the type of thing a Forerunner civilization would build.""\nAt the time, the game was known as Blam!, but Bungie had always expected to replace the working title with something better (Blam! was only used after studio co-founder Jason Jones could not bring himself to tell his mother their next project was dubbed Monkey Nuts.) Titles such as The Crystal Palace, Hard Vacuum, Star Maker, Star Shield, and The Santa Machine were suggested. Russel suggested calling it Project: Halo because of the ring. Despite concerns that the title seemed too religious or lacked action, the name stuck. In turn, ""Halo"" became the ring\'s name as well.\nCombat Evolved \'s Halo was intended to be populated with large animal life, collectively known as Fauna. The Fauna included ""pseudo-dinosaurs"" and mammals, as well as a Chocobo-like creature—the ""Blind Wolf""—that players could ride. The animals were removed for technical and conceptual reasons; there were difficulties in getting herd and behavior action to work, and under pressure to complete the game\'s more central aspects, the animals were dropped. Bungie also felt that the desolate ring heightened the sense of Halo\'s mystery, and made the appearance of the parasitic Flood more terrifying and unexpected.\nPhysicist Kevin R. Grazier, Ph.D, posited in a 2006 essay the composition and problems associated with a Halo installation. The complete Halos seen in Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2 orbit gas giants similar to Jupiter, though much larger; the bodies exhibit characteristics of both a jovian planet and a small star. In each system, there are five points where a body of negligible mass would remain stationary to the two much larger bodies in the system, the gas giant and its moon. These areas, known as Lagrange points, are classified by stability; while bodies at 60° angles to the gas giant would remain in the same location relative to the other objects in the system, the other three Lagrange points are meta-stable, having the tendency to be unstable in one direction. As the Halos are located at point L1, the installations must actively correct its orbit. The apparent gravity of the Halo installations is close to Earth normal. A Halo would have to spin with a tangental speed of 7 kilometers (4.3 mi) per second to match Earth\'s gravity, translating to 19.25 rotations in a day.\nAside from its unstable position, Halos would have to contend with thousands of meteor and micrometeor impacts which would destabilize or destroy the ring; there is no evidence in the games that the installations project an energy shield to prevent this occurrence. Because of the magnetic environment around the gas giant, a Halo would be exposed to high levels of radiation. Earth is protected from such radiation by charged particles created by the planet\'s magnetic field. Grazier posits that huge conductive cables could run the circumference of a Halo; when an electric current was run through these cables, a protective magnetic environment could be created to sustain life.\nIn the games, spectroscopic analysis of the ring\'s composition proved ""inconclusive"", implying that the Halos are constructed of an unknown material (unobtainium). Were a Halo to be constructed using conventional materials a light steel alloy would be most feasible. Assuming that the ring structure is 50% empty space, a 5000 km ring composed of steel alloy at an average density of 7.7 grams (0.27 oz) per 1 cubic centimeter (0.061 cu in) would result in a total mass of 1.7x1017 kg. The amount of material required to build such a ring would be akin to the total material available in the asteroid belt.\nInstallation 03, also referred to as Gamma Halo, appears in Halo 4. It is monitored by 049 Abject Testament and is located in the Khaphrae system, orbiting a damaged planet. Whilst no gameplay takes place on the installation, an extremely dense asteroid field surrounding the installation is the site of the UNSC scientific research base Ivanoff. It is here that UNSC scientists are conducting experiments on the Forerunner artifact called the Composer, which has the ability to convert biological forms, specifically humans, into AIs. Once the game\'s antagonist, the Didact, activates the device, the UNSC base is left uninhabited. In Halo: Escalation, a series of comics which follows many events after Halo 4, establishes that 049 Abject Testament has long disappeared from the ring, leading a monitor to arrive at the Installation, just to be ambushed by a still living Didact, using the Installation to use the Composer.\nInstallation 04, also referred to as Alpha Halo, appears in Halo: Combat Evolved. The majority of gameplay takes place in areas on this installation, and its exploration drives the story. The ring was managed by an artificial intelligence known as 343 Guilty Spark, and is located in the Soell system, dominated by a gas giant known as Threshold. Halo orbits Threshold\'s only satellite, an extremely large moon known as Basis. A group of humans aboard the ship Pillar of Autumn crash-land on the ring after being pursued by the alien Covenant. The ring holds religious significance to the aliens, while the humans believe it is a weapon that could turn the tide of the war against the Covenant in their favor. In reality, the ring is home to a virulent parasite called the Flood, which is accidentally released by the Covenant and threaten to infest the galaxy. The human soldier Master Chief eventually detonates the Pillar of Autumn \'s reactors in order to destabilize the ring and cause it to break up, preventing the spread of the Flood and the activation of the Halo network, which would kill all sentient life as a fail-safe to starve the Flood. The Ark was alerted to its destruction and proceeded to create Installation 04B, which, too, was destroyed by Master Chief. During the game\'s events, Guilty Spark alludes to a previous firing of the network, which Bungie\'s director of cinematics Joseph Staten said occurred around 100,000 years previous to the events of the game in the year 2552.\nDuring the events of Halo 2, the Covenant and humans discover a second ringworld, Installation 05, or Delta Halo. It was monitored by 2401 Penitent Tangent, who completely ignored Flood warnings and was captured by their leader, the Gravemind. The Covenant leadership wants to activate the installation, believing it is the key to their salvation. At the same time, the Flood, led by an intelligence known as the Gravemind, lay siege to the Covenant\'s city-ship, High Charity. After 343 Guilty Spark informs Halo\'s true purpose to the Arbiter, a Covenant holy warrior, of the danger that the Halos truly represent, a group of humans and Covenant Elites prevent the firing of the ring. The unexpected shutdown activates a fail-safe protocol, priming the remaining Halo installations for remote activation from a location known as The Ark. In Halo 4, it is revealed that the UNSC has created an oversight base on the Installation (or around it), as they did with Installation 03.\nThe Ark, also referred to as Installation 00, is located outside the Milky Way galaxy and serves as the construction and control station for the Halo weapon system. It does not share the ringworld geometry of the other installations. During Halo 3, the Covenant discover a portal on Earth that leads to the Ark and are pursued by the humans and a breakaway faction of Covenant opposed to activating the rings. Gravemind, having hijacked High Charity, also crash-lands on the installation. The remote firing of the rings is halted by Master Chief and the Arbiter. In order to end the threat of the Flood, Master Chief decides to activate Installation 04B under construction in The Ark, the replacement for the Halo that he destroyed in Halo: Combat Evolved. Unknown to everyone but 343 Guilty Spark, a premature firing would destroy the installation; the monitor attempted to defend \'his\' ring but was destroyed by Master Chief, who proceeded to fire the weapon. The firing tears apart the incomplete Halo and severely damages The Ark as Master Chief, Cortana, and the Arbiter try to escape through the Portal, which closes as they enter, leaving Master Chief and Cortana drifting in space while the Arbiter returns to Earth successfully, forming the setting of Halo 4.\nAccording to Greg Bear\'s Forerunner Trilogy, a ""Greater Ark"" served as the location for the construction of larger 30,000 km rings.\n- Grazier (2006), 39–40.\n- Hiatt (1999), 94–96.\n- Grazier (2006), 41.\n- McLaughlin (2007), 1.\n- Jarrard, et al (2008).\n- Perry (2006), 6.\n- Trautmann (2004), ix.\n- Trautmann (2004), 73.\n- Toyama (2001), 61.\n- Preston (2000), 19.\n- Lehto, et al (2002).\n- Grazier (2006), 44–45.\n- Grazier (2006), 46.\n- Grazier (2006), 49.\n- Grazier (2006), 47.\n- Grazier (2006), 48.\n- Grazier (2006), 42.\n- Trautmann (2004), 77.\n- Grazier (2006), 43.\n- Trautmann (2004), viii.\n- Barrat (2007), 2.\n- McLees, et al (2006).\n- ""Cortana: That\'s what I thought he said.

Offset paper is matte and suitable for single color printing, while coated paper offers higher flatness and good color printing. Mirror coated paper provides high gloss and bright printing colors. However, from a recyclability perspective, paper labels can cause issues in recycling processes - when paper labels dissolve in water during recycling, they can create impurities in recycled plastic. Additionally, if labels are too large or use excessive ink chemicals, they can contaminate the recycled plastic and hamper sorting.	"['The most plane materials of adhesive labels roll\ncan be divided into paper and chemical film. The common plane materials and their characteristics are as follows:\n1. Offset paper: it also called writing paper, simile paper, its surface is matte paper that is without coating, it is always used for printing with single color and bar-code information label, it is also can be used for writing.\n2. Coated paper: its surface is the coated medium glossy paper with high flatness, its surface brightness is lower than the mirror coated coated paper. At present, it is used in the pharmaceutical industry and food industry under color printing, and it is also a good printing material for heat transfer bar-code label.\n3. Mirror coated paper: it is with super calendering treatment and high gloss on the surface, it is used in industries, such as medicine and health care products that require bright printing color for product labels.\n4. Thermal paper: The common one is the information label used in supermarkets, which is also used in the thermal printing information label of large logistics companies.\n5. Heat transfer paper: It is a kind of adhesive labels roll material that specially developed for heat transfer printing, the surface of paper is specially coated, especially for small bar codes with excellent printing effect, so that the product bar code is scanned without breaking the bar code, broken line can not identify, and surface paper is not easy to change color, its service life is longer than coated paper.\n6. Laser print paper for office use: In market, more common material for laser printers choose offset paper, but the high temperature and high speed of the printer that makes the pressure-sensitive adhesive at high temperature and it is easy to produce glue leakage fault and damage the printer, the special laser printing paper adhesive can solve this problem. There are some uncommon paper adhesive labels roll surface materials, such as fragile paper aluminum foil is also used in food health products and wine products\n7. PE film: Polyethylene film, the surface has bright white, sub-white bright, silver and transparent, it is soft with water resistance, oil resistance and extrusion characteristics, it is widely used in daily chemical products, such as shampoo, shower gel and other products.\n8. PP film: Polypropylene film, its surface is with bright white, sub-white bright, silver transparent, it is also with good characteristics like water resistance and oil stiffness. Super transparent PP adhesive labels roll material, due to its high transparency, when it is posted on the transparent bottle, it seems to have no label visual effect, it is also widely used in daily chemical products and cosmetics and other fields.\n9. PET film: Polyester film, which id divided into treated and untreated, its surface has bright white, white transparent, bright silver, matte silver and so on, Due to its high stiffness, resistance to water, temperature, oil, solvent and other characteristics, it is suitable for all kinds of electronic products on the plane mechanical label materials.\n10. PVC film: PVC film has various surface like transparent white, white and sub-white, it has various characteristic like water resistance, oil resistance and solvent resistance. It is mainly used for chemical products, PVC film with contractility can be used for battery shrink label material.', ""Tell us more about the mechanics of the study - how was it conducted?\nWe took samples of municipal solid waste and lightweight packaging waste (in the Netherlands also called PMD: plastics, metals and beverage cartons) and sorted these waste streams. Herewith, we calculated the distribution of packaging types on the Dutch market in 2021. We defined the recyclability of the packaging types.\nAlso, we defined package types that should be well-recyclable in case their designs matched the requirements of the recycling scheme. These packages were further analysed in greater detail with regard to their design characteristics. This resulted in the amount of well- and limited-recyclable packages on the Dutch market.\nOne promising conclusion from the report is that many designs can be adjusted fairly simply in order to make them easier to recycle. Can you give us some examples?\nYes, packages where, for instance, the label is too big can be fitted with a smaller label. The type of material of the label and the glue are also important. The label should thus be small enough not to interfere with the sorting system.\nThe glue should be water-soluble so that the label can be removed from the packaging in the recycling process. And the material of the label should be chosen not to interfere with the recycling process. For instance, a paper label will dissolve in the water and can cause impurities if particles end up in recycled plastic.\nYou say that, in order to make packs more recyclable, marketing may have to take a back seat. Could you explain this to our readers?\nTo use the label example again: brightly coloured and oversized labels are chosen for their marketing function. However, these labels are not the right choice when it comes to recyclability, since they hamper sorting, and the excessive use of ink chemicals causes the recycled plastic to be contaminated.\nMost of the time, these labels are glued to the packaging with glues that are so strong that the label will stick to the packaging in the recycling process, resulting in the contamination of the recycled plastic. Other examples are valves and spray guns. These packaging components are used to provide convenience to the consumer but are unwanted from a recyclability perspective.\nThe study found that roughly a quarter of all packs are difficult to design for recycling. Could you break this finding down for us?\nThese are two types of packages that fit this mould.\nThe first is very small packages. These will get lost in the sorting process of the recycling scheme due to their size. However, it will not make sense to make them bigger, as that only will result in over-packing for a small product.\nThe second is the packages that would cause serious dilemmas – mainly solutions for perishable products (cheese, meat, etc.). These products need protective packaging that extends their shelf-life and thus less food is wasted. Most of these packages are, however, limited-recyclable. But at the moment there are also no real alternatives on the market that are well-recyclable.\nTherefore, whenever packages are redesigned to make them fit in the circular economy, it is wise to verify that the shelf life of the product is not reduced. A shortened shelf-life can translate into more food losses and that usually results in large negative environmental impacts that is not outweighed by the improved recyclability of the package.\nIn your view, how can the share of well-recyclable packages be raised?\nThe FMCG industry should start with the easy changes: design the labels, caps, etc. of the well-recyclable packages in such a way that they fit in the recycling system. Next, the more difficult issues can be tackled, such as the packages of the perishable product.\nAlso, the recycling technologies for some packaging types need to be further developed – PET trays, for instance.\nAdditionally, for some products, it can be better to use alternative materials or designs to solve the recycling issues. In that case, the option should fit into the alternative collection and recycling scheme. As we see some 'regrettable replacements' (a packaging made of a different material, for instance, paper with a plastic layer, which looks more sustainable, but is not as it cannot be recycled in any recycling scheme) on the market, this is not always the best option.""]"	['<urn:uuid:8954e665-f214-44fc-a821-c51d1eee7c5c>', '<urn:uuid:864ed243-cb75-4715-a6f6-8c4afcd493c7>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	6	89	1269
49	looking to clean my water at home expensive bottled water vs reverse osmosis system which costs less long term	A reverse osmosis (RO) system is more cost-effective than bottled water in the long term. Ultrapure HPLC-grade bottled water costs around $20 per liter, while regular distilled water jugs cost between $1 to $2.50 per gallon. In contrast, under-sink RO systems typically range from $200-500 plus installation costs. While RO systems do have ongoing costs like membrane and pre-filter replacements, cleaning, maintenance, and increased water bills due to waste water, they still end up being more economical than continuously purchasing bottled water. Additionally, bottled water's quality can't always be verified, and plastic containers may leach chemicals into the water.	"['Food analysis laboratory needs for purified water tend to be modest in quantity but demanding in quality. Food analytical methods call for two general water quality grades, pure and ultrapure. To meet purified water needs, cost-conscious laboratories consuming up to 15 liters of water per day must choose from among several options:\nExplore this issueJune/July 2005\n- Purchasing and maintaining separate purification systems for each grade of water used;\n- Acquiring a single, ultrapure water system and absorb the capital and maintenance costs of producing very high-quality water for less-than-critical applications;\n- Buying bottled water that roughly corresponds to pure and ultrapure standards;\n- Obtaining an all-purpose water system that supplies water on demand at the appropriate purity level for every assay.\nThe decision ultimately is based on quality, convenience and cost. Generally, small in size, food laboratories often combine R&D with quality-related work. The assays lab techs conduct can include quality testing of raw materials and finished products. The goal is to determine food safety requirements, nutritional analysis, quality assurance/quality control and product development.\nWater quality needs to be considered for optimal results. Operations requiring purified water include most analytical methods (titration, HPLC, ion analysis, colorimetric assays), microbiological tests, quality control, growth media, washing and rinses, column analytical and preparative chromatography, etc.\nThe two major classes of laboratory water as pure and ultrapure. Pure water has been distilled, deionized or treated by reverse osmosis. It is used in non-critical applications, where detection limits are high or in situations in which contaminants from water purity fall well within the error limits of the method used.\nUltrapure water takes pure water and adds purification steps that kill adventitious pathogens as well as removes trace ions and organics. Not every application that calls for ultrapure water demands removal of all remaining contaminants up to ultrapure standards. Specific analytical methods may only require depletion of certain ions, bacterial products or organics.\nThe need to remove organic contaminants is the most common reason for specifying ultrapure water. Organics interfere with analytical HPLC by altering peak resolution and integration, introducing ghost peaks, and affecting stationary phase chemical selectivity. About 70 and 80 percent of HPLC performance problems are directly attributable to water quality. For analytical HPLC, organic contaminants easily can achieve on-column concentrations equal to those of target analytes. In preparative chromatography, organics may concentrate on columns and co-elute with product.\nAnalytical-grade ultrapure water should comply with ASTM Specification D1193, which stipulates that water be freshly drawn and used within 8 hours of production. ASTM D1193 also specifies acceptable levels for dissolved total organic carbon (TOC) at less than 50 ppb, and microbiological contamination to less than 10 colony-forming units per liter.\nStandards for ultrapure water are significantly higher than for pure water, specifically with respect to removal of organic contaminants, which include free-standing hydrocarbons, halogenated organics, detergents and bacterial products.\nUltraviolet-mediated photo-oxidation is the most efficient, cost-effective means of achieving removal of environmental and pathogen-related organics. UV photo-oxidation employs a dual-wavelength, low-pressure mercury UV lamp in quartz sleeves and dual-wavelength (185 and 254 nm) irradiation. This wavelength combination generates hydroxyl radicals from dissolved oxygen and water. Hydroxyl and secondary free radicals react with and break up small organic molecules, the end products of which are water and CO2.\nBottled water is perhaps the least cost-effective solution. Ultrapure HPLC-grade bottled water costs close to $20 per liter – far higher than the cost of water produced by an ultrapure water system.\nA jug of distilled water costs between $1 to $2.50 per gallon in supermarkets and pharmacies. While this water is certainly of very high quality for ordinary household chores, using it in a laboratory setting is not advisable. It’s impossible to determine the pedigree of bottled water that is not reagent grade. Plastic containers used to store jug water may leach chemicals into water. And once the bottle is opened all bets are off since water absorbs gases and chemicals present in laboratory air.', 'Sign up for the latest water news and information.\nAn Overview of Reverse Osmosis and Distillation Systems\nWhat is Reverse Osmosis?\nReverse Osmosis is a water purification process that uses pressure to force water through a semipermeable membrane. It is commonly used during the production of bottled fresh water and the desalination of salt water.\nReverse Osmosis is also a common step in many household water purification systems. Such systems typically include:\n- A sediment filter\n- An activated carbon filter\n- A Reverse Osmosis membrane\n- An ultraviolet lamp for sterilizing microbes that escape filtration\nThe systems are typically installed under a sink, and pull in water from an incoming tap line.\nOsmosis is the, “Tendency of water to flow from a hypotonic solution (low concentration of dissolved substances) to hypertonic solution (higher concentration of dissolved substances) across a semipermeable membrane.”1\nThink of a tank of water with two chambers. One chamber has a low level of dissolved substances (salt, bacteria, or contaminants), while the other chamber has a high level of dissolved substances. Water would naturally flow through a semipermeable membrane toward the chamber with the higher level of dissolved substances in order to even out the concentrations between the two chambers.\nRO Uses Pressure to Control the Flow of Water\nReverse Osmosis pressurizes the solution with the higher level of dissolved substances in order to reverse the natural flow of osmosis. It forces water to move toward the chamber with the lower level of dissolved substances, resulting in filtered water accumulating in the second chamber.\nWhat can I expect from a Reverse Osmosis system at home?\nTypical Performance / What a Home System Removes\nAt-home Reverse Osmosis systems are capable of removing up to 99%+ of dissolved salts (ions), particles, minerals, organics, bacteria and cysts (such as cryptosporidium) from incoming tap water.2 They also reduce certain tastes, some pesticides, high chloride content, nitrate, heavy metals, and arsenic.3\nWhile models of Reverse Osmosis systems will vary, in general several categories of contaminants should be considered carefully when evaluating effectiveness: dissolved gases, trihalomethanes, VOCs and bacteria.\nAccording to Cornell Cooperative Extension, College of Human Ecology:\nReverse osmosis will not remove all contaminants from water. Dissolved gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide pass through RO membranes into the treated water. Unfortunately, hydrogen sulfide gas, with its notorious odor of rotten eggs, also passes through the RO membrane. RO in general is not a very effective treatment for trihalomethanes (THMs), some pesticides, solvents, and other volatile organic chemicals (VOCs). However, RO systems can be certified by NSF for VOCs, THMs, and several pesticides and solvents if the contamination is not too high.4\nBacteria Reduction and Tank Colonization\nReverse Osmosis systems often add a UV light to the system in order to more effectively reduce bacteria.5 However, the UV light sometimes does not kill all the bacteria because any turbidity in the water can create shaded spots, preventing some bacteria from being exposed. In addition, the UV is installed before the bladder tank; however it is in the bladder tank that bacteria usually colonize. Therefore, if the bladder tank is not sterilized on a regular basis, it becomes a source for bacteriological contamination. Note that the carcasses of the dead bacteria may remain within the bladder tank (the filtered drinking water) with a Reverse Osmosis system.6\nMaintaining a Traditional Reverse Osmosis Systems\nReverse Osmosis systems can have up to four filter elements, with each needing to be changed at various intervals ranging from four months up to two years. This process may require that water pressure to the home be shut off, and part or all of the system be disassembled for maintenance. Additionally, the bladder tank should be washed with a chlorine solution at six-month intervals to kill any colonizing bacteria.7\nMaintaining a Tankless Reverse Osmosis Systems\nWhile some newer tankless Reverse Osmosis systems have overcome the issue of bacteria colonizing in the bladder tank, these systems have their own set of inherent issues, including:\n- TDS Creep: without a flush tank, the initial water coming out can taste horrid, due to increased TDS in the water. TDS creep is common to all systems using an RO membrane and results from the natural diffusion of TDS ions through the membrane from the feed side to the permeate side when the tank is full. This results in lowered or “dirty” water quality.\n- High Failure Rate: some tankless models have already been removed from the market, due to numerous issues, including high rates of failure. Noise: depending on the specific model and features, some units are extremely noisy to operate.\n- Excessive Water Waste: this is a problem with both standard and tankless Reverse Osmosis systems.\n- Cost: with multiple membranes being used, the overall cost per gallon, can be even more expensive than older-style Reverse Osmosis systems.\nIn an Emergency\nHere are several items to consider regarding relying on a Reverse Osmosis system during an emergency:\n- They require electrical power to function, which may not be available\n- They require water pressure to function, which also may not be available\n- They are not portable, and cannot travel with you during an evacuation\n- They are typically suggested for use only with “biologically safe” water sources\nWhat is distillation?\nDistillation is the process of purifying water through boiling the water and collecting the steam. When water is purified by distillation, it is boiled in a container and the steam is sent into cooling tubes.10 The steam is condensed and then collected as purified water in a second container. The impurities in the water are left behind in the first container and can be discarded. Distillation is used for many commercial purposes, including the production of gasoline, distilled water, alcohol, paraffin, kerosene and many other liquids.\nWhat can I expect from a distillation system at home?\nTypical Performance / What a Home System Removes\nDistillation removes sediment, high salt content, high total dissolved solids, pesticides (if properly equipped with a gas vent), fluoride, nitrate, lead, copper and other heavy metals, arsenic, and bacteria.11 Depending on the system, and if operated properly, it may also effectively inactivate microorganisms such as bacteria, cysts and viruses.12\nDistillation does not remove chlorine, chlorine byproducts, some VOCs, certain herbicides and other chemicals with boiling points lower than or near that of water.13 Contaminants that easily turn into gases, such as gasoline components or radon, may be retained in the water unless the system is specifically designed to remove them. In addition, bacteria may recolonize on the cooling coils during inactive periods. Distillation also removes beneficial minerals from the water.\nMaintaining Distillation Systems\nWater distillers range from relatively small countertop units to large floor models for commercial and industrial use. At-home distillation units typically consist of:\n- A boiling chamber, where the water enters, is heated and vaporized\n- Condensing coils or chamber, where the water is cooled and converted back to liquid water\n- A storage tank for purified water\nDistillation systems need to be cleaned with a vinegar solution regularly to remove scale buildup. The distilled water holding tank should also be disinfected periodically. For those with hard water, a water softener may reduce the frequency of required cleanings.14 Keep in mind this will add salts to the water. Unevaporated pollutants remaining in the boiling chamber need to be regularly flushed to the septic or sewer system.\nIn an Emergency\nHere are several items to consider regarding relying on a Distillation system during an emergency:\n- Smaller units are portable, with some being suitable for use with a fire or camping cooktop\n- However, portable units will not provide sufficient water for multiple individuals\n- A heating source may not be available\n- If a source of fuel is available, the system will require this precious resource\n- Larger units will require electrical power to function, which may not be available\nHow much do Reverse Osmosis and Distillation systems typically cost?\nReverse Osmosis systems are typically more expensive due to the cost of the system and the additional expense to have the system plumbed. Whole house systems often range from $12,000-$18,000, depending on the amount of water that needs to be generated daily. Under-sink Reverse Osmosis systems typically range from $200-500 plus installation. Overall, cost factors one may consider include:\n- The system\n- Membrane and pre-filter replacements\n- Cleaning and routine maintenance\n- Waste water from the process, which can drive up water bills\nNext in cost would be a Distillation unit. Heating water to form steam requires energy (typically electricity, but also potentially a stovetop or fire), which factors into the cost of operating a Distillation unit.\n/Small electric, countertop units tend to range from $75-$500. Outdoor, emergency distillers, which look similar to metal pans, are about $100. Cost factors for these types of units are limited:\n- Electricity or another fuel source (wood, propane stove, etc.)\n- Maintenance and cleaning\nLarger “automatic” distillers offer higher capacities than countertop units, ranging from about 7-12 gallons per day. They are freestanding units that run from approximately $800-2,500+, depending on the model. Cost factors for larger units include:\n- Installation, if connecting to a tap line\n- Maintenance and cleaning off scale\n- Filter replacements (many include a carbon filter step)\nNote that both Reverse Osmosis and Distillation systems can also be wasteful and inefficient. They use large amounts of water to create a very small amount of purified water, as typically 75-80% of the feed water may end up discarded.15\nWhat are the health concerns associated with Reverse Osmosis or distillation?\nMany Reverse Osmosis and distillation systems remove the “good” with the “bad.” Reverse Osmosis or Distillation strips out beneficial minerals from the water, making the water an acidic “hypotonic” solution.16\nA chemist will tell you that when a hypotonic (de-mineralized) solution comes into contact with a “hypertonic” (mineralized) solution, the minerals within the hypertonic solution will transfer out of hypertonic solution and into the hypotonic solution until equilibrium is achieved.17 What this simply means is that when one drinks hypotonic water, the minerals in the blood and lymphatic system, which are hypertonic, transfer into the hypotonic Reverse Osmosis or Distilled water that is consumed and the minerals are flushed out of the body upon urination. In an effort to re-mineralize, the blood and lymphatic systems then begin to scavenge for minerals from other parts of the body, such as bones and other organs, and this process repeats itself every time de-mineralized hypotonic water is re-consumed.\nSeveral studies suggest that people who drink demineralized water (hypotonic) over a long period of time tend to be more prone to degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis.18\nHow do Berkey® Systems compare to Reverse Osmosis and Distillation?\nBlack Berkey® Purification Elements are Unique\nBerkey® Water Purification Systems address a broad universe of potential contaminants, including viruses, bacteria, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, heavy metals and even radiologicals while leaving in the healthy minerals your body needs.\n- Addresses pathogenic bacteria without a UV light\n- Removes dead bacteria bodies during the purification process\n- No need to turn off water pressure to the home\n- There are no coils to maintain\n- Addresses chlorine, chlorine byproducts and VOCs (among many other chemicals)\n- Not susceptible to contaminants that may pass through Distillation systems in a gaseous state\nBlack Berkey® Purification Elements Leave in Beneficial Minerals\nBerkey® purification systems leave in the beneficial minerals your body needs.

50	As a surgeon, I'm curious how gastrectomy recovery impacts physical and mental well-being?	Physical recovery after gastrectomy involves managing symptoms like dumping syndrome, which causes lightheadedness, heart palpitations, and nausea after meals. Patients may experience weight loss and require vitamin B12, iron, folate, vitamin D, and calcium supplementation. From a mental health perspective, while many patients maintain normal social activity levels, some experience emotional shock and trauma responses, which may require therapeutic interventions like Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or Trauma-focused therapy to restore emotional equilibrium.	"['Gastrectomy is the surgical removal of all or part of the stomach.\nGastrectomy is performed most commonly to treat the following conditions:\n- stomach cancer\n- bleeding gastric ulcer\n- perforation of the stomach wall\n- noncancerous polyps\nStomach cancer was the most common form of cancer worldwide in the 1970s and early 1980s, and the incidence rates have always shown substantial variation in different countries. Rates are currently highest in Japan and eastern Asia, but other areas of the world have high incidence rates, including Eastern European countries and parts of Latin America. Incidence rates are generally lower in Western Europe and the United States.\nGastrointestinal diseases (including gastric ulcers) affect an estimated 25–30% of the world\'s population. In the United States, 60 million adults experience gastrointestinal reflux at least once a month, and 25 million adults suffer daily from heartburn, a condition that may evolve into ulcers.\nGastrectomy for cancer\nRemoval of the tumor, often with removal of the surrounding lymph nodes, is the only curative treatment for various forms of gastric (stomach) cancer. For many patients, this entails removing not only the tumor, but part of the stomach as well. The extent to which lymph nodes should also be removed is a subject of debate, but some studies show additional survival benefits associated with removal of a greater number of lymph nodes.\nGastrectomy, either total or subtotal (also called partial), is the treatment of choice for gastric adenocarcinomas, primary gastric lymphomas (originating in the stomach), and the rare leiomyosarcomas (also called gastric sarcomas). Adenocarcinomas are by far the most common form of stomach cancer and are less curable than the relatively uncommon lymphomas, for which gastrectomy offers good chances of survival.\nGeneral anesthesia is used to ensure that the patient does not experience pain and is not conscious during the operation. When the anesthesia has taken hold, a urinary catheter is usually inserted to monitor urine output. A thin nasogastric tube is inserted from the nose down into the stomach. The abdomen is cleansed with an antiseptic solution. The surgeon makes a large incision from just below the breastbone down to the navel. If the lower end of the stomach is diseased, the surgeon places clamps on either end of the area, and that portion is excised. The upper part of the stomach is then attached to the small intestine. If the upper end of the stomach is diseased, the end of the esophagus and the upper part of the stomach are clamped together. The diseased part is removed, and the lower part of the stomach is attached to the esophagus.\nAfter gastrectomy, the surgeon may reconstruct the altered portions of the digestive tract so that it may continue to function. Several different surgical techniques are used, but, generally speaking, the surgeon attaches any remaining portion of the stomach to the small intestine.\nGastrectomy for gastric cancer is almost always done using the traditional open surgery technique, which requires a wide incision to open the abdomen. However, some surgeons use a laparoscopic technique that requires only a small incision. The laparoscope is connected to a tiny video camera that projects a picture of the abdominal contents onto a monitor for the surgeon\'s viewing. The stomach is operated on through this incision.\nThe potential benefits of laparoscopic surgery include less postoperative pain, decreased hospitalization, and earlier return to normal activities. The use of laparoscopic gastrectomy is limited, however. Only patients with early-stage gastric cancers or those whose surgery is intended only for palliation (pain and symptomatic relief rather than cure) are considered for this minimally invasive technique. It can only be performed by surgeons experienced in this type of surgery.\nGastrectomy for ulcers\nGastrectomy is also occasionally used in the treatment of severe peptic ulcer disease or its complications. While the vast majority of peptic ulcers (gastric ulcers in the stomach or duodenal ulcers in the duodenum) are managed with medication, partial gastrectomy is sometimes required for peptic ulcer patients who have complications. These include patients who do not respond satisfactorily to medical therapy; those who develop a bleeding or perforated ulcer; and those who develop pyloric obstruction, a blockage to the exit from the stomach.\nThe surgical procedure for severe ulcer disease is also called an antrectomy , a limited form of gastrectomy in which the antrum, a portion of the stomach, is removed. For duodenal ulcers, antrectomy may be combined with other surgical procedures that are aimed at reducing the secretion of gastric acid, which is associated with ulcer formation. This additional surgery is commonly a vagotomy , surgery on the vagus nerve that disables the acid-producing portion of the stomach.\nBefore undergoing gastrectomy, patients require a variety of such tests as x rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, ultrasonography, or endoscopic biopsies (microscopic examination of tissue) to confirm the diagnosis and localize the tumor or ulcer. Laparoscopy may be done to diagnose a malignancy or to determine the extent of a tumor that is already diagnosed. When a tumor is strongly suspected, laparoscopy is often performed immediately before the surgery to remove the tumor; this method avoids the need to anesthetize the patient twice and sometimes avoids the need for surgery altogether if the tumor found on laparoscopy is deemed inoperable.\nAfter gastrectomy surgery, patients are taken to the recovery unit and vital signs are closely monitored by\nSurgery for peptic ulcer is effective, but it may result in a variety of postoperative complications. Following gastrectomy surgery, as many as 30% of patients have significant symptoms. An operation called highly selective vagotomy is now preferred for ulcer management, and is safer than gastrectomy.\nAfter a gastrectomy, several abnormalities may develop that produce symptoms related to food intake. They happen largely because the stomach, which serves as a food reservoir, has been reduced in its capacity by the surgery. Other surgical procedures that often accompany gastrectomy for ulcer disease can also contribute to later symptoms. These procedures include vagotomy, which lessens acid production and slows stomach emptying; and pyloroplasty , which enlarges the opening between the stomach and small intestine to facilitate emptying of the stomach.\nSome patients experience lightheadedness, heart palpitations or racing heart, sweating, and nausea and vomiting after a meal. These may be symptoms of ""dumping syndrome,"" as food is rapidly dumped into the small intestine from the stomach. Dumping syndrome is treated by adjusting the diet and pattern of eating, for example, eating smaller, more frequent meals and limiting liquids.\nPatients who have abdominal bloating and pain after eating, frequently followed by nausea and vomiting, may have what is called the ""afferent loop syndrome."" This is treated by surgical correction. Patients who have early satiety (feeling of fullness after eating), abdominal discomfort, and vomiting may have bile reflux gastritis (also called bilious vomiting), which is also surgically correctable. Many patients also experience weight loss.\nReactive hypoglycemia is a condition that results when blood sugar levels become too high after a meal, stimulating the release of insulin, occurring about two hours after eating. A high-protein diet and smaller meals are advised.\nUlcers recur in a small percentage of patients after surgery for peptic ulcer, usually in the first few years. Further surgery is usually necessary.\nVitamin and mineral supplementation is necessary after gastrectomy to correct certain deficiencies, especially vitamin B 12 , iron, and folate. Vitamin D and calcium are also needed to prevent and treat the bone problems that often occur. These include softening and bending of the bones, which can produce pain and osteoporosis, a loss of bone mass. According to one study, the risk for spinal fractures may be as high as 50% after gastrectomy.\nOverall survival after gastrectomy for gastric cancer varies greatly by the stage of disease at the time of surgery. For early gastric cancer, the five-year survival rate is as high as 80–90%; for late-stage disease, the prognosis is bad. For gastric adenocarcinomas that are amenable to gastrectomy, the five-year survival rate is 10–30%, depending on the location of the tumor. The prognosis for patients with gastric lymphoma is better, with five-year survival rates reported at 40–60%.\nMost studies have shown that patients can have an acceptable quality of life after gastrectomy for a potentially curable gastric cancer. Many patients will maintain a healthy appetite and eat a normal diet. Others may lose weight and not enjoy meals as much. Some studies show that patients who have total gastrectomies have more disease-related or treatment-related symptoms after surgery and poorer physical function than patients who have subtotal gastrectomies. There does not appear to be much difference, however, in emotional status or social activity level between patients who have undergone total versus subtotal gastrectomies.\nMorbidity and mortality rates\nDepending on the extent of surgery, the risk for postoperative death after gastrectomy for gastric cancer has been reported as 1–3% and the risk of non-fatal complications as 9–18%. Overall, gastric cancer incidence and mortality rates have been declining for several decades in most areas of the world.\n""Disorders of the Stomach and Duodenum."" In The Merck Manual.

When faced with an intense stressor, you may experience a rush of overwhelming emotions that you aren‘t ready to understand or respond to, which can cause your body to go into a state of shock, says Aimee Daramus, PsyD, a licensed clinical psychologist and author of “Understanding Bipolar Disorder.” Emotional shock is often part of the fight or flight response, a normal but painful way your brain reacts to something it sees as a threat to your well-being, according to Dr. Daramus. When your brain is unable to process the situation, it freezes in an effort to protect your mind and body. This article explores the causes and symptoms of emotional shock, as well as treatment options and coping strategies. Signs of an Emotional Breakdown Symptoms of Emotional Shock Emotional shock may be accompanied by a range of physical and emotional symptoms. Aimee Daramus, PsyD You might feel numb, or cry, or rage. You might just sit there, emotionally unable to move. You might dissociate, and feel like nothing around you is real, or that it‘s actually happening to someone else. — Aimee Daramus, PsyD According to Dr. Daramus, the symptoms of emotional shock can include: Denial Numbness Disassociation Panic Anger Breathlessness Headache Nausea Dizziness Lightheadedness Muscle tension Increased heart rate Tightness in the throat or chest Inability to speak or move Difficulty rationalizing, thinking, or planning Loss of interest in surroundings Inability to express emotion It’s important to note that everyone experiences emotional shock differently. Two people may face the exact same experience and have completely different emotional reactions. This is because experiences are extremely subjective; they are less indicative of the actual event and more indicative of the way a person interprets them. Causes of Emotional Shock You may experience emotional shock in the wake of an event that suddenly changes your world. It could be an event that affects you or those close to you, such as your parents, spouse, children, or close friends. Some of the causes of emotional shock can include: Abandonment Abuse Accident Argument Breakup Crime Death Divorce Domestic abuse Financial crisis Health diagnosis Infidelity Injury Job loss Natural disaster Near death incident Racism Terrorism Violence Witnessing a death, accident, crime, or trauma “Sometimes people may even experience emotional shock about something good, like a dream job or a marriage proposal, if the emotions are too big to handle at the moment. Most of the time, though, it‘s a response to scary or intensely painful events,” says Dr. Daramus. Diagnosing Emotional Shock People experience emotional shock for varying amounts of time. Depending on its severity and the circumstances, it may dissipate on its own within minutes or may persist for longer. It can lead to acute stress disorder (ASD) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). If emotional shock persists or causes discomfort, it can be helpful to visit a licensed mental health professional or medical professional. They can assess your symptoms, conduct any physical or psychological tests required, diagnose your condition, evaluate its severity, refer you to a specialist if necessary, and develop a treatment plan for you. How to Help Someone With PTSD Treatment for Emotional Shock Emotional shock in the wake of a traumatic event can be treated with therapy, particularly if you develop PTSD. Some of the forms of therapy that can treat PTSD include: Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT): ACT can help you experience your emotions and accept them, instead of trying to escape or avoid them. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT can help challenge unhelpful thought patterns and correct problematic behaviors. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT): DBT can help you regulate your emotions and increase mindfulness. Exposure therapy (ET): ET involves revisiting the situation and confronting your fears until you have processed the situation and are not scared of it anymore. Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT): Primarily designed for children and adolescents, TF-CBT can help them process the event and work through their emotional reactions. How to Heal From Trauma Coping With Emotional Shock Aimee Daramus, PsyD If you or a loved one are experiencing emotional shock, the most important thing is to restore a sense of safety and comfort. — Aimee Daramus, PsyD Dr. Daramus suggests some strategies that can help you cope with emotional shock and restore your sense of equilibrium: Surround yourself with supportive people. Go somewhere where you feel safe. Make sure you eat and stay hydrated. Take good care of yourself or let others take care of you. Seek comfort from pets or familiar, comforting objects. Distract yourself with games like Tetris or video games, as they take a lot of attention and concentration and can help you manage your thoughts. Accept that you won’t be functioning normally right now because your mind and body already have a big job to handle. Don‘t try to talk about the situation or process it while you‘re still overwhelmed. That could make it worse because your mind and body are already telling you that this is too much. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Respect where you‘re at and let safe spaces, people, and comforting objects ease you out of it in a non-pressuring way. When Oversharing Turns into Trauma Dumping, and How to Stop A Word From Verywell People may experience emotional shock in the wake of a traumatic event, such as an accident, the loss of a job, or the death of a loved one. Everyone reacts to traumatic events differently. Depending on the circumstances, you may feel completely numb or you may experience panic, anger, or disassociation. You may also experience physical symptoms such as a rapid heartbeat, breathlessness, or tightness in your throat. In the immediate aftermath of an emotional shock, the most important thing is to focus on your comfort and safety, to restore your emotional equilibrium. Emotional shock is often short-lived, but it may persist or develop into PTSD. PTSD can be assessed, diagnosed, and treated by a mental health professional. 9 Healthy Coping Skills for PTSD 5 Sources Verywell Mind uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

51	lycoming o 320 a1a vs o 320 a3a prop flange bolts differences specifications	The difference between the Lycoming O-320-A1A and the O-320-A3A is that the A3A model utilizes 7/16-inch prop flange bolts. Both models can be used as reference for replacement parts for the O-320 engine with no suffix.	['Q, I have a Lycoming O-320 150 hp engine with no suffix in my PA-22 Tri-Pacer. In one of your articles you list the O-320-A1A and the O-320-A3A as the numbers to refer to for replacement parts. Lycoming does not list an O-320-A1A and shows the O-320-A3A fitting a Piper PA-23. Lycoming lists the O-320-E3D as the engine for my PA-22. I’m thinking of either replacing my engine or overhauling it, but I’m not quite sure what to look for in either case.\nA, Thanks for your question. Let’s see if I can get this all figured out for you. Yes, as my earlier article stated, the model you have in your aircraft, O-320 with no suffix, would use the replacement parts from the O-320-A1A and the O-320-A3A. This can become quite confusing, but let’s just leave it at this to keep things simple at this point. The difference between the O-320-A1A and the A3A is simply that the A3A utilizes 7/16-inch prop flange bolts.\nFrom your inquiry, I’d guess you’re looking towards a complete engine replacement. My only concern with overhauling your engine is “”if”” the crankcase is cracked and possibly non-repairable, it may present a real challenge to locate another “”narrow deck”” crankcase, which your engine was built with originally. My guess would be for the last 40 or so years Lycoming has been using “”wide deck”” crankcases on the 320 series engines, which are beefier and use corresponding “”wide deck”” cylinders. If you were to purchase a factory engine now, you would get nothing other than a “”wide deck”” configuration, which is a direct replacement for your engine other than possibly trimming some of the engine baffling to accommodate the slightly larger cylinders in the flange area.\nI’d like to set the record straight right now about what Lycoming lists as the engine for the Piper PA-22. I can assure it is not the O-320-E3D! This appears to be an error on behalf of Lycoming. (You don’t think things may have slipped a little since I retired from Lycoming do you?) The O-320-E3D is used in the 140 Piper Cherokee, but not in the PA-22. I did a quick check of the FAA Type Certificate Data Sheet for the Piper PA-22 and found the following engines are certified for use in that particular model: O-320-A1A, O-320-A1B, O-320-A2A or O-320-A2B in the 150 hp category; and the O-320-B2A or O-320-B2B in the 160 hp category. I’d recommend you check the FAA Aircraft Specification No. 1A6 to be certain exactly which engine model is approved for your specific aircraft serial number.\nWhat’s the difference between these models? The O-320-A1B is the same as the A1A except it uses a different oil sump and carburetor. The O-320-A2A is the same as the O-320-A1A except it’s configured for a fixed pitch prop. The O-320-A2B is the same as the A2A except it uses a different oil sump and carburetor. Again, according to the FAA Type Certificate, any of these engines are approved for use on your aircraft, not to mention the 160 hp engines noted previously. If you’re thinking of stepping up to the 160 hp engine, I’d again be certain to check the FAA Type Certificate Data Sheet.\nI realize this can sound confusing, but the main thing to keep in mind is the FAA Type Certificate provides the specific models approved. By following that you can’t get into any trouble.\nIf all of this causes you or your maintenance facility confusion, please don’t hesitate to contact Lycoming directly and request their assistance. Prior to placing your call be certain to have your current engine model and serial number.\nI’m certain you can get this all worked out and continue to fly your beautiful PA-22 for many years to come.\nPaul McBride, recognized worldwide as an expert on engines, retired after almost 40 years with Lycoming.

52	As someone who regularly sources specialty cheeses, I'd like to know what specific characteristics make Burrata different from regular Mozzarella in terms of preparation?	Burrata is made using the same technique as Mozzarella, which involves stretching fresh curd in boiling water to make a shiny white ball, but Burrata is specifically stuffed with pieces of curd and cream.	['Tips for Exploring Cheeses\nBuying cheese is hard. Start with your average grocery store. Sure, there is cheese. It’s just limited: to quasi-shelf-stable, plastic-wrapped versions of national favorites: Cheddar, Mozzarella, and Parmesan, which is not the real Italian Parmigiano-Reggiano, whose name and style is legally protected by the European Union.\nTiptoe into a fancy food store, and there’s a different kind of cheese: aromas of funk and cream hit your nose as you open the door. Hard-to-pronounce names like Ossau-Iraty, Hittisau or Époisses are enough of a barrier to stomp right out.\nAnd then, there’s the internet. A cheese may look beautiful, the description may sound beautiful, but will it taste like what you want?\nI’ve been there: hungry and frustrated. Cheese Stalemate. Go with the tried-and-true Brie or take a risk with Brillat-Savarin? All this boils down to one answer: you need your own Cheese Rolodex. But no, I don’t mean a physical Rolling Index.\nWhat I’m describing is developing a basic idea of the separate characteristics you like, and hate, in cheese. Then you can walk into a store or restaurant, “flip through” traits you know you like, and say, “I love the hard bite and silky, almost sweet taste of Gruyere, show me something similar.” And you’ll also know, when you’re surfing the internet for a late night cheese purchase, that “hard mountain cheese with a nutty finish” is probably close enough to Gruyere that you’ll polish it off in one sitting.\nStart small. Pick a cheese you like, say Mozzarella. The next time you’re on a cheese safari, preferably at a store with at least 30 types of cheese, ask for one similar to Mozzarella. If the cheesemonger has it, he or she will point to Burrata. Burrata is made with the same technique, by stretching fresh curd in boiling water to make its shiny white ball and stuffing it with pieces of curd and cream. Heaven, right? Or, he might suggest a sharper, salty version of Mozzarella, in which case he’d let you sample at least two stretched-curd cheeses from other regions in Italy. Ragusano and Caciocavallo are both made with the same basic technique, but are salted, stretched into different forms, and aged. And if you like the Ragusano, he might jump styles, to the sharper, creamier (and more familiar) Cheddar or to the sweeter, firmer Comté. Tasting through these connections will give you a more tangible idea of your taste, and add cards to that Rolodex.\nIt’s similar to wine. If you know you like Napa Cabernet, why not try one from Sonoma? And if you like the slightly drier wine, why not try a Cabernet blend, maybe with a touch of Merlot? It’s not a huge leap over to Bordeaux, for the same blend in an Old World style. Once you’re in France, you might be intrigued by the complicated region of Burgundy, and heck, from an Old World Pinot, it’s not a stretch to jump back to Oregon for some New World Pinot Noir.\nAs Lot18’s gourmet food specialist, I recognize that this isn’t a small task. After all, I’ve probably tasted over 350 types of cheeses, and I can still be indecisive. You may not have a good local cheese store, or you may not stop by more than twice a year. But every trek is time well-spent; there are delicious returns on even the most basic Cheese Rolodex.']	['<urn:uuid:ba9a0c48-62ec-4d72-9d8a-969583f2e67e>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	24	34	569
53	How should pancreatic tissue be handled during surgery?	During pancreatic resection surgery, a small piece (1-3 cm³) of pancreas should be cut from the transection margin using a new scalpel blade to limit cell damage. The piece should be immediately washed in ice-cold extracellular solution to remove debris and blood products, and then transferred to a solution containing trypsin inhibitor, protease inhibitors, and sodium pyruvate.	['The pancreatic acinar cell is a specialised secretory unit, the physiology of which has been extensively studied over a number of decades principally using rodents, although recently significant progress has been made with respect to investigation of human samples. Due to significant difficulties in developing culture methods for this cell type, primary isolation procedures are essential in order to study function. The high quantity of dense-core vesicles and the clustered nature of acini, mean that low-speed centrifugation is extremely effective at isolating this cell type from less dense material such as cellular debris and other component cells of the pancreas. An isolation procedure was developed for murine tissue (1, 2) which was based on a series of purification steps following enzymatic dispersal of freshly dissected pancreas to yield isolated cells and small acinar clusters. We have recently modified this procedure for the isolation of human pancreatic acinar cells, taking into account differences between adult human and murine pancreas samples, most notably contamination with blood products and fat, and presence of fibrosis in the former (3). Here we describe a simple and effective procedure for the isolation of human pancreatic acinar cells using collagenase digestion, mechanical dispersion and low-speed centrifugation.\n- Extracellular solution (mM): 140 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.13 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 D-glucose, 10 HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.35 with NaOH)\n- Collagenase (CLSPA, 200 U/ml) (Worthington) to be dissolved in extracellular solution (above)\n- Polystyrene 15 ml tubes (Sarstedt) (see Note 1)\n- Tabletop centrifuge\n- Water bath (shaking if possible)\n- 70 mm nylon Cell Strainer (BD Biosciences),\n- Human pancreas (see 2.1 Human Pancreatic Tissue Sample Retrieval)\n- *Protease inhibitor tablets 1 per 10 ml (Roche Diagnostics)\n- *Sodium Pyruvate 100 mM (100 mM stock solution, Sigma-Aldrich)\n- * Soybean trypsin inhibitor (lyophilized powder, 0.01% w/v, Sigma-Aldrich)\n*These extra compounds are used to augment the extracellular solution for use during transport from theatre to the laboratory (see 2.1 point 3), but are omitted from the basic extracellular solution for all subsequent steps.\n2.1 Human Pancreatic Tissue Sample Retrieval\nSamples may only be taken from consenting patients. Human pancreatic tissue should be of high quality, which will normally only be available from surgery for left-sided pancreatectomy, resections for duodenal tumours, or non-obstructive right sided cancer resections in patients with no history of jaundice or chronic pancreatitis (3). Samples from patients with chronic pancreatitis or ductal obstruction are unsuitable due to the high levels of activated trypsin in this tissue (Fig. 1).\n- During surgery (pancreatic resection), a small piece (~1 - 3 cm3) of pancreas should be cut from the transection margin of the remaining pancreas. This procedure should be carried out using a new scalpel blade to limit gross macroscopic cell damage from diathermy burns (see Note 2).\n- The piece of pancreas should be immediately washed by transfer between two 50 ml tubes of ice-cold extracellular solution to remove debris and blood products. These may contain neutrophils, macrophages etc. which have the potential to induce additional oxidative stress and tissue damage.\n- After washing, the sample should be added to a third, pre-prepared tube containing ~ 50 ml ice-cold extracellular solution plus soya bean trypsin inhibitor (see Note 3), protease inhibitors, and sodium pyruvate.\n- The sample is then immediately transported in this solution on ice to the laboratory. Crucially, the time from sampling to the start of cell isolation should be as brief as possible (ideally less than 10 minutes) to ensure good quality cell preparations. Failure to do so may result in poorly responsive cells that are either insensitive to agonists (cholecystokinin, acetylcholine) or require supramaximal stimulation to elicit responses e.g. oscillatory Ca2+ elevations.\n2.2 Human pancreatic acinar cell isolation\n- Tissue with a high proportion of fat should be avoided. This is extremely important when loading with lipophilic dyes. Fatty tissue is elastic, pinkish and translucent, and will float in the extracellular solution. Using these identifying criteria, fatty tissue can be immediately recognised and removed to prevent lipid droplets from building up in the external solution / collagenase solution. Use a fresh surgical blade (size 15) or sharp scissors to remove all unwanted sections of the tissue.\n- Inject the resultant section of pancreas at several points with collagenase solution. In most cases, 1 ml of collagenase solution is used (see Note 4). Unlike the mouse pancreas, delivery to every portion of the pancreatic sample is impossible as the pancreatic ductal system is not intact following the initial surgical resection. To attempt to overcome this, the sample should be cut into fine pieces using a fresh surgical blade or sharp scissors so that the surface area exposed to the collagenase is as large as possible. The sample is then transferred into fresh collagenase solution to remove damaged cellular material and fat droplets.\n- Incubate the sample in a shaking water bath for 30 minutes at 37ºC.\n- Following digestion, add the pancreas sample to 5 ml standard extracellular solution. Manually agitate and disperse the suspension through pipette tips of progressively diminishing diameter. This is achieved by manually slicing the tip off 1 ml plastic pipette tips, cut at a slight angle with a fresh surgical blade to give a sharp clean edge.\n- When the supernatant is cloudy, collect and transfer it to a fresh tube. The speed of this process is determined by many variations in tissue quality, collagenase digestion and ambient conditions but should be repeated until the supernatant stays clear upon agitation of the sample. The remaining bulk of the tissue should then remain white and fibrous. The collected supernatant now contains the final population of pancreatic acinar cells. Isolation of acini from other pancreatic cell types is achieved by two rounds of low-speed centrifugation.\n- Centrifuge the sample for 1 minute at 260 g and remove the supernatant by rapid inversion of the tube. 5 ml of fresh extracellular solution is then added and the pellet resuspended. Repeat this centrifugation step.\n- Resuspend the pellet in ~2 ml extracellular solution, filter using a 70 µm cell strainer to remove larger clumps of tissue, and centrifuge as before (see Note 5).\n- Finally, resuspend this pellet in ~2 ml of extracellular solution.\n- Cells can then be loaded with fluorescent dyes as required. Generally, loading conditions are similar to that of murine pancreatic acinar cells, but often require 35ºC.\n2.3 Confirmation of human pancreatic acinar cell viability\nMicroscopic confirmation of the cells should always be performed in the first instance, as the quality of the cells will vary between patients (see all figures for examples of light transmitted images of human pancreatic acinar cells).\nCell viability was originally confirmed by the recording of transient cytosolic Ca2+ increases in response to cholecystokinin (10 pM), which were coupled to mitochondrial NAD(P)H increases (detected as autofluorescence) and amylase secretion (Figs. 2, 3); responses typical of freshly isolated murine pancreatic acinar cells. Ca2+ signals were shown to occur by direct stimulation of acinar cells by cholecystokinin and not via the indirect release of acetylcholine from neuronal tissue (that might have potentially adhered to the acinar cells during separation) by the addition of atropine and tetrodotoxin (3).\n- Avoid the use of polypropylene tubes for the isolation procedure. Polystyrene tubes increased the yield of the isolation significantly, possibly due to single cells and small clusters readily adhering to the polypropylene.\n- Wherever possible, the amount of time during which the pancreas is clamped should be kept to a minimum to prevent ischaemic damage.\n- Original protocols included the addition of 1 mM Benzamidine (Worthington), a cell membrane permeable trypsin inhibitor, to try to avoid any premature intracellular trypsinogen activation and features of acute pancreatitis. However, for simplicity this is no longer used in isolation procedures since if the tissue is of superior quality (as defined in 2.1), the cells should not show intracellular trypsin activation (Fig. 1).\n- During the injection, fat droplets can build up on the surface of the collagenase solution. In this case, the sample should be washed through external solution to remove any fat droplets and returned to a fresh aliquot of collagenase solution. Therefore it is advised to have surplus collagenase solution available.\n- Filtration will necessarily cause a reduction in the number of cells. If the final cell suspension tends to have little or no acinar cells, this step may be omitted to increase yield. In the case of confocal microscopy experiments, any remaining large clumps should not interfere with single cell recordings from acinar cells which can be easily identified visually.\n- Osipchuk YV, Wakui M, Yule DI, Gallacher DV, and Petersen OH.

54	What determines the size and shape of basalt columns?	The size and shape of each column is determined by the rate at which the lava cools and dries, and the speed at which the 'drying front' moves. Slower cooling results in larger columns.

However, upon contact with the air it will im-mediately begin to cool. At first this cooling is extremely rapid and causes a hardened crust to form on top of the lava, which insulates the still liquid lava below. Because the lava is insulated this cooling becomes increasingly slow over time. While you could probably walk on the lava’s crust after about half an hour, thick lava flows can take many years to cool completely and become totally solid.\nWhile the temperature falls the lava dries out, and it’s this drying that causes the solidifying lava to crack and form regular pillars of basalt rock. The size and shape of each column is determined by the rate at which the lava cools and dries, and therefore the speed at which what’s called the ‘drying front’ moves. Scientists from the University of Toronto discovered that the slower the cooling the larger the columns, this probably took more than 100 years to cool fully.\nWe tend to think of this formation of rock to be unique but here are the locations of another 10 similar locations around the world\nFingal\'s Cave on the Isle of Staffa in Scotland\nDevils Postpile National Monument in California\nHexagon Pool in Israel\nSvartifoss Waterfall in Iceland\nTakachiho Gorge in Japan\nLos Prismas Basálticos in Mexico\nCape Stolbchaty in Russia\nLos Organos of the Canary Islands in Spain\nGhenh Da Dia in Vietnam\nBasalt Cliffs of Jeju Island in South Korea\nYou can find more information and photos of these sites at\nGabbro and Basalt\nWhat is Gabbro?\nGabbro is a coarse-grained, dark-colored, intrusive igneous rock.

It is used for everything from crushed stone base materials at construction sites to polished stone counter tops and floor tiles\nWhat is Basalt?\nBasalt is a dark-colored, fine-grained, igneous rock composed mainly of plagioclase and pyroxene minerals. It most commonly forms as an extrusive rock, such as a lava flow, but can also form in small intrusive bodies, such as an igneous dike or a thin sill. It has a composition similar to gabbro. The difference between basalt and gabbro is that basalt is a fine-grained rock while gabbro is a coarse-grained rock.\nGabbros are equivalent in composition to basalts. The difference between the two rock types is their grain size. Basalts are extrusive igneous rocks that cool quickly and have fine-grained crystals. Gabbros are intrusive igneous rocks that cool slowly and have coarse-grained crystals\nIt is often stated that Earth\'s oceanic crust is made-up of basalt. The word ""basalt"" is used because the rocks of the oceanic crust have a ""basaltic"" composition. However; only a thin surface veneer of oceanic crust is basalt. The deeper rocks of the oceanic crust are generally coarser-grained gabbro. Basalt occurs at the surface of the crust because the rocks there have cooled quickly, (in a geological timescale). At greater depth the cooling rate is slower and large crystals have time to develop.\nAs you look at the columns you will notice that some are concave like a seat and some are convex like a pillow this is called horizontal corrugation. The horizontal corrugation or striations on the vertical column surfaces are the result of the stepwise downward advance of the fracture pattern. This means if adjacent columns are unequal in size, the asymmetry of the cooling between the two columns will drive the crack toward the larger column. Hence, the smaller column will form corrugations with convex surfaces, and the facing surface of the larger adjacent column will form concave surfaces. So if you look you should find convex and concave columns next to each other and the smaller of the columns should be the one you feel inclined to sit on.\nOk so now you should be able to answer the questions below.\n- 1) Please describe the stones, I know they are mostly hexagonal, be creative, particularly concentrate on the grain or crystal size\n- 2) Tell me if you think these rocks are basalt or gabbros? (Hint geologically 100 years is the blink of an eye, slowly means 1000 years or more)\n- 3) Some columns are concave, (seat) some convex (pillow). Which tend to have a larger cross section, concave or convex?\nFinally, if you are willing and able please include a photo in your log. It is almost impossible to take an un-amazing (is that a real word?) photo around here so don’t worry about giving away answers.\nThanks for visiting the location;']"	['<urn:uuid:87de58a3-2bf7-4905-ad07-50ba09c6c7c8>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	9	34	1041
55	how much do realtor fees cost and who normally pays them when selling house	Realtor fees typically amount to 5-6% of the sale price, though some agencies charge 4% but provide limited services. The fee is usually split 50-50 between the buyer's and seller's agents. Generally, it's the seller who pays the realtor's fee. Some sellers choose to list and sell the property on their own to avoid these fees. For buyers, using a realtor typically doesn't cost anything, and they usually don't need to sign a contract, allowing them to switch realtors if desired.	['The most common way to buy or sell a home is through realtors (also called an agent). The amount and who pays the realtors fee changes region to region, and country to country. Typically the realtors fee is split 50-50 between the buyer and sellers agent. Generally it’s the seller who pays the realtor’s fee, so sometimes sellers list and sell the property on their own. If this is the case, than it doesn’t cost a buyer to use a realtor, and there typically isn’t a contract established before hand, so if you don’t like your realtor you can leave.\nHowever if you use realtors to sell your home, than there is a contract that determines how long you have to stay with them, and how much you have to pay them. Generally the amount is 5-6%. There are a few agencies that take 4% but limit the amount of help they give you.\nThe problem with the lower fees is some buyers agents will not show clients property where there potential fee is limited to 1-2%. Realtors buy-in-large are worth the effort, since a good agent will increase the time and likelihood of your property selling, or you buying the right property.\nHow do I find a “good” realtor?\nRealtors can pretty much be found everywhere, but good ones are not. Remember it’s fairly easy to become a realtor and usually only need a few weeks or months of training. Here are four things to look for:\n1. Make sure they work full-time, and have been in the industry for a while. There are many who work part-time, have just started, or have jobs “on the side”. However, one must remember this, “if they were any good at what they do, they wouldn’t have to work at another job on the side”.\n2. Make sure the realtors you choose have experience and works with a reputable agency. It is important that the realtors and their company have experience in both the location (region) you want, and the kind (residential, multi-family, commercial) you want. It is also important to make sure the realtor, and agency is reputable. This can be done by calling the local realtors association, checking out the Better Business Bureau, Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, looking up references, and going online to research the current and past activities of the company.\n3. Make sure the realtors have in writing what they do for their clients. If the agent is too lazy to put things in writing, and only verbally tells you what they are going to do, than you had better find another realtor. Most realtors should at least make sure you are listed on some type of (MLS) Multiple Listing Service, LoopNet (more for multi-family and commercial properties), their own website, and various other online advertisements.\nThis ensures both realtors and people can find out the basic information about your property. The other things they should do is put up appropriate signage and informational boxes on the property, place advertisements in the local papers or magazines, put the property on local realtor drive-bys so other agents can see and show the property, open houses for the public, and place advertisements on free sites like Craigslist, bulletin boards, partner realtor sites etc.\n4 Make sure they are willing to list the selling or buying price at you are comfortable with. This does not mean that we can put any price on a property, and we should be willing to listen to the expertise of the person. Work with your realtor to determine what price you want the listing contract, or buying contract to be, and how much you are willing to negotiate. However in the end you have to live with the consequences and not them.\nI hear the term escrow all the time, what is escrow?\nHow do I know if the property is a good deal and what is an appraisal?\nA home inspection is not typically required by a bank or as part of escrow, but is a good idea. A home inspector is usually hired by the buyer to determine the overall condition of a home and to point out safety concerns with a structure (not environmental concerns). The inspector is a generalist (not code inspector) who performs a site visit, and then puts together a written report.A buyer can attend and walk along with the inspector, or come at the end if they choose. The inspection basically covers the structure, roof, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, interior, exterior and basic site work of the home.\nThey may or may not give recommendations, and most will not try to persuade you to buy or not buy the home. They are hired to basically provide overall assessment on the basic condition of the visible components on the home. A commercial building inspection is typically done on certain parts of a building that the potential buyer or seller is concerned with. Sometimes they include all the exterior, interior and site work. Other times they might include only the exterior, or roof, or electrical components. These may also include recommendations for repair, quotes on financial costs for repairs, potential safety concerns, conformance to various codes etc.\nMore articles on Buying a Home.']	['<urn:uuid:f8acd510-6603-4f17-a207-5b317cc925db>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	14	81	875
56	cases when continued sterilization baby bottles necessary beyond first use	Continued sterilization of baby bottles beyond first use is necessary in several specific cases: 1) When using old bottles borrowed from others or hand-me-downs from older siblings 2) When the baby was recently sick, to prevent reinfection from bacteria that might have stuck to the bottle 3) For premature babies, infants less than 3 months old, or babies with compromised immunity due to conditions like HIV or medical treatments like chemotherapy 4) When lacking access to good-quality municipal drinking water or when traveling to countries with unreliable water sources.	['The best way for a new mother to establish a nurturing bond with her baby is through breastfeeding. But sooner or later, you will have to switch to other alternatives for feeding your baby. Nursing becomes quite inconvenient when you are running low on breast milk, are in the throes of illness, or are nearing the end of your maternity leave and have to shuffle between work and home.\nYour baby’s need to breastfeed can be gradually phased out by switching to a bottle, which is the natural progression that most new parents adopt. Perhaps the greatest comfort associated with bottle feeding is that it can be done by anybody at home, not just the mother. The most prominent con, however, is the effort that goes into cleaning and sterilizing the bottle.\nAfter remaining cocooned in the warm confines of the womb, infants take their own sweet time to adapt and adjust to the foreign environment of the outer world. Moreover, their immune system is still very nascent and underprepared to take on even the everyday germs and bacteria that are usually harmless to adults.\nThus, cleanliness with regard to everything your baby comes in contact with cannot be stressed enough. One key aspect of maintaining such sanitary standards is to keep your baby’s feeding equipment both clean and sterilized.\nThe mouth is the primary entry point to the body, so it is imperative that you take extra care of what your child is putting in his/her mouth. Sterilization goes a long way in eliminating any trace of microbes from your baby’s feeding bottles and cleaning them thoroughly.\nReasons to Sterilize Baby Bottles\nBabies have to be shielded from the all-pervasive disease-carrying agents that riddle the environment, particularly in the initial few months after birth. Keeping your baby’s bottle and its accessories squeaky clean is one such way to ensure the health and well-being of your tiny, vulnerable being.\nBe it a glass, plastic, or silicone bottle, cleaning and sterilizing this feeding equipment is essential for the following reasons:\n- It is very easy for pathogenic microorganisms to accumulate and thrive within the damp insides of the bottle. Bottles that have had milk stored in them and are not cleaned properly thereafter offer perfect breeding grounds for disease-causing bacteria and viruses. Subsequently, these microorganisms can gain easy access into your baby’s body, which can lead to bouts of vomiting, diarrhea, and other infections and illnesses.\n- A newborn possesses only those disease-fighting antibodies that have been passed on from the mother during the last three months of pregnancy. This form of passive immunity begins to wane in the first few months after birth.\n- The water supply at your home may be contaminated with disease-causing microbes or other impurities, especially if you do not use municipal treated water.\nWhen to Sterilize Baby Bottles\nIt is a common misconception that brand-new, unused baby bottles are devoid of any germs and are safe to use without being cleaned first. However, you can never be too sure about where the bottle has been and how it was handled before it was packaged and sold to you.\nBesides, a lot of chemicals go into the manufacturing of these bottles, and they are exposed to a lot of possibly germ-ridden hands in the factory, during shipping, and in stores before they reach you.\nIt is highly likely that even if a bottle has never been used, it might still have a lot of toxic and infectious agents latched onto its surface.\nThus, when you buy a fresh new bottle, it is recommended to sterilize it after rinsing it with hot, soapy water, either by hand or in your dishwasher. This kind of thorough cleaning serves in the interest of your baby’s health and safety as it rids the bottle of any surface grime and germs.\nThe initial sterilization effect will wear out after some time and the feeding supplies will eventually start picking up germs from your home.\nSterilizing baby bottles is a necessary step beyond traditional cleaning to safeguard your child from germs. It aims at killing bacteria and other disease-carrying agents in the bottle through the use of chemicals and high temperature.\nThere was a time when the need for sterilizing your baby’s bottle was far more pressing than it is today. With the steady improvement in water quality, particularly in the developed world, most homes are now supplied with relatively safe and reliable water sources. As a result, the need for sterilizing bottles beyond the first use seems redundant except in certain cases, such as:\n- If you’re using an old bottle that has been borrowed from someone else or is a hand-me-down from an older sibling of the baby, sterilization is mandatory to dispel any pathogenic traces.\n- If your baby was recently sick, chances are some of the disease-causing bacteria might have stuck on the bottle, and using it without sterilizing might end up reinfecting the baby.\n- If your baby had a premature birth, is less than 3 months old, or has compromised immunity due to health issues such as HIV or ongoing medical treatment such as chemotherapy, daily sterilization is all the more important to ensure his/her health and well-being.\n- If you don’t have access to good-quality municipal drinking water that isn’t coming from a well or you’re traveling to a country with unreliable water sources, you may need to sterilize your baby’s bottles every so often to avoid the buildup of harmful microbes.\nFrequency of Sterilizing Baby Bottles\nWhile most experts agree upon the importance of sterilization, there are varying opinions regarding how many times it should be done.\nIf your baby is otherwise healthy and you wish to keep it that way, washing the bottles in a dishwasher with a heat cycle or scrubbing them by hand in hot, soapy water as soon as your baby is done feeding should suffice to keep the germs away.\nOnce your baby crosses 3 months of age, you can do without the daily sterilization given that the feeding items are carefully cleaned after every use.\nIf, however, the bottle is left uncleaned for a few hours after your baby last used it, that’s all the time it takes for bacteria and virus to fester. In such instances, most child experts recommend subjecting your child’s feeding items to a second round of sterilization.\nSome experts incline towards a more cautious approach that calls for regular sterilization, once every week. Given that sterilizing your baby’s feeding equipment is a pretty straightforward process that can be easily managed within half an hour, it’s not a big ask when we consider what’s at stake. Just the peace of mind in knowing that you are doing the best you can to keep your little one out of harm’s way is well worth the effort.\nPre-Sterilization Ritual: Cleaning Bottle-Feeding Equipment\nYou can avoid the need to sterilize your baby’s bottle-feeding equipment frequently by cleaning it after every feed. Besides, cleaning the bottles, teats, and other feeding equipment in hot, soapy water is also an essential prerequisite of the sterilization process.\nHere is a step-by-step guide for successfully completing the presterilization regimen:\n- First and foremost, wash your hands with soapy water and dry them with a clean towel. If you detect any cracks in the bottle’s teat, discard it at once as bacteria can easily flourish in the tears.\n- Cleaning bottles, teats, and other feeding equipment often involves using a bottle brush that can reach the narrow insides of the bottle and teat to scrub out any dried milk stuck on the surface. To clean the small opening in the teat, squirt water through it.\n- Turn the teat inside out and wash it in hot soapy water for a more thorough cleaning. It is preferable to scrub the teats separately by hand, rather than in a dishwasher.\n- If you choose to clean your baby’s feeding equipment in the dishwasher, make sure the bottles, lids, and teats are facing downwards to clean them.\n- Lastly, rinse all the cleaned equipment with fresh cold running water before setting aside to air-dry.\nThis preliminary form of cleaning is important for removing all traces of milk or formula left inside the bottles, but it does not ensure that the feeding equipment is completely sterile or germ-free.\nStandard Methods of Sterilizing Baby Bottles\nThere are a number of different methods to sterilize your baby’s bottles, teats, lids, and other feeding equipment. You can pick and choose from any of the tried-and-tested options given below, depending on what’s most convenient for you.\n1. Sterilization by Boiling\nThe mechanism behind sterilization through boiling water works by raising the temperature high enough to kill any bacteria left over after washing. This is perhaps the simplest form of sterilization and does not require any special equipment. A basic kitchen pan or pot and clean water are all you need for this method to work. .\nHowever, before you proceed with this method, make sure that the feeding equipment that you want to sterilize is safe to boil.\n- Fill an adequately sized pot or pan with sufficient water to cover the feeding equipment that you intend to sterilize.\n- Immerse the freshly washed feeding equipment in it such that there are no air traps.\n- Cover the pan with a heavy plate or lid that almost touches the surface of the water.\n- Place the pan on a stove burner set on high, and bring the water to a boil.\n- Let the water boil for at least 10 minutes, and set a timer so you don’t forget to turn the heat off.\n- If you plan to prepare the bottle right away, clean your hands and the kitchen surface beforehand. In fact, disinfecting your hands before handling any sterilized equipment is mandatory regardless.\n- Use sterilized tongs to pull out the equipment from the pan. To that end, you may want to plunge the tongs into the water while it was boiling and leave them be for some time. Once the heat is turned off, allow the tongs to cool off a bit so that you don’t burn yourself in trying to hold them.\n- As soon as you take the equipment out, assemble the lids and teats on the bottles straightaway.\n- Give the bottle a shake to get rid of the dripping water, if you need to use them right after sterilization.\n- If there is no urgency, place the bottle on a dry, clean dishcloth in an upside-down position or on the upturned lid of the pan to get rid of the excess water and allow them to air-dry.\n- Once dry, refrigerate the bottles with the teat on in a clean container to prevent contamination.\n2. Using the Microwave\nMicrowave sterilization works on the principle of using steam power to sterilize baby bottles and teats. As microwaves that are in regular household use invite a lot of food spills, they are often hygienically unfit for conducting a sterilization process.\nThere are, however, specially designed sterilization units available in the market that also harness the power of steam. Such units enclose the bottles in a plastic casing, giving them a more thorough cleaning inside the microwave.\n- Whether you are using a microwave steam sterilizer or a standard kitchen microwave, make sure that all the feeding equipment is thoroughly cleaned before beginning the sterilization process.\n- You will also want to make sure that the insides of your microwave are devoid of any food residue.\n- When using a regular microwave, fill a bowl with water such that the feeding bottle, teats, rings, caps, and other accessories get submerged in it.\n- Place the bowl in the microwave set on high for about 3-4 minutes.\n- Use clean, dry oven mitts to remove the equipment from the microwave. Dump the remaining water, and let the equipment air-dry on a sanitary surface. Alternatively, you can also wait for the feeding items to return to normal temperature so that you can handle them with your bare but clean hands.\n3. Using Bleach\nBleach offers another nifty way to sterilize your baby’s bottle when you’re in a crunch situation, without any access to the basic amenities required for standard sterilization such as boiling water, steam, or a dishwasher. This easy-to-do method involves the following steps:\n- Mix 1 teaspoon of unscented bleach in 16 cups of hot water.\n- Immerse the feeding equipment in the solution in such a way that there isn’t any air bubble formation at the bottom of the bottle.\n- Soak the bottle for 2–5 minutes, and then pull them out of the solution using sterilized tongs.\n- Place the damp bottles on a clean dish towel and allow them to air dry.\n- As any remaining traces of bleach will naturally breakdown during the drying process, there’s no need for a follow-up rinse once the bottle is taken out of the solution.\n4. Try Cold Sterilization\nParents who are always on the move and rely on a baby bottle sterilizer may find themselves without access to electricity or boiling water while being out and about. Cold sterilization is perfect in such situations.\n- Add a sterilizing solution or tablet (available from supermarkets) to a clean plastic bucket or tub of water, and then plunge the baby items in it.\n- Keep the items submerged underwater for at least 30 minutes or preferably longer.\n- The same water and solution can be safely reused as needed but should be changed after 24 hours.\n5. Avail an Electric Sterilizer\nAn electric sterilizer is one of the most convenient tools for sterilizing your baby’s bottle. This device gets the job done in no time and with minimum effort. High-temperature steam is used to kill the microorganisms in the bottles and teats.\n- Simply place the cleaned baby bottles and teats into the sterilizing unit. Make sure the mouth of the bottle and teats are facing downward to allow efficient sterilization. Pour clean filtered water as instructed in the user manual.\n- Switch on the device. Switch it off once the sterilization is complete.\n- Go through the user manual to check for instructions regarding how long the bottles can be kept inside.\nElectric sterilizers are far more efficient than boiling or microwave methods as they obliterate the chances of any human fallacy.\nUsing UV Light\nUV light can kill most microorganisms ranging from bacteria and viruses to mold populations. Working on this principle, UV light sterilizers can help you sterilize the teat of your baby’s feeding bottle.\nAlthough this method cannot sterilize your child’s feeding bottle, it is a small, lightweight portable instrument that can help you out while traveling.\n- Always be alert when using hot or boiling liquids, especially if there are children in the house. Never leave them unattended or within reach of children to stave off burning accidents or injuries.\n- Be mindful when using steam for sterilization as it can burn or scald you just as badly as boiling water.\n- Store chemicals and chemical solutions in places that are beyond the reach of children.\n- If you do not wash your hands thoroughly before handling equipment that has been sterilized, you risk transferring any lingering germs from your hand to the freshly sterilized bottle. This single lapse can undo all your concerted efforts and must be avoided.\n- Masood MSA. Scientia Ricerca Inviting Innovations.

57	How do California and French wineries differ in showing the importance of where their grapes are grown, and what makes each location special for growing grapes?	Both regions recognize the importance of location ('terroir') but show it differently. In Burgundy, there's a complex classification system with over 600 appellations based on specific vineyard sites, while California demonstrates terroir through distinctive wines like Ridge Monte Bello from Santa Cruz Mountains versus Stag's Leap from Napa Valley. The special growing conditions in each location affect wine characteristics - for example, Burgundy's limestone soils produce distinctive Chardonnays, while Santa Barbara's east-west coastline creates a Mediterranean climate perfect for ripening grapes, resulting in full-bodied, rich wines.	"['Burgundy is one of the world’s most intriguing wine regions, best known for its exceptional Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays produced in an awe-inspiring array of styles. With its multitude of appellations and vineyards, each having a unique terrain, Burgundy offers an unsurpassed study in the highly sensitive nature of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay to various growing conditions. While Pinot Noir and Chardonnay are the most renowned of Burgundy’s grape varietals, the red Gamay and white Aligoté are also among the main grapes grown in the region. Gamay is the star of the Beaujolais region, flourishing in the granite soils there, and Aligoté is mainly used in sparkling wines.\nDeciphering Burgundy’s classification system can be confusing, to say the least. When examining a wine list or an individual wine label, different vineyard names can appear next to a single village name, which is further complicated (thanks to Napoleonic Law) by the various vineyards having multiple owners, each producing their own wines for better or worse. Understanding Burgundy’s nomenclature and the characteristic styles of each region will give you an upper hand when shopping for your next bottle. So, how does the system work and what should we look for on the label?\nFirst, let’s get acquainted with the five regions of Burgundy. From north to south, these are: Chablis, Côte d’Or (Côte de Nuits & Côte de Beaune), Côte Chalonnaise, Mâconnais and Beaujolais. Burgundy’s classification system is quite unique and is significantly different than that of Bordeaux. In Bordeaux, individual producers (château), are awarded Premier Cru or Grand Cru classifications, while in Burgundy, these classifications are given to individual vineyard sites, which are then elevated to Appellation Contrôlée (AC) status. Thus, Bordeaux has about 60 appellations compared to Burgundy’s 600 plus!\nIn ascending order, Burgundy’s hierarchy begins with Regional Appellation Contrôlées (ACs), which always include the word Bourgogne in their name. There are generic Bourgognes, which can come from anywhere in Burgundy, such as Bourgogne Rouge and Bourgogne Blanc, as well as more exclusive regional ACs; i.e. Bourgogne Hautes-Côtes de Beaune.\nThe next step up the ladder are District ACs, which exclude the word Bourgogne in their title and are named according to the wine regions of Burgundy. District ACs include Chablis, Mâcon, Côte de Chalonnaise, and so on.\nVillage (a.k.a. Commune) Appellations\nNext up, we have Village Appellations, which are named after specific villages and divided into two groups: non-Premier Cru villages and the more elite Premier Cru villages. The name of the village (commune) will always appear on the label and will sometimes be accompanied by a specific vineyard, if the wine comes from only one vineyard site. However, if the vineyard is not Premier Cru, its name will appear in smaller print on the label.\nPremier Cru Appellations\nPremier Crus are esteemed single-vineyard appellations, which explains the plethora of ACs in Burgundy. To further complicate things, each vineyard (called climat in Burgundy) can have multiple owners, each producing their own wine. A vineyard under sole-ownership is distinguished as monopole on the wine label. Premier Cru status will almost always appear in print on the label, but may sometimes be designated by the village and vineyard name sharing the same font size.\nGrand Cru Appellations\nFinally, at the very top, we have the most prestigious Burgundies of all, those distinguished as Grand Cru appellations. There are a total of 33 Grand Crus, one in Chablis, and the remaining 32 in Côte de Nuits and Côte de Beaune, along the Côte d’Or. Labels of Grand Cru wines simply state the vineyard name, since these names are so well recognized in the region. For example, Chambertin and Montrachet are Grand Cru vineyards, located in Côte de Nuits and Côte de Beaune respectively.\nWhen considering the wines from the Côte d’Or, we encounter a number of hyphenated names, such as Gevrey-Chambertin and Puligny-Montrachet. The reason for this? In the early 1900s, some of the villages along the Côte d’Or decided to hyphenate their village name to their very best vineyard, in order to increase sales of their village wines. In the case of Puligny-Montrachet, Puligny is the village, and Montrachet is the Grand Cru vineyard.\nWine Styles by Region\nChablis, always 100% Chardonnay, is arguably the most elegant expression of this grape in the world. This northern-most region in Burgundy, located in the valley of the Serein River, has a challenging, cool climate, which is reflected in its wines. The soils of the region are predominantly limestone, with the best wines, the Grand Cru and Premier Crus coming specifically from Kimmeridgian limestone. Characteristically, the wines of the region are lighter bodied, with citrus and green fruit flavors, high acidity, and refreshing minerality.\nThe “Golden Slopes” are so named because the vineyard leaves turn a brilliant gold color at the end of the growing season, after harvest. To the north, the Côte de Nuits produces full-bodied, age-worthy, Pinot Noirs that are second to none. These Pinots offer aromas and flavors of cherry, raspberry and strawberry that evolve into savory, gamey characteristics. To the south, the Côte de Beaune produces some of the world’s most complex, premium Chardonnays as well as lighter styled Pinot Noirs. These Chardonnays are fermented and aged in new French oak and can age beautifully for a decade. They have a fuller body, intriguing texture and unrivaled complexity.\nThe Côte Chalonnaise produces Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays that are similar to those of the Côte d’Or, but at lower price points.\nFarther south in the Mâcon region, Chardonnay is King. Thriving in the warmer climate and limestone soils, these wines are characteristically rich and full-bodied with ripe citrus flavors. The most distinguished wine of the region is Poully-Fuissé, offering aromas and flavors of peach and melon, and savory qualities from barrel aging in new French oak.\nBeaujolais is home to the Gamay grape, which produces fruity red wines that taste of cherry and raspberry. A special winemaking technique called carbonic maceration can impart unique aromas of bananas, bubblegum and sweet spice. Beaujolais often gets dismissed as a less than serious wine region that produces insipid Beaujolais Nouveau, the youthful wine released each year on the third Thursday of November. However, there are those of us who appreciate the fun, fruity character of Beaujolais Nouveau, and find the presence of banana aromas in wine to be more interesting than off-putting. Wines labeled as Beaujolais-Villages AC come from the villages in the north of the region and make up a quarter of production. The Beaujolais Crus are the most distinct, highest quality wines of the region. There are ten cru villages in total: Saint-Amour, Juliénas, Chénas, Moulin à Vent, Chiroubles, Fleurie, Morgan, Régnié, Côte de Brouilly and Brouilly.\nTerroir and Burgundy’s Classification System\nTerroir is a French term that encompasses the individual soil, landscape and climate of a particular growing region. This concept is the backbone of Burgundy’s classification system. The Cistercian monks, who began acquiring vineyards in the region during the 11th century, were the first to explore, observe and record the affects of terroir on grape growing. Discovering the influence of individual growing sites led the Cistercians to begin recognizing the various Crus. Consequently, the Burgundian classification system, with its scores of appellations, was born.\nCLICK HERE to browse our entire selection of wines from Burgundy.\nThe concept of terroir is not exclusive to the great vineyards of Burgundy and Barolo. Anyone who has tasted through and experienced the so-called great growths of Northern California cabernet will immediately recognize the difference between the elegance of the Ridge Monte Bello, from high atop the Santa Cruz Mountains and the richness of wines of Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars, from the heart of Napa Valley.\nJust because a wine is without hundreds of years of history does not mean terroir is inapplicable. Napa Valley wineries demonstrated this at the Judgment of Paris in 1976.\nA similar situation is beginning to emerge in Santa Barbara, encompassing the AVAs of Santa Maria Valley, Santa Ynez Valley, Sta. Rita Hills. Despite the popularity pinot noir from Sideways, winegrowers and winemakers, to date, have had most success with the Rhône varietals of syrah and grenache for reds, and viognier, marsanne, and roussanne for whites. The Burgundian nomenclature of labeling with specific vineyards has also taken hold, with Bien Nacido, Thompson, Stolpman and Larner becoming more and more familiar to the consumer.\nJaffurs, located in heart of the city, is an urban winery that uses only purchased grapes from the best of these vineyards in Santa Barbara. The winery excels in single vineyards syrahs, as well as small\nproductions of viognier, roussane, and grenache blanc from the famed Thompson Vineyard. Tasting through these wines, the sense of place is not lost. Santa Barbara is located on an east-west stretch of the Pacific coast line, and its climate is decidedly Mediterranean, and the city has the moniker of the American Riviera. As such, the grapes have no trouble ripening, and the resulting wine should be full-bodied, supple, and rich.\nJaffurs does not shy away from this bold style involving high alcohol levels, which in recent years, has seen a backlash from the wine community for being extracted and difficult to pair with food. These criticisms are valid to a certain extent, but the key for any wine is still balance above all else, and Jaffurs achieves it splendidly. Its wines retain a firm structure and vibrant acidity. The judicious use of oak, mostly involving used, year-old barrels, complements a dark, rich expression of syrah, without masking the primary fruit and peppery qualities.\nWinemakers often aspire to make their favorite wines. And more often than not, unfortunately, the result is a wine without identity. In this case, Jaffurs might be expected to look to the Hermitage or Côte-Rôtie for inspiration. One taste of its syrahs should make its intentions clear: this is a big, badass syrah from Santa Barbara; if you would like a wine that reminds you of the Northern Rhône, go buy a wine from the Northern Rhône. These wines make no apologies for being what it is, and nor should they.', ""By Mark Andrew MW\nOne of the things that separates the wine enthusiast from the casual drinker is the importance of place, or more specifically the concept of ‘terroir’ – a French word that has no direct translation into English, but has been described as the ‘location, location, location’ of wine.\nWhen I was first getting into wine, I was fascinated by the idea that if presented with two different bottles that looked the same, cost the same and came from the same grape variety, I would usually prefer one of them to the other. The question of why this might be turned me from someone that enjoyed drinking wine into someone that started thinking about wine. The answer turned out to be terroir.\nTerroir is the combination of factors that, when brought together, make one vineyard (and hopefully the resulting wine) different to another. Many different things can have an effect on terroir – climate, soil type, vineyard altitude and indigenous flora and fauna to name but a few. Essentially we are talking about the specific characteristics of the land and microclimate that mark a given site or region as unique.\nBut how much can this affect what we taste in the bottle? Well, quite a significant amount. Remember that the wine that we drink is a direct product of the fruit that is harvested. If all that fruit comes from a specific vineyard that is steep, close to a body of water and composed of gravelly soils that have excellent drainage, then the resulting wine will be very different to that made of fruit from an inland vineyard with clay-rich soil on a flatter aspect. Is this not just the difference between a good vineyard and a bad vineyard? Well, no – in this example the first vineyard sounds like it would be perfect for Cabernet Sauvignon, whereas the second may be more suitable for Merlot. And matching the grape variety to the terroir when planting the vines will give you even better fruit come harvest time.\nTerroir is a national obsession in France, where they created an entire bureaucracy based on geography, called Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC). The AOC system began back in the 1930s when the Baron de Ley decided he would propose regulations to govern the production methods and geographic boundaries of his beloved Châteuaneuf-du-Pape. The Baron was furious at the growing volume of wine from outside the area that was being fraudulently bottled as Châteauneuf, particularly as the large stones (called ‘galets’) throughout the vineyards created a unique terroir. These large pebbles soaked up the heat of the sun during the day and then radiated warmth to the low-trained vines during the night, meaning that the fruit in Châteauneuf would invariably ripen far better than in other areas, giving wines of greater body and richness.\nToday the AOC system has been expanded beyond wine to include spirits, cheese, chickens and even lentils.\nIt is important to remember that the 300 or so wine appellations are not necessarily a guarantee of quality, only a guarantee of authenticity, and herein lies the problem. Whether or not the galets of Châteauneuf or the Kimmeridge clay of Chablis infuse character into their respective wines, this alone will never ensure a quality bottle of wine. Only a combination of great terroir, enlightened winemaking and favourable vintage conditions will do that. There are even those that dispute the entire notion of terroir and would have you believe that it is the human influence that dictates the intrinsic quality of a wine, but where’s the romance in that?\nWe sell wine that offers quality and value at every level, from the everyday to the extraordinary.

58	sailboat interior storage space constraints design solutions	Sailboat interior storage presents significant constraints, with a 150-foot sailboat having half the interior space of a similar-length powerboat due to curved hulls and equipment. Designers like Munford create illusions of more space using 7/8 scale furniture and cambered ceilings. Storage solutions must accommodate items like laptops, sleeping bags, luggage, sweaters, liquor, food, and leave 20% empty space for new items, while also having below-deck storage for major items like liferaft, dinghy, and outboard.	"['You could comfortably live year-round in a sailboat designed by John Munford, enjoying the wide-open galley, the gadget-filled saloon, the mahogany paneling, and the cherry furniture. Still, even the most finely appointed and well-equipped sailboat has characteristics that you wouldn’t want in your home—the paucity of natural light, the absence of freestanding furniture, the tendency to heel and sway in strong winds.\nSome features can’t be adapted to your wishes, so instead, you must adapt to your surroundings. “It’s as if you bought a 14th-century house in England. If you’re 6 foot 5, you would duck going through the doorway—you wouldn’t cut it out,” says Munford, principal of John Munford Design, an English firm that specializes in sailboat interior design. “You’re fitting into the history of it. Yachting has the same sort of effect. You know it has to perform in a particular way.”\nWhile a 150-foot powerboat and a 150-foot sailboat are identical in length, the size of the latter’s interior, because of its curved hull and equipment that must be crammed belowdecks, is usually half that of its power counterpart. “There are far more curves to deal with, whereas powerboat spaces can be more rectangular,” says Glade Johnson, president of Glade Johnson Design, a Washington-based firm. “With a sailboat, it’s like working in a bathtub.”\nFrom Homer the poet of ancient Greece to Homer the 19th-century painter, sailing has been romanticized, etching in our consciences a certain look—swooping lines, mahogany interiors, spartan staterooms—that each vessel must conform to. The designer’s challenge is to craft not only a comfortable, modern interior with all of today’s technology, but one that also embraces sailing’s historical elegance. “If you’re looking at a traditional sailboat, that’s the perception of what is beautiful,” says Bill Dixon, managing director of Dixon Yacht Design, another English firm. “You might not say a modern sailboat is beautiful, but you would say it’s functional.”\nSome owners, builders, and design firms, despite the logistical challenges and preconceptions of what a sailboat should look like, are willing to try innovative looks, sometimes blending traditional concepts with modern ideas. Robert Miller, the owner of Mari Cha III, a 145-foot sailboat built by Sensation New Zealand, wanted to sail fast—very fast. Miller, who hired Munford as the interior designer, hoped to set the west-to-east transatlantic record by a monohull sailboat, so he needed Mari Cha III to be as light as possible. The sailboat’s total weight was set at 115 tons, and the interior was capped at 6.5 tons (the average interior of a similar-size boat is 20 tons).\nMunford designed the main saloon and guest cabins so that the compartments could be removed for racing. He used as little steel as possible, and created interior paneling using lightweight woods with mahogany veneer. In 1998, Mari Cha IIIsucceeded in breaking the record by completing the 2,925-mile transatlantic journey in eight days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, and 41 seconds. “Even the reading had to be light,” jokes Munford. “It was certainly a challenge, but for her to get the record for the transatlantic was a highlight. She did what she was meant to do. Looking at the boat, you would not know it was lightweight.”\nWhile some owners have their sailboats built for spray-soaked racing, others opt for designs that are more suited for leisurely cruising. London-based Andrew Winch Designs is working on a 130-foot sloop that serves as both a home and a performance-oriented craft. The owners plan to sail around the world for two years on the sailboat, along with their five children, two teachers, and six crewmembers—and they want to sail fast. The boat has a sleek, low structure to give it speed, and the interior, which is made of maple, includes a library in which the children can study and a saloon for social activities. “The lower saloon area is more of an introspective space,” says designer Andrew Winch. “They can look at each other and talk, but they can also watch TV, read, and play card games.”\nThe owners of Freya, an 80-foot Alloy Yachts vessel, ordered a piano for their sailboat, and Dixon designed an interior that would accommodate the instrument and amplify the sound. Dixon also worked on Hanseat IV, an 80-foot Austral Yachts sailboat that features a traditional solid, fielded-panel interior with detailed woodwork, and something else that contributes to the vessel’s old-world feel: a gas fireplace. “What a nightmare,” says Dixon. “It must be the most expensive small fire ever built. It’s easy in a house, but it’s bloody difficult to get in a sailboat.”\nDespite Dixon’s complaints, he and other interior designers prefer intrepid owners who are willing to take chances. Most sailboats have small windows that are almost always above your sight line when you sit down in a lounge or cabin. But the owner of Georgia, a 159-foot Alloy Yachts sailboat, broke from the norm and told Johnson that he wanted to look down on the water from the boat’s windows. Johnson accommodated the request and maintained the vessel’s low profile by designing larger windows.\nGeorgia’s owner also wanted the sail equipment to be hidden below the deck, an unusual feature on sailboats. Johnson had to devise special compartments, so he designed containers similar to 50-gallon drums in which to store the equipment unobtrusively belowdecks. “If you get an owner who’s willing to do something that’s challenging from the technical side, things that have been thought to be totally traditional can change,” Johnson says. “You come up with something that provides a heightened sense of enjoyment for the owner.”\nThe typical sailboat owner has grown up on sailboats and knows exactly how they work, says Bruce King, president of Bruce King Yacht Design in Newcastle, Maine. “They see the boat as entirely separate and not connected to their home,” he says. “They want it to be a completely different environment. It’s a boat, not an extension to a house. That’s the main difference between a powerboat and a sailboat.”\n“They’re enthusiasts,” adds Dixon. “In general, they’re more detailed people. It’s very much a hands-on process for them. They really get involved, more so than motorboat owners. By nature, the client is more demanding and wants to get more intensely involved.”\nHis clients’ knowledge and familiarity with sailboats do not preclude Munford from playing visual tricks on them. Because interior real estate is precious, Munford creates the illusion that there is more space than there actually is. For a 125-foot sailboat, for example, Munford designs furniture that is 7/8 scale. The slightly shrunken chairs, tables, and couches fulfill their functions while making a cabin, saloon, dining area, or stateroom seem larger than it is.\nMunford also always designs his interiors with cambered ceilings, because level ceilings can give a space a greater feeling of enclosure. Skylights also add natural light and expand the sense of openness in a cabin. Yet cozy confines, while restrictive at times, can give a sailboat a more intimate atmosphere. “The thing about sailing boats is that they have a feeling to them,” says Munford. “You have to work on it. In it. With it. Rather than it simply surrounding you like a hotel, the whole working thing functions around you.”\nAlthough designing a sailboat can provide much pleasure, the process can also initiate an addiction that might be hard to shake. Johnson says most of his clients get more pleasure from helping to design their boats than from sailing them. “Once the boats are finished, they enjoy them, but they miss the process,” says Johnson. “Not too long after, they’re back and thinking, ‘What can we do next time?’ ”\nPhotography by Martin Fine, Bugsy Gedlek, Ivor Wilkins, and Michael Ng.', 'There is probably nothing like \'the\nideal cruising yacht\', but after more than 14 years of doing it, we will stick our necks\nout and give our opinions.\n- A feature on\nAn ideal cruising yacht depends on composition, age, and fitness of the crew,\narea to be visited and a thousand other factors.

59	I'm learning about art history. What Jewish art emerged after 1917?	After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the ban on Yiddish and Hebrew publications was lifted, leading to a flourishing of avant-garde Jewish art. Artists like El Lissitzky, Natan Altman, and Chagall began illustrating Yiddish poetry and journals. Specifically, Chagall created illustrations for a book called 'Troyer', featuring images of empty villages, funerals, and gravestones that reflected the Jewish struggle in Ukraine during the Civil War.	['After the Revolution of 1917 in Russia, the ban on Yiddish and Hebrew publications was rescinded, and many avant-garde artists (including El Lissitzky, Natan Altman and Chagall) illustrated Yiddish poetry and journals. Chagall created the cover, title page and 6 illustrations of “Troyer”, which is a book of poems that reflect upon the struggle of the Jews in the Ukraine during the recent Civil War. Chagall’s illustrations–empty villages, funerals and gravestones–evoke the emptiness and loss that he was feeling in his own life, having just lost the position as head of the Vitebsk Popular Art Institute to Malevich. This was one of the last projects he worked on in Russia, before leaving.\nThe conservation problems was seemed fairly straightforward; the front cover was detached, the staples were rusting and causing damage to the paper and the paper itself was quite fragile and brittle. There was surface soiling to the text and numerous small tears.\nBut because this belonged to a dealer, the treatment discussion raised some interesting points concerning custodianship. I prefer this term to ownership, because it highlights the temporal nature of our relationship to the objects that we have acquired– in most cases they will outlast us.\nA dealer has a very short period of custodianship– he acquires a piece in order to sell it. Collectors purchase objects for a variety of reasons, sometimes to flip them at for a profit in a short time, often to keep them longer. Institutions tend to keep objects the longest, but that is changing. This dealer wanted the cover reattached in order to sell the book, but the acidic paper and rusting staples were also causeing damage.\nI often counsel dealers to do as little as possible, and in particular avoid superficial aesthetic repairs that could mislead potential buyers to the actual condition, and let the purchaser decide what is the best for the object. If a the purchaser of this book would come to me at a later date, I might recommend removing the staples, repairing the damaged areas, and replacing them with visually similar but chemically inert replacement- such as painted thread of the same dimensions. And once the staples were removed, a more careful examination of the paper could take place and other possible treatments considered. If an institution purchased the item, they might want a different approach– removing the staples and leaving it in that state for display of all the Chagall illustrations, for example. This would solve the problem of the active deterioration around the staples and allow considerations for future treatment options to take place at a later date. Experiments could take place in developing an isolating layer around the rusting staples that would allow them to be replaced without causing further damage. For every item, there are a variety of treatment possibilities that meet the AIC’s Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice. Sometimes treatment decisions are driven by the larger context in which the item resides, not for reasons inherent to the object itself.\nIn this case, very delicate minor hinging was done, bridging the torn paper under the staples, without detaching or disturbing them and reattaching the front to the back cover. The text was lightly surface cleaned and tears repaired. In this situation, choosing the least invasive treatment route kept all the physical information intact for the next custodian to determine what was best for the object. It is the conservators duty advocate for the object, attempt to preserve all the information that it contains, and not to pass judgement on what is, or is not considered valuable in the current intellectual climate.']	['<urn:uuid:946c4691-4e68-4674-b232-af30718963dc>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	11	65	602
60	How do DISC standards help with digital workflow problems?	DISC standards help determine minimum quality levels for digital images, create guidelines for accepting or rejecting images, specify submission formats, and establish how images should be labeled within the digital workflow.	['As the world becomes increasingly digitized, there is a new need for standardization of digital media files. The ways in which these files are stored are important, but even more so are the ways in which metadata is applied to allow one to search for a file once it has been placed within a content management system.\nWhile looking at metadata standards, it is important to think about image capture standards as well. Images, especially those captured digitally, must meet certain criteria in order to be stored over a period of time, as well as allow for multiple uses. One example of image capture standards is the Digital Image Submission Criteria (DISC) standards provided by the IDEAlliance. DISC gives advice on how to store images for maximum reproduction in print and other media, while also lending itself to proper archival storage of digital images and files.\nThe DISC standards allow for digital media creators and publishers to deal with common problems found within a digital workflow. By following image standards, the digital file creator is able to determine the minimum quality level for digital images for printed output. Such standards also provide a way of creating a contract between the creator of the file and the acceptor, by creating guidelines specifying how images will be accepted or rejected. The DISC surveys also determine what format images should be submitted in. For example, in our Xinet project it was determined that images would be submitted as tiff files, using LAB color space and be at least 8 bit depth. A final aspect is how images should be labeled so that they fit within the digital workflow. This allows the image takers to create a standard to reach towards when outputting their work to the collective (Dougherty 2).\nWhen images are rejected, it is understood that it is because the files did not meet the requirements laid out by the image standards. It is common for photographers and other digital file creators to not even receive payment for their work in the digital workflow world if their files do not follow the standards set forth by the receiving digital workflow. In a way, standards for image capture serves as a contract for both parties involved in the digital workflow.\nMetadata is often utilized within the DISC standards. One aspect of metadata is the use of keywords to allow files to be searched. An important part of this includes the use of keywords. Keywords are part of an access structure, which “relates content types or publication pages to each other or to an external set of concepts that can be used to get to a particular content type” (Boiko par 40). Keywords fall within the indexing structure of metadata in the ranking of access structures making it the one of the most important fields. Keyword entry may come in different forms, for example in the IPTC Core, in which there is a spot for keywords. Similarly, within some museum systems there is a “Subject Matter—Description…A description of the work in terms of the generic elements of the image or images depicted in, on, or by it,” which may also hold keywords (Harpring par 10).\nIt is important when using keywords that taxonomy is applied to them. Since keywords may be free text, it is important to have a standard when using them (Dougherty 6). Taxonomy allows for “an orderly classification that explicitly expresses the relationships, usually hierarchical (e.g., genus/species, whole/part, class/instance), between and among the things being classified” (Gill par 80). It is also important to keep in mind that many times keywords are known as open lists so you must “make sure that you trust users to add new items responsibly” (Boiko 10). When creating keywords, you must keep in mind the result – an extensible series of categories for organizing digital assets into meaningful sets (Bock 4).\n“Using a taxonomy, we know how to relate one term in the information hierarchy to another” (Bock 5). If we look at this from the perspective of a cataloger of an art museum, it may take place in three steps. The first is where keywords entered may be generic, such as “nude” or “woman”, which are elements that would be easily observable to any person that is viewing the work. The next level would be identification, providing information that is generally more specific, such as “Birth of Venus.” Finally, the last set of keywords would deal with an even more specific set of terms that allow for interpretation, for example “Sandro Botticelli Classiest representation of Venus Birth” (Harpring par 20).\nIn respect to my experience with Xinet for a classproject, the keywords were chosen in a similar fashion to the hierarchy described in Introduction to Art Image Access, Issues, Tools, Standards, and Strategies. The first level of keywords for the images represents an overall knowledge of the subject matter. For example, the topic chosen for the images was baked goods, so the first keyword to be entered was “food” since this is a general term for anything editable (and the baked goods are food). Next, a keyword identifying the type of food was added – bakery. Since the baked goods came from a specific store, it was also added so that someone searching for the bakery name would be able to find it, along with “menu” to denote that this may be found year round in their store. In addition, “sweets” was added to show the type of baked good in the photo. Finally, the specific name of the baked good was added, “vanilla bean slice”.\nIt is important to use taxonomy within any type of database when dealing with digital media, as it allows users of all occupations and knowledge bases to easily search for images in a timely manner while preserving the original intent of the digital media.\nBock, G.

61	tree nursery project impacts economy environment community	The tree planting projects have multiple impacts. Economically, while seedlings typically cost $5 including transportation, organizations like Strong Roots distribute them for free to local communities. Trees provide significant economic benefits - farmers can earn $14 per season selling branches as bean poles, use trees to pay for school fees or house repairs, and produce charcoal from species like Eucalyptus. Environmentally, the projects counter deforestation, sequester carbon, prevent erosion, provide shade for crops, and maintain soil fertility. For communities, the International Small Group and Tree Planting Program (TIST) has helped plant over 18 million trees across multiple countries, providing income through carbon credits, improving food security through increased crop yields, and offering training on technology, leadership and health issues.	['Community Tree Planting\nHelping small communities replant trees so they can counter the effects of poverty, deforestation, and harmful carbon emissions.\nWhat it does\nThe International Small Group and Tree Planting Program (TIST) is a combined reforestation and sustainable development project. The project works with small groups of poor farmers to replant trees which counters the devastating effects of deforestation, poverty and drought. Since TIST’s inception in 1999, they have helped plant over 18 million trees in Tanzania, India, Kenya, and Uganda.\nHow it works\nTIST members are subsistence farmers and participate voluntarily. As a grassroots initiative, the farmers form small groups of 6 to 12 farmers. They are provided access to training that allows them to build on their own best practices which are then shared with the other 9,000 groups. These small groups benefit from a new income source: the sale of carbon credits that result from the sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere in the biomass of the trees and soil.

Well, a tree seedling normally costs around $1.00 to buy, but when you add in cost of transportation, you must travel to Bukavu to find a tree nursery, the costs are raised to about $5.00 per seedling. Considering that most people make well below 300 dollars per year, investing money in one tree, let alone multiple is nearly impossible.\nBut what are the economic benefits of planting trees in your fields? Well for starters, you get free fertilizer for your crops. You can sell branches as bean poles and easily make $14 per tree per season. You can also sell a tree to pay for a child?s school fees, or to repair your house. Other species, like Eucalyptus, are great for firewood and for charcoal which is in high demand in Bukavu. Not to mention the non-economic benefits of preventing erosion, providing shade to your crops, maintaining soil fertility, and regulating the climate. All in all, people here around Kahuzi-Biega and the Itombwe Nature Reserve highly value trees. As one man told me, ? When we cut down one tree, we try and plant four more.?\nStrong Roots, in collaboration with Partners in Conservation, currently operates the only tree nursery in the villages surrounding Kahuzi-Biega. On average we grow 100,000 trees a year in this nursery. Based in Miti, which also is the KiSwahili word for tree, we produce grevillea, markhamia, eucluptyus and podocarpus . From purchasing the seeds, bags, and other equipment to paying our tree manager and his staff, it costs us about 15 cents to produce each tree. Grevillea is the most highly demanded tree because it is a great organic fertilizer for fields and doesn?t disrupt crop growth. Markhamia is used by artists to carve masks and statues, but can also be used for lumber. Markhamira is also great because you can grow it in a coppice system, meaning if you cut it, it will re-sprout. While slow growing, podocarpus are used to mark the boundaries of fields. And eucalyptus is a great tree for lumber,firewood, and charcoal. Charcoal production for cooking for the nearby booming town of Bukavu is one of the main drivers of deforestation around and in the park. As the manager of the tree nursery told everyone waiting for trees, though, Euclyptus shouldn?t be planted in fields because it doesn?t work well with crops. As a condition to take home a Euclyptus tree, you must show the tree manager where you plan to plant it and because of the negative impacts of Euclyptus on the soil we only allow it on land that cannot be used for crops.\nStrong Root also manages the only tree nursery in the Burhinyi Chiefdom, located near the Itombwe Nature Reserve. We began this tree nursery two years ago in our efforts to reduce pressure on the Burhinyi Community Forest, which is also home to Grauer?s gorillas and numerous endemic and endangered bird species. This year we distributed about 60,000 trees to surrounding villages. Some people had to walk up to 4 hours to get trees! We are hoping to install a second tree nursery next year to reduce this distance and reach a great number of people. We distribute the same tree species in Burhinyi as around Kahuzi-Biega, but because the climate is much colder due to the high elevation in the mountains we also grow pine trees.\nStrong Roots could easily sell each of their seedlings for $1 a piece, but instead with support from Partners in Conservation we are able to distribute and plant them for free. The reason? It?s a win-win. People who are able to produce their own firewood, lumber, and organic material, no longer need to go into the park, reducing pressure on Kahuzi-Biega and people benefit immensely from increasing the number of trees on their land. In a sense, trees serve as a saving account. In times of financial need, you can cut a tree or two, and easily pay for food or medical bills. It provides extra income to families while also reducing degradation in the park. The trees are in such high demand that people from towns further away come and ask for trees, but because our goal is reduce pressures on Kahuzi-Biega we restrict tree distribution to the 7 villages surrounding the park. Strong Roots is happy that the tree nursery can improve livelihoods and help conserve the Grauer?s gorilla.\nKnowing all of this, I wasn?t surprised to find a large crowd of people waiting for the tree distribution to begin when Strong Roots arrived in Miti. In Burhinyi, we had people knocking on our door at 5am asking when we would start the distribution! Men, women, and kids, gathered with baskets, buckets, and cement sacks, to haul their trees back to their fields. I was impressed by the ingenuity of people in transporting these heavy trees back home. I saw one women carry her baby on her head so she could carry her trees on her back. Another old man dragged the trees home in a cut off water jug. This was my first year attending the tree distribution so I was eager to talk with the people who came to collect trees. Why did they come? Why benefits did they trees give them? Was this there first time there? What tree species did they prefer?\nBeatrice, the project manager for the tree nursery in Burhinyi, joined me in chatting with the people who were there. Leonard, a chief from a nearby vilalge, told us he came every year for new trees because there was a ??.direct need for trees. If our wives enter the park for firewood they get arrested, if we enter to get wood for constructed we get sent to prison. If we have our own trees, we have no problem with the park.? Beatrice asked him what he would do until the trees he collected at the nursery were big enough to use. For him, he said, it was no problem, because he had other mature trees that he got from Strong Roots six years ago.\nFor Esperence, this was her first time collecting trees from Strong Roots. When asked why she came for trees she said ?trees are important, they help bring rain and we can use them as fertilizer.? I asked her which were her favorite, which trees she preferred. Laughing at my question, she replied, ? they are all good, I cant have a favorite.?\nAnother man we chatted with jokingly told me, ?There are three things every person should have in life; human rights, trees, and good sauce.? Not only did three local schools show up for trees in Buryhini, but the Mwami, the traditional chief of this area, asked for trees too! Having the Mwami?s support is a huge endorsement and will encourage further tree planting around the forest.\nWe found that beyond the direct benefits from trees, the tree nursery also employs community members. From filling the tree sachets with dirt, to helping collect branches and banana leaves for shade for the young seedlings, the community members are able to earn a small income working in the tree nursery. Women are the ones who largely come out to fill the tree sachets with dirt. However, the women did tell us that they would like to be employed full time in the nursery as well. They said they were no different, that they too could also manage the tree nursery and help out with work. Safi, our project coordinator for Kahuzi, immediately agreed and we are working on creating a more gender inclusive tree nursery for next year. Because of the high demand, we are also planning on doubling tree production next year and also incorporating several fruit trees.\nIf you visit Kahuzi- Biega, you can see all the trees that Strong Roots in helped plant. They line the roads, they line the fields, and serve as shades near the homes. Normally the main challenge for reforestation projects is convincing people to plant trees, but here, our challenge is trying to produce enough']	['<urn:uuid:e75ce24b-c217-4348-89ed-654b92119b49>', '<urn:uuid:50774350-3c0e-423a-b4bf-8c513b2f3db7>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	7	119	1948
62	What did test pilots do at Farnborough and Pax River?	At Patuxent River, test pilots evaluated new jets and helped establish a formal Test Pilot School in 1948, focusing on performance and stability testing. At the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough, test pilots like Bill Bedford worked on spinning of swept winged aircraft, conducted research on gas turbines, and worked on power controlled aircraft development.	['Thursday, April 2, 2009\nPhoto by Rick Thompson\nAfter World War II, the world of naval aviation was undergoing a sea change, as high-performance jets began to replace propeller-driver fighters. At the Patuxent River Naval Air Test Center, this meant a change in testing — and in test pilots.\nThe new Test Coordinator, Capt. Frederick M. Trapnell, was one of the first to earn the ‘‘green card,” the top level of flying qualification, and insisted all his test pilots do the same. Very quickly, they became a crack team ready to take on the job of evaluating the new jets.\nThe new jets had swept wings, pressurized cabins, ejection seats and radar for flight interception of bombers. They were also faster, and reaction times to thrust changes at low speeds, especially during carrier approaches, were less.\nTrapnell was well aware of how aviation would change in the jet age. In the spring of 1943, he had made the first jet flight by a naval aviator by piloting a Bell XP-59 Aeracomet, America’s first jet-propelled airplane.\nThe new test coordinator was at the center of making the transition happen — and work — for the Navy. Like an umpire, he would call them as he saw them.\nAs John Lacouture stated in a 1991 article, ‘‘In testing of airplanes, integrity was his motto, and (Trapnell) reported results as they were, not as some senior or contractor wanted them to be. Once the airplane’s flight characteristics were determined, he then had all his pilots work on converting the test results into design change recommendations for the contractors who would improve the capabilities of the aircraft.”\nHe ‘‘also insisted that an airplane worthy of Navy procurement has to be able to operate well and safely over a broad range of flying conditions.”\nTrapnell saw a problem up ahead, though. Most of the test pilots would be moving on to the fleet, where they would be invaluable to squadrons flying the new jets for the first time. Their replacements would be less experienced, and unfamiliar with flight testing new aircraft and equipment.\nPax River had a Test Pilot School, but Trapnell insisted on its upgrading and expansion. It would have a complete flying program that covered performance, stability and control testing. The classroom work would be a complete aeronautical engineering course. Trapnell himself had flown more types of aircraft than any of his pilots, and he flew all aircraft assigned to Pax River.\nThe goal then, as now: provide the Navy with better airplanes for all missions, whether from carriers or not.\nThe Test Pilot School at the time had an informal technical school periodically run by Capt. Sydney S. Sherby. As Sherby later wrote, Trapnell and NATC Commander Capt. James Barner ‘‘became very interested in the informal school, and were highly impressed with the results. One of the fallouts of the training was the knowledge that our pilots took back to the fleet with them. It was beginning to show up in improvement in fleet operations. They were the ones who started the ball rolling in the Navy Department to have the school set up as the Test Pilot Training Division of the Naval Air Test Center.”\nBarner was relieved as NATC Commander by Rear Adm. Apollo Soucek in 1947, but for six months in between, Trapnell served in the position before reverting back to Test Coordinator. Soucek, like Barner, ‘‘fully concurred with the effort to have the school set up as a permanent school and joined Trapnell in the effort to get the school approved,” said Sherby.\nThey ultimately succeeded, and on Jan. 22, 1948 Trapnell’s plan for a formal test pilot school as a division of NATC was approved by Deputy Chief of Naval Operations Adm. J.D. Price. The Test Pilot Division was established in April 1948, with Sherby as its first director.\nTrapnell’s involvement in the school’s establishment was far from over, though. He chaired the selection of the school’s first class. The criteria, according to Sherby: ‘‘Candidates must be volunteers, have a good operational record, at least a high school education, be commissioned officers and have a letter of recommendation from their commanding officers.”\nHe chose well. The first class ranged from ex-enlisted pilots with a high school diploma to one with a master’s in aeronautics, with ranks from lieutenant junior grade to commander.\n‘‘The traits that all had were a very high intelligence, were exceptionally fine pilots and were all enthusiastic,” said Sherby. ‘‘The course was paced so that we did not bore the Master of Science or leave the high school behind. It took a little doing, but no one flunked the course.”\nTrapnell collected a library of about 550 technical books and assorted used desks to outfit the school, and the Test Pilot Training Division’s first class began July 6, 1948. He would eventually write the foreword to the textbook Airplane Aerodynamics. The book had been created from the Test Pilot Training Division’s lectures and concepts by Sherby and his successor, Capt. (eventually Vice Adm.) Thomas Connolly. Twenty-seven universities would eventually use its four editions (1951, 1957, 1961 and 1967) as the text for courses in aircraft design.\nIn the book’s foreword, Trapnell wrote, ‘‘In the flight testing of aircraft, the talents of the engineer and the pilot must be available to the maximum attainable extent in one individual. Without a sound understanding of the basic principles and a reasonable appreciation of the more advanced problems of the aeronautical engineer, the test pilot can neither gather usable data nor analyze his own experiences with sufficient clarity to convey them to others in usable form. The requirement grows more severe as the complexity of the aircraft increases.”\nHowever, ‘‘Such dual personalities do not occur in nature. Very few pilots have acquired an engineering background in the normal course of events. In most cases, both time and inclination are missing during the early stages of his career. Later on, however, the inclination often appears rather strikingly,” Trapnell said. ‘‘When advantage is taken of this manifestation, and time and facilities are provided for study, the results are likely to be gratifying.”\nHe concluded, ‘‘Such a procedure may not produce aeronautical engineers, but it does qualify pilots to meet the aeronautical engineer on common ground and to perform their flying duties with greatly improved insight and effectiveness.”\nIn June 1949, Trapnell again became NATC commander. It was later that year he appeared in House Armed Services Committee hearings that disputed Air Force claims for the B-36 — that flying at 40,000 feet it would be undetectable by radar and unreachable by enemy fighters.\nAccording to Time Magazine’s report, Trapnell ‘‘testified that standard Navy radar had no trouble picking up small jet fighters at 40,000 feet, and that Navy fighters had made interceptions at that altitude by day and by night.”\nHe told the committee, ‘‘If you were able to ride as an observer in a B-36 at 40,000 feet during joint exercises, you would see (F2H) Banshees diving and zooming all around you and making repeated gunnery attacks with a speed advantage of over 100 miles per hour.”\nThat summer Trapnell was named recipient of the Octave Chanute Award, named for the man who gave critical support and encouragement to the Wright Brothers during their design of their aircraft. Given annually by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics for ‘‘notable contribution by a pilot to the aerospace sciences,” the award recognized Trapnell for ‘‘showing outstanding ability not only in flying every type of aircraft but also in detecting critical defects in new airplanes and suggesting ways to deal with them.”\nTrapnell’s career at Pax River ended in April 1950 when he was named commanding officer of the carrier USS Coral Sea. While CO, he developed a two-line system for aircraft takeoff, with the left line turning left and the right line turning right. This system significantly reduced takeoff times over carriers that used only one line.\nPromoted to rear admiral in Feb. 1951, Trapnell was deputy commander of Sandia Base and of the Field Command Armed Forces Special Weapons Project at Albuquerque, N.M. from March 1951 to April 1952. That was when he suffered a heart attack and was retired for physical disability in Sept. 1952 with the rank of vice admiral. The medical findings also ended his days as a pilot.\nHe spent the next 23 years as a consultant for Grumman Aircraft, and became a sailing enthusiast, first in the Long Island, N.Y. area and then San Diego. Vice Adm. Frederick M. Trapnell died in the U.S. Naval Hospital, San Diego, on Jan. 30, 1975..\nOn April 1, 1976, the 33rd anniversary of the commissioning of NAS Patuxent River, the station’s air field was officially named ‘‘Trapnell Field.” A small memorial to the left of the tarmac outside Air Operations was unveiled in his honor. Over 300 guests attended the ceremony.\nChief of Naval Material Adm. Frederick Michaelis said in his keynote address, ‘‘Vice Adm. Trapnell was a pioneer test pilot whose calculated daring and prophetic vision served to advance the science of naval aviation test and evaluation. ‘Get the numbers’ was the watchword of the test pilots he trained and led. His contributions to aviation were enormous.”\nMichaelis added, ‘‘All who fly in Navy blue remain indebted to Vice Adm. Trapnell. This field will serve as a living reminder of that debt.”', 'This set of 7 reels of audio interview was recorded with Bill Bedford at Brooklands Museum in 1989.

63	compare benefits environmental impact traditional tillage versus conservation agriculture soil health carbon storage methods	Traditional tillage destroys soil structure, reduces water holding capacity, and increases erosion by breaking up soil and leaving it vulnerable. It also has a high carbon cost, requiring significant fuel use and releasing stored soil carbon. In tropical regions, tillage particularly stimulates microorganisms to decompose organic matter, releasing greenhouse gases. In contrast, conservation agriculture, especially no-till farming, shows substantial benefits. No-till practices offset N2O emissions by storing 2063-3940 kg of carbon equivalent per hectare yearly, while only emitting 375-616 kg. Conservation tillage also reduces fuel usage (5.8 kg carbon equivalent/ha/year versus 35.3 kg for conventional tillage), improves water retention, and decreases runoff. GMO crops have facilitated this transition, with soybean no-till adoption increasing from 27% to 39% after introducing herbicide-tolerant varieties.	"[""Agriculture and land use change contribute 24% of greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers estimate that this share will increase by 30 to 40% by 2050. The challenge is therefore to counterbalance this with greater carbon sequestration in order to transform agrosystems into greenhouse gas sinks.\nTo determine this role, it is sufficient, in broad terms, to take into account the gases drawn from the agrosystem and to compare them to those emitted by the same agrosystem. To do this, it is necessary to measure the accumulation of carbon in the soil, the quantities of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) released into the atmosphere, as well as all the CO2 coming from agricultural practices: plowing, planting, harvesting, installation and use of irrigation, application of agrochemicals, fertilizers and lime.\nKnowing that CH4 and N2O are greenhouse gases 34 and 298 times more potent than CO₂ respectively, it is sufficient to convert all these emissions into CO2 equivalent to estimate the net global warming potential and compare between different agricultural management methods.\nTo calculate the carbon cost of today's dominant agricultural practices, one must also consider their direct CO2 emissions. According to studies conducted in southern Brazil and the United States, the carbon cost of agricultural practices represents a significant amount of CO2, up to 800 and 2,000 kg ha-1 year-1.\nDiagram showing how to estimate whether an agrosystem is a source or sink of greenhouse gases: measure carbon fixation in the soil, the amount of CH₄ and N₂O released into the atmosphere, and all the CO₂ from agricultural practices: tilling, planting, harvesting, irrigation installation and use, and application of agrochemicals, fertilizers, and lime.\nBased on this observation, the first thing to do is to determine which agricultural practices to adopt in order to transform the soil into a greenhouse gas sink - and not a source.\nThe first element to take into account is that the soil can become a source of greenhouse gases when there is an excessive input, because telluric microorganisms feed on all these inputs and spit them out in the form of GHG.\nEven more so when the land is saturated with water by irrigation and compacted by machinery, as oxygen availability becomes scarce, leading to methanization (a process responsible for the production of CH₄) and denitrification (one of the processes responsible for the production of N₂O). Nevertheless, these methane fluxes remain low or even sometimes negative if the soils have a good structure and are not flooded.\nIn addition, the establishment and use of irrigation accounts for 47-63% of the carbon footprint while fertilization and limestone application rise to 35%. These proportions vary according to the inputs used and their annual input. To mitigate the climate change caused by agriculture, the most obvious solution seems to be the reduction of inputs, with more reasoned spreading.\nAgroforestry and legumes\nOther agricultural practices are just as important in moving from a source to a sink for greenhouse gases.\nThis is particularly true of agroforestry, which has been adopted by some farms. It consists of using cover crops, for which carbon storage exceeds its CO₂ equivalent released into the atmosphere in terms of N2O emissions, and improves soil structure with negative CH4 emissions.\nTwo contrasting agricultural systems, behaving as source (left) and sink (right) of greenhouse gases, according to CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O emissions as well as soil carbon sequestration. Murilo Veloso\nThis is also the case for the use of legumes. As these plants associate with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, they promote carbon storage in the soil and make it possible to substitute part of the mineral fertilization, thus reducing nitrous oxide emissions.\nFurthermore, by maintaining soil moisture and structure, practices such as agroforestry and cover crops provide an alternative to decrease irrigation.\nHowever, transforming an agrosystem into a greenhouse gas sink is not always obvious. For example, plowing, the practice of turning over the soil before seeding, does not necessarily have the same impact on GHGs.\nIn temperate environments, plowing has little effect on soil carbon stocks because low temperatures in early spring slow down microbial activity and the decomposition of soil organic matter.\nIn contrast, in tropical environments where temperatures remain favorable, soil destructuring by tillage stimulates microorganisms to decompose soil organic matter, which releases GHGs.\nExample of conventional agriculture and its practices such as monoculture, tillage and heavy reliance on inputs that contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions and reduced soil carbon sequestration, making the agricultural system a source of greenhouse gases (left). Example of agroecological practices such as cover crops, no-till, intercropping, legumes and agroforestry that contribute to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and increase soil carbon sequestration, making the agricultural system a greenhouse gas sink (right).\nFor no-till farming practices, N2O emissions are largely offset by CO2 storage, counterbalancing the 375 to 616 kg of carbon equivalent emitted per hectare per year by the 2063 to 3940 kg of carbon equivalent fixed in the soil per hectare per year. This represents nothing less than a carbon storage five to six times higher than the emissions! Ploughing, on the other hand, clearly reduces the soil's capacity to draw carbon from these tropical zones.\nOn the other hand, plowing also constitutes an additional cost of CO₂ when the use of diesel for machinery is taken into account (35.3 kg of carbon equivalent per hectare per year in conventional and 5.8 kg in direct seeding).\nFrom field to plate\nLet's not forget that greenhouse gas emissions do not stop at production, but also continue during transportation, processing, packaging and redistribution of products.\nIt is therefore necessary to radically change agricultural practices, starting with the fields. The practices mentioned above - the use of cover crops, legumes, intercrops, agroforestry, and the abandonment of tilling the soil - would have a triple effect: strengthening an organic and sustainable agri-food system, respecting biodiversity, allowing a balanced cohabitation between agriculture and the environment, while making farmers less dependent on large industrial companies"", 'When most people think about soil and farming the first image that comes to mind is that of a farmer plowing his or her field. That rural image has become emblematic of agricultural cultivation and our shared connection to the land, soil and food that sustains us, but the reality is actually quite problematic.\nTillage, or the act of mechanically turning over and breaking up soil to prepare it for planting, has been an important part of farming practices for thousands of years, for good reason, but with unintended consequences both for farmland and the environment at large.\nThis past week we celebrated World Soil Day – a global awareness day the United Nations declared to celebrate the importance of soil as a vital contributor to human well-being. It’s also an opportunity to reflect on how GMOs have helped to improve soil health and the environment.\nHistorically, tillage practices have been used as a means for weed control; to help break up severely compacted soil; and to mix harvest residue, organic matter and nutrients evenly into the soil to prepare it for planting. All of these tillage aspects can provide benefits to crop production. However, tillage is increasingly recognized as a cause of soil damage that leaves soil vulnerable to erosion and contributes to other environmental ills, such as increased pollution and sedimentation in streams and rivers and loss of land to desertification.\nHow Does Tillage Impact The Environment?\nLet’s take a closer look. John Graham, a soil health specialist for the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Kentucky, explains that “tillage destroys and/or depletes the soil’s aggregate stability, structure, pore space, water holding capacity, infiltration, permeability, gaseous exchange and nutrient storage ability.” In other words, destroying soil severely reduces water infiltration – causing the soil’s capacity for water to be depleted. Instead of water going into the soil, it runs off, taking topsoil, chemicals and fertilizers with it. This leads to more vulnerable and less productive farmland and an environmental chain reaction. According to the World Wildlife Foundation, half of the topsoil on the planet has been lost in the last 150 years. The effects of soil erosion, which go beyond the loss of fertile land, have contributed to declines in fish and other species and worsened flooding and desertification.\nConservation Tillage Improves Soil Health, The Environment\nFor these reasons, movements toward more sustainable agriculture, including conservation tillage, are critical if we hope to meet the food production needs of a growing global population, while also reducing our impact on the environment.\nSo, How Does Conservation Tillage Work?\nConservation tillage allows farmers to till the soil less often. Here is a breakdown of the benefits:\n- Less tilling = less erosion. Instead of tilling an entire field after harvest, farmers can leave the crop’s residue (like corn stalks) in the field, and then plant seeds directly into that residue during the next planting season. This serves as a “mulch” for the next season’s crop, also protecting the soil.\n- Less tilling = more water retention. Utilizing crop’s residue drastically increases water infiltration and therefore retention. This also results in reduced runoff into water ways.\n- Less tilling = fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Tillage is a very fuel intensive operation and releases carbon dioxide. Reducing tillage reduces the amount of fuel used and greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.\nWhat It Means For Farmers & The Environment\nThe ecological benefits of conservation tillage are clear, but what does it actually mean for farmers and how, after thousands of years as a mainstay of agricultural production, have we become less reliant on tilling?\nThe answer may come as a surprise. Advances in biotechnology, particularly the development of GMO crops, have been instrumental in facilitating conservation tillage and resulting improvements in soil health. The development of herbicide-tolerant GMO crops was a breakthrough. By allowing farmers a highly effective and reliable means to fight weeds by chemical means, GMOs have reduced reliance on tillage for weed control and made it easier and less risky for farmers to adopt more sustainable production strategies.\nTake soybeans for example. According to the Conservation Technology Information Center (CTIC), before the introduction of glyphosate-tolerant soybeans, approximately 27% of the nation’s full-season soybeans were no-tilled. Today, the latest CTIC surveys show that 39% are no-tilled, “a phenomenon that closely tracked the adoption of herbicide-tolerant soybeans.”\nCTIC further states that “biotechnology has played a significant role in influencing the shift of millions of acres of U.S. cropland to conservation tillage systems, which in turn has reduced topsoil loss, energy consumption, pesticide use, labor, water pollution and air pollution.” Conservation tillage means fewer trips across the fields, saving farmers time and money by lowering fuel and machinery maintenance costs, and reduced soil compaction.\nResearch by PG Economics published in 2013 in the journal GM Crops Food, also showed that “GM traits have contributed to a significant reduction in the environmental impact associated with insecticide and herbicide use on the areas devoted to GM crops.” Further, a 2014 meta-analysis of the impacts of GM crops published by Wilhelm Klümper and Matin Qaim found that on average, GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide applications by 37%, increased crop yields by 22%, and increased farmer profits by 68%, offering proof that with GMOs what’s good for the environment can also be good for farmer’s bottom lines.\nAt GMO Answers, we believe that maintaining healthy soil is of critical importance, not only to farmers, but to the global community at large. We are proud of the positive impact GMO crops have made and continue to make by enabling more sustainable agricultural production and promoting soil health in ways that benefit farmers, the land they work and the environment as a whole.']"	['<urn:uuid:af9dd96c-4d30-4a93-9431-853dd63dbf04>', '<urn:uuid:b9e01065-ed05-4369-8bc1-7ff49603fd7b>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	14	121	1945

The role of age in determining disability benefits differs for each of these programs.\nSSI Benefits and Age\nClaimants may qualify for SSI benefits if they are aged, disabled or blind; if they have very limited income and resources; and if they are not able to work for at least 12 continuous months. SSI benefits have no minimum age requirements and can be awarded to any person from birth.\nIf the applicant is a child, which means that they are not married, they are under the age of 18, or they under the 22 (if they are a student regularly attending school), they will be evaluated using the criteria established for children.\nWhen the child reaches 18 years of age, the SSA will re-evaluate their health condition, using the definition of disability for adults, to determine if they are still entitled to SSI benefits.\nClaimants older than 18 years of age (and younger than 65) who apply for SSI benefits must meet the criteria outlined above (i.e. have a severe mental or physical health condition, lack the ability to work for at least 12 continuous months, and have limited income and resources), but they will be evaluated using the criteria for adults.\nAge 65 Years or Older and Applying for SSI Benefits\nClaimants who are 65 years or older can apply for SSI benefits if their income and resources are limited. They do not have to be disabled. For example, individuals who do not have sufficient work credits to qualify for Social Security retirement benefits may, instead, apply for SSI benefits.\nSSDI and Age\nSocial Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is available to workers who have a severe mental or physical health condition that does not allow them to work for at least 12 continuous months. To qualify for SSDI, however, workers must have sufficient work credits that they have earned by paying employment taxes.\nClaimants who are younger than 22 years of age generally do not have sufficient work credits to qualify for SSDI benefits. For example, according to the SSA, “If you become disabled before age 24, you generally need 1½ years of work (six credits) in the three years before you became disabled to qualify for SSDI.”\nQualifying for SSDI as an Adult Child?\nAnother consideration for claimants who are over the age of 18 but their disability started prior to the age of 22 is whether or not they can qualify to receive “disabled adult child” SSDI benefits. To qualify under this specific program, the individual must:\n- Be over the age of 18\n- Not married\n- Disabled prior to the age of 22\n- Have a parent who currently receives SSA benefits or is dead but received SSA benefits at the time of their death\nAdult child benefits allow the qualifying individual to collect SSDI benefits based on their parent’s Social Security earnings.\nAge and the Disability Determination for SSDI Benefits\nAge is not just a factor when an individual applies for disability benefits. Age can also be an important factor when the SSA is making a disability determination for SSDI benefits and whether or not a claimant has the ability to retrain for new work. Let’s take a closer look at this process.\nWhen does the SSA consider my age for SSDI?\nThe Social Security Administration will consider a claimant disabled, assuming that they meet the non-medical requirements for SSDI, if they meet a listing on the SSA Listing of Impairments or if they have a condition that is so severe that the SSA determines they cannot work their current job, any past relevant job or retrain for new work.\nAge is not a factor if the claimant’s condition meets a listing or if the SSA decides that they can work their current job. Age does become a factor when the SSA is considering whether or not a claimant can retrain for new work, a determination that is made in the last step of the disability evaluation process.\nAt this step, the SSA has developed what they call medical vocational grids, which allow them to consider a variety of factors—age, skills, education and residual functional capacity to work—when making a disability decision.\nWithin these grids, there are age categories: 18–44 (young), 45–49 (younger), 50–54 (approaching advanced age), 55–59 (advanced age) and 60–65 (closely approaching retirement). The SSA will use these age categories, in conjunction with the other factors, to determine if the claimant is disabled.\nFor example, using the appropriate grid, if you were age 45 to 49 but you could do sedentary work, the SSA would deny you disability, even if you only had a high school diploma and had not done skilled work. In this case, the SSA would generally conclude that because you are younger, you would have the skills to retrain for new work.\nIf you were 50 or older, however, your claim would be viewed through a different set of grid rules. These grid rules would allow the SSA to find you disabled due to your age and your inability to transfer your skills to sedentary work.\nBottom line: age can be a factor in the disability application process as well as in determining whether a claimant is disabled.\nHave a question?

65	What are the current theories about what causes mysterious fast radio bursts, and how frequently are they estimated to occur in space?	Various theories have been proposed to explain fast radio bursts, including exploding stars, evaporating black holes, and even alien signalling devices. While their exact cause remains unknown, calculations indicate there could be as many as 10,000 of these radio bursts occurring every day. Each burst lasts just a few milliseconds but releases as much energy as the Sun produces in a month.	['1. How did it all begin?\nCosmologists talk about the Big Bang, but they have no idea what it was. “We are sure that the early phase of the Universe was hot and dense,” says Prof Tim O’Brien, an astronomer from Jodrell Bank, University of Manchester. “But what triggered the Big Bang is still very much open for investigation.”\nIn March 2014, astronomers using an instrument called BICEP2 thought that they had seen evidence for a colossal increase in the expansion of the Universe at the moment of the Big Bang. This would fit theoretical ideas called inflation. Sadly, it turned out to be space dust contaminating the signal.\n2. What are fast radio bursts?\nFast radio bursts have the whole radio astronomy community scratching their heads at the moment. Just a dozen or so of the mysterious electromagnetic pulses have been discovered since the first one was detected in 2001. Each lasts just a few milliseconds, yet carries as much energy as the Sun releases in a month.\n“We really have no idea at all what these things are,” says O’Brien.\nVarious suggestions have been made, including exploding stars, evaporating black holes and even alien signalling devices.\nCalculations show that there could be as many as 10,000 of these radio bursts taking place every single day, but they still remain a mystery.\n3. What is the space time continuum?\n“The space-time continuum is the pinnacle of cosmological achievement in the last century,” says Dr Andrew Pontzen, cosmologist at University College London. The trouble is, nobody understands what it actually is. When Einstein developed General Relativity, he introduced it as a mathematical coordinate system. But what did it represent in reality?\nThe maths suggested it was a malleable substance in which the celestial objects are suspended, but General Relativity provides no real insight into its physical nature. It could be made of incredibly tiny particles like a beach, which looks smooth from a distance but on close-up examination can be seen to be made from grains of sand. If so, it would need a quantum theory of space-time to be developed.\nThere are some indications that light from distant stellar explosions, known as gamma-ray bursts, are delayed according to their wavelength as they travel across space. This is important because space-time particles would slow down shorter wavelengths of light more than longer wavelengths.\nThere have been too few observations to prove or disprove the quantum nature of space-time. The puzzle remains: what is the space-time continuum?\n4. What is dark matter?\nAlmost every galaxy that astronomers have currently studied spins faster than they can explain. This means that there must be some other source of mass that we are unable to directly detect.\nUnfathomable galactic motions first came to light in the 1930s thanks to the work of Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky. He postulated that the extra mass must come from an unseen gas. He called this gas ‘dark matter’.\nBy the 1970s, the need for dark matter was worse than ever. Astronomers were seeing far too much movement in the individual galaxies, yet they were convinced that the dark matter could not be atoms otherwise they would have found it already. Particle physicists provided a possible solution because they were predicting relic particles of nature that are invisible to light but interact through gravity.\n“We are now at a point where a lot of experiments on Earth stand a realistic chance of seeing something,” explains Pontzen. One of those experiments is the newly upgraded Large Hadron Collider at CERN, which is now looking for neutralinos. These are currently the best candidate particles for dark matter, but are only hypothetical. If CERN does not find them, it will be back to the drawing board.\n5. How did the moon form?\nThe origin of the Moon has proven remarkably tricky for astronomers to understand. In the late 1990s, planetary geologists felt that they had finally zeroed in on the answer. They called it the ‘Big Splat’.\nThe idea involves a world about the size of Mars striking the Earth a glancing blow so that the shattered world gathered in Earth’s orbit. Once there, the debris coalesced to form the Moon. Moon rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts corroborated this scenario. But then it all went wrong.\nBetter measurements showed that the Moon’s rocks were not just similar to Earth’s rocks – they were virtually identical. This would not be the case if the Moon had mostly formed out of the impactor.\n“The giant impact is still the best hypothesis because all the other scenarios just seem impossible,” explains planetary scientist Prof David Rothery from the Open University.\nCurrently, researchers are wondering whether a scenario can be envisaged in which the impacting body is smaller and embeds itself in Earth, blasting out rocks to form the Moon.\n6. Do we understand gravity?\nMany scientists are convinced we need a new theory to explain the strongest gravitational fields in the Universe. But a much smaller group thinks that a new theory of gravity is also needed to explain very weak gravitational fields.\nThe idea is called Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). It was developed in the 1980s by the Israeli physicist Mordehai Milgrom. He made a small mathematical modification to Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation and showed that it could reproduce the rotation of galaxies without the need for dark matter. Yet no-one knows why such a modification should exist.\nESA’s LISA-Pathfinder mission could help. The craft is designed to test sensitive instrumentation in the study of gravity in space. It launched in December 2015 and once the payload has been shown to work, the craft could be sent on a journey to test MOND in a region between Earth and the Sun. LISA-Pathfinder is sensitive enough to show if the weak gravity there is following Newton’s or Milgrom’s prediction. If Newton rules, there must be dark matter. If Milgrom gets it right, he’s looking at a Nobel Prize.\n7. What makes a planet habitable?\nBefore we can go looking for habitable planets in the Universe, we first have to know what makes a planet capable of supporting life. This is no easy task. There are a number of factors that determine whether a planet can support life.\nAstronomers often talk about the habitable zone: the region around a star in which a planet can be warm enough for liquid water to exist on its surface. However, as Europa proves, this might be too simplistic.\n“I no longer think about a habitable zone,” says Dr Peter Grindrod, a planetary scientist at Birkbeck, University of London. “Instead, I think planetary zones can be much more localised.”\nWhat seems clear is that there needs to be an energy source and nutrients, then water or some other solvent in which the biochemistry can take place. In terms of ‘life as we know it’, this means we should look anywhere there is abundant water and sunlight.\nBut there could be other possible biochemistries as well. A key investigation for theoretical astrobiology is to identify other routes to life as well. Such research has the potential to drastically change the way we think about planetary habitability.\n8. What are black holes?\n“We’re sure they exist, even though we’ve never seen one,” says O’Brien. Black holes are the places in the Universe where matter has become so condensed that gravity has become overwhelming. No amount of energy will allow you to escape from a black hole once you cross its outer boundary, known as the event horizon (although Professor Stephen Hawking recently announced a different theory).\nLight cannot escape either, making them appear black. They are often very small too, which means they are fiendishly difficult to spot. To put this in context, to transform the Earth into a black hole, it would need to be squeezed into a sphere about one centimetre across.\nHowever, the real mystery of black holes is what lies inside them. Nothing in physics appears able to stop the matter collapsing into a denser and denser object until it reaches a point of infinite density in zero volume, known as a singularity. But mathematically, a singularity seems almost impossible. “I find it very hard to believe a singularity can exist in nature,” says O’Brien.\nOur predominant theories of physics – General Relativity and quantum mechanics – are no help here. Worse, the hints these theories do give are contradictory. Physicists are currently trying to develop ‘quantum gravity’. This is a mathematical theory that could give us testable predictions about the true nature of black holes. For now, we’re stumped.\n9. Is there life on Europa?\nEuropa is one of the four moons of Jupiter spotted by Galileo in 1610. At the time, the discovery caused a sensation, with some wondering why such a world had been placed into the heavens. Yet it wasn’t until space probes took close-up observations in the 1970s that Europa’s true mystery came to light.\nIts neighbouring moon, Io, suffers from giant eruptions that throw sulphurous lava high into space. This volcanic activity is sustained by a gravitational tug-of-war that sees Jupiter pulling the moon one way, and the other moons pulling it the other. On Europa, these forces are not so severe. They cannot spark volcanism, but they can keep the moon’s interior warm enough to melt much of the ice. Europa’s ocean is so large that it must contain two to three times more water than all the oceans on Earth put together.\nOn Earth, one theory states that life started on the dark ocean floor around hydrothermal vents called black smokers. Black smokers occur when water heated in the interior of our planet jets up into the ocean. The water carries dissolved chemicals that provide nutrients for the ecosystem’s exotic microorganisms. Could the same be happening on Europa? Prof David Rothery, a planetary scientist at the Open University, thinks it’s a distinct possibility. He says: “Europa is one of the most promising places to look for life. It has everything you need.”\nNASA’s Europa Clipper mission will determine whether Europa possesses the right conditions for life. There is no precise launch date, but NASA expects it to be on its way in the 2020s. In 2016, $30m (£19m approx) will be spent developing the craft and its instruments.\nIn 2012, the Hubble Space Telescope spotted water vapour around the moon’s south pole, implying that the ice is thin or fissured, allowing the subsurface water to escape. Planetary geologists have seen cracks appearing on Europa because of the gravitational forces that are at work. All this means that Europa Clipper could directly sample the water by flying through these plumes. Maybe it could look for the evidence of life?\n“Once you are at Europa, it is easier to look for life than at Mars,” says Rothery. This is because any microbes that have formed in the ocean could find themselves transported to the bottom of the ice crust on the rising currents, and then jetted through the cracks, bringing them to the surface where they could be studied.\nAssuming that the signs remain positive for life, a follow-on mission could be designed to land on the icy surface and burrow down into the ocean below.\n10. What is dark energy?\nWhen it comes to a list of cosmic unknowns, there is no question about what tops the list. “Dark energy is certainly the biggest mystery in our understanding of the present day Universe,” says Pontzen.\nIn 1929, US astronomer Edwin Hubble established that distant galaxies are moving away from us. Belgian astronomer Georges Lemaître had predicted this behaviour in 1927, when he calculated the expected rate of this expansion. Rather unjustly, this is now called the Hubble Constant.\nBy the 1990s, the Hubble Space Telescope was in orbit and was being used with ground-based telescopes to measure the rate at which this expansion changed across the breadth of the observable Universe. Two international research teams were racing to make this measurement as it would reveal the fate of the Universe: whether it would expand forever or fall back together, coming to an end in a catastrophic ‘Big Crunch’.\nIt seemed obvious that the expansion must be decelerating, because the gravity generated by the matter in the Universe would resist the expansion. What the teams discovered was the complete opposite – the expansion is getting faster. Further research has shown that the acceleration began about seven billion years ago, when the Universe was about half its current age.\nIt is as if some previously undetected anti-gravity substance is dominating the behaviour of the Universe. It makes up about 70 per cent of all the matter and energy in the cosmos, and is called ‘dark energy’. Yet uncovering its identity remains very difficult. “Frankly, we are still pretty clueless,” says Pontzen.\nThere are two leading possibilities: it is either an energy, or a force of nature. If it is an energy, then it will have to display properties unlike any other energy. Some people call it negative energy, because instead of generating gravity, it creates a kind of anti-gravity. If it is a force, often termed ‘quintessence’, then it is very weak. But over the vastness of space, it builds up into the acceleration we see around us.\nTo try to discriminate between these two options, the European Space Agency is building a space telescope called Euclid. Launching in 2020, it will map galaxies to a distance of 10 billion light-years, to reveal the way dark energy has moved them around. It will allow cosmologists to describe the behaviour of dark energy, such as whether it changes from place to place.\nWhatever dark energy turns out to be, it will require a re-write of the textbooks when we finally understand its true nature.\nStuart Clark holds a PhD in astrophysics and is author of The Unknown Universe.\nThis article has been edited for the web.

66	ammo organization tips best choke selection	For ammunition organization, use labeled metal or plastic ammo cans instead of cardboard boxes, and regularly check inventory for damage. For choke selection, use Cylinder choke for 25-yard shots, Improved Cylinder for 30 yards, Modified for 35 yards, and Full choke for 40-yard shots.	"[""There is nothing quite as satisfying as walking up on a staunch point, seeing a bird flush, and dropping it with one shot. The dog gets feathers in its mouth, you smile, and your buddies slap you on the back. But missed opportunities are as much of a part of wingshooting as hits, and by matching your loads to your chokes you'll have more successes than failures. That includes staggering your shells.\nAlso See: Shooting Singles vs. Flocks\nThink about it, and you've all seen it plenty of time in your covers, fields, marshes, and beaches. First shots on a bird occur at a distance much closer than the second or even the third. The simple reason is that the bird is nailed by a pointing or a flushing dog which gives the uplander an advantage. Waterfowl dumping into a spread are close until that first shot spooks 'em and they fly away. After that shot, the game bird is doing its best to put as much distance between it and the hunter as possible. With every passing moment, the bird flies farther and farther away.\nThe first order of business is to pick a choke that excels at the realistic distance of your first shot. Taking a visual estimate is a good step provided that your frame of view is accurate. A view of a flushed bird in a field is very different from one taking flight in primary or secondary growth. To compensate for those differences, I subject them to an additional test. I pace the distance from where I shot and where the bird fell or from where it flushed. In doing so, I can accurately know the distance which translates into the proper choke to use.\nThe next issue to address is where your second shot is taken. The bird has put some distance between the firing of your first and/or second shell. Maybe a tailwind speeds up or slows down its flight. The combined visual and pacing method provides that cross-reference which again results in a more accurate choke selection for a second shot. Here's a chart for the general rule of thumb for the basic chokes and their ideal range.\n- Cylinder: A 40-inch spread at about 25 yards.\n- Improved Cylinder: A 40-inch spread at about 30 yards.\n- Modified: A 40-inch spread at about 35 yards.\n- Full: A 40-inch spread at about 40 yards.\nOne grouse played tricks on me, and when it dropped, I said to my wife it was so far away it looked like a 30-yard shot. It took me seven paces, or about 21 yards, to reach it; the same distance as a target on a skeet field. If you're shooting too tight of a choke such as IC, Modified, or Full at a bird at that close distance, then one of two results will occur. You'll either miss cleanly as your choke and pattern is too tight. But if you hit, you'll blow up the bird. Neither result is ideal.\nDouble guns have an advantage as gunners can shoot two different chokes, the first of which is more open for a closer first shot and the second with more constriction to launch a tighter pattern which is better at distance. Single-barrel shotguns are at a slight disadvantage as only one choke is used. Most shooters use only one type of shell, but another solution is to stagger your shells to bring out the best pattern spread.\nLighter or spreader loads delivered in a more open choke work great on close birds. A slightly hotter load delivered in a choke with more constriction helps anchor the bird on the second shot. Here's an example:\n- A light 20 gauge shell is a 3/4 ounce load.\n- A standard 20 gauge shell is a 7/8 ounce load.\n- A heavy 20 gauge shell is a 1 ounce load.\nIf your gunning iron is a double barrel, then place the 3/4 ounce shell in your right (SxS) or bottom (O/U) barrel matched with a more open choke (like Cylinder or Skeet). Your second shot, which is in either your left barrel (SxS) or top (O/U) barrel would be a 7/8 ounce shell delivered in either an IC or Modified choke. You'll get better pattern spread on your first shot at close range and a tighter pattern delivered through a choke with more constriction on your second shot.\nSingle-barrel shooters enhance performance while using only one choke; they'll simply vary their loads to maximize pattern spread. Load the lightest shell in the chamber, then place the hottest shell in the magazine tube. The second shell in the magazine should be a mid-range load, and your sequence is set. And by all means increase your shot size between your first, second or third shot. Upland game birds aren't tough like a grizzly bear; every BB doesn't need to hit, but pattern spread is critical to get enough that are lethal.\nThis offseason, experiment with chokes and loads. RST Shotshells make great low pressure/light loads, while other companies offer spreader loads which are terrific for close range first shots. Standard and heavy loads are readily available from many companies. For better success in the field determine the actual distance of your shot, then pick the appropriate choke, and finally match it with the correct shell. Your bird dog will thank you."", 'What Are the Best Ways to Store Ammo Long-Term?\nAmmunition storage is a critical aspect for gun owners and enthusiasts. Proper storage ensures the safety, reliability, and longevity of your ammunition. It’s essential to understand that ammunition is a sensitive item that reacts to its environment. Consequently, knowing the right conditions and methods for storage can significantly impact its performance. This article delves into effective strategies for long-term ammo storage, emphasizing safety and preservation, whether for rifle cartridges or 9mm ammo.\nThe Importance of a Cool, Dry Environment\n- Temperature Control\nAmmo longevity is highly dependent on the storage environment, particularly temperature. High temperatures can deteriorate the powder and primer, leading to misfires or duds. To avoid this, store your ammunition in a cool area with minimal temperature fluctuations. Ideally, a consistent temperature below 70°F (21°C) is recommended. Avoid places like attics or garages where temperatures can vary widely. Consistency in temperature is key, as frequent changes can accelerate the aging process of the components inside the ammunition.\n- Moisture Avoidance\nHumidity is ammunition’s nemesis. Moisture can lead to corrosion and damage both the bullet and the casing. Ensure your storage space is dry, with a relative humidity of around 50%. Desiccant packs or a dehumidifier can help in maintaining optimal humidity levels. It’s advisable to regularly check the humidity levels and replace desiccant packs as necessary. Airtight storage can also prevent moisture from seeping in, ensuring the ammo remains pristine.\nUse of Proper Storage Containers\n- Ammo Cans and Containers\nThe right container is essential for protecting ammo from environmental elements. Military-style metal ammo cans are popular due to their durability and sealant properties, making them ideal for storing various types of ammunition, including 9mm ammo. Ensure the rubber gasket on the can’s lid is intact to provide an air-tight seal. Plastic ammo boxes are also a viable option, especially for organizing different types of ammunition. These containers not only protect from moisture and temperature but also help in preventing dust and other contaminants. The key is to ensure that the container is robust and capable of withstanding environmental pressures.\n- Avoiding Original Cardboard Boxes\nWhile storing ammo in its original packaging is common, cardboard boxes are not ideal for long-term storage. They absorb moisture and do not offer airtight protection. Transferring ammo to dedicated containers is a more secure approach. Cardboard can also attract pests, damaging both the packaging and the ammunition. Investing in quality storage containers is a wise decision that will pay off in the long run by preserving the integrity of your ammunition.\nOrganization and Inventory Management\n- Labeling for Easy Identification\nOrganizing your ammunition makes it easier to track and use. Label each container with the ammo type, caliber, and purchase date. This not only aids in identifying the ammo but also helps in using older stock first. Detailed labeling helps in quick decision-making, especially when you need to access specific ammunition types rapidly. It also prevents mixing different ammunition types, which can be dangerous.\n- Inventory Checks\nRegular inventory checks are crucial. This process involves inspecting ammunition for any signs of corrosion or damage. Any compromised ammo should be safely disposed of to prevent accidents. This routine ensures your stock is always in top condition and ready for use. It also lets you track your ammo supply, helping you plan purchases and maintain an adequate stock.\nSafety and Legal Compliance\n- Adhering to Legal Requirements\nEvery region has specific laws regarding ammunition storage. It’s essential to be aware of and comply with these regulations to avoid legal complications. Ignorance of the law is not a defense, and non-compliance can lead to serious legal consequences. Regularly updating yourself on local laws and regulations is part of responsible ammunition ownership.\n- Secure Storage\nKeeping ammunition out of reach of unauthorized persons, especially children, is paramount. A locked cabinet or safe secures your ammo and adds an extra layer of protection against environmental factors. This is not just a safety measure; it’s a moral responsibility. Safeguarding your ammunition also protects your family and community.\nHandling with Care\n- Avoid Rough Handling\nAmmunition is designed to withstand some degree of impact, but rough handling can damage it. When moving or organizing your ammo, handle it gently to prevent any accidental discharges or damage. The components of a cartridge are sensitive; mishandling can alter their alignment or integrity, leading to potential failures. This respect for the ammunition extends its life and maintains its reliability.\n- Rotation of Stock\nUsing the oldest ammunition first is a good practice. This rotation ensures that no ammo sits in storage for too long, reducing the chances of deterioration. Consistently rotating stock minimizes the risk of having unusable ammunition and ensures that your supply remains fresh and effective. This practice is particularly important for those who may not use their ammunition frequently.\nConclusion: Ensuring Longevity and Safety\nLong-term ammunition storage requires careful consideration of environmental factors, proper containers, organization, safety, and legal compliance. By following these guidelines, gun owners can ensure their ammo remains safe, reliable, and ready for use whenever needed. Remember, responsible storage is not just about preserving ammunition; it’s also about ensuring safety and peace of mind. Storing ammunition correctly is a reflection of your commitment to safety and responsibility as a gun owner.']"	['<urn:uuid:ed8bd989-8711-435e-8cd7-951a0e2207fb>', '<urn:uuid:a133aa81-af3d-432e-923c-6b29ba1cc482>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	6	44	1783

68	export shipping crate packaging requirements moisture breakage pilferage costs international commercial terms	For international shipping, export crates must address four main problems: breakage, moisture, pilferage, and excess weight. Packages should be made of moisture-resistant material, properly braced with evenly distributed weight, and adequately sealed. To prevent theft, contents and brand names should not be written on packages, and safeguards like straps, seals, and shrink wrapping should be used. According to International Commercial Terms (Incoterms), the responsibility for these packaging costs and risks must be clearly specified in the sales contract between buyer and seller, with specific terms like CIF (Cost, Insurance, Freight) or CPT (Carriage Paid To) determining who bears these responsibilities.	"['Exporters should be aware of the demands that international shipping puts on packaged goods. Exporters should jeep four potential problems in mind when designing an export shipping crate: breakage, moisture, pilferage and excess weight.\nGenerally, cargo is carried in containers, but sometimes it is still shipped as breakbulk cargo. Besides the normal handling encountered in domestic transportation, a breakbulk shipment transported by ocean freight may be loaded aboard vessels in a net or by a sling, conveyor, or chute, that puts an added strain on the package. During the voyage, goods may be stacked on top of or come into violent contact with other goods. Overseas, handling facilities may be less sophisticated than in the United States and the cargo could be dragged, pushed, rolled, or dropped during unloading, while moving through customs, or in transit to the final destination.\nMoisture is a constant concern because condensation may develop in the hold of a ship even if it is equipped with air conditioning and a dehumidifier. Another aspect of this problem is that cargo may also be unloaded in precipitation, or the foreign port may not have covered storage facilities. Theft and pilferage are added risks.\nBuyers are often familiar with the port systems overseas, so they will often specify packaging requirements. If the buyer does not specify this, be sure the goods are prepared using these guidelines:\n- Pack in strong containers, adequately sealed and filled when possible.\n- To provide proper bracing in the container, regardless of size, make sure the weight is evenly distributed.\n- Goods should be palletized and when possible containerized.\n- Packages and packing filler should be made of moisture-resistant material.\n- To avoid pilferage, avoid writing contents or brand names on packages. Other safeguards include using straps, seals, and shrink wrapping.\n- Observe any product-specific hazardous materials packing requirements.\nOne popular method of shipment is to use containers obtained from carriers or private leasing companies. These containers vary in size, material, and construction and accommodate most cargo, but they are best suited for standard package sizes and shapes. Also, refrigerated and liquid bulk containers are usually readily available. Some containers are no more than semi-truck trailers lifted off their wheels, placed on a vessel at the port of export and then transferred to another set of wheels at the port of import.\nNormally, air shipments require less heavy packing than ocean shipments, though they should still be adequately protected, especially if they are highly pilferable. In many instances, standard domestic packing is acceptable, especially if the product is durable and there is no concern for display packaging. In other instances, high-test (at least 250 pounds per square inch) cardboard or tri-wall construction boxes are more than adequate.\nFinally, because transportation costs are determined by volume and weight, specially reinforced and lightweight packing materials have been developed for exporting. Packing goods to minimize volume and weight while reinforcing them may save money, as well as ensure that the goods are properly packed. It is recommended that a professional firm be hired to pack the products if the supplier is not equipped to do so. This service is usually provided at a moderate cost.\nSource : http://www.unzco.com\nSpecific marking and labeling is used on export shipping cartons and containers to:\n- Meet shipping regulations.\n- Ensure proper handling.\n- Conceal the identity of the contents.\n- Help receivers identify shipments.\n- Insure compliance with environmental and safety standards.\nThe overseas buyer usually specifies which export marks should appear on the cargo for easy identification by receivers. Products can require many markings for shipment. For example, exporters need to put the following markings on cartons to be shipped :\n- Shipper\'s mark.\n- Country of origin (U.S.A.).\n- Weight marking (in pounds and in kilograms).\n- Number of packages and size of cases (in inches and centimeters).\n- Handling marks (international pictorial symbols).\n- Cautionary markings, such as ""This Side Up"" or ""Use No Hooks"" (in English and in the language of the country of destination).\n- Port of entry.\n- Labels for hazardous materials (universal symbols adapted by the International Air Transport Association and the International Maritime Organization).\n- Ingredients (if applicable, also included in the language of the destination country).\nPackages should be clearly marked to prevent misunderstandings and delays in shipping. Letters are generally stenciled onto packages and containers in waterproof ink. Markings should appear on three faces of the container, preferably on the top and on the two ends or the two sides. Ant old markings must be completely removed from previously used packaging.\nIn addition to the port marks, the customer identification code, and an indication of origin, the marks should include the package number, gross and net weights, and dimensions. If more than one package is being shipped, the total number of packages in the shipment should be included in the markings. The exporter should also add any special handling instructions. It is a good idea to repeat these instructions in the language of the country of destination. and use standard international shipping and handling symbols.\nCustoms regulations regarding freight labeling are strictly enforced. For example, many countries require that the country of origin be clearly labeled on each imported package. Most freight forwarders and export packing specialists can supply the necessary information regarding specific regulations.\nThe handling of transportation is similar for domestic and export orders. Export marks are added to the standard information on a domestic bill of lading. These marks show the name of the exporting carrier and the latest allowed arrival date at the port of export. Instructions for the inland carrier to notify the international freight forwarder by telephone upon arrival should also be included.\nExporters may find it useful to consult with a freight forwarder when determining the method of international shipping. Since carriers are often used for large and bulky shipments, the exporter should reserve space on the carrier well before actual shipment date. This reservation is called the booking contract.\nInternational shipments are increasingly made on a through bill of lading under a multimodal contract. The multimodal transit operator (frequently one of the transporters) takes charge of and responsibility for the entire movement from factory to final destination.\nThe cost of the shipment, the delivery schedule, and the accessibility to the shipped product by the foreign buyer are all factors to consider when determining the method of international shipping. Although air carriers can be more expensive, their cost may be offset by lower domestic shipping costs (for example, using a local airport instead of a coastal seaport) and quicker delivery times. These factors may give the U.S. exporter an edge over other competitors.\nBefore shipping, the U.S. firm should be sure to check with the foreign buyer about the destination of the goods. Buyers often want the goods to be shipped to a free-trade zone or a free port where they are exempt from import duties.\nThe computation of the actual cost of producing a product and bringing it to market is the core element in determining if exporting is financially viable. Many new exporters calculate their export price by the cost-plus method. In the cost-plus method of calculation, the exporter starts with the domestic manufacturing cost and adds administration, research and development, overhead, freight forwarding, distributor margins, customs charges, and profit.\nThe effect of this pricing approach may be that the export price escalates into an uncompetitive range gives a sample calculation. It clearly shows that if an export product has the same ex-factory price as the domestic product, its final consumer price is considerably higher once exporting costs are included.\nMarginal cost pricing is a more competitive method of pricing a product for market entry. This method considers the direct, out-of-pocket expenses of producing and selling products for export as a floor beneath which prices cannot be set without incurring a loss. For example, additional costs may occur due to product modification for the export market that accommodates different sizes, electrical systems, or labels. On the other hand, costs may decrease if the export products are stripped-down versions or made without increasing the fixed costs of domestic production.\nOther costs should be assessed for domestic and export products according to how much benefit each product receives from such expenditures. Additional costs often associated with export sales include :\n- Market research and credit checks.\n- Business travel.\n- International postage, cable, and telephone rates.\n- Translation costs.\n- Commissions, training charges, and other costs involving foreign representatives.\n- Consultants and freight forwarders.\n- Product modification and special packaging.\nAfter the actual cost of the export product has been calculated, the exporter should formulate an approximate consumer price for the foreign market.\nDamaging weather conditions, rough handling by carriers, and other common hazards to cargo make insurance an important protection for U.S. exporters. If the terms of sale make the exporter responsible for insurance, the exporter should either obtain its own policy or insure the cargo under a freight forwarder\'s policy for a fee. If the terms of sale make the foreign buyer responsible, the exporter should not assume (or even take the buyer\'s word) that adequate insurance has been obtained. If the buyer neglects to obtain adequate coverage, damage to the cargo may cause a major financial loss to the exporter.\nShipments by sea are covered by marine cargo insurance.\nAir shipments may also be covered by marine cargo insurance or insurance may be purchased from the air carrier.\nExport shipments are usually insured against loss, damage, and delay in transit by cargo insurance. Carrier liability is frequently limited by international agreements. Additionally, the coverage is substantially different from domestic coverage. Arrangements for insurance may be made by either the buyer or the seller, in accordance with the terms of sale. Exporters are advised to consult with international insurance carriers or freight forwarders for more information.\nAlthough sellers and buyers can agree to different components, coverage is usually placed at 110 percent of the CIF (cost, insurance, freight) or CIP (carriage and insurance paid to) value.', 'You will need to know who is responsible for all the costs and risks associated with a sales contract between you and your new export market. Knowing the delivery terms incorporated into your worldwide sales contracts will reduce any uncertainties and misunderstandings for both you and the buyers of your products.\nTo understand the mutual obligations between you and your buyers.\nInternational Commercial Terms: keeping both parties happy\nInternational Commercial Terms (Incoterms) rules were created to prevent any misunderstandings in international sale contracts where goods pass across national borders.\nThe rules were created and adapted by the International Chamber of Commerce. These define, clearly, the obligations of both sellers and buyers to make global trade easier and reduce the risk of legal complications. They are designed to help trade, not to hinder it.\nIncoterms are regularly updated to keep up with developments in international trade. Incoterms 2010 is the latest version of the rules and has been adapted to take into account the:\n- Increase in customs free zones\n- Increased use of electronic communication in business transactions\n- Effort to increase security in the movement of goods\n- Changes in transport practices\nDelivery terms are put into sales contracts worldwide to make sure both supplier and buyer don’t fall into a costly misunderstanding over who is responsible for the costs and risks in a sales contract.\nThese costs and risks could apply to:\n- Transport freights\n- Customs clearance\n- Duties payable\nIncoterms are three letter trade terms relating to the business terms which are in contracts relating to the sale of goods to export markets.\nClarifying terms for exporters\nWhen you export to a new country or even region, there is a risk of misunderstandings due to countries potentially having different interpretations of the business practices relating to a sale of your goods.\nThe rules clearly explain a set of three letter trade terms reflecting business practices in contracts of the sale of goods.\nThe terms describe mainly the tasks, costs, and risks involved for exporters delivering goods to their buyers.\nThe Incoterms rule is suited to the type of goods sold, the means of transport used, and other obligations of the seller and the buyer which could include insurance or customs clearance.\nWhat Incoterms do (and don’t do)\nFirstly, Incoterms do not replace the contract of sale. They only clarify:\n- Which party to the sale contract is obliged to arrange for shipment\n- When the seller delivers the goods to the buyer\n- Which costs each party is responsible for\nIncoterms do not deal with the transfer of ownership of goods, or any issues arising from a breach of contract. These are usually dealt with in the contract of sale or in the law governing the contract.\nThe Incoterms 2010 rules and you\nYour obligations and your buyer’s obligations mirror each other. These can be carried out personally or through other parties such as carriers or freight forwarders. The individual obligations of the contractual parties (you and your buyer) are below.\nA | Seller’s Obligations | B | Buyer’s Obligations ---| ---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---| A1 | General obligations | B1 | General obligations A2 | Licenses, authorizations, security clearances | B2 | Licenses, authorizations, security clearances A3| Contracts of carriage and insurance | B3 | Contracts of carriage and insurance A4| Delivery| B4| Taking delivery A5| Transfer of risks| B5| Transfer of risks A6| Allocation of costs| B6| Allocation of costs A7| Notices to the buyer| B7| Notices to the seller A8| Delivery document| B8| Proof of delivery A9| Checking, packaging, marking| B9| Inspection of goods A10| Help with information and related costs| B10| Help with information and related costs\n2 The ABCs of the 2010 Incoterms Rules\nThe 2010 Incoterms Rules are divided into two distinct classes.\nThe first class of rules includes seven rules that can be used no matter what the type and number of selected modes of transport. You can apply these rules where a ship is used as part of the carriage of your exported goods.\nIn the second class of rules the point of delivery and the place to which the goods are carried to the buyer of your goods are both maritime or inland waterway ports. For example exporting from Liverpool to Marseilles.\nHere is your list of the three letter trade terms relating to the business terms you will find in the contracts which relate to the sale of your goods to your export markets.\nUnderneath each three letter rule you will find an explanation about what each rule means for you the seller, and your buyer.\nTerms for the first class of Incoterms rules\nEx Works (named place of delivery)\nThe seller delivers when goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer at the seller’s premises, or at a mutually agreed place such as a warehouse or factory.\nThe buyer is responsible for:\n- All transportation costs\n- Bringing the goods to their final destination\nIf the seller loads the goods, he does so at the buyer’s risk and cost.\nFree Carrier (named place of delivery)\n- Delivers the goods, cleared for export, to the buyer-designated carrier at a named location. The risk passes to the buyer at this point\n- Has no obligation to clear the goods for import, pay any import duty or carry out any import custom formalities\n- Is obliged to load goods onto the buyer’s carrier\nCarriage Paid To (named place of destination)\nThis rule is critical because risk passes and costs are transferred at different places. The risk passes when the goods have been delivered to the first carrier.\nThe seller must:\n- Deliver the goods to the carrier or another person nominated by the seller at an agreed place\n- Contract and pay for the costs of carriage necessary to bring the goods to the named place of destination\nWhen CPT rules are used, the seller fulfills their obligation delivering the goods to the carrier, not when the goods reach the place of destination.\nCarriage and Insurance Paid to (named place of destination)\nLike the CPT rule, the rule is critical because the risk passes and costs are transferred at different places.\n- Delivers the goods to the carrier or another person nominated by the seller at an agreed place\n- Is obliged to pay the costs of carriage necessary to bring the goods to the named place of destination\n- Contracts for insurance covering risk of loss of, or damage to, the goods during their carriage\n- Is obliged to obtain at its own expense cargo insurance complying at least with the minimum cover as provided by Clauses ( C ) of the Institute Cargo Clauses\nThis insurance shall be:\n- Contracted with an insurance company of good repute\n- Entitle the buyer to claim directly from the insurer\n- Able to cover, at a minimum, the price provided in the contract plus 10%\n- Shall be in the currency of the contract\nWhen CIP rules are used, the seller fulfills their obligation delivering the goods to the carrier, not when the goods reach the place of destination.\nDelivered at Terminal (named terminal at port or place of destination)\nThe seller delivers when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer at the named terminal at the named port, or place of destination\nHere “terminal” means any place, covered or uncovered, such as a warehouse, container yard or road, rail or air cargo terminal.\nThe seller bears all freights and risks connected with bringing the goods to and unloading them at the terminal.\nDelivered at Place (named place of destination)\nThe seller delivers when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving means of transport ready for unloading at the named place of destination\nThe seller bears all the risks connected with bringing the goods to the named place.\nThe seller isn’t obliged to arrange for the unloading of goods at the place of destination.\nDelivered Duty Paid (named place of destination)\nThis rule has the most obligation for the seller, who must bear all the costs and risks connected with the transport of the goods at the place of destination. The seller must carry out both export and import customs formalities, and pay all the related duties and taxes.\nThe seller delivers when all three objectives below are achieved, namely when the goods are:\nPlaced at the disposal of the buyer Cleared for import on the arriving mode of transport *Ready for unloading at the named place of destination\nTerms for the second class of Incoterms rules:\nYou need adhere to only the following rules if you are exporting goods and the place of departure and the place of destination are both ports on the sea or both an inland waterway.\nFree Alongside Ship (named port of shipment)\nThis rule is widely used in maritime and inland waterway transport, although it may not be appropriate where goods are handed over to the carrier before they are on board the vessel.\nThe seller delivers when the goods are placed alongside the vessel, on a quay for example, at the named port of shipment\nThe risk to the seller of the loss of or damage to the goods also passes from the moment of placing goods alongside a vessel at a named port of shipment.\nCost and Freight (named port of destination)\nThis rule has a critical point because the risk passes and the costs are transferred at different places. While the rule will always specify a destination port, it may not specify the port of shipment where the risk passes to the buyer.\nThe seller is obliged to:\nDeliver the goods on board the vessel Contract for and pay the costs and freight necessary to bring the goods to the named port of destination\nThe risk of loss of, or damage to, the goods passes from the supplier when the goods are on board the vessel.\nWhen the CFR rule is used, the seller fulfills their obligation delivering delivering the goods to the carrier, not when the goods reach the place of destination.\nCost, Insurance, and Freight (named port of destination)\nThe seller is obliged to:\nDeliver the goods on board the vessel Contract for and pay the costs and freight necessary to bring the goods to the named port of destination Contract for insurance covering buyer’s risk of loss of or damage to the goods during the carriage. Obtain insurance only on minimum cover\nThe risk of loss of, or damage to, the goods passes from the supplier when the goods are on board the vessel\nWhen the CIF rule is used, the seller fulfills their obligation delivering delivering the goods to the carrier, not when the goods reach the place of destination.\nTip: Extra insurance arrangements at the buyer’s account are needed for getting more insurance protection.']"	['<urn:uuid:5780560f-e15e-40d3-9b20-f4bec49fb8f5>', '<urn:uuid:ea1cd2a1-fd4a-4cda-b1a3-c2682cf1fe49>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	12	100	3492
69	What models are used to study wound infection treatments?	Two models have been developed to study treatments for infected wounds: 1) The Infection Prevention Model, where treatment is applied before bacterial inoculation and wounds are swabbed regularly to determine bacteria levels, and 2) The Infection Treatment Model, where treatment is delayed for days to allow bacterial infection to establish before treatment, with wounds swabbed for baseline levels and regularly afterward to determine bacterial levels.	['These complex 3D structures of bacteria explain many of the challenges clinicians face with wound care, infection and healing. Scientists are fighting back.\nAntonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) was the first person to delve into the field of microbiology and document initial observations of bacteria. After this preliminary discovery, microbiology was not actively studied again until the 1800s, when it began to gain a foothold in contemporary medicine. Fast-forward to today’s labs, where clinicians are becoming more knowledgeable in the bacteriology of wound healing, and researchers are identifying new ways to overcome long-standing challenges in wound healing, such as biofilms.\nBiofilm is a term used to describe a colony of microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi or yeast, encased by an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). The EPS forms a shield, often causing the bacteria to be resistant to antibodies. While biofilms have been understood in nature for many decades, researchers are only recently beginning to recognize the role they play in infected wounds and the healing process.\nThe US National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates that 80% of human bacterial infections involve biofilms. These infections can develop quickly, sometimes in a matter of hours, and are highly complex. Biofilms are resistant to the defense mechanisms of the body, and as polymicrobial systems, they are difficult to treat with systemic antibiotics or topical antibiotics.\nBiofilms may explain many of the challenges clinicians face with wound care, infection and healing. Due to antibiotic resistance, biofilms may cause chronic infections or prevent wounds from fully healing because the infection is never fully eradicated. Persistent infection can lead to systemic infections, risky prolonged exposure to antibiotics or amputation of the infected site.\nTasked with breaking down biofilms in order to develop effective treatments, scientists are conducting in vivo studies to better understand biofilm properties and identify ways to expose the bacteria. Two models that our lab developed to study the effectiveness of treatments for infected wounds in small and large animals, include the:\n- Infection Prevention Model, where treatment is applied prior to inoculation with bacteria and wounds are swabbed at regular intervals to determine bacteria levels.\n- Infection Treatment Model, where treatment is delayed for several days to allow establishment of bacterial infection prior to treatment. Wounds are swabbed prior to treatment for baseline levels and then at regular intervals post-treatment to determine bacterial levels.\nThere are also models in development designed to test new treatments specifically for biofilms. The typical bacterial strain for all infected wound or biofilm models is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA, as this environmental organism regularly causes infections in wounds and is a major concern in individuals with compromised immune systems, especially those who are hospitalized.\nIt’s evident that biofilms are a significant public health concern today and the more we do to understand their role in certain infectious disease and biofilm processes the greater the chances of controlling them and improving patient safety.\nAn earlier version of this post was published by MPI Research, which is now part of Charles River.']	['<urn:uuid:49374028-3cf2-496f-ab9c-b318d85e10be>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	9	65	502
70	Hi! I'm new to retro gaming and wondering what's the best way to understand how these classic video game cheat codes actually work behind the scenes?	Game cheats typically work through two main mechanisms. The first involves modifying RAM (game memory) values while the game is running - like how the Pro Action Replay works. For example, in Metroid, finding and modifying the missile count memory address at 0x6879 can give infinite missiles. The second method involves patching the ROM (game code) itself - this is how the Game Genie operates. The Game Genie watches for specific memory addresses being accessed and substitutes different values. It uses a special encoding system with 16 letters (A,E,P,O,Z,X,L,U,G,K,I,S,T,V,Y,N) to represent these patches. Modern games like those in the Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 use simpler button combination codes, like the 'UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, UP, UP, DOWN' sequence to unlock DLC content.

All authors contributing to EnHacklopedia should be made aware of the license before contributing. If the author does not agree to the licensing, his or her contributions will not be accepted into the project.\nFCE Ultra Debug is a highly compatible NES emulator that helps facilitate code hacking. It includes a RAM searcher as well as a debugger. The RAM searcher is labeled ""Cheats"" under the Tools menu and can also be accessed by the ""Shift+F1"" key combination. Cheats can be both added, removed, and searched for here. The ""Known value"" options searches for the specific byte entered in the space next to that button. Below this, the unknown value options exist. If the check box next to any of the bottom three options is checked, then the value is restricted to being with in the difference supplied. The RAM searcher only searches for 8-byte values and performs all searches in hexadecimal.\nAlso under the tools menu is the debugger, labeled ""Debug""; It can also be accessed with F1. On the left is the disassembled 6502 code, with the top instruction being the current instruction to be executed. In the middle are several options. ""Run"" resumes the game, while ""Step in"" executes the next instruction. Step out continues execution until the subroutine is exected. Finally, step over skips the next instruction. The ""seek to"" option simply moves the disassembly to the location specified, while the seek PC moves the disassembly to the PC. Underneath this, the registers A, X, and Y are displayed, with the stack underneath. Finally, at the bottom, PPU and Sprite are listed.\nThe 6502 processor that the NES uses is an 8-bit processor. The 6502 provides 2 8-bit general purpose registers (X and Y), an 8-bit accumulator, an 8-bit stack pointer, an 8-bit status register, and a 16-bit program counter. With only 151 instructions defined, many desirable operations are missing, including any multi-byte operations; multiply, divide, and modulus operations, and several branch instructions. Additionally, the 6502 contains several potentially problematic bugs. The JMP instruction is partially broken. If JMP $xxFF is executed, the PC will not jump to the address stored in $xxFF and $xxFF+1 like it should but rather to the address stored in $xxFF and $xx00. Additionally, the 105 undefined instructions result in undocumented and hard to prevent effects, instead of a NOP or BRK instruction. A list of all the 6502 opcodes and their effects on the NES can be found in the 6502 reference.\nThe Game Genie, made by Galoob, is a cheat device, like the Pro Action Replay. However, unlike the Pro Action Replay, the Game Genie patches ROM, whereas the Pro Action Replay edits RAM. For example, a code may patch the address 0x8000 with the value 0x3F. This means that instead of modifying 0x8000 to be 0x3F, instead the Game Genie will watch for the game to access 0x8000, and whenever that happens it will send 0x3F to the location that requested 0x8000. This method, however, has one drawback. Because the 6502 only has a 16-bit program counter, only 64 KB of memory can be referenced at a time. To get around this limitation, the NES employs what is known as ""bank switching"". Basically, the NES references the entire ROM in 64 KB pages, and when necessary switches the page. What this means is that the assembly code referenced at our location 0x8000 is not always the same. It may refer to 0x8000 or 0x18000 or something else, but all will be patched. This can cause bugs, which is obviously undesirable. To combat this, Galoob provides an 8-character Game Genie code, which an extra byte called ""compare"". For this example, compare will be 0x5A. What the Game Genie will do is watch the address 0x8000 to be called. When it is called, if the value at that location is 0x5A, then 0x3F will be return. Otherwise, the Game Genie will allow the game to operate as intended. Game Genie codes also have to be encoded. Encoding and decoding Game Genie codes is explained in the sections below. It is worthwhile to learn how to do these operations by hand. However, while not very hard, it is quite tedious. GG Encoder automates this process for you. Finally, decoded Game Genie codes are expressed in the format aabb:cc for 6-character and aabb?dd:cc, where aabb is the address to patch, cc is the patch value, and dd is the compare byte.\nGame Genie codes for the NES code in two formats: 6-character and 8-character. In any Game Genie code, only 16 different letters are used: A, E. P, O, Z, X, L, U, G, K, I, S, T, V, Y, and N. Left to right, each of these characters is assigned the bytes 0x0 through 0xF. To decode a game genie code, first rewrite the code in the for of hexadecimal. For example, the code GOSSIP would become 0x49DD51. To get the address out of a 6-character game genie code, the C-style equation is ""addr = 0x8000 + ((n3 & 7) << 12) | ((n5 & 7) << 8) | ((n4 & 8) << 8) | ((n2 & 7) << 4) | ((n1 & 8) << 4 | (n4 & 7) | (n3 & 8);"", where n0 is the highest nybble, n1 the next highest, etc., with n5 being the lowest nybble. This equation also works for 8-character Game Genie codes. The equations for decoding the data vary slightly between the two formats. For 6-character, it\'s ""data = ((n1 & 7) << 4) | ((n0 & 8) << 4) | (n0 & 7) | (n5 & 8);"" while for 8-character it is ""data = ((n1 & 7) << 4) | ((n0 & 8) << 4) | (n0 & 7) | (n7 & 8);"" Finally, 8-character Game Genie codes have the extra compare byte, which is decoded with ""compare = ((n7 & 7) << 4) | ((n6 & 8) << 4) | (n6 & 7) | (n5 & 8);""\nDecoding GOSSIP. First convert into hex, which gives us 0x49DD51. Then extract the address: addr = 0x8000 + ((0xD & 7) << 12) | ((1 & 7) << 8) | ((5 & 8) << 8) | ((0xD & 7) << 4) | (9 & 8) << 4) | (5 & 7) | (0xD & 8). This simplifies to 0x8000 + (5 << 12) | (1 << 8) | (0 << 8) | (5 << 4) | (8 << 4) | 5 | 8 = 0x8000 + 0x5000 | 0x100 | 0 | 0x50 | 0x80 | 5 | 8 = 0x8000 + 0x51DD = 0xD1DD. The only thing left to do is to grab the data: data = ((9 & 7) << 4) | ((4 & 8) << 4) | (4 & 7) | (1 & 8) = (1 << 4) | (0 << 4) | 4 | 0 = 0x10 | 4 = 0x14. The decoded Game Genie code is D1DD:14.\nDecoding ZEXPYGLA. In hex, this gives us 0x28A17430. Extracting the address is the same as in the 6-character example: addr = 0x8000 + ((1 & 7) << 12) | ((4 & 7) << 8) | ((7 & 8) << 8) | ((0xA & 7) << 4) | ((8 & 8) << 4) | (7 & 7) | (1 & 8) = 0x8000 + (1 << 12) | (4 << 8) | (0 << 8) | (2 << 4) | (8 << 4) | 7 | 0 = 0x8000 + 0x1000 | 0x400 | 0 | 0x20 | 0x80 | 7 | 0 = 0x8000 + 0x14A7 = 0x94A7. Now get the data and compare values: data = ((8 & 7) << 4) | ((2 & 8) << 4) | (2 & 7) | (0 & 8) = (0 << 4) | (0 << 4) | 2 | 0 = 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 = 2; compare = ((0 & 7) << 4) | ((3 & 8) << 4) | (3 & 7) | (4 & 8) = (0 << 4) | (0 << 4) | 3 | 0 = 3. The final decoded version is 94A7?03:02.\nThis hack is performed on the Metroid (U) (PRG0) [!] rom. Results on the (E) or bad or overdump versions may be different. Boot up FCEUXD and start a game. Play through the game until you obtain missiles. If necessary, consult GameFAQs. Samus starts off with 5 missiles. This is plenty. Make a save state, just in case. Go to the cheat menu and do a known value search for 5. For me, this cut down the possibilities to 37. Shoot a missile then search for 4. I have 2 possibilies left. You may have more. While it\'s possible to just go ahead test each possibility, we can try to get rid of one. Walk around for a bit, but don\'t shoot. Then search for 4. Still 2 possibilities. Shoot another missile. Down to 3. Search for 3. Still two possibilities (0x0000 and 0x6879). Let\'s test them. Select the first possibility on the far right menu ($0000). Click on it. On the left, the address and value will be added. Click ""add"". The game froze. This is not good. So the other possibility is likely the right one. Load the save state, at the code, and test. You have infinite missiles.\nWhile the code just hacked is good for PAR, it won\'t work with a Game Genie. This section shows how to make the code into Game Genie. Because Game Genie patches ROM, we need to modify the assembly code to give us infinite missiles. We already have a starting point - the address where the number of missiles is stored out - 0x6879. Delete all codes and go to the debug menu. Under breakpoints, click add. In the left address box, put in our address, 0x6879. We\'re only looking at one address, so leave the right box blank. Underneath this, we can choose whether we want to break when the address is read from, written to, or executed, or any combination of the three. The missile address is subtracted from when a missile is shot, so this qualifies as a write. Choose this and click OK. Click the run button and shoot a missile. The game pauses and the debug menu comes up. This means that one of our breakpoints occurred, in this case our only one. On the left, the disassembly is shown, with the instruction on top being the one just executed. Here it is $D333: CE 79 68 DEC $6879 = #$04. DEC stands for decrement, or subtract one. It is subtracting one from the address given - our missile addresss! The rest is added on by FCEU. This tells you that after the operation, the value at $6879 will be 4. We want to disable this operation. The easiest way is to just NOP the instruction. NOP means nothing happens. While this would certainly achieve our goal, NOP is a one byte instruction (0xEA), whereas this DEC is three. The NOP would have to be used three times. Because the NES Game Genie only allows three codes to begin with, this is certainly undesirable. If only one NOP were to be used, all subsequent opcodes would be messed up. Indeed, here changing only 0xD333 to a NOP causes the game to reset when a missile is shot. Another option is to find some unused memory, and change the instruction so that the decrement occurs there. Opening the hex editor up and going to the 0x6800 block, there is much RAM that appears to be unused, including 0x6800. Our code will change DEC $6879 to DEC $6800. Just as CE 79 68 is DEC $6879, CE 00 68 is DEC $6800. Go in the hex editor to 0xD334 and modify 0x79 to 0x00. When shooting missiles, the missile count does not go down, and there are no apparent side effects. The final step is to format the code. We want to change the byte 0x79 to 0x00 at 0xD334. This makes the code D334?79:00, or AAUIGUPY.', 'This page contains Cheats, Secrets, and Boss Orders for every game in the Mega Man Legacy Collection 2: Mega Man 7, 8, 9, and 10.\nThe following cheats were added for the 2017 collection.\nEditUnlock all DLC in Mega Man 9 and 10\nTo unlock all DLC in Mega Man 9 or 10, navigate to the title screen of either game and enter this code on Controller 1: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, UP, UP, DOWN.\nMega Man 7 was originally released on the Super Nintendo and the button commands below reflect that.\nTo get the music of Super Ghouls and Ghosts on the Shade Man stage, simply hold B while selecting Shade Man.\nCloud Man- use powered up M.Buster shots, slide when he tries to blow you off the edge, and slide under him when he charges.\nJunk Man- just wait till he jumps over you then zap him with Thunder Strike.\nFreeze Man- When he comes near you, use Junk shield.\nTurbo Man- shoot him with ice at the start, then dodge and blast his bubble with M.Buster, and blast him with ice whenever you have the chance.\nClown (at the museum)- shoot his head with M.Buster or shoot your fist at his head if you have R.Adaptor.\nSlash Man- blast him with ice then dodge the paint he drops.\nSpring Man- use Slash claw and jump right when he fires his fist at you.\nShade Man- use wild coil or Rocket Punch and dodge when he swoops down by sliding.\nTurbo Man- Use Crush Noise and jump over him when he charges at you.\nBass- use Rocket Punch and dodge his shots, you should have an energy tank to be safe.\nGuts Man (rebuilt)- use slash claw to swipe the blocks at him, and you should have at least one energy tank.\nBass with T.

However, you cannot jump straight up (you must be moving forward), and you can only do it if you haven’t used up all your megaball.\nTo execute the super jump, jump while moving towards a ledge you want to reach. At the peak of the jump, shoot the megaball and immediately jump. you will bounce off the ball in mid-air and skyrocket up. This is especialy useful in Tengu Man’s stage, where jumping from platform to platform against the wind can be risky.\nThe following cheats were originally written for the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of MM9.\nIn the first Wiley stage directly after defeating Changkey Dragon(which becomes the new spawn point if you perish) you will come across two Telly X’s that will continually re-spawn out of tubes. Equip Jewel Satellite and you can destroy the two Telly’s for as long as you would like and collect screws, extra lives, health and weapon energy. (If you stand on top of the first set of tubes and position yourself correctly, you can put your controller down and walk away. You will continue to destroy the Telly X in front of you and whatever it drops will fall into your lap. When you come back eventually you will have 999 screws, 9 lives, and full health and weapon ammo.\nSubmitted by: situations\n<p>If you want to farm for screws and the like, consider going back to Plug Man’s stage after clearing it. By playing through the stage over and over again in its entirety, you can collect two extra lives, an E-Tank (the only E-Tank in any of the eight Robot Master stages) and around 45 screws per visit. It is indeed the most lucrative of the stages to head to in this regard.\nAn addition from Colin Moriarty: The Jewel Satellite on just about any stage will allow you to easily harvest screws and extra lives from unsuspecting enemies as well. The best place to use the Jewel Satellite is in the initial run on Concrete Man’s stage. The birds, the rocks they drop, and the enemies that come out of holes in an attempt to knock you into them will give you endless amounts of screws and extra lives if enough time is spent. Run back and forth with the Jewel Satellite equipped during on the first section of Concrete Man’s stage, respawning enemies and collecting ridiculous amounts of screws!\nAn addition from bergsandwich: There’s another great technique to get as many screws as you need. With the Jewel Satellite in your inventory, head to Plug Man’s stage. Head to the first pipe you find that spawns endless amounts of slow-moving floating robots. Engage the shield and sit right next to the pipe. Enemies will run into you from above, dropping whatever items they drop right on top of you, including small screws. Stand there for as long as needed to acquire the amount of screws you want.\nAn addition from Holyxion: The above technique described by bergsandwich is an awesome one. Keep in mind that with the Jewel Satellite engaged at the proper areas on Plug Man‘s stage, you can actually walk away from your game for as long as needed as enemies funnel towards you, dropping items right on top of Mega Man. So, if you need to farm, you can do so while you do something else entirely!\nAn addition from static123: Another great place to farm for screws and extra lives is on Hornet Man’s stage. Head to the area near the beginning of the stage with two missile-launching flower pots. Stand on the second of the three steps heading left and use the Jewel Satellite to destroy their flower missiles. Positioning yourself in such a way that destroyed missiles drop items right on Mega Man, you can stand here indefinitely and farm screws and lives at your leisure.\nTo easily defeat the rock miniboss on Jewel Man’s stage, equip the Hornet Chaser. The Hornet Chaser, when deployed, will attack and damage the rock foe even when he’s on the ceiling, forcing him to come down where you can quickly finish him off.\nTo easily defeat the flame dragon miniboss on Magma Man’s stage and in Dr. Wily’s castle, consider equipping the Concrete Shot. Five shots to the face of the dragon with the Concrete Shot will quickly dispatch it. While the Black Hole Bomb will suck all of the flames off of the dragon’s body, rendering it unable to attack, it won’t heavily damage the dragon itself. Use the Concrete Shot instead.\nThe Rush Jet Adaptor is acquired differently in Mega Man 9 than fans may be accustomed. Instead of getting it when defeating a specific Robot Master and assimilating the skill along with that Robot Master’s weapon, the Rush Jet Adaptor is earned by Mega Man after any five Robot Masters are slain. When the fifth is killed, Roll and Auto will automatically give Mega Man this adaptor.\nBelow is the suggested order to defeat the Robot Masters in, as well as which weapons to use on both them and the bosses in Dr. Wily’s castle. Keep in mind that in terms of the Robot Masters, you can jump in at any point, but we recommend starting with Galaxy Man and going from there.\n– The Laser Trident is the weakness of all three sections of this boss, but the middle section is made much, much easier by using the Tornado Blow on it.</p>\n– The Plug Ball is the primary weakness of Wily’s final form (the UFO). However, if he appears too high to attack with the Plug Ball, quickly switch over to the Hornet Chaser and use it on him. They will hit him high above for only one bar of energy per strike, but it will help you decrease his energy a little bit more.</p>\nMega Man 9 is hard. There are two specific items that will help you beyond the usual batch of extra lives and E-Tanks that you should consider purchasing with your screws if you’re having difficulty. The first item to be considered are Shock Guards, which can be purchased from Auto and Roll and will allow you to survive any unintentional encounter with instant-kill spikes (once per purchase). The other item is called a Beat Call, and will automatically save you from any unintentional encounter with a pit or chasm (once per purchase). If you’re having difficulty getting through any given stage, especially in Dr. Wily’s castle, consider a visit to the store to purchase these two items to even the odds.\nThe following cheats were originally written for the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of MM10.\nAside from the Trophy/Achievement you get for beating the game on Hard, all of the Trophies/Achievements can be won on Easy Mode.\nCertain challenges in Challenges Mode can be unlocked by confronting that challenge in the main game. For instance, to fight Pump Man on hard in Challenges Mode, you must first get to him and beat him in the regular game on hard difficulty.\nTo unlock Hard difficulty, beat the game once-through on Normal difficulty.\nIt’s been over two decades since Dr. Wily built his first set of Robot Masters with an exploitable set of fatal flaws. Not having learned his lesson the last nine times, Wily’s newest batch is once again riddled with weaknesses. Our own Colin Moriarty exposes these weaknesses with his no-fail Mega Man 10 boss order.\nDefeat the robot bosses in this order to take advantage of their unique weaknesses. You’ll have to use your Mega Buster to take out the first boss, Sheep Man, but he’s a bit of a pushover thanks to the predictability of his attacks. Use the weapons you gain from each enemy to beat the next.\n- Sheep Man – Use Mega Buster\n- Pump Man – Use Electric Wool\n- Solar Man – Use Water Shield\n- Chill Man – Use Solar Blaze\n- Nitro Man – Use Chill Spike\n- Commando Man – Use Wheel Cutter\n- Blade Man – Use Commando Bomb\n- Strike Man – Use Triple Blade']"	['<urn:uuid:9d0b7a49-5508-459f-8c7b-ef67355da063>', '<urn:uuid:426125f8-84f5-4664-a08b-3d12c1460013>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	26	126	4106

Compost particularly enhances soil by creating passageways for air and water, holding moisture, and supporting beneficial microorganisms.	"['Taking your hobby of gardening an extra step and using organic materials, can be beneficial for the plants you grow, as well as, the environment!

Groundcover perennials can be used as an alternative to grass where there is minimal foot traffic, or in an area where grass is difficult to maintain, such as on a slope. They are also handy in between larger perennials, as they help to suppress weeds and keep the soil moist and cool. Good choices for groundcover perennials are creeping thyme, ajuga, various sedums, alyssum and armeria.\nCheck for weeds often in your garden as they will leech nutrients from the soil. Weeds can grow at a high rate of speed and overwhelm the resources available to your plants. Take the time to check for weeds at least twice a week to catch them while they are new shoots.\nUse a sanitary laundry basket to pick your fruit and vegetable harvest. They are reusable and already have holes so you can rinse the dirt and debris off your yields. It acts like a strainer and will replace the function of wood baskets. Save money and stay green at the same time.\nIf you’re planting crops that need an abundant amount of sunshine, then plant miniature gardens wherever the sun shines most. If you have plants that need more than six hours of sunlight, group them together in small plots throughout your yard. If your patio or deck receives the most amount of sunshine, plant your crops in appropriately sized containers and place them in the brightest spot you can find.\nKnow your climate zone. This can be the difference between a thriving garden and one that never grows. Knowing your climate zone will help you choose flowers, fruits, vegetables and trees that are perfect for where you are. This way, you get a bit of a headstart when designing a garden.\nRemember your climate and don’t plant things that won’t grow in your area. You don’t want to waste time and space by planting seeds that will not do well. Ask other gardeners you know what they are successful with growing. Most gardeners are willing to share any advice they have.\nYou should place human hair in netting around your garden to deter animals from eating your growing produce. The scent of humans can deter animals from coming near an area. When you get a hair cut place the cut hair into satchels made from netting. Hang the netting around your garden to ward off pests.\nYou can maintain a garden without spending a lot of money on store-bought mulch or using pesticides on your plants. Anything that used to be alive is a great source for mulch, like leaves or kitchen waste. Remember the tips in this article, in order to maintain a great organic garden, without spending too much money!…', 'Lawn and Garden Shop\nWHAT IS COMPOST?\nCompost is a natural organic material produced when microorganisms break down organic residue. This process occurs continually in nature, resulting in a sweet, earthy smelling brown material called compost. Compost adds food for many organisms and an enormous diversity of organisms to your garden soil when you use it as a soil amendment. It is a rich source of organic matter. Although compost contains plant nutrients, it is typically characterized as a soil amendment rather than as a fertilizer because most of the nutrients are not readily available and only become available slowly, over many years.\nThere are several ways to acquire and use compost to benefit the soil and plants in your own yard and garden:\nThe best way to improve the soil is to mix in plenty of compost or other organic matter before planting. Thoroughly mixing these materials deep into the soil helps retain water and air, and provides nutrients to the plant roots.\nWhen: Mix in organic matter with existing soil before planting perennials, lawns, trees and shrubs, each time annual beds are replanted, and when dividing perennials or repotting container plants.\nHow: Use a shovel or digging fork to mix amendments into the top 6 to 12 inches of soil. Amend large planting areas not just small holes for each plant.\nHow Much: Amount of compost recommended to be tilled into each 100 square\nfeet of planting area. Use these following guidelines.\nIn clay soils: 8 cu. feet (0.3 cu. Yd.) = 1"" layer of compost.\nIn sandy soils: 13 cu. feet (0.5 cu. Yd.) = 1 ½"" layer of compost.\nIn sandy soils: 24 cu. feet (0.9 cu. Yd.) = 4"" layer of compost.\nSoil Testing: For a list of local laboratories who can test the amount of sand, silt and clay in your soil call your County Extension Service.\nWhat: Different types of organic amendments may provide special benefits for certain plants or soil types, as the chart below shows. Any clean organic amendment will improve the soil. The best advice is to use what is reasonably priced, plentiful and easy to get. Use as Mulch for Vegetable and Perennial Gardens - Mulch means placing compost (or another material) on the soil’s surface around a plant. Mulching with compost is especially beneficial because earthworms and other soil life move through the mulch and help carry these materials down into the soil. Placing mulch around plants also helps to limit weed growth, reduce evaporation, moderate fluctuations in soil temperature, and reduce soil erosion.\nUse to Top-dress and Renovate your Lawn - Spreading a thin layer of compost on your lawn can do wonders for the soil underneath. This technique works best if you first aerate the lawn.\nIn the spring or fall when the soil is moist, use an aerator tool (you can rent one) to remove plugs of soil and thatch from your lawn.\nNext, using a spreader tool or a rake, spread a thin layer (about ½ "") of compost over the lawn. The grass should be standing up through the compost after application, not bent over or buried.\nYou can also mix grass seed in with the compost to encourage new growth and fill in bare spots where weeds might take hold.\nConsider a Retrofit If the soil under your lawn is unhealthy, one of the best actions you can take is to retrofit your lawn. Grass thrives in 8-12"" of healthy soil. In addition, seed-grown lawns are more sustainable in healthy soil than sod-grown lawns because roots grow directly into the soil rather than through layers of potentially different soil types. Retrofitting a lawn with healthy soil and reseeding may be worth it-in fact, several local studies have indicated that a lawn grown on a deep layer of healthy soil pays for itself in 5-7 years based on water savings alone!\nWhat Does Compost Do? Improved soil structure creates passageways in the soil for air and water. In heavy clay soils, the addition of compost enhances the physical make-up of soil which improves soil structure, porosity and bulk density to create a better environment for plant growth.\nSupplies Slow-Release Nutrients to Plants without using fertilizers Compost is a good source of nutrients including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, and microorganisms essential for plant growth. Since compost is made of relatively stable organic matter, nutrients are slowly made available for root uptake and. In this way, nutrients are less likely to be lost through leaching.\nHolds Moisture and Reduces Erosion Compost has a large capacity to hold water-many times its own weight. This reduces water loss and leaching in soil. The soil-binding properties of compost result from its humus content which acts like a glue, holding soil particles together, making soil resistant to erosion and improving moisture retention.\nImmobilizes and Degrades Pollutants Compost has the ability to bind heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides and other contaminants, reducing both their leachability and absorption by plants. The soil microorganisms that compost supports also help break down pesticides, fertilizers and hydrocarbons. This same binding effect allows compost to be used as a filter for storm water and other runoff.\nProvides Organic Matter Compost supplies organic matter to the soil which increases the presence of microorganisms. The activity of microorganisms promotes root development and assists in the extraction of nutrients from the soil. It also encourages the growth of earthworms and other macro-organisms, whose tunneling increases water infiltration and aeration.\nSuppresses Soil-Borne Diseases and Plant Pathogens Plant disease is influenced by both the level and type of organic matter as well as the microorganisms present in soil. Detrimental organisms like oot-eating nematodes, a number of specific plant diseases and several lawn diseases are suppressed by microorganisms found in compost.\nHow good is the compost? The quality of the compost used for soil enhancement is important. Commercial compost should have a sweet, earthy smell. Compost should meet your Department of Ecology’s guidelines for Grade A compost.\nSuggested Reading: Soil Biology Primer, Soil and Water Conservation Society, Revised 2000.

73	How do formal rules differ in music and society?	In music, formal rules involve keeping time and proportion, as when these are broken, the music becomes sour and loses its sweet nature. In contrast, social rules are divided into different categories with varying levels of enforcement - social norms are informal consensual guidelines where violations lead to rejection but no legal consequences, while legal norms are formal, universal, and coercible with state-enforced sanctions. Religious and moral norms form additional categories with their own characteristics.

Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me."", 'What are social norms?\nWe explain what social norms are, their characteristics, examples and their relationship with legal norms. In addition, other types of standards.\nSocial norms are a group of rules and provisions determined by society regarding the conduct of individuals.\nThese are social considerations that society imposes on us as adequate or respectful. However, non-compliance does not constitute a crime , but must be followed to enjoy a better coexistence and acceptance.\nSocial norms include values , customs , rituals, traditions and behaviors of all kinds, which may be more or less close to moral norms or the cultural tradition of society.\nThese types of norms are informal and come from the social consensus , that is, from what a certain society (or sector of it) considers in good taste at a given time.\nSocial norms vary according to their sociocultural context , they are not universal: they depend on the place and time to which they belong. For example, the social norms of Victorian England, famous for its puritanism and modesty, are not the same as they exist today in the same country, nor were they similar to those that existed at the same time, but in China.\nOn the other hand, the breach of the social norms does not entail a formal or legal sanction in itself, but not following them can lead to situations of rejection , since what they are looking for is to standardize the behavior. For example, we may be denied the right to enter a church, if we intend to do so in a bathing suit.\nThere are all kinds of social conventions that qualify as social norms. For example:\n- In almost the entire West, he shakes hands when greeting an unknown person. If, instead, it is someone familiar, the greeting changes to a kiss on the cheek or other types of interactions, which in turn will depend on the sex of that person: in certain countries men greet each other with a handshake always, while in others it is normal to kiss on the cheek.\n- In colonial America dependent on Spain, it was usual to separate society by race (Indians, blacks, whites), and formal treatment between the subaltern races (Indians and blacks) towards the dominant one should be given according to certain linguistic formulas: “Your mercy” or “Your excellence.” Whites should do the same when dealing with emissaries of the king or their own authorities.\n- In some Muslim countries, the code of respect at mealtime involves the final belching as a sign of thanks and approval. In the West, on the other hand, belching at the table is a gesture considered rude and in bad taste.\nSocial and legal norms have a similar origin: they are part of the norms with which a society decides by consensus to govern itself and that organize, structure and articulate everyday treatment. However, legal norms have a much more formal, universal and coercible status , since their non-compliance entails severe sanctions by the State .\nOn the contrary, social norms can lead to misunderstandings, to offend others, or to social isolation, but rarely to more risky situations.\nFurthermore, social norms can be respected in many ways, even partially, or they can be replaced by others. While legal norms are immovable and define the framework of justice and coexistence of societies.\nOther types of standards\nThe norms or normative orders can be of many types, according to the authority that issues them or to the vital space that they try to regulate or control. Thus, it is also possible to talk about:\n- Religious norms . They arise from religious institutions and regulate the spiritual life of people. They are personal and voluntary. They imply adherence to a code or philosophy considered as a path to salvation or elevation.\n- Legal norms . They come from a judicial or legal authority and are coercive. They make up the body of laws with which a society governs itself.\n- Moral standards . They govern the behavior of individuals in a society. They depend on what that society considers “good”, “bad” or “adequate.”']"	['<urn:uuid:4a09c741-f584-47b0-8361-92b2dbc82d41>', '<urn:uuid:246b9c4e-0bde-4e46-b82d-f1a55c957190>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	9	75	1370
74	community climate change adaptation engagement strategies success examples	Successful community climate change adaptation involves multiple strategies and stakeholder engagement. Examples include the City of Annapolis's Weather It Together initiative engaging local business partnerships, Cambridge's Climate Change Preparedness & Resilience Plan involving business participation, and R-Urban in Colombes, France, which created collective facilities for recycling, eco-construction, and urban agriculture. These initiatives demonstrate how communities can involve citizens, businesses, and local organizations in resilience planning while addressing both environmental and economic challenges through participatory approaches.	['R-Urban: Resilient Agencies, Short Circuits, and Civic Practices in Metropolitan Suburbs\nContemporary cities and suburbs struggle today to adapt to current and future challenges, such as global warming, depletion of fossil fuels and other natural resources, economic recession, population growth, housing and employment crises, and growing social and economic divides. In this context, most of the current approaches to urban regeneration are top-down, driven by municipal or private developers, and fail to take into account the social and ecological interests of the residents. It is clear that new approaches to urban regeneration are desperately needed in times of economic and ecological crisis, and that as financial capital diminishes, social capital increases.\nR-Urban was initiated by atelier d’architecture autogérée (aaa) in 2008 as a bottom-up framework for resilient urban regeneration involving the city residents in transforming their neighborhoods to face the challenges of the future. It is one of the numerous small-scale initiatives that have emerged as a reaction to the slow pace of governmental processes in Europe and the lack of consensus in taking the future environmental and economic challenges further and evaluating their consequences for people’s lives. Although starting local and small-scale, R-Urban aims for a shift in scale and a long-term and larger impact, by initiating short circuits between complementary urban hubs and developing resilient practices at different levels (local, regional, international) that will create new collective dynamics and forms of urban “commons” 1 and eventually conduction to a civic urban movement.\nConcentrating on spatial agencies and networks around these collective hubs, R-Urban tries to supply tools and spaces that will manifest citizens’ existing resilience initiatives and practices in suburban contexts. Spatial design processes contribute to expressing ecological cycles in tangible ways and help facilitate citizens’ experiences of making and doing. The democratic governance of “commons” is as such associated with concrete hands-on actions whose consequences are visible and measurable. More than just adaptation, resilience is for R-Urban a catalyst of urban activation, innovation, and creativity.\nAfter a period of research into urban resilience based on ecological cycles and following cradle-to-cradle principles, we at aaa proposed the project to various municipalities and grassroots organizations in different cities and towns. We conceived it as a participative strategy based on the setting up of local ecological cycles that activate material (e.g., water, energy, waste, and food) and immaterial (e.g., local skill, socioeconomic, cultural, and self-building) flows between key fields of activity (e.g., economy, habitation, and urban agriculture) that exist already or could be implemented within the existing fabric of the city. We started the concrete implementation of the R-Urban strategy in 2011 in Colombes, a suburban town of 84,000 inhabitants near Paris, in partnership with the local municipality and a number of organizations and local residents. The project is intended to gradually generate a network around collective facilities hubs, each with complementary urban functions, bringing together emerging citizen projects and creating spatial and ecological agencies to enhance the capacity of urban resilience. The first three collective facilities include a social economy unit specialized in recycling and eco-construction, a cooperative housing unit, and an urban agriculture unit. The units are collectively run and their architecture showcases the various issues they address, such as local material recycling, local skills, energy production, and food growing.2\nRecyclab is a recycling and eco-construction unit comprising several facilities for storing and reusing locally salvaged materials, recycling and transforming them into eco-construction elements for self-building and retrofitting. An associated “fab lab” has been set up for resident use. Recyclab will function as a social enterprise.\nEcohab is a cooperative eco-housing project comprising a number of partially self-built and collectively managed ecological dwellings, including several shared facilities and schemes (e.g., food growing, production spaces, energy and water harvesting, and car sharing). The seven dwellings will include two public housing units and a temporary residence unit for students and researchers. Ecohab will be run as a cooperative.\nAgrocité is an agro-cultural unit comprising an experimental micro-farm, community gardens, pedagogical and cultural spaces, and a series of experimental devices for compost heating, rainwater collection and use for garden irrigation, solar energy production, and graywater phyto-remediation. Agrocité is a hybrid structure, with some components running as social enterprises (e.g., the micro-farm, market, worm compost farm, and café) and others being run by local organizations (e.g., the community garden, cultural space, and pedagogical space).\nCurrent stakeholders include existing local organizations and professional organizations and institutions at the regional and national level as well as social entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens. Inn addition to giving citizens the opportunity to take active roles, we teach the necessary skills, and create opportunities for people to invent their own jobs as part of a different economy. This alternative economy is not only financial. It is also social, cognitive, and affective.\nNetworks and cycles of production and consumption will form between the collective facilities and the neighborhood, closing chains of need and supply as locally as possible. To overcome the current crisis, we must try, as French philosopher André Gorz states, “to produce what we consume and consume what we produce.”3 However, R-Urban interprets this production-consumption chain broadly, going well beyond material aspects to include the cultural, cognitive, and affective dimensions. The project sets a precedent for the participative retrofitting of metropolitan suburbs, in which the relationship between the urban and the rural is reconsidered. It tries to demonstrate what citizens can do if they change working and living habits.\nR-Urban is not only about “sustainability” but also about societal change and political and cultural reinvention, addressing issues of social inequality, power, and cultural difference. A city can only become resilient with the active involvement of its diverse inhabitants. To stimulate the democratic engagement of the largest number of citizens, we need tools, knowledge, and places for testing new collective practices and initiatives and for showcasing the results and benefits of a resilient transformation of the city. In this, architects have a role to play. Rather than acting merely as building designers, they can be initiators, negotiators, co-managers, and enablers of processes and agencies that strengthen existing civic resilience initiatives. R-Urban is an emancipatory project for all those who participate in it—even for the municipality as a partner.\nTwo of the initial hubs—Agrocité and Recyclab—are currently built and have started to function. The R-Urban network will grow in the next few years with new units and will be managed by a cooperative land trust, which will acquire space, facilitate development, and guarantee democratic governance. The municipality should help with land and offer funding and logistical support. Local governments need to play a new role in such citizens’ initiatives by allowing new types of civic, self-managed facilities to emerge and to last. This is the passage from the welfare state to a civic economy in which new forms of public-civic partnerships should be key components.', 'The year 2017 will stay on the record as one of the most expensive years to date for climate and weather disaster events. The U.S. experienced 16 weather and climate disasters that caused over $1 billion in damages, tying the record year of 2011 for the most billion-dollar disasters. From summer through the fall, wildfires in various parts of California led to fatalities, destruction of entire communities, and damage costs of $18 billion, with economic consequences that will continue to impact the region. These events have highlighted that climate change has already begun to and will continue to impact local communities and businesses, and that local economies will benefit from more coordinated resilience planning.\nCommunities across the U.S. are taking steps to identify their climate change risks and enhance their resilience to changing climate conditions. Many local governments have assessed their vulnerabilities and are developing resilience plans with support from local stakeholders. However, a key set of stakeholders are often not at the table: businesses. Collaboration between local governments and the business community on climate change resilience remains limited. As local and regional climate change planning continues, it becomes increasingly important for local governments to engage with businesses, both large and small, on these issues.\nThe success of businesses and communities is intertwined\nMany larger companies recognize the impacts of climate change on their operations, including risks to physical assets, disruptions to supply chains, and impacts on their workforce. In fact, some businesses, like Google, are examining how to develop company resilience strategies that address changing climate conditions. Businesses are also dependent on public infrastructure and local government services, and climate risks on these “outside the fence” components are much harder for businesses to evaluate. In fact, a number of companies have highlighted these uncertainties as a major barrier in addressing adaptation.\nLocal governments are dependent on the private sector in many ways. Businesses are essential to the economic health and growth of communities. Business interruptions can affect the quality of life for residents, disrupt the local economy, and reduce tax revenues. The costs of Hurricane Harvey are still being evaluated, but preliminary estimates suggest that lost economic output from this storm was in the range of $9 billion to $11 billion, including $540 million for goods-producing industries and $141 million for oil and gas industries. The October 2017 wildfires in California’s wine country are estimated to have caused economic losses between $6 and $8 billion dollars due to property damage and business interruptions alone, with $789 million in commercial property claims. These costs do not include the potential losses to the wine industry for many years to come.\nLocal governments have a strong interest in ensuring that businesses are resilient and remain operational as the climate continues to change. Companies will also benefit from engaging with the public sector on community resilience to enhance their business continuity plans and support their employees. In addition to better protecting their employees and operations, this type of collaboration will help businesses better understand community needs.\nBusinesses can assist local governments with expertise and solutions\nLarger businesses often already understand local risks because of internal risk management processes. Risk management and emergency management plans, along with drills and training exercises with employees, help businesses prepare for extreme events. Local governments can coordinate with businesses on risk management, including participating in drills and trainings, to build and maintain community resilience.\nLocal governments can also use larger companies’ expertise and data on risk. Businesses may be monitoring information that could be relevant to local resilience planning. For example, utilities often track potential risks to their assets, such as those related to storms (e.g., wind, precipitation, flooding), wildfire, and temperature impacts on energy demand. This information can be helpful to local decision-makers in both emergency management and long-term resilience planning.\nThe private sector also offers opportunities in services and solutions. Businesses are often interested in developing and improving technologies, engineering approaches, technical assistance, and opportunities to connect with their communities. For example, Airbnb offered disaster relief to people impacted by the California wildfires, connecting displaced residents to available housing. The company also worked with the City of San Francisco’s Department of Emergency Management to share their lessons learned from Superstorm Sandy. Airbnb is also partnering with various local governments to help communities prepare for and recover from disasters. Local governments’ suggestions for climate change solutions and services can help businesses tailor their products to best serve the community.\nIn addition, financing for implementing community resilience can often be a challenge for local governments. The private sector can offer financing solutions to help fund climate change resilience. For example, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is investing $1 million over five years through their Better Together Resilient Communities grant program to support local climate resilience initiatives in California.\nLocal governments can share data and information with businesses\nSome local governments have undertaken vulnerability assessments and climate change scenario planning for their regions. The data and results from these studies can be shared with businesses to help them understand what assumptions are being used by local governments, and whether their scenarios align, which will be increasingly important to ensure regional coordination as conditions change.\nWhile larger companies may undertake scenario planning and vulnerability assessments, most small businesses do not. However, small businesses can also benefit from data and information sharing. Small companies do not often have the expertise or resources to adequately assess climate change risks and undertake resilience planning. Local governments can share information with small businesses to help them better understand their potential risks and prepare for extreme events. In California, Valley Vision has developed the Capital Region Business Resiliency Initiative to help engage the small business community in resilience planning. This effort helps small businesses engage with local stakeholders to understand potential risks and provides resources to help these businesses plan for disaster resilience.\nLocal governments can engage with businesses through existing networks or by creating new processes to assist with engagement\nLocal governments can engage with both small and large businesses through networks and organizations for the private sector, like local chambers of commerce, trade associations, and other business networking groups. For example, the City of Annapolis has engaged the Anne Arundel County Chamber of Commerce and the Downtown Annapolis Partnership in its Weather It Together initiative, which is focused on adapting the historic community to minimize the risks associated with flooding. Through this effort, local businesses are part of the planning process to help the community become more resilient. The City of Cambridge, Massachusetts has also engaged businesses in long-term planning efforts like the Cambridge Compact and the city’s Climate Change Preparedness & Resilience Plan. Establishing public-private partnerships focused on climate resilience will also help to facilitate conversations and collaboration between these two sectors.\nLocal governments may already engage with businesses individually, but it can be helpful to set up an ongoing process for involving the private sector in resilience planning. For example, business representatives can participate in local planning and advisory committees, contributing their perspectives and identifying any key issues for the business community. Effectively engaging the business community will often require targeted outreach and potentially different strategies, as businesses may not be aware of ongoing stakeholder processes or may not realize their relevance to company needs. Some communities have incorporated businesses into resilience planning through regional climate collaboratives. Several regional climate collaboratives in California focus on engaging different stakeholder groups, including businesses, to further climate change planning. For example, the Sierra Climate Adaptation and Mitigation Partnership was founded by the Sierra Business Council and has various business members, including ski resorts and forestry companies.\nEffectively preparing for climate change’s impacts requires that cities coordinate with many different stakeholders. Businesses, public agencies, community groups, and citizens are all important to the discussion on community resilience, as they will all be impacted by climate change and have important ideas to contribute. Engaging the private sector is an important way for local governments to improve community resilience, and will benefit both the public and private sector through information sharing, aligning needs and goals, and developing multi-sector networks.']	['<urn:uuid:9649618d-4e10-4996-b2fc-303bdfae2920>', '<urn:uuid:abac6898-51b0-42fd-a5b1-b5052c4a2b07>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	8	75	2489
75	What role do quality checks play before starting production?	Quality checks before production are crucial as they prevent costly failures and compliance issues. This includes verifying the accuracy of manufacturing batch records (MBR), confirming operator training, and ensuring equipment qualification. The Pharmaceutical Quality System mandates these checks as part of its goal to ensure consistent delivery of medicinal products with appropriate quality attributes throughout the product lifecycle.	"['If the effective version generated during protocol generation is the same as what is being used on the production floor, then\nit is safe to initiate the process validation production runs. If not, there is a high probability that the protocol may be\ninaccurate (possibly resulting in numerous ""failures"") or that the process itself is not ready for process validation or even\nworse, commercial production.\nFor example, during a recent process validation activity at a liquid dosage pharmaceutical plant, modifications were made\nto the MBR less than a day before the already approved protocol was to be executed. Certain processes were modified without\nthe knowledge and consent of the validation team. As a result, there were numerous deviations (i.e., investigations) that\nneeded to be documented and addressed during the execution of the process validation production runs. This was due to the\napproved protocol not stating the correct directions to follow, which resulted in a big waste of time and money-let alone\nquestioning compliance (i.e., the ability of the quality system to catch issues prior to and during production). If the MBR\nstatus was verified as a prerequisite, this issue would have been caught prior to executing the runs.\nOperator and test personnel training verification. In manufacturing as well as in the analytical laboratory, many standard operating procedures (SOPs) and analytical test procedures\nare used. As the purpose of process validation is to provide assurance of the repeatability of a process, operators and analysts\nmust be trained on all procedures that may affect the manufacturing and testing of the process. This prerequisite checks the\ntraining records of the operators and laboratory testing analysts to ensure that they have documented training on the procedures\nthat they will be performing during the process validation activity. Again, not only is this a compliance risk, but it is\nalso good business practice as failures due purely to untrained operator or analyst errors result in additional consecutive\nprocess validation production runs (i.e., avoidable wastes of time and money).\nFor example, during a recent pre-approval inspection of a pharmaceutical manufacturer, an investigator was reviewing the executed\nprocess validation protocol for the product being assessed. The investigator asked to see the training records for two of\nthe analysts who performed the release testing on the finished lot of product. When given those records, the company realized\nthat the two analysts had not been trained on the test procedures. This situation called into question the validity of the\ntest results and ended in the company repeating the costly and time consuming testing. This situation would have been easily\navoided by verifying training prior to execution.\nEquipment and utility system qualification verification.\nJust as an individual marathon runner chooses a very specific pair of running shoes to compete in versus a pair of everyday\nflip flops, equipment and utility systems are two of the most critical areas affecting the outcome of a manufacturing process.\nIt is important to verify that the commercial equipment and support utility systems have first been qualified and second have\nbeen qualified within the specified process ranges prior to executing the process validation manufacturing runs.\nNot only is the lack of equipment or utility system qualification a common gap discovered during inspections, and for which\nentire process validation efforts been disregarded, but many unforeseen commercial production issues may arise when these\nactivities have not been completed prior to process validation production runs. This situation was clearly demonstrated when\na coating process for a solid oral dosage pharmaceutical was developed and optimized at a specific spray rate using a process\ndevelopment pan coater. The pan coater used during the process validation runs, although similar in function to the process\ndevelopment pan coater, was not challenged during equipment qualification at a spray rate that bracketed the intended use.\nWhen the process went into validation, the difference in the spray nozzles caused the commercial pan coater to be unable to\nconsistently obtain the specified MBR specifications for spray rate.\nIn this case, the entire batch was lost because the problem was discovered after the coating process was already in progress.\nA prerequisite verification of equipment qualification would have avoided the loss of a potentially saleable batch as well\nas the requirement to run a new set of consecutive process validation batches.', 'Pharmaceutical Quality System\nPharmaceutical Quality System – Questions and answers\nQ1: What is the main goal of a Pharmaceutical Quality System for medicinal product manufacturing?\nA1: The primary goal of a Pharmaceutical Quality System is to ensure the consistent delivery of medicinal products with appropriate quality attributes through the entire product lifecycle.\nQ2: How is product and process knowledge managed within the Pharmaceutical Quality System?\nA2: Product and process knowledge is managed throughout all lifecycle stages, ensuring that there is a clear understanding of the products and processes, leading to informed decisions and consistent quality.\nQ3: How does the Pharmaceutical Quality System relate to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)?\nA3: The Pharmaceutical Quality System ensures that medicinal products are designed and developed in compliance with the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice, which includes proper production and control operations.\nQ4: What role does managerial responsibility play within the Pharmaceutical Quality System?\nA4: Managerial responsibilities are clearly specified within the system to ensure that roles, responsibilities, and authorities are well-defined and communicated throughout the organization, providing effective oversight.\nQ5: How are arrangements made for starting and packaging materials within the Pharmaceutical Quality System?\nA5: The system ensures proper arrangements for the manufacture, supply, and use of correct starting and packaging materials.

76	As a sleep medicine specialist interested in cognitive symptoms comparison between deliriums sleep related symptoms versus lewy body dementia sleep disturbances characteristic features mechanisms treatment	Sleep disturbances manifest differently in delirium versus Lewy Body dementia. In delirium, chronic severe sleep loss can actually cause the condition, as sleep is essential for maintaining memory circuits that otherwise weaken due to molecular turnover. After just 48 hours of sleep deprivation, patients can experience illusions and hallucinations. Treatment focuses on securing deep restorative sleep. In Lewy Body dementia, the characteristic sleep disturbance is REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD), where patients talk and move while asleep and have difficulty distinguishing dreams from reality when awake. About 66% of RBD patients eventually develop degenerative brain disorders. Additionally, while delirium patients can improve with sleep restoration, Lewy Body dementia patients may show extreme sensitivity to antipsychotic medications used for sleep, potentially worsening their symptoms.

This situation is a consequence of the insensitivity of current clinical criteria for the diagnosis of delirium, which recognize only the most severe forms of functional brain impairment (including disorientation and clouding of consciousness). Serial electroencephalograms (EEGs) are the most sensitive method for detecting delirium and until such studies are performed, the true incidence of delirium in psychotic patients will not be known. The suggested causal mechanism of delirium in psychosis is sleep disruption. Sleep is essential for maintenance of memory circuits which otherwise suffer progressive synaptic weakening due to molecular turnover. When sleep is disrupted, memory circuits deteriorate, and subsequent activation of incompetent circuits can generate psychotic symptoms. Induction of physiologically-normal sleep would therefore be expected to produce significant clinical improvement in patients with psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, the ‘anti-delirium’ action of electroconvulsive therapy may account for its effectiveness in alleviating a wide range of psychiatric and neurological pathologies.\nDelirium is functional cognitive impairment - brain dysfunction without permanent changes in brain structure. Other terms for delirium include acute organic syndrome, and acute or toxic confusional state . The causes of delirium are many-fold and include any severe insult to the brain, such as pharmacological intoxication or withdrawal, fever, trauma, or any generalized physiological or biochemical derangement. It is recognized that psychotic phenomena, such as irrational thinking and speech, and abnormal psychological experiences, such as hallucinations and bizarre delusions, are a common feature of delirium . When a brain is globally dysfunctional, it cannot perform cognitive processing in the normal fashion. For instance, delusional beliefs are unsurprising when the cognitive processes by which beliefs are generated are themselves impaired.\nDelirium and Psychotic Symptoms - an integrative model\nWe suggest that delirium may be a much commoner cause of psychotic symptoms in psychiatry than is generally acknowledged; even in the ‘functional psychoses’ such as schizophrenia, mania and depression, where delirium was traditionally considered to be excluded by definition.\nClinical diagnosis of delirium\nAn electroencephalogram (EEG) constitutes the most sensitive method for detecting delirium  - however EEGs are very seldom performed in psychiatric practice. Furthermore, because of the wide range of normal variation, serial EEGs are necessary, with measurements taken during and after recovery from the acute delirious episode, each patient serving as his or her own control. Until such studies are performed, the true incidence of delirium in psychiatric patients will not be known.\nLacking objective measurements of delirium, the clinical diagnosis of delirium in psychiatric practice has typically been reserved for the most severe forms of functional brain impairment - when disorientation and clouding of consciousness are present . This definition of delirium is parsimonious, and prevents false positives in diagnosis; but this clinical practice carries the implication that significant but mild delirium is probably routinely under-diagnosed.\nIt is hard to exclude delirium in any individual patient because the condition demonstrates a continuum of severity, with milder symptoms being difficult to discriminate from normal behavior . For example, a mood of fearful perplexity is often typical of early stages of brain dysfunction; and distractible attention is an early cognitive change, such that a mildly delirious patient cannot concentrate for very long on any single line of reasoning and is readily diverted from any particular line of thought or attempted task . However, both perplexity and distractibility are non-specific symptoms, difficult to identify objectively, and typically recognized as being a part of the clinical syndrome of delirium only retrospectively, when the condition has progressed to include qualitatively abnormal behaviors such as hallucinations.\nThe routine under-diagnosis of delirium in psychiatric practice is potentially important since delirium can potentially lead to a wide range of severe psychiatric symptoms. Indeed, the \'Kraepelinian\' diagnostic categories of the ‘functional’ psychoses (schizophrenia, mania and major depressive disorder) are defined in terms of the exclusion of organic disease such as delirium . This distinction is crucial since the symptoms of delirium may be strikingly similar to those typical of the functional psychoses. For example, both delirium and acute mania may include perplexed, fearful and labile emotions, distractible attention, jumbled speech, disinhibited behavior, and hallucinations and delusions [1, 5]. Indeed, the presence or absence of disorientation and \'clouding\' of consciousness may be the only symptoms that distinguish between the diagnostic categories. Yet even that criterion is not considered to be decisive: for example some psychiatrists have long recognized that clouding and disorientation can occur in patients who are otherwise typically ‘manic’ .\nThe whole of modern neo-Kraepelinian diagnostic practice in schizophrenia, mania and \'psychotic depression\' therefore hangs upon the validity of the clinical exclusion of delirium . Yet there is a strong theoretical case that many patients who demonstrate \'classic\' psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations, bizarre delusions and thought disorder are suffering from delirium - even in the ‘functional psychoses’ where disorientation and clouding of consciousness are not evident. In other words, we predict that patients with hallucinations, bizarre delusions or thought disorder should exhibit delirium. Available evidence, much of it from the research literature of the mid-twentieth century, is ambiguous; but acutely psychotic patients may demonstrate EEG abnormalities [5, 6, 7].\nBut the question of the prevalence of EEG abnormalities in patients with psychotic symptoms needs to be studied afresh, since (as explained above) serial EEGs are necessary to exclude delirium. Furthermore, modern EEG technology has improved considerably compared with that available during the 1950s and 1960s when most of the relevant studies were carried out.\nDelirium and illusory dreams\nChronic severe sleep loss and other forms of sleep disruption are significant clinical features in many psychotic patients, although they are seldom considered as potential aetiological factors for psychotic symptoms. Yet chronic, severe sleep loss can certainly cause delirium , and the probable mechanisms of this link have recently been elucidated , .\nIt was the 18th Century Scottish physician, William Cullen, who first drew the analogy between delirium and illusory dreams (ie. dreams containing incongruent, bizarre, or impossible contents). It is now believed that many memory circuits of the brain are reinforced during sleep, a process in which synaptic strengths are maintained at dedicated levels [11, 12, 13]. Synaptic strength maintenance occurs largely through the action of self-generated, spontaneously occurring, slow brain waves (waves at frequencies less than about 14 cycles per second). This occurs both during rapid-eye-movement (REM) and nonREM sleep, though there are significant differences in function between the two phases [14, 15]. Maintenance is necessary since all synaptic strengths weaken with time due to ""turnover"" of essential molecules. Without remedial action during sleep, all memory circuits that were not being regularly ‘exercised’ by frequent use while awake, would gradually deteriorate and their encoded memories be lost.\nIncidentally, some of the memories being reinforced during sleep rise to the level of ""unconscious"" awareness, and these are the memories that provide the substance of our dreams [14, 16, 17]. If our stored memories were valid in every respect, then our dreams would consist solely of ""replays"" of past or plausible events in our lives. And indeed, roughly 85-95% of dream contents derive from authentic contents [17, 18]. On the other hand, when memory circuits are faulty, the events and perceptions in the resulting dreams may be distorted or largely illusory.\nThe sources of illusory dream contents are at least three-fold: first, there are disordered synaptic strengths that owe to normal imperfections in the processes that store and maintain memories; second, there are the abnormal influences of pathologically altered brain waves; and third, there are the influences of sleep loss leading to incomplete refreshment of synaptic strengths.\nThe earliest manifestations of sleep deprivation, even after a single night, include significant impairment of cognitive performance and changes in mood. After only 48 hours most subjects report illusions and/or visual and tactile hallucinations, and these become more intense as deprivation progresses . The pathology underlying organic delirium additionally involves abnormalities in slow waves observable by EEG and characterized by deviations from normal frequency, form, magnitude or distribution [3, 20, 21]. Such pathological waves are presumably incapable of reinforcing memory circuits in the usual fashion. With a cumulative weakening of synaptic strengths in affected circuits, subsequent recall of such distorted memories produces hallucinations, delusions, and other hallmarks of delirium .\nThese alterations of mental state apparently reflect the use of incompetent circuitry that accumulates during the extended periods of sleep loss and/ or the effects of pathological brain waves. Just as illusory dreams in normal individuals often are the result of activation of incompetent circuits, the symptoms of organic delirium probably owe their origin primarily to the activation of incompetent circuitry of functionally pathological origin.\nTreatment of delirium\nThe first-line management of delirium is, of course, directed at the identification and treatment of the underlying cause . However, symptomatic treatment may also be vital, and in patients with a history of severe sleep loss and either EEG or clinical evidence of delirium, management directed primarily at securing deep and restorative sleep would be expected to produce significant clinical improvement .\nAssuming that delirium is indeed responsible for psychotic symptoms in many patients with acute pscyhosis, it is interesting to speculate what proportion of the clinical benefit of neuroleptic and other tranquilizing drugs (such as lorazepam) currently used in the management of acute psychosis might be attributable simply to their sleep-promoting effects. Choice of pharmacological agents may turn out to be important, since different sedative drugs have different effects on EEG. For example, it has been suggested that the ‘atypical’ neuroleptics may provide a particularly close simulation of ‘natural’ sleep .\nAdopting this view of the genesis of organic delirium, it seems likely that the useful, but often only temporary, clinical benefit of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for organic delirium [24, 25], may be due to the inducing electrical shock temporarily suppressing abnormal slow-wave regimes, allowing spontaneous resumption of synaptic maintenance by remedial slow waves . A relevant analogy might be the way in which a cardiac defibrillating shock halts fibrillation and allows the intrinsically-generated normal sinus rhythm to resume spontaneously. Following ECT the remedial regimes of slow waves operating during natural sleep then act to restore dedicated functional strengths in synapses of previously incompetent circuitry. On ECT maintenance therapy, the abnormal slow waves remain suppressed, and normal reinforcement regimes, with their alleviating influences, prevail. But when maintenance therapy ceases, the abnormal slow waves may regain dominance, because of prevalence of the underlying functional pathology, and delirium returns.\nThis ‘anti-delirium’ mechanism proposed for ECT [9, 26] may account for the effectiveness of ECT in alleviating a wide range of psychiatric and neurological pathologies; probably including not only severe depressive disorder but also acute schizophrenia, mania, Parkinson’s disease, delirium tremens, CNS syphilis, typhoid catatonia, and phencyclidine psychosis . All these conditions plausibly have a delirious element which may be contributing significantly to their symptomatology.\nThe time appears to be ripe to reconsider the nature, status, classification and prevalence of delirium in psychiatric patients. We suggest that delirium is routinely under-detected in practice due to the insensitivity of clinical diagnostic criteria. Hence we predict that serial EEGs would confirm that delirium is responsible for severe psychotic symptoms in many patients, particularly those with severe sleep loss or disruption. To confirm or refute these hypotheses would require that delirium should again become the focus of systematic research effort in psychiatry.\n1. Lipowski, Z.J.

The reality is that different forms of dementia have different signs.\nHere are some of the indicators that signal each type of dementia:\n- Memory loss: Early-stage Alzheimer\'s is almost always hallmarked by some form of memory loss. A person may experience difficulty trying to remember a particular word, or the name of someone they just met. They may also be more prone to losing important objects. Often, a person\'s short-term memory is the first thing affected by Alzheimer\'s. Memory loss gradually gets worse until long-term recollections are impacted as well. A person in the later stages of Alzheimer\'s won\'t be able to remember their own name, how to dress themselves, or even how to smile.\n- Trouble performing familiar tasks: A super-organized individual may become scattered as a result of Alzheimer\'s. Not remembering the route to the grocery store, or forgetting something they just read are two additional early-to-mid-stage Alzheimer\'s indicators.\n- Bad judgment: Unsound financial decisions, inappropriate public outbursts and an inability to understand and abide by social norms of cleanliness and grooming are all signs of increasingly poor judgment that may signify Alzheimer\'s.\n- Social withdrawal: People suffering from memory loss may be reluctant to engage in social activities. They are easily overwhelmed by large groups of people, even close friends and family.\n- Sundowning: When the sun goes down, an Alzheimer\'s sufferer may become fearful, agitated and sad. They may pace, hallucinate, shadow their caregiver and wander. This collection of emotions and subsequent behaviors is referred to as ""Sundowner\'s syndrome"" or ""sundowning."" Sundowning can be a sign of virtually any type of dementia, but is most often seen in individuals with Alzheimer\'s disease.\nDiscover more information about the signs, symptoms and treatment of Alzheimer\'s disease.\n- Hallucinations and delusions: Seeing, hearing, and even tasting things that aren\'t real is widely considered one of the first signs of Lewy Body dementia. Also occurring early on in the disease are persistent fictitious beliefs about a particular person or circumstance. For caregivers this particular dementia behavior can seem like manipulation.\n- Sleep troubles: Another early symptom of Lewy Body dementia is known as REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD). A person with RBD will talk and move while still asleep. Once awake, they may struggle to distinguish between their dreams and reality. A person with RBD won\'t always develop Lewy Body dementia, but research suggests that about 66 percent of people with RBD will eventually develop a degenerative brain disorder, according to the Lewy Body Dementia Association.\n- Varying degrees of alertness: A person with Lewy Body dementia may experience periods of lucidity, interspersed with episodes of profound disorientation that may last anywhere from minutes to days. These cycles of confusion and clarity are not tied to any particular time of day, unlike the sundowning behaviors seen in people with Alzheimer\'s disease.\n- Movement issues: A person with Lewy Body dementia may resemble a person suffering from Parkinson\'s because of the effect the disease has on their ability to control their body and perceive their environment. Stiff movements, a hunched over posture and shuffling can all be physical manifestations of cognitive degeneration. These mobility issues also up a person\'s risk for falling.\n- Medication sensitivity: About half of Lewy Body dementia sufferers develop an extreme sensitivity to antipsychotic medications that can result in worsening of existing dementia symptoms, and Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, which can lead to death.\n- Memory and cognitive issues: Memory loss is typically one of the last symptoms to show up in people with Lewy Body dementia.\nDiscover more information about the signs, symptoms and treatment of Lewy Body dementia.\n- The symptoms of vascular dementia are different depending on which part of the person\'s brain was impacted by reduced blood flow. Memory loss, confusion, depression, problems with planning and organization, mobility issues and urinary incontinence are all possible signs that a person is suffering from vascular dementia.\nDiscover more information about the signs, symptoms and treatment of Vascular dementia.\nFrontotemporal Dementia (Pick\'s disease)\n- There are several types of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), each with their own set of initial symptoms that gradually begin to intersect as the disease gets worse.\n- Loss of inhibition: Saying and doing inappropriate things is a common sign that a person has developed some form of FTD.\n- Problems with language: A person who consistently has trouble remembering words, or using the right words to describe what they\'re talking about may suffer from FTD.\n- Movement issues: Similar to Lewy Body dementia, FTD can also cause rigid movements and a lack of coordination.\nDiscover more information about the signs, symptoms and treatment of Frontal Lobe dementia.']"	['<urn:uuid:a021e4fb-66bc-452a-8b30-d7ee503828c4>', '<urn:uuid:524fcbc9-1fbf-4cee-87fb-4d81d252d244>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	25	123	3277
77	emergency preparation beach vs canoe camping	For canoe camping, essential emergency preparations include carrying emergency food rations, clean drinking water, and a First Aid Kit, with specific focus on preventing hypothermia. For beach safety, the main preparation involves watching for red warning flags from lifeguards and identifying rip currents by looking for dark patches with reduced wave breaking in the surf zone.	"[""Your Canoe Equipment Checklist is one part of your camping trip. It also can be used by those planning a Kayak Camping trip, with just a few edits. The checklist at the bottom of this page can be used as a starting point. Make changes to fit your needs, time of year and area you will be camping in.\nWhen review the list, think about how much room you will have, and how long you will be gone. Think small, compact and is it necessary. There is not one person who has gone camping that has over or under packed. As you review the list, start with the basics and go from there.\nMake sure you adjust your Canoe Equipment Checklist to consider seasonal temperatures and type of waterways traveled. If the campsite is one on a lake that you will be returning to every evening, then add some items from our tent camping checklist.\nOn the other hand, if your trip is headed down river, then a single tent or no tent (just a tarp) may be needed. A camping hammock would be ideal for this type of camping. The backpacking checklist can help here with some items that may not appear on this list.\nAbove all, make sure you have emergency rations of food, clean drinking water, and First Aid Kit. One mishap with a poorly packed canoe and you'll find yourself without the basic necessities to stay alive.\nOne of the hidden dangers of canoeing or kayaking is not the possibility of drowning. The danger comes from the body beginning to shut down due to hypothermia.\nMany mountain rivers can be as cold as 40° in the summertime. Staying wet for most of the day without pulling off, and getting a chance to dry off, and warm up can bring on hypothermia and it can happen very gradually.\nIf a person has begun to show signs of lack of sensory perception and lack of awareness of surroundings, then there is a good chance that the body temperature has begun to drop and the body is shutting down.\nRead up on what emergency actions need to be started to bring someone out of this dangerous state. There are many websites and medical journals that can offer simple to follow steps on both preventing hypothermia and what to do to for someone with hypothermia.\nCamping Equipment Checklist\nCooking Equipment (cont'd)\n|Aluminum Foil (Heavy Duty)||Mitts, Oven||Bungi cords/straps|\n|Bottle opener/corkscrew||Mugs/cups||Duct tape/electrical tape|\n|Water bottles||Paper Plates, Bowls, Cups||Dust pan / Whisk broom|\n|Mixing bowls||Paper Towels / Napkins||Glue/super glue|\n|Can Opener||Pot Grabber||Hatchet|\n|canister, Food-storage||Pot Holders||Knife or Multi-Tool|\n|Charcoal and Lighter Fluid||roasting sticks||Knife sharpener|\n|chimney, charcoal||Plastic Silverware||Machete|\n|Coffee Pot||Camp Stove||Mallet or Hammer|\n|container(s), Collapsible water||thermos||Pliers, wrench|\n|Cook Set (pots & pans)||Trash bags; resalable bags||Saw|\n|cooler||Utensils (spoons, spatula, etc)||Small shovel / Trowel|\n|cups, plastic||Ziploc bags||\n|Dish Soap & Dish Rags||\n|Dish towels||Door mat||Flashlight|\n|Egg holder(s)||Multi-tool or knife||Lantern with fuel/mantles|\n|Extension sticks/roasting items||Seam sealant||Maglight|\n|Fuel (propane, white gas, etc.)||Stakes|\n|Funnel||Sun shade, tarp or screen house|\n|Grill||Tent (with stakes and guy lines)||\n|Grill rack||Tent repair kit||\n|Hot-cold vacuum bottle||Tent-pole repair sleeve||Blankets|\n|Water Jug||Utility bags for storage||Fleece sleeping bag liner|\n|Lighter fluid||Sleeping Bag|\n|Measuring cups & spoons||Pillows|"", 'Rip currents are worldwide recognized as a major hazard on beaches exposed to energetic waves. The American Life Saving Association and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution reported that between 70% and 80% of all rescues in US and England are due to rip currents. The victims are not only children or people with low aquatic confidence, but also adults with good swim skills have been reported as victims. Beach lifeguards usually warn beach-goers through a flag system in which red flag means that swimming is forbidden. This warning system is based on practical experience of lifeguards who can recognize severe storms and dangerous conditions potentially leading to the development of strong rip currents. So, rip currents are something to be concerned about but what are they and how do they develop? This post tries to answer to these questions.\nOne of the first theoretical notions that one learns about sea waves is that they are able carry energy but not water. Water flows forward under the crest and backward under the trough, so that the net balance is close to zero. However, this in not valid in the surf zone. In fact, broken waves propagate within the surf zone developing a turbulent and air-entrained front, called the roller, in which water is tumbling down from the crest toward the trough. Whereas, particles in the water column still oscillate forward and backward under crests and troughs, particles in the roller are pushed shoreward traveling at the same speed of waves. This water pushed shoreward must somehow go back to the sea.\nIt must be said that natural beaches are not longshore uniform but they present variations in the submerged beach bottom. This irregularity leads to an alongshore variations of the wave force: wave energy is focused on shallow bars where eventually wave breaking takes place. These areas with intense breaking are normally know as “peaks”. Water is pushed shoreward by broken waves increasing the mean water level in the inner surf zone and giving rise to longshore currents flowing in shallow waters away from these areas of intense wave breaking. These longshore currents are called rip feeders. Rip currents are seaward oriented currents that usually develop from one or more feeders through highly localized cross-shore channels that cut the submerged beach. Basically, a rip current can generate when two opposing feeders meet in the inner surf zone, or when a headland or a structure blocks a feeder that is forced to turn into a seaward flowing rip current. Rip currents are not always directly cross-shore oriented but they can also show an angle with respect to the shoreline especially during oblique wave incidence.\nSummarizing, on natural beaches cyclic circulation systems develop under wave forcing. These systems are usually characterized by: 1) a shoreward water flux in the breaking zone, 2) a longshore current (the feeder) flowing within the inner surf zone, 3) a seaward water current (rip current) taking place on relatively narrow and deep cross-shore channels and 4) an expansion of the current in the head of the rip towards the breaking zone, closing the circuit. This is a ideal case that usually occurs on natural beaches, however in some cases the circuit is not closed, meaning the the water in the rip is pushed away from the surf zone leaving the rip system. Since the current system location and spacing reflects the beach morphology characterized by bars and channels, these rip currents are know as morphologically controlled. Moreover, rip currents flowing seaward through channels trigger a feedback mechanism in which erosion of bed channels is enhanced by currents.\nCrucial question: how can one spot a rip currents? The main indicator of a rip is the absence (or a reduction) of wave breaking in a limited area inside the surf zone surrounded by areas with intense wave breaking. Because rip currents flow through narrow and relatively deep channels in the opposite direction of waves, these areas are characterized by dark patches with a rippled surface. The configuration of rip systems can be misleading for beach-goers that can think that areas with limited wave breaking are safer, actually it happens the opposite. On the other hand, someone able to correctly spot rip systems can take advantage of them. For instance, this is the case of experienced surfers that use the rip current help to save energy and reach the peak faster.\nLet’s close with a curiosity. In the past years, people were used to refer to rip currents as to rip tides. For instance, in the movie “Big Wednesday”, during the last scene with the big swell hitting the beach the loudspeaker warned about the presence of strong rip tides: “Get out of the water! You are in a riptide!”. However, strictly speaking nearshore currents during massive swells are not generated by tides. Although the intensity of rip currents can change depending on the tide (stronger rip currents are usually observed at low tide), we have seen that the only rip current forcing is due to the presence of wind-generated waves breaking on a shore.']"	['<urn:uuid:672a4220-d453-4b20-a21e-b191f239d758>', '<urn:uuid:7ceaea16-53df-4a76-8f2f-eb517924215d>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	6	56	1373
78	sickle cell crisis blood vessels clumping mechanism pain location spine arms legs	A sickle cell crisis occurs when sickle-shaped red blood cells clump together and block small blood vessels that carry blood to organs, muscles, and bones. This causes mild to severe pain that can last from hours to days. The most common pain locations are the bones of the spine and the bones in the arms and legs.	"['What is a sickle cell crisis?\nA sickle cell crisis is a painful episode that may begin suddenly in a person who has sickle cell disease.\nA sickle cell crisis occurs when sickle-shaped red blood cells clump together and block small blood vessels that carry blood to certain organs, muscles, and bones. This causes mild to severe pain. The pain can last from hours to days. ""Painful event"" and ""painful crisis"" are other terms used to describe these episodes. Some people who have sickle cell disease have many painful events, while others have few or none.\nThe pain can happen in any part of the body. But the most common areas include the:\n- Bones of the spine.\n- Bones in the arms and legs.\nHow is it treated?\nTreatment depends on the level of pain and how long it lasts. Sometimes, nonprescription, or over-the-counter, pain relievers such as ibuprofen can help. Other times, a person needs stronger pain relief medicine that is prescribed or given by a doctor. Some painful episodes may need IV therapy for fluids and powerful pain medicines, such as morphine, to ease the pain.\nYou can prepare for a crisis in advance by creating a pain management plan with your doctor. This plan should include not only the types of medicines you can take at home but also other actions you can take at home to relieve pain. Also, your plan helps you know when to call your doctor or go to a hospital.\nFor more information, see Sickle Cell Disease: Pain Management.\nHow can you prevent a crisis?\nIt isn\'t always possible to know what sets off a crisis, but triggers include dehydration, cold temperatures, infection, stress, and low oxygen intake.\nYou can help prevent a crisis by:\n- Drinking plenty of fluids, especially before, during, and after exercise or strenuous activity and when you have a fever or infection. Drink enough so that your urine is light yellow or clear like water.\n- Dressing warmly in cold weather. Try to avoid situations where you might become cold. Exposure to cold air, wind, and water may cause a crisis by triggering red blood cell sickling in exposed areas of the body.\n- Exercise with care. If you exercise strenuously, rest when you feel tired, and drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Dehydration and reduced oxygen levels in a person\'s blood resulting from strenuous exercise may cause red blood cells to sickle.\n- Get plenty of sleep.\n- Try to reduce and manage stress in your life.\nFor more information, see Sickle Cell Disease: Staying Healthy.\nOther Works Consulted\n- Meremikwu MM, Okomo U (2011).

79	manufacturing flame resistant workwear which inherent fibers commonly blended with modacrylic for strong damage resistant fabric	Modacrylic fibers are often combined with varying percentages of para-aramid, lyocell, or polyamide-imide fibers. These fiber blends make strong fabrics capable of resisting considerable amounts of damage.	['If you’ve heard about the term flame-resistant fabric clothing, you’ll probably be thinking that they’re fabrics that won’t let fire pass through them, but this isn’t the case, and flame-resistant garments are a little more complicated than that.\nIt is important to understand what flame-resistant fabrics are, what flame-resistant fibers are, and what their types are. Knowledge regarding these fabrics and fibers is vital for fire safety.\nFlame Resistant Fabrics\nFabric is a combination of fibers combined with other pieces of fabric to make a garment or a piece of clothing. You can say that fabric is manufactured from fiber to garment. Flame-resistant fabrics are treated fabrics with a flame retardant chemical added to them to give them fire-resistant qualities. Fibers used in these fabrics aren’t naturally protective against flames. They turn into flame-resistant fabrics due to the addition of flame-retardant chemicals.\nThese fabrics often have 100% cotton fibers or are sometimes a combination of nylon and cotton. Regarding durability, fabrics made of cotton fibers provide less resistance to abrasion. Fabrics that have the combination of nylon with cotton have better resistance to abrasion. Flame-resistant treated fabrics work well in gas, oil, utility, chemicals, and petrochemical applications.\nTreated fabrics should be cared for greatly, so their usage is longer and more effective against flames. To wash these fabrics, place them in water with a hardness of 1.5 grains (25ppm) or fewer. Water with less hardness is even better because hard water has mineral salts that may leave deposits on the fabric. These deposits have a chance of decreasing the fire-resistant capabilities of the fabric. Deposits can also be used as fuel if the flame-resistant clothing is exposed to fire.\nWhat Is Treated Fiber?\nTreated fibers have a fire retardant chemical applied to their fiber-forming process. This makes these fibers resistant to flames. Fabrics made with these types of fibers are fire resistant, and their resistant abilities don’t lessen when you wash them or wear them roughly. Flame-resistant fabrics made with these fibers would lose their protective qualities only when damaged or soiled too much to the point that the soil can’t come off.\nAn example of such a type of fiber is a combination of cotton and modacrylic fibers. Fabrics composed of these fibers are comfortable and soft and feel like cotton. The modacrylic fiber added to it has soft and durable qualities. It also has resistance against solvents and chemicals. This makes these types of fibers very efficient in flame-resistant environments such as jobs where you need effective flame-resistant clothing.\nWhat Are Inherent Fibers And Fabrics?\nFor inherent fibers and fabrics, there is no need to add chemicals to them. These fabrics are naturally resistant to fire as they’re woven from naturally fire-resistant fibers. These fabrics will remain resistant to flames for a lifetime, and there is no need for further altering them through the use of chemicals.\nModacrylic fibers are the most famous and commonly used flame-resistant fibers. These types of fibers are often combined with other inherent flame-resistant fibers. These modacrylic fibers usually get mixed with varying percentages of para-aramid, lyocell, or polyamide-imide fibers. These fiber blends make strong fabrics capable of resisting considerable amounts of damage.\nWhat Fabric is Naturally Fire Resistant?\nBesides modacrylic fibers, other naturally fire-resistant fabrics are silk, nylon, polyester, and cotton. These fabrics are naturally flame resistant because of the structure of their fibers and how they are woven. Because of their natural resistance, these fabrics do not have to be treated with flame-retardant chemicals. These are inherent fabrics. It is hard to burn all these fabrics, and they catch fire very slowly compared to other types of fabrics.\nAnother famous naturally fire-resistant fabric is Nomex. Nomex comes as a standalone fiber when it comes to clothing applications. It also comes as a blend with kevlar.\nWhat Fabric Can Withstand High Temperatures?\nFabrics that are used for industrial purposes such as silica, wool, and kevlar can withstand very high temperatures. Besides wool, fabrics such as silica and kevlar aren’t normally used in homes for fire-resistant purposes. The use of these fabrics is mainly limited to industrial work. Silicone, neoprene, refractory, and ceramic are some fabrics often used in homes.\nFlame-resistant fabrics help a lot against fire-related hazards and offer great protection. These fabrics are especially necessary if you’re an individual that regularly works near fire and heat. Safety is of utmost importance, where fire hazards are common, and FR fabrics ensure you’re always safe.']	['<urn:uuid:910e0ab0-7d7b-40b0-aaff-a1ced5f5e458>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	16	27	742
80	As a machine learning engineer working on facial recognition systems, I'm curious how FairVis's approach to detecting algorithmic bias compares to IBM's stance on addressing facial recognition biases?	FairVis and IBM represent different approaches to addressing algorithmic bias. FairVis takes an active detection approach by providing visualization tools that help identify bias through two techniques: grouping similar items in training data to find affected populations, and using statistical divergence to compare subgroups for bias patterns. This system specifically targets intersectional bias across multiple features. In contrast, IBM has taken a complete withdrawal approach, halting all facial recognition development and calling for a national dialogue on its use in law enforcement, after studies showed significant bias with false positive rates up to 100 times higher among African and Asian faces compared to Eastern European faces, as well as higher error rates for women, elderly, and children.	['FairVis is Helping Data Scientists Discover Societal Biases in their Machine Learning Models\nResearchers at Georgia Tech, Carnegie Mellon University, and University of Washington have developed a data visualization system that can help data scientists discover bias in machine learning algorithms.\nFairVis, presented at IEEE Vis 2019 in Vancouver, is the first system to integrate a novel technique that allows users to audit the fairness of machine learning models by identifying and comparing different populations in their data sets.\nAccording to School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Professor and co-investigator Polo Chau, this feat has never been accomplished by any platform before, and is a major contribution of FairVis to the data science and machine learning communities.\n“Computers are never going to be perfect. So, the question is how to help people prioritize where to look in their data, and then, in a scalable way, enable them to compare these areas to other similar or dissimilar groups in the data. By enabling comparison of groups in a data set, FairVis allows data to become very scannable,” he said.\nIn order to do accomplish this, FairVis uses two novel techniques to find subgroups that are statistically similar.\nThe first technique groups similar items together in the training data set, calculates various performance metrics like accuracy, and then shows users which groups of people the algorithm may be biased against. The second technique uses statistical divergence to measure the distance between subgroups to allow users to compare similar groups and find larger patterns of bias.\nThese outputs are then viewed and analyzed through FairVis’ visual analytics system, which is designed to specifically discover and show intersectional bias.\nIntersectional bias, or bias that is found when looking at populations defined by multiple features, is a mounting challenge for scientists to tackle in an increasingly diverse world.\n“While a machine learning algorithm may work very well in general, there may be certain groups for which it fails. For example, various face detection algorithms were found to be 30 percent less accurate for darker skinned women than for lighter skinned men. When you look at more specific groups of sex, race, nationality, and more, there can be hundreds or thousands of groups to audit,” said Carnegie Mellon University Ph.D. student Alex Cabrera.\nCabrera is the primary investigator of FairVis and has been pursuing this problem since he was an undergraduate student at Georgia Tech.\n“During the summer of my junior year I had been researching various topics in machine learning, and discovered some recent work showing how machine learning models can encode and worsen societal biases. I quickly realized that not only was this a significant issue, with examples of biased algorithms in everything from hiring systems to self-driving cars, but that my own work during my internship had the possibility to be biased against lower socioeconomic groups.”\nThis is when Cabrera reached out to Chau who then recruited the help of CSE alumni Minsuk Kahng, CSE Ph.D. Fred Hohman, College of Computing undergraduate student Will Epperson, and University of Washington Assistant Professor Jamie Morgenstern.\nMorgenstern is the lead researcher for a number of projects related to fairness in machine learning, including the study Cabrera mentioned about self-driving cars. This particular study shows the potentially fatal consequences of algorithmic bias which highlights the severity of software created without fairness embedded into its core.\nFairVis is one of the first systems that helps us achieve a dramatic step towards understanding and addressing the problem of fairness in machine learning, and prevents similar headlines from making their way to reality in the future.\nHowever, Cabrera stressed that the solution does not simply end with better data practices.\n“Fairness is an extremely difficult problem, a so-called ‘wicked problem’, that will not be solved by technology alone,” he said.\n“Social scientists, policy makers, and engineers need to work together to make inroads and ensure that our algorithms are equitable for all people. We hope FairVis is a step in this direction and helps people start the conversation about how to tackle and address these issues.”\nAs we step into 2024 and reflect on the previous year, 2023 was a huge year for news stories here at @GTcomputing .

But vendors and users of Al systems have a shared responsibility to ensure that Al is tested for bias, particularity when used in law enforcement, and that such bias testing is audited and reported.”\nBias in Modern Face Recognition Algorithms\nIn December of 2019, The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published a study which found large variations in accuracy across numerous contemporary face recognition algorithms.\nA false positive is when the system says that a face matches an entry in the database, when in fact they are not of the same person. The biggest glaring issue was that false positive rates were much higher among those of African and Asian descent. Oppositely, they were lowest among Eastern Europeans. The study found that “This effect is generally large, with a factor of 100 more false positives between countries.”\nAdditionally, they found that false positives were higher in faces of women, the elderly, and young children.\nA false negative is when the system says that a face does not match any entries in the database, when in fact it is in the database. This is especially dangerous at airports or border crossings. If the system checks individual faces against a criminal database, it could potentially allow dangerous individuals past a security check.\nHow Will IBM’s Boycott on Face Recognition Tech Affect the Industry?\nIBM has been at the forefront of machine learning development for a long time. Their natural language processing system, IBM Watson, is regarded as one of the best question-and-answer systems in the world.\nPositive Impact of IBM’s Stance on Facial Recognition\nWhen such a large company takes a strong position on facial recognition, it is bound to make waves. In fact, IBM’s decision already seems to be causing a domino effect in the industry.\nOn the other hand, other companies may take advantage of IBM halting facial recognition development. There is now more room in the market for other companies and startups to move in. The worst case scenario is that nothing changes. Companies might continue developing face recognition algorithms to sell to law enforcement agencies, without worrying about the consequences.\nIdeally, other developers will start investing more time and money to ensure that their algorithms are free of bias. Hopefully, more companies will take a step back to study the effects of emerging technologies before releasing them.\nIBM’s CEO believes that the biases that exist in modern facial recognition algorithms warrant a complete halt of their usage. They are calling on governments and vendors to ensure that their algorithms are free of bias before being implemented in vital areas of society, such as law enforcement.\nMany AI technologies are emerging faster than governments are able to regulate. Hopefully, IBM’s stance paves the way for other large tech companies and startups to think about ethics before advancement.\nSubscribe to get your daily round-up of top tech stories!']	['<urn:uuid:7235cc21-e39c-4714-a108-2403427c4e58>', '<urn:uuid:d49403e6-a751-4b7a-a352-25801dd9c380>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	28	117	1393
81	cnn architecture max pooling function purpose explain advantages disadvantages pooling layers dimensionality reduction connection fully connected layers	Max pooling in CNNs serves multiple important purposes. The primary function is to reduce dimensionality by down-sampling feature maps, which helps prevent overfitting and reduces computational costs. It works by selecting the maximum value from regions covered by a filter, typically using a 2x2 window with a stride of 2. This pooling process makes the network less sensitive to feature locations in images, providing basic translation invariance. After pooling layers, the network uses fully connected layers that combine features into more complex attributes. These fully connected layers are essentially an artificial neural network added to the CNN, where features are flattened into a column and processed through hidden layers to optimize the network's performance through backpropagation.	"['Welcome to this tutorial on max pooling in Python. In this tutorial we will learn everything there is to learn about max-pooling.\nAfter this tutorial we will be able to answer the following questions :\n- What is pooling?\n- Why do we need pooling?\n- What is max pooling in Python?\n- How to perform max-pooling?\nLet’s get started.\nWhat is pooling?\nPooling is a technique that reduces the number of features in a feature map. The operation involves applying a 2-Dimensional filter across a feature map. Doing this summarizes the features present in a region of the map.\nWhat is a feature map?\nA feature map is what we get as the output after applying the convolution layer on the input image. Convolution layers are the building blocks of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). CNNs are popular for their application in object detection.\nConvolution layer applies a filter over the entire image repeatedly to detect features. The output of this convolution layer is a 2-Dimensional map that is known as a feature map.\nBut why do we need pooling? Let’s try and answer this question next.\nWhy do we need pooling?\nOne of the problems with feature maps generated from the convolution layer is that they are too sensitive to the location of the features in the image.\nOne solution for this is down-sampling of the feature map and that is exactly what pooling does.\nBy reducing the number of features we are able to avoid the problem of over-fitting to some extent. It also reduces the computational cost involved in the training of the model.\nWhat is max pooling in Python?\nThere are different types of pooling techniques. Max pooling is one of them.\nWhile applying max-pooling, the filter selects the maximum out of the pixels covered under the filter. The filter acts as a window out of which only the maximum value is selected for the output.\nThe operation of max pooling can be understood with the following example:\nIf we take the image array to be:\n[[2, 3, 4, 2], [8, 5, 5, 1], [6, 7, 9, 4], [3, 1, 4, 5]]\nApply a max-pooling filter with size 2X2 and a stride of 2 on this array.\nWe fill get the following output :\n[[8 5] [7 9]]\nNote how every value in the output is the maximum value from a 2X2 window in the original array.\nHow is max pooling done in python?\nNow that we have understood what is max pooling, let’s learn how to write a python code for it.\nWe will use the Keras to implement max pooling.\nThe Python code for applying max pooling on a numpy array is as follows:\nimport numpy as np from keras.models import Sequential from keras.layers import MaxPooling2D arr = np.array([[2, 3, 4, 2], [8, 5, 5, 1], [6, 7, 9, 4], [3, 1, 4, 5]]) #reshaping arr = image.reshape(1, 4, 4, 1) #define a max pooling layer max_pool = MaxPooling2D(pool_size = 2, strides = 2) #define a sequential model with just one pooling layer model = Sequential( [max_pool]) #get the output output = model.predict(arr) #print the output output = np.squeeze(output) print(output)\nWe get the output as :\n[[8 5] [7 9]]\nIn this example, we used a small array to explain the concept, but in reality feature maps of images can be much bigger in size.\nThis tutorial was about max-pooling in Python. We learned about pooling and the need for pooling. In the final section of the tutorial, we used Keras to implement max-pooling.\nAnother type of pooling technique that is quite popular is average-pooling. In average pooling, the average value is calculated for each window. Hope you had fun learning with us.', ""Convolution Neural Network: A Convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.\nCNN's use a variation of multilayer perceptrons designed to require minimal preprocessing. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics.\nConvolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. Individual cortical neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the receptive field. The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they cover the entire visual field.\nCNN's use relatively little pre-processing compared to other image classification algorithms. This means that the network learns the filters that in traditional algorithms were hand-engineered. This independence from prior knowledge and human effort in feature design is a major advantage.\nHere, we have an image, convolution neural network and having output label image.\nConvolution Operation: In this tutorial, we are going to talk about the convolution. Here, we describe the convolution function:\nConvolution is a combined integration of the two functions and it shows you how one function modifies the other or modifies the shape of other.\nConvolution is a mathematical operation to merge two sets of information. In our case, the convolution is applied to the input data using a convolution filter to produce a feature map. There are a lot of terms being used so let's visualize them one by one.\nOn the left side is the input to the convolution layer, for example, the input image. On the right is the convolution filter, also called the kernel, we will use these terms interchangeably. This is called a 3x3 convolution due to the shape of the filter.\nWe perform the convolution operation by sliding this filter over the input. At every location, we do element-wise matrix multiplication and sum the result. This sum goes into the feature map. Now, we have some input message and we create a feature map. We create multiple feature map because we use different filters.\nReLU Layer: In this tutorial, we are going to talk about the ReLU layer. Here, we are applying the rectifier because we want to increase non-linearity in our image. They propose different types of rectified function.\nPooling: In this tutorial, we are going to talk about the max pooling.\nMax pooling is a sample-based discretization process. The objective is to down-sample an input representation (image, hidden-layer output matrix, etc.), reducing its dimensionality and allowing for assumptions to be made about features contained in the sub-regions binned.\nThis is done so in part to help over-fitting by providing an abstracted form of the representation. As well, it reduces the computational cost by reducing the number of parameters to learn and provides basic translation invariance to the internal representation.\nMax pooling is done by applying a max filter to (usually) non-overlapping subregions of the initial representation.\nWe are taking the maximum of the pixel that we or the values that we have. This helping with preventing overfitting. We applied the convolution operation and now we apply the pooling.\nFlattening: Here, we have the pooled featured map. After that, we apply the convolution operation to our image and then we apply the pooling to the result of the collision. So, we are going to flatten it into the column. Here, we see many pooling layers. We put them into one log column sequentially. In the input image, we apply the convolution. And also apply the rectifier function.\nFull Connection: Today, we are talking about the full connection. In this step, we are adding a whole artificial neural network to our convolutional neural network. Here, we are calling them fully connected which are the hidden layer. The main purpose of the artificial neural network to combine our feature into more attributes. Here, we used to call a cost function in an artificial neural network and we used mean square error there in common illusional neural network. It is called a loss function and we use across entropy function for that. We are trying to optimize it to minimize that function to optimize our network. We had an artificial neural network is back propagated and some things are adjusted t help optimize. It all done through a gradient descent of backpropagation. The dog neuron knows that the answer it is actually a dog because at the end we are comparing to the picture or to the label on the picture.\nCNN in Python 1: In this tutorial, we are going to implement the CNN in python. Here, we build our convolutional neural network model, we will simply need to change the image of\nThen, we will be able to train a convolutional neural network to predict if some new brain image contains the tumor is yes or no. Now, we have to input these image in our convolution neural that work.\nHere, in the working directory, we have a dataset which are all our images of cats and dogs. In each folder the training set and the test set we would get for example 5000 image.\nThe first pillar of the structure is to separate our images into two separate folders. A training set folder and testing set folder. Here, we see different dog pictures. Now, we can take some pictures of our friends and replace these dogs picture by that picture. Then, we will able to train an algorithm that will predict. And, there are images of a cat. Here, the training set contained 8000 customers and the test set contained 2000 customer. Here, also,4000 images for dogs and 4000 images of cats. So, there are 80 percent and 20 percent split. We already import this dataset.we do not need to encode the dataset because the independent variable is some way of a pixel and the three channel. We need to split the dataset into the training set and test set. Now, we need to apply the feature scaling.\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n# Importing the dataset\ndataset = pd.read_csv('Churn_Modelling.csv')\nX = dataset.iloc[:, 3:13].values\ny = dataset.iloc[:, 13].values\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)\n# Feature Scaling\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nsc = StandardScaler()\nX_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test = sc.transform(X_test)\nCNN in Python 2: In this tutorial, we are going to talk about the convolution neural network. In the first step is to import all the keras packages that we will need to make our CNN model. Here, the first package is sequential. We use sequential packages to initialize our neural network. Now, we import convolution layers and we are working on images and since images are in two dimensions. We use the 2D packages to deal with images. And we also add our pooling layers. And next is flatten. Here, we also use the last dense packages. We use to add the fully connected layers and a classic artificial neural network. Now, I execute the code.\nNow, we are going to create an object of this sequential class. We are going to call this object classifier and we call the sequential method.\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Convolution2D\nfrom keras.layers import MaxPooling2D\nfrom keras.layers import Flatten\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\nCNN in Python 4: In this tutorial, we are going to take care of the first state of convolutions. Here, we take the classifier object and also include the method add. Here, we include convolution2D. Here, we use the 32 feature detectors three by three-dimension for feature detector. We need to specify what are the expected format of our input images. The input image converted into a 3D array if the image is a color image and into a 2D array if it is a black and white image. The 3D means three channel. We need to start with the 2D array dimension. We need to import here for our input shape argument. Therefore, 64 to 64 and then the number of channel 3 that is we are using tensor flow. We have one last argument to input which is the activation function exactly as we did for our fully connected layers. We used this activation function to activate the neurons in the neural network. Here, we are using the rectifier function.\n# Initialising the CNN\nclassifier = Sequential()\n# Step 1 - Convolution\nclassifier.add(Convolution2D(32, 3, 3, input_shape = (64, 64, 3), activation = 'relu'))\nCNN in Python 5: Today, we will take care of the second step pulling. We call the classifier. For the classifier object, we use the add method. And we add the new parenthesis max pooling. We use the max pool size 2 and 2.This line will reduce the size of our maps and it's well divided by two. The size of the feature map is divided by two. For flattening, we use the classifier object and use the add method. We use the parenthesis Flatten().\nIn the same way, For Full connection, we use the classifier object and use the add method. We use the parenthesis Dense (). Also has a parenthesis output_dim is equal to 128. We need to choose a number that is not too small to make the classifier a good model and also not too big. Here, we will go with this 128 hidden nodes in the hidden layer. And another activation function is a rectifier. Now, we copy paste the code. And, add the sigmoid function. now, we add 128 to 1. Then, we get the final layer, which predicts the output.\n# Step 2 - Pooling\nclassifier.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size = (2, 2)))\n# Adding a second convolutional layer\nclassifier.add(Convolution2D(32, 3, 3, activation = 'relu'))\nclassifier.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size = (2, 2)))\n# Step 3 - Flattening\n# Step 4 - Full connection\nclassifier.add(Dense(output_dim = 128, activation = 'relu'))\nclassifier.add(Dense(output_dim = 1, activation = 'sigmoid'))\nCNN in Python 8: In this tutorial, we need to compile the whole thing by choosing to cast a grade. To compile this, we add the compile method and also add the parameter in the optimizer. The optimizer is equal to the Adam. Ans we use loss is equal to bunary_cross entropy. And, the metrics is equal to the accuracy.\n# Compiling the CNN\nclassifier.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'binary_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy'])\nCNN in Python 9: In this tutorial, we are going to fit the CNN image. We actually need a lot of images to find and generalize some correlations. The amount of our training images is augmented because the transformation is random transformation. Image augmentation is a technique that allows you to enrich our dataset our train set. Now, image augmentation is applied to the training set. Here, we create ImageDataGenerator class. We will rescale all our pixel values between 0 and 1. By rescaling them using this rescale equals one over 255 then all our pixels will be between 0 and 1. She arranged that to apply random transaction and we will keep this open to value zoom range. So this 0.2 values here are just some parameters of how much we want to apply these random transformations. We call it the test set because this code section will create the test set. We have 8000 images in our training set. we need to replace 2000 by 8000 right. Now, we generate a fit method onto our classifier. Now, we execute it. And we create another object. Here, 8000 and 2000 images belonging to two classes.2000 image of our test set. After execution, we get 75% accuracy. We get three predictions out of four..there is a difference between the accuracy in the training set and accuracy in the test set.\nfrom keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\ntrain_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale = 1./255,\nshear_range = 0.2,\nzoom_range = 0.2,\nhorizontal_flip = True)\ntest_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale = 1./255)\ntraining_set = train_datagen.flow_from_directory('dataset/training_set',\ntarget_size = (64, 64),\nbatch_size = 32,\nclass_mode = 'binary')\ntest_set = test_datagen.flow_from_directory('dataset/test_set',\ntarget_size = (64, 64),\nbatch_size = 32,\nclass_mode = 'binary')\nsamples_per_epoch = 8000,\nnb_epoch = 25,\nvalidation_data = test_set,\nnb_val_samples = 2000)\nCNN in Python 10: In this tutorial, we are going to talk about if we achieve our goal to get an accuracy of more than 80 percent on the test. Only adding a convolutional layer, we will see how it will definitely improve our performance results. Now, we add another convolution layer. Here, we going to keep the same parameter. Now, we execute the whole code. The accuracy of the training set is about 85.The accuracy of stains on the test that began at 55 percent almost 56 percent. We got indeed 64 percent and 68 percent on the test set. We get an accuracy of 85 percent for the training set and 82 percent for the test. We get a difference of 3 percent as opposed to this 10 percent difference that we got in.\nSoftmax and Cross-Entropy: In softmax function in order to help us out of the situation.\nThe softmax function or the normalized exponential function is a generalization of the logistic function. It takes the exponent and put the power of zed and adds it up so that one's two across all. Here we use a function called mean squared which we used as the cost function for assessing our natural performance. Our goal is to minimize the MSE in order to optimize our network performance.""]"	['<urn:uuid:7ff2b255-b02f-4512-9f40-97e5fe87a548>', '<urn:uuid:8cc2057d-1c31-41ce-8b08-90d88ef8947f>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	17	116	2872
82	What is the proper way to store dried and preserved food items to prevent them from becoming rancid or spoiled?	Dried and preserved food should be placed in a dry cool place or kept in refrigerator. They should be transferred to airtight containers, especially when bought loose or after opening packages. For extended storage periods, use packaging that doesn't allow entry of air or water vapor to prevent rancidity.	['One of the more prevalent causes of food poisoning is improper handling of food by consumers at home.\nSafe food handling is crucial to protect the health and well being of consumers, especially infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with immune-disorders. These people are more susceptible to food poisoning than normal healthy adults.\nBy observing some simple and good practices, we can prevent food from becoming contaminated as well as prevent bacterial growth and multiplication in our food.\n1. Select your food carefully\n2. Wash and keep clean\n3. Separate raw and cooked food\n4. Cook your food well\n5. Keep food at a safe temperature\nWash your hands regularly\nThorough hand-washing with warm soapy water before, during and after handling food prevents bacteria from being transferred from our hands to our food.\nSafe family meal\nThe family meal should be safe to eat. Cooking at high temperatures which are above 75 °C will destroy most of the bacteria.\n1. Cook meat and poultry thoroughly. There should be no pink meat and the juices should run clear when pricked or sliced\n2. Do not cook food partially as this increases risk of growth of bacteria.\n3. Cook seafood thoroughly, especially if cooking for people with illness, pregnant women and older folks.\n4. Keep hot food hot. Serve food immediately after cooking. Food to be served hot should be held at 60 °C or above to prevent bacterial growth.\n5. Reheat stored cooked food at temperatures 75 °C and above to kill bacteria\nFood safety while Using Microwave\nBacteria will be destroyed during microwave cooking just as in other types of ovens, so food is safe cooked in a microwave oven. However the food can cook less evenly than in a conventional oven. Microwave cooking can be uneven just as with frying and grilling. So it is necessary to ensure that food is evenly cooked or bacteria may survive and cause food poisoning.\n1. Watch out for cold spots in the food. Stir the food in between to ensure that whole dish is evenly cooked.\n2. Use a covered dish. Arrange the food uniformly and add a little water. Under a cover, the steam formed will help destroy bacteria and ensure even cooking.\nFood safety on Food storage\nKeep cold food cold\nKeep food outside of the temperature danger zone (between 5°C to 60°C), where bacteria multiply quickly. We can refrigerate cold food until serving time.\nKeep dried food in cool, dry place\nDried and preserved food should be placed in a dry cool place or kept in refrigerator. Warm & humid conditions can cause dried food to go mouldy and rancid faster.\n1. Nuts can keep better and longer in airtight containers when stored in a cool, dry place away from light.\n2. Mouldy food should be discarded as it may contain harmful mycotoxins.\n3. Transfer dried food that are bought loose or unused contents of opened packages of dried and preserved food to airtight containers.\n4. Dried and preserved food that are to be kept for extended periods of time should be stored in packaging that does not allow entry of air or water vapor to prevent rancidity.\nHandling cooked food\n1. Cook just enough for the current meal.\n2. If required keep the extra food in closed vessels.\n3. Once cooked, take the required for consumption and place the remaining cooked food in refrigerator.']	['<urn:uuid:5317f245-3c76-47d1-9683-cbd6de3535dd>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	20	49	569
83	I work in healthcare recruitment and I'm curious - how many different medical specialties and subspecialties are officially recognized in the medical field?	The American Board of Medical Specialties recognizes more than 130 specialties and subspecialties in the medical field.	['Certifications in the healthcare industry run the gamut from nice-to-have to can’t-work-unless-you’re-certified. The variation has to do with the numbers of careers -- more than 200 in the allied health area alone, according to Explore Health Careers. In addition, each state regulates the practice of medicine, nursing and allied health. Certification does have meaning for many healthcare professionals, however, and can demonstrate knowledge as well as expertise.\nMedicine is a profession where all players begin at the same point -- medical school -- but paths then diverge into a wide variety of specialties. The American Board of Medical Specialties recognizes more than 130 specialties and subspecialties. In some cases, subspecialties cross over. Anesthesiologists, family practice physicians and internists, for example, can all specialize in hospice and palliative medicine. Certifications are available in each major specialty and all subspecialties. Certification for physicians is a voluntary process, although some hospitals, insurance companies and managed-care organizations give preference to board-certified physicians.\nNurses can specialize just as physicians do, and certifications are available in many nursing specialties. Some employers give preference to certified registered nurses. In addition, there are four advanced practice nurse categories -- nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse midwives and certified registered nurse anesthetists -- who have post-graduate training and a scope of practice equivalent to that of a physician. Although registered nurses in general are not required to be certified, some states do require that advanced practice nurses be both licensed and certified to practice. Certifications in nursing are available from the American Nurses Credentialing Center or from professional organizations.\nAllied health professionals include occupations as diverse as respiratory therapy, dental assisting, medical technology and licensed practical nursing. Although certification is not usually required to practice, many employers prefer or require certification, particularly for fields in which on-the-job training is a legitimate entry point for the allied health worker. Medical assistants and dental assistants, for example, might be trained in an accredited program or on the job. Certification provides a means to determine the level of knowledge a worker possesses.\nOther Healthcare Occupations\nIn addition to healthcare workers who provide direct care, many other occupations in the industry offer opportunities for certification. The National HealthCareer Association offers certifications for billing and coding specialists, as well as electronic health record specialists. Health information management -- once known as medical records management -- is another area in which workers can obtain certification. The American Health Information Management Association offers credentials such as registered health information administrator; registered health information technician; certified coding specialist; certified health data analyst; and certification in healthcare privacy and security. Although none of these certifications is required for practice, employers may prefer or require them.\n- Explore Heatlh Careers: Allied Health Professions Overview\n- American Board of Medical Specialties: Specialties and Subspecialties\n- American Board of Medical Specialties: What Board Certification Means\n- American Board of Medical Specialties: Certification Matters\n- American Nurses Credentialing Center: ANCC Certification Center\n- Lippincott’s Nursing Center: State-by-State Guide for RN License Renewal Requirements\n- American Medical Technologists: Why Certify with AMT?\n- National HealthCareer Association: Certifications for Ten Allied Health Professions\n- American Health Information Management Association: Types of Credentials\n- Siri Stafford/Photodisc/Getty Images']	['<urn:uuid:87cc5db7-b46f-4d8c-875c-d66e0de3cff6>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	23	17	533
84	design process for educational games and student choice factors what steps to make game and how geography affects student engagement	The educational game design process involves four key stages: First, creating design specifications considering aesthetics, target audience, function, and creation constraints. Second, developing multiple ideas through elevator pitches that outline setting, gameplay, objectives, and learning outcomes. Third, selecting the final design by comparing options against specifications and gathering feedback. Fourth, detailed planning using storyboards for start screens, gameplay, and end screens. As for student engagement factors, geography plays a crucial role - many students are limited to institutions within 50 miles of their home, with some areas being 'education deserts' with few or no educational institutions. Nearly 25.3 million adults live in such education deserts, making physical location often more influential than program quality or graduation rates in determining educational engagement.	['Now that we have completed the initial inquiry and analysis for our educational game design, it’s time to turn our attention to developing ideas.\n[What’s that you say? Initial inquiry and analysis? Yes. Initial. Remember, as you go through this process, you will undoubtedly need to do more research to help with your creation. This should be documented in your process journal and used in the appropriate sections of your work!]\nTo help with this development of ideas, let’s break it down into four stages:\nStage 1 – Design Specifications\nDesign specs, according to the MYP, are “a set of considerations, constraints and requirements for a solution: what the solution must or must not have to be successful. A specification is not a description of the outcome.” It is important that the specs are written well as they will be used throughout the rest of the project. Good design specs are specific, measurable, realistic and testable. Some (but maybe not all!) factors to consider when writing your design specs for this project are:\nAesthetics – Consider appearance, style, colour, shape/form, texture, pattern, finish, layout.\nCustomer – Who it is for? What is the target user’s age, gender, socio-economic background?\nFunction – What it must do? What is its purpose? Where will the product be stored? How easily can it be used/maintained?\nCreation – What resources are available for you to use? Are there limitations as to how this can be created? How much time is needed to create the design?\nRemember: specific, measurable, realistic and testable.\nStage 2 – Developing a Range of Ideas\nTo help us create a range of ideas, you need to write elevator pitches for each of your possible design ideas. This “pitch paragraph” tells the story of your game in a brief manner. Some questions that might help you to write this are:\n- What is the setting?\n- How is it played?\n- What is the objective of the game?\n- What will the user do?\n- What will the user learn?\nIdeally, each of your pitches will create different scenarios rather than just change some minor details. These pitches should be able to give others a reasonable vision of what your game might be like. A good pitch will also include another paragraph that gives more details and/or explains why you are including different aspects in your pitch. This second paragraph should not be part of the explanation of the game but rather an explanation of your thinking.\nStage 3 – Making Your Choice\nSince you have more than one possible design, how will you choose which one to create? If you immediately started thinking “design specification!”, you’re right! For this part of the process, you should justify your choice of final design by comparing your designs against the design specs you wrote earlier. To be done thoroughly, each design should be compared against all the specs to help you make your choice. This should also include some feedback from others about your designs. Ideally this would be part of your target audience but could also be from classmates, family members, etc.\nStage 4 – Detailed Planning\nNow that you have chosen your final design, you need to add details to your elevator pitch idea. This is going to be done in the form of storyboards. You should have at least three different storyboard panels for this game:\n- the Start screen\n- at least one panel of game play\n- the Game Over screen\nA thorough example of these storyboards will include not only the picture, but a narrative description of what is happening, annotations of the sample screen to provide more explanation, and a list of the requirements (sprites, backgrounds, music, sound effects, etc.) that are envisioned for that stage of play.\nAll of this will be submitted in a single document but you may wish to do some of the work in your process journal and then transfer it over to your final copy. You can use these TSCs to help guide your work.', 'By Jonathan M. Turk & Nicholas Hillman\nSince taking office in 2009, expanding college access has been a major goal of the Obama administration. While there has been a multifaceted approach to increasing the number of Americans with a postsecondary credential, a key focus has been on informing the college choice process. Specifically, the administration has sought to ensure better information about colleges and universities is reaching students and their families—the most recent example being the 2015 relaunch of the College Scorecard—while also holding institutions more accountable for student outcomes.\nWe agree generally that the college choice process can be aided by accessible and meaningful data on institutions. But for many students, the decision of whether to attend college, let alone which college, is likely determined more by where they live than by graduation rates, programs offered or even salary after completion. The importance of place therefore needs to be emphasized not only in the college choice process, but also in the greater discussion of higher education accountability as well.\nThe goals of consumer information tools such as the College Scorecard, College Navigator and the Financial Aid Shopping Sheet are two-fold. First, these tools are designed to provide students and families with more detailed information about colleges and universities so that they may make a decision that maximizes the student’s chances of success. The second goal is to foster greater accountability within the higher education market. After all, the revamped or version 2.0 of the College Scorecard was born out of the administration’s abandoned plans for an institutional rating system.\nThe utility of any consumer information tool on increasing college access and success and institutional accountability relies on a set of major assumptions about college student choice. The first assumption is that students and families utilize such tools when selecting a college. Many do not. By assuming they do, the next assumption is that the tool not only contains the information students and families are looking for, but that they can accurately digest the information, which might have major data-quality issues and other limitations that hinder accessibility.\nUltimately, the primary assumption is that when comparable information about a set of colleges and universities is presented to students—information about graduation rates, costs and available programs—they will select a higher performing institution rather than a lower one. In effect, students are expected to select an institution where they perceive their chances of success are maximized.\nIf all of these assumptions hold correct, accountability is achieved as higher performing institutions are rewarded through increased enrollment and tuition revenue, while lower performing institutions are driven to improve or face dwindling enrollment and financial distress.\nBut what if the assumptions prove to be false or only partially true? A recent study helps us answer this question by examining whether releasing College Scorecard data affected where students sent their SAT scores. These “score sends” are a key step in the college application process, so the Scorecard data should have theoretically induced more students to send scores to higher-performing colleges.\nBut this did not happen: releasing more information about graduation rates and costs did not affect score sending behaviors. Notably, the release of this new data did not influence score sending behaviors for students from high-minority and high-free/reduced-price lunch high schools. It did, however, encourage students from well-resourced high schools to send their scores to colleges reporting higher median earnings. This study suggests that Scorecard data likely benefits students who are already highly privileged and least likely to make sub-optimal college choices.\nWhile information about costs, program availability and completion is important and potentially influential to many students, college choice is a complex and multi-stage process that is heavily influenced by social, cultural, economic and geographic characteristics as well. In fact, for most students, college choice is often limited by the number of institutions within 50 miles from their home. And for some students, this reduces college choice to a matter of whether to go, rather than where to go.\nAs highlighted in the recent ACE report “Education Deserts: The Continued Significance of ‘Place’ in the Twenty-First Century,” place matters. Policymakers must consider the reality that for many students, the market for higher education is not a national or even state one, but a local one. In fact, for reasons such as current employment status, family connections, financial resources and academic preparation, perspective students, particularly post-traditional students, are often restricted to attending a nearby institution.\nAt face value, this is not necessarily problematic. While there are communities throughout the country that support multiple higher education institutions (e.g., a community college, public university and a private liberal arts college), there are others with only a single community college serving as the broad-access institution, and still others with no institutions at all. Such latter communities, where college opportunities are few, are education deserts. They exist in all regions of the United States; by one estimate, nearly 25.3 million adults call an education desert home. Even students outside of education deserts often find themselves limited only to a small number of broad-access institutions.\nThe prevalence of education deserts requires federal and state policymakers to consider the importance of the geography of opportunity as it relates to not only college access and success, but also to the accountability movement. We offer the following recommendations to assist in achieving the aims of greater college access and student success and increased accountability.\n1. Research consumer information tools and their influence on college choices. Lessons from financial aid policy show that simply providing “better information” is less effective than coupling that information with personal guidance, mentorship and coaching (Bettinger & Baker, 2014; Castleman, Page, & Schooley, 2014). Information tools like those mentioned above are likely to have limited impact if they are not part of a broader effort to help make that information useful.\n2. Federal policymakers should consider expanding Title III of the Higher Education Act to help institutions build the capacity necessary to improve student retention, degree opportunities and completion rates. Institutions in education deserts, as well as institutions that serve largely first-generation and underserved students, need to be strengthened, not weakened further by limiting the flow of financial support. One of the strongest predictors of timely degree completion is the amount of resources a campus has to serve its students, and so targeting resources to colleges with the least current capacity is likely to yield the greatest results (Bound & Turner, 2007; Bound, Lovenheim, & Turner, 2012).\n3. State policymakers should consider the disproportionately negative impact performance-based funding formulas have on institutions operating in an education desert. Such colleges may require additional resources to meet local needs and improve student outcomes, so states should consider investing additional resources. Without these investments, colleges might unintentionally become more selective and less diverse in response to performance incentives (Dougherty & Reddy, 2013; Kelchen & Stedrak, 2016; Umbricht, Fernandez, Ortagus, 2015).\nEfforts to provide students and families with new and meaningful data to inform college choice are admirable. However, if policymakers want to improve postsecondary attainment levels and strengthen institutions, simply trying to nudge students to make “better choices” about where to attend is not sufficient. Policymakers also need to consider the supply and capacity of colleges and universities—where they are located, whether they are serving their local communities and the role geography and place has in shaping students’ choices.\nBettinger, E.

85	What did researchers find about the role of intermediaries when foreign workers arrive to work in Finland?	According to the study, an intermediary who acts as a link between the two cultures is most useful at the beginning of the stay in the other country.	"[""Adapting to a Finnish workplace : case : occupational immigration of Chinese metal workers.\nThis material has a restricted access due to copyright reasons. It can be read at the workstation at Jyväskylä University Library reserved for the use of archival materials: https://kirjasto.jyu.fi/en/workspaces/facilities\nThe aim of the study was to investigate intercultural adaptation of occupational immigrants to Finnish working life and culture and identify factors that support or hinder the adaptation process. Due to demographic changes in the society and the increasing number of foreigners in Finnish workplaces, the study of occupational immigration is a very contemporary topic. The study was qualitative in nature. 13 Chinese metal workers were interviewed in small groups using a translator in Mandarin Chinese. The respondents had arrived in Finland at different times between 6 and 16 months prior to the interview. The research was conducted with the help of Mänttä Regional Vocational Education Centre which administrates a European Social Fund project for occupational immigration development. They recruited the Chinese to Finnish companies and organised a training programme for them concerning work, language and culture related issues. The applied goal of the research was to find feedback and recommendations for the project on how to support the adaptation process and improve the programme. According to the study there were many communication differences observed between the Finns and Chinese. However, most of the respondents had adapted to the Finnish culture and to these differences rather well. Most respondents were optimistic about their future and thought that having the right attitude is crucial for adaptation. The study found that language plays an important role in the adaptation and both co-national and host support facilitates adaptation to the culture. The training programme was perceived as indispensable but could be further improved by making it closer to practise.

86	What kind of bacteria cause food poisoning and how does the Food Safety Lab test for them?	Several bacteria can cause food poisoning, including Staph and Bacillus cereus that act quickly (1-7 hours) through toxins, and Salmonella and Campylobacter that take 12 hours or days to cause illness. The NMSU Food Safety Laboratory tests for various bacteria including Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus using FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual procedures.	"[""The New Mexico State University Food Safety Laboratory (NMSU FSL) is a Biosafety Level 2 food microbiology laboratory that employs five analysts and two students. Our primary work involves the development and evaluation of rapid methods for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms in foods.\nDr Willis Fedio is the Director of the FSL and has over 25 years of food pathogen detection experience using a wide range of techniques including cultural procedures, PCR, real time PCR, and a variety of immunoassays. For the last twelve years, we have had an Interagency Agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to provide method assessment, development and validation data for commodities identified in national food safety and food defense programs. NMSU FSL staff are required to undergo rigorous training on FDA methods and demonstrate proficiency in the procedures both by practical and written evaluations. The scope of the experimental work in the FSL ranges from validation of commercially available test kits, to the development and fine tuning of procedures for specific foods. The NMSU FSL's evaluation includes the assessment of rapid test methods for a particular analyte(s) or food commodity to be measured against the FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM). This comparison is necessary prior to the FDA adopting a rapid test method for field use.\nThe work of the Food Safety Laboratory helps the FDA perform its mission by enhancing the Agency's ability to be responsive in the food safety and food defense arenas by providing rapid method assessment, development and validation data. These improved methodologies allow the FDA to more effectively conduct surveillance and regulatory enforcement and facilitates the early detection of potentially deadly organisms in the food supply.\nFive years ago we became a Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) Microbiology Laboratory and four years got FDA funding to become a FERN Microbiology Agreement Program Laboratory. The FERN MCAP program enabled us to acquire additional laboratory equipment and expertise. We have participated in many FERN trainings, FERN Proficiency Tests, Multilab Validation Studies, Surveillance Studies and other assignments. We recently received another FERN MCAP grant for an additional three years.\nThe NMSU FSL works with local food processors on the microbiological evaluation of a wide range of products. We have conducted numerous studies on the microflora of raw, fermented and dried chile peppers and examined the survival and growth of pathogenic bacteria in a wide range of food products.\nWe conduct procedures for detection of microorganisms including Escherichia coli O157:H7; non-O157 Shiga Toxin Producing Escherichia coli; Salmonella spp.; Listeria monocytogenes; Vibrio spp.; Shigella spp.; Staphylococcus aureus; Escherichia coli, coliforms, aerobic plate count and yeasts and molds. We use FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual and USDA FSIS Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook procedures for detection and isolation of foodborne microorganisms.\nThe NMSU FSL staff also works with processors on HACCP plan and Listeria Control Program development and process evaluations.\nWho Are We?\nDr. Willis Fedio\nP.O. Box 30003 MSC 3BF\nLas Cruces NM 88003-8003\nNMSU Food Safety Laboratory\n2990 Knox St.\nLas Cruces NM 88003-1268"", 'In warm-weather months, who doesn’t love to get outside for picnics, backyard gatherings, and of course delicious foods? But high temperatures raise your chance of getting sick from things you eat. Learn how to handle food properly to avoid the misery of food poisoning.\nIt can be hard to keep foods safe to eat during warmer weather. If you’re eating or preparing foods outside, you may have trouble finding places to wash your hands, keep foods cold, or cook at the proper temperature—all of which are important to prevent foodborne illness.\n“Food poisoning occurs if the foods you eat contain certain microbes or the toxins they produce,” says Dr. Alison O’Brien, a food safety expert at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Maryland. “You can get sick directly from swallowing the toxins. Or you can get sick if the microbes get into your gut and start to multiply.”\nEach year, about 1 in 6 Americans get sick from tainted foods. Most foodborne illnesses arise suddenly and last only a short time. But food poisoning sometimes leads to more serious problems. Foodborne diseases kill about 3,000 people nationwide each year. Infants, older people, and those with compromised immune systems are especially at risk.\nMany people know the symptoms of food poisoning: vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, or chills. The sickness may be mild or severe. It may last from a few hours to several days. The symptoms and length of illness depend on the type of disease-causing microbe or toxin you’ve swallowed.\nThe leading cause of foodborne disease outbreaks in the U.S. is norovirus. This highly contagious virus sickens more than 20 million people nationwide each year, leading to vomiting and diarrhea. Norovirus outbreaks can occur anywhere people gather or food is served.\n“You can get norovirus when a sick food handler contaminates your food, possibly by not washing their hands well enough after touching the virus,” O’Brien says. “Swallowing just a little norovirus can make you very sick.”\nSeveral types of bacteria can also cause food poisoning. Some foods you buy—such as raw meat or fruits and vegetables—may already contain bacteria that you need to wash off or cook to destroy. Bacteria can also thrive in certain foods if not stored properly.\nBacteria like Staph and Bacillus cereus can make you sick quickly, within 1 to 7 hours. These bacteria produce fast-acting toxins in foods (such as meat or dairy for Staph, and starchy foods like rice for B. cereus). Keeping such foods refrigerated at 40 °F or colder helps slow or stop the growth of these bacteria.\nOther bacteria, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, don’t make you sick until they get in your body and multiply. With these microbes, it can take 12 hours or a few days for you to feel ill. “Symptoms can include fever, cramps, and sometimes bloody diarrhea,” says O’Brien.\nWhen you have a foodborne illness, you usually need to drink plenty of fluids. “But see a doctor if you have blood in your stool,” O’Brien advises. “And if a child seems to have food poisoning, you should have the child seen by a doctor.”\nJanuary 30, 2015 //\nHuff Post Live Pleasurable Weight Loss author Jena La Flamme finds sexual act...\nJanuary 29, 2015 //\nBy Naomi MacKenzie -Blackdoctor.org Blueberry skincare!

87	What tools are used to monitor engineering project completion rates, and what are the rules for conducting effective project meetings?	Document Management Systems (DMS) are used to monitor project completion rates by tracking document and drawing files through review and approval workflows, calculating progress based on weighted averages of individual documents. For meetings, organizations require three key elements: advance notification to attendees, specific formal agendas, and distribution of meeting notes to all team members. This formalization helps manage time effectively and ensures all project business is properly documented.	['Earned value for a project represents the actual work that has been done so far against the overall planned work to be done. Earned Value Management has been an important facet of project management for years. Project managers have used earned value to gauge the overall progress of projects. Tracking actual progress of a project is an important part of Earned Value Management, as the earned value is a direct reflection of the actual progress.\nHow you can track the actual progress of different project activities, highly depends on the nature of those activities. Engineering or design work is basically production of engineering drawings, design specifications, bill of materials, datasheets and design models. To measure the progress of engineering work, you need to measure the progress of documents and drawings produced.\nMaster Document Register (MDR)\nNormally the scope of work for an engineering design project is the list of documents and drawings to be produced. Commonly referred to by either one of the following terms –\n- Master Document List\n- Master Deliverable List\n- Master Document/Deliverable Register\nUsually before starting the project, engineering team lists down the documents and drawings that are expected to be produced during the course of the project. However, this list is flexible and scope of work may increase or decrease during the course of the project, as the design matures.\nProject managers can then use this list as a benchmark for measuring the actual progress achieved on a project against what is expected or planned scope of work.\nProject progress as weighted average\nClearly, the number of documents and drawings produced in a project is an indicator of the actual work done. However it is not a direct indicator, as some drawings may require a lot more work than others.\nHence it is a good idea to have weights assigned to each document/drawing. The task weights can be proportionate to the amount of work that goes into producing that particular document/drawing. Usually manhours spent on producing a document is an effective parameter to be used as progress measurement weights. These weights will then be used to measure the overall project progress as a weighted average of progress values for all individual documents and drawings.\nThis weighted average represents actual progress or work achieved in an engineering project. The weighted average can be in terms of % progress or in terms of manhours, depending on how the progress on individual documents is measured. Note that weights can be anything, as their units cancel out in the end anyway.\nMeasuring actual progress with document management\nOnce you have the actual progress numbers for individual document/drawing items, calculation of actual project progress is just basic math. But it is the measurement of actual progress at document level that needs serious attention and efforts from the project managers.\nThere are several tools available for tracking actual progress of engineering & construction projects. But the best-suited tool for tracking documents and drawings is a Document Management System. So all the project document and drawing files that are uploaded, reviewed and approved, can be tracked and progress can be reported accordingly.\nDocument review and approval\nThe production of engineering drawings is usually a multi-step process, where the CAD drawings and design documents undergo multiple steps of review and approval. If the project involves multiple teams from different disciplines, then drawings from each discipline should be reviewed and approved by all other discipline teams. Finally project managers should also review and approve the drawings cleared from the multidisciplinary review.\nSince this is usually a complex process, it is a good idea to track the status of documents and drawings as they go through this review-approval process. Project managers can also assign progress weights to the approvals given by different stakeholders in the workflow. For example, an approval from engineering manager can mean 40% progress and approval from project manager will signal 80% progress of a document. Finally the ‘Good For Construction’ copy of the drawing will mean 100% progress and completion of that particular drawing.\nProject based workflows\nReview and approval process for engineering drawings can be project specific. So it can change from project to project. You can also have different approval processes for different types of documents and drawings.\nSo ideally you should have a way to capture multiple review and approval processes within the document management system that you are using to tracking the actual earned value. A workflow engine integrated with your document management system can certainly help to configure multiple such review and approval workflows.\nEngineering Drawing Management System (DMS) in WorkPack has helped many engineering project managers to track and measure the earned value of their projects by combining a workflow engine with the DMS.\nPutting it all together\nTo sum it all up, follow these steps to track the earned value for engineering projects –\n- Get your team to work with a Document Management System (DMS) for engineering drawings.\n- Configure review and approval workflows within your DMS\n- Upload your Master Document Register or MDR to the DMS\n- Assign weights for different document/drawing line items. These can correspond to amount of work required and complexity of each item.\n- Measure the progress of individual documents and drawings as they move through the review and approval workflow (configured in step2).\n- Calculate the earned value of engineering project as the weighted average of progress numbers for individual documents and drawings.', 'Why Keep Procedures Consistent Across Multiple Projects?\nEvery project manager can recall at least one initiative that a manager or a stakeholder has asked to “keep on the down low.” In actuality, it’s those extra requests and hallway conversations that contribute to project killers like scope creep.\nSometimes, stakeholders will want to “fast track” a project by skipping important steps. In other cases, stakeholders assume that less important initiatives can be handled with fewer formalities. Best practices in project management involve making sure that stakeholders handle every project using consistent methods and documentation, regardless of its priority within an organization.\nAlways Use Project Request Documentation\nManagers often fear project documentation because it suggests that resources are spent writing things down instead of actually adding value. Project managers can keep documentation that’s simple and clear by using philosophies like one page document templates. Minimizing formalities within busy teams doesn’t have to mean ignoring them, especially when documentation can prevent major project management disasters.\nStandardize Meeting Formats and Attendees\nHallway conversations like the one above are just one distant early warning for project managers. Requests for changes during informal meetings, especially when project sponsors aren’t present, can lead to problems during the implementation and evaluation phases of the project cycle. Project managers can ensure that teams stay focused by following standard meeting protocols.\nIn many organizations, a meeting isn’t considered “official” until the following criteria are met:\n• Attendees are notified in advance, even if it’s just a few minutes in the future.\n• Each meeting must have a formal and specific agenda.\n• Notes must be taken at each meeting and distributed to all team members.\nFormalizing meetings this way accomplishes two of a project manager’s major goals. First, it forces meeting-prone team members to manage time more effectively by pushing more meeting topics into e-mail or memo format. Second, it puts an entire team on notice that all project business is documented, even informal meetings.\nPublish Meeting Notes and Milestones\nAs evidenced by the above example, publishing meeting notes helps to keep everyone on a team up to speed about discussions and concerns. Published meeting notes can also document any shifts in scope, which will have to be justified during the evaluation phase of the project cycle.\nPublishing and celebrating milestones also fills the crucial need for ongoing evaluation through documentation. Keeping a running log of tasks completed and milestones reached can help teams reconsider some of the challenges they faced on the way to project completion. Maintaining this level of communication on each project can help teams reach a consistent level of quality over time.\nThis post is part of the series: Best Practices of Project Management\nBusiness leaders have identified five critical areas where project management professionals can help their teams excel. These best practices of project management apply to teams in any kind of industry, under any conditions. All five best practices require tactical skills and organizational courage.\n- Best Practices of Project Management: Following the Project Cycle\n- Best Practices of Project Management: Standardizing Procedures\n- Best Practices of Project Management: Clear Communication\n- Best Practices of Project Management: Dealing with Change\n- Best Practices of Project Management: Choose the Right Tools']	['<urn:uuid:260dc5ad-0388-46e5-b55b-97ae812db057>', '<urn:uuid:c92d9096-1fcf-4746-b8e3-c6e253fc5abb>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	20	68	1444

Best Rules to Stay Hygienic\nHygiene is essential for a successful and enjoyable practice for martial arts practitioners. Not only does good hygiene prevent the spread of germs and bacteria, but it also creates a more comfortable environment for everyone. Here are the best rules for maintaining hygiene in martial arts gyms:\n1.1. Rule 1: Wear Clean Clothes\nThe first rule of martial arts is always to wear clean clothes. This rule applies regardless of the martial art discipline and should be taken seriously, as contaminated clothing can lead to skin infections and other health issues. Practitioners must keep their training gear clean, especially during hot months when bacteria can grow quickly on sweaty and damp apparel.\nCleanliness also helps maintain respect in the game. Wearing soiled or unkempt gear and clothes shows a lack of respect towards yourself and your peers, making it difficult to foster a healthy learning and friendly environment. Additionally, wearing clean attire like BJJ Gi and rash guards can help build self-confidence and ensure optimal health in the environment of the training vicinity.\n1.2. Rule 2: Shower Before Training\nFor martial arts practitioners, showering before training is a must-follow routine to practice. Not only does it promote hygiene and prevent the spread of germs, but it also helps to set the tone for physical and mental preparation.\nA warm shower can help you feel energized and ready for a head-on tackle session. This, in turn, allows you to focus better on each technique you will go to practice. Furthermore, wearing clean clothes is vital to prevent skin irritation or infection from sweat or bacteria accumulating on fabrics.\nShowering before martial arts training keeps you clean and creates a more pleasant atmosphere for both instructor and student. It helps maintain respect among everyone in the game and allows you to clear your thoughts before engaging in any physical activity.\n1.3. Rule 3: Wash Gym Clothes Regularly\nFor newly learning the art, keeping their gym clothes clean and fresh is essential, as this will help them remain comfortable and focused during their training sessions.\nIt's also necessary to ensure that sweat-soaked clothing only sits for a short time in the laundry bin, as bacteria can grow from sweat-soaked clothing over time. So, the best way to keep BJJ gym clothes fresh is by washing them immediately after each use.\nSweaty apparel should be cleaned with a mild detergent at a warm temperature to kill any germs or bacteria.\n1.4. Rule 4: Sanitize Equipment After Use\nSanitization removes dirt, germs, and other particles from surfaces to keep you safe. Martial arts equipment such as punching bags, mats, and protective gear should be disinfected before and after every use. This will prevent the spread of bacteria or viruses among practitioners.\nTo sanitize martial arts equipment properly, clean surfaces with a cloth dampened with warm soap and water. Once this is done, spray the equipment with an approved sanitizer or disinfectant - Don’t forget to check your product's instructions for details on how long it takes for the product to work best.\n1.5. Rule 5: Avoid Sharing Belongings\nTry to keep your belongings private at the martial art gyms. This rule is essential to maintain safety and respect among all participants.\nIn martial arts classes, everyone must own their equipment and gear. This includes Gi, training gloves, shin and rash guards, and other protective gear. Preventing equipment exposure to germs or bacteria from other people's belongings.\nMoreover, this ensures that everyone gets the right fit for their body type since they may need different sizes or styles for the best training. It also shows respect for fellow practitioners by not asking them to share their belongings with others.\n1.6. Rule 6: Cover Open Sores and Cuts\nHowever, taking safety precautions when engaging in any physical activity is essential.\nRule number 6 of martial arts is to always cover open sores or cuts before practice or competition. Not only will this help prevent the spread of bacteria and viruses, but covering an open wound can also reduce the risk of further damage.\nThe recommended way for martial artists to carry a medical-grade adhesive bandage and other first aid prerequisites to cover wounds. This bandage adheres well and allows the skin to remain in contact with fresh air without compromising coverage or protection from infection.\nThe wound must be covered entirely before engaging in any physical activities, such as sparring, rolling, or grappling, so that other participants are not exposed to potential contamination from blood-borne pathogens.\n1.7. Rule 7: Disinfect Mats and Floors\nIt is better to disinfect mats and floors of martial arts gyms regularly. For optimal hygiene and safety, every martial arts studio should clean its mats and floors daily.\nIf you are training in a martial art gym, ensure the mats cleaning and floors are done daily. To begin with, no matter what type of striking or grappling martial art you practice like Karate, Taekwondo, or Judo – having clean mats are essential for keeping germs at bay.\nNot only should all equipment be wiped down after each use, but the entire mat area should also be mopped and disinfected thoroughly with a disinfecting solution. To maximize cleanliness and prevent germs from spreading, it is also necessary to regularly vacuum and deep clean rugs or carpets in gyms.\n1.8. Rule 8: Keep Shoes Clean and Dry\nKeep your shoes clean and dry to avoid health issues and hygiene concerns. This rule should be taken seriously as it not only helps with the personal hygiene of a martial artist but also ensures your safety during training sessions.\nShoes can get dirty quickly, especially when practicing martial arts, where practitioners constantly move around on the floor or mats. This dirt can lead to the nourishment of bacteria, which could spread to other people during training sessions, increasing the risk of contracting illnesses or diseases like athlete's foot.\nKeeping your shoes clean and dry will decrease the spread ratio of potential bacteria among fellow students or instructors.\n1.9. Rule 9: Avoid Touching Faces During Training\nThis rule applies to everyone, regardless of rank or experience level, and serves an essential purpose, preventing potential injuries and illnesses.\nKeeping hands away from the face is the best way to reduce the risk of contamination from germs carried on the hands, which can cause anything from colds and flu to more effects.\nFurthermore, martial artists must develop self-control when resisting the urge to touch their faces during training.\nTouching one's face should only be done when necessary - for example, if a contact lens needs adjusting - not as a reflex or out of habit. As martial artists learn more significant control over their bodies through practice, this includes developing discipline against unwanted movements such as touching one's face.\n1.10. Rule 10: Report Illness Immediately\nNeglecting illnesses and injuries in martial arts or in general will be a risk to your health. In martial arts, it is necessary to keep diseases at bay by reporting and addressing them immediately when symptoms arise. This will ensure that other members of the martial arts stay safe and healthy as well.\nMartial artists must take caution when they are feeling sick or have been exposed to someone who may be ill. Even though training sessions can be challenging, continuing to practice in a medically compromised state can lead to more severe conditions that could put you and others at risk.\nReporting sickness early is the best way to protect everyone from harm and prevent the spread of germs. In addition, if you report your illness immediately, there is a greater chance you will be able to recover faster since treatment can begin quickly after diagnosis. So, being careful is wise because prevention is better than cure.\n1.11. Rule 11: Keep Your Hair Properly Tied\nWhen it comes to martial arts, most people think of kicks and punches. But to practice martial arts safely and effectively, another important rule must be followed: female practitioners must keep their hair properly tied with a fabric or rubber band.\nHaving your hair up and away from your face and body will help you avoid getting caught on any part of your uniform or equipment while practicing martial arts.\nLong hair can quickly become a hazard, as it can present an obstruction when attempting certain motions. Having your hair properly tied could help you stay focused on the task.\nThe best way to keep this rule is by tying back long hair into a ponytail or braid before beginning practice each session. If needed for extra support, headbands can also be worn underneath helmets and other protective gear.\n1.12. Rule 12: Avoid Wearing Jewelry\nTraining with Jewelry can be dangerous in martial arts, as it can catch on clothing or other items and cause injury. It can also be distracting to the practitioner and their opponent.\nSo, the jewelry should not be worn during training, tournaments, or competition. Rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and watches should all be removed before entering the dojo or any tournament area.\n2. What are the Dos and Don'ts in the Gym for a Beginner?\nIf you're a beginner in martial arts, there are some key do's and don'ts to remember when working out at the gym. Be aware of these rules so your training can be as safe and effective as possible.\n- Firstly, when training at the gym, it's essential to wear comfortable clothing that allows for a full range of motion.

89	How does the battery production process handle water treatment, and what are the key differences between developed and developing nations in managing industrial water pollution?	In battery production, the process requires deionized water for lead paste manufacturing and water-cooling systems for formation processes. For water quality control, developed countries like the U.S. have sharply reduced point source pollution through strict regulations and the Clean Water Act, which sets standards for key pollutants and requires permits for discharge. However, in developing countries, water pollution remains a serious and growing problem. Half of the world's 500 major rivers are heavily polluted, with minimal sewage treatment due to financial constraints. For instance, in China, only 10% of sewage is treated, and economic growth often occurs with little funding allocated for cleanup efforts.	"['The production of various types of lead-acid batteries is similar, and can be divided into pole plate production line, assembly line and charging chemical line according to the characteristics and sequence of production process. The pole plate production line consists of lead powder production line, grid casting line, plate coating and filling line and Curing and drying line composition.\nIn addition to the above main production process lines, there are also some auxiliary lines, mainly including the production process of pole terminal lead parts casting, pole plate slitting and grinding, pole plate washing and drying, acid preparation and water production. The main equipment of the above production lines are lead powder machine, plate casting machine, paste machine, smear machine, surface dryer, curing chamber, automatic assembly line, acid filling machine, charging and discharging machine, acid preparation water equipment, etc.\nAs for all kinds of special batteries, in addition to the above production lines, there are some differences in individual processes. For example, for winding batteries, die-casting grids are used, and continuous casting, continuous milking, and continuous coating lines are used. Because the bipolar plate is different from the plate structure of the traditional lead-acid battery, the bipolar plate manufacturing, smearing, assembly and other production lines need special production lines to complete.\nThe manufacturing process of lead-acid battery is shown in Figure 1.\nThe main processes of each flow in Figure 1 are briefly described as follows.\n(1) Lead powder manufacturing process. The electrolytic lead is passed through the automatic lead powder machine to complete the process of automatic casting, dicing, timing and quantitative feeding, grinding, powder output, closed transportation, and storage in the warehouse, and then processed into lead oxide that meets the technical requirements.\n(2) Grid casting process. The lead alloys used in the positive and negative grids are respectively poured into the alloy pot of the automatic plate casting machine to be melted and kept warm, and the battery plate is completed through continuous and repeated actions such as closed automatic quantitative conveying, injection molding, molding, demoulding, and automatic cutting. The production process of the grid.\n(3) Lead casting process. The lead alloys used in the positive and negative electrodes are respectively put into the alloy pot to melt and keep warm, and the production process of lead parts and bus bars for batteries is completed through continuous and repeated actions such as automatic quantitative conveying, injection molding, molding, demoulding, and automatic cutting. , The lead casting process mainly provides raw materials for assembly supply and demand.\n(4) Manufacturing process of lead paste and coated board. Through the automatic lead paste manufacturing unit, the lead powder, dilute sulfuric acid, deionized water, various additives, etc. required for the manufacture of lead paste are automatically weighed, enclosed, transported, added to the paste machine, and sealed. Procedure, complete the process of full mixing in the specified sequence, so that the final semi-finished lead paste produced can meet the requirements of the coating process.\n(5) Curing and drying manufacturing process. The filled and coated plates are sent to a special room (curing and drying room) whose temperature, humidity and time are controlled by an automatic program. The pole plate completes the process of physical and chemical changes, so that the pole plate after curing and drying can meet the requirements of production and technology. This process will have a great impact on the strength of the plate, the life of the active material, and the initial discharge capacity of the battery.\n(6) Assembly and manufacturing process. The overall assembly of the battery is completed through the processes of wrapping, welding, manhole, welding bridge, capping, welding terminals, and pole sealing.\n(7) Formation process. The acid-added battery is placed in a circulating water cooling tank or an air-cooled assembly line, and a dedicated charging and discharging machine is used. standard.', 'Presentation on theme: ""Any chemical, biological, or physical change in water quality that has a harmful effect on living organisms or makes water unsuitable for desired usage.""— Presentation transcript:\nAny chemical, biological, or physical change in water quality that has a harmful effect on living organisms or makes water unsuitable for desired usage.\nWHO: * 3.4 million premature deaths each year from waterborne diseases * 1.9 million from diarrhea * U.S. 1.5 million illnesses * 1993 Milwaukee 370,000 sick\nInfectious Agents: - bacteria and viruses often from animal wastes Oxygen Demanding Wastes: - organic waste that needs oxygen often from animal waste, paper mills and food processing.

90	what is foundation square measuring method and what safety gear needed during foundation work	"For measuring and squaring a foundation, you can use the mathematical principle that A squared + B squared = C squared to find the hypotenuse of a triangle. For example, with walls of 16'4"" and 13'7"", you calculate the diagonal measurement that ensures square corners. As for safety gear requirements during foundation work, everyone must wear brimless plastic hard hats that are regularly inspected for damage. Workers need specific protection like welding helmets and goggles for welders, and neoprene coated canvas gloves when working with cement. The worksite must also have multi-purpose dry chemical extinguishers in office and welding areas."	"['How to Square a Wall or Layout for a Foundation\nWhen laying out the foundation for a house the way I always square a house is this. First of all, you know you will have one straight wall or line, and you will know the length. Pop a line for that first wall and make a mark at each end. You now have the first wall, the length and location.\nNow from one end of the first line hook your tape on that mark that is the end of the wall. You know the length wall running 90° of the first wall. Now is when you figure the two walls for square.\nA squared + B squared = C squared, you want to figure the hypotenuse of the triangle. Say the wall is 16 feet 4 inches, convert the feet and inches to all inches this will = 196 inches. Now the wall running 90° to the first wall lets say 13 feet 7 inches which = 163 inches. With a calculator multiply the first number by itself. 196X196 =38,416, not put that in your memory plus of the calculator.\nNext multiply the second number by itself, 163X163 =26,569, add that number to the memory plus on your calculator. Now hit memory recall button and next hit the square root button. This will give you the number 254.92159 which is the distance from one corner to the other of that room.\nConvert this back into inches and feet which is by dividing by 12. This = 21.243465 so you have 21 feet .243465. Multiply .243465 by 12 inches (one foot) which will = 2.92158 which is 2 and a fraction of an inch. This fraction of an inch is so close to 15/16 that it is safe to round it up. so the measurement from one corner of the room is 21 feet 2 15/16 inch. This will be the hypotenuse of the triangle the two walls form.\nYou already have the first wall line where it is supposed to go.\nNow take two tape measures, hook one on the end mark of the first wall. At the other end of that wall hook the other tape on the end of that wall at the mark you made. Now just lay the first tape down anywhere. Pull the second tape out the measurement of the wall running 90° of the first wall. You will want the number on the tape to be 13 feet 7 inches, now take the first tape that is hooked on the other end of the first wall and pull it across the second tape, you will want the number 21 feet 2 15/16 to intersect with the number 13 feet 7 inches. Mark right there, that is the corner of the room and will be square.\nI hope this isn\'t too confusing.\nNice! I used to use that theory for framing foundations and decks, it\'s a good one! Even nicer with the old ""construction master"" calculator, lol. When I needed a 45* brace on a 7\' high gable end, I thought; There must be a quicker way than all that math... Realizing when I made the cuts for rafters using the framing square set on 1\' each way (tongue/blade) the diagonal measurement always added 5"" or 17"" total in the flat plane -- used as a standard. So applying that to the length I needed for the brace; 7\' times 5 = 35"" + 7\' = 1"" short of 10\' or 9\'11"" Math= 9\' 10-13/16""..... 5\' height = 5x5 = 25"" (2\' 1"") plus 5\' = 7\'1"" Math= 7\' 7/8"" Close enough for a brace.\nI\'ll use this for rough square on footings, etc.--- obviously it won\'t work on accuracy needed measurements, 20\' footing leg each way for a right-angle is 20 x 5 = 100"" OR in ft./in. = 8\'4"" + 20\' = 28\'4"" Math check= 28\' 3-7/16"" --- so I\'m off 9/16"" in diagonals of 20\', good enough for a quick footing set without a calculator or phone-- just head math. Neat part is; go to an larger number than needed (for feet/with inches) and set the pin/mark there for the rough-set, snap the line to that.\nPS. Though I\'d share that, if you don\'t mind...\nsquare a wall? use the 3,4,5 triangle method\nuse the 3 4 5 triangle concept...(6 8 10 also works)\n|All times are GMT -5.

Drillers are working around live electrical, gas and water lines, and a whole host of environmental hazards, like extreme temperatures, wildlife, and traffic, just to name a few.\nEnsuring that you and your teams implement a drilling safety plan is critical. Not only do you want to keep you and your crews safe, but it’s better for business. Many companies are looking beyond price to safety program as part of their bid review process.\nNot sure where to start with your drilling safety program? These five tips will help you to build one and to keep you and your crew on your next foundation drilling project.\nPre-Task Hazard Analysis\nPlanning is the most critical piece of any drilling safety program. Creating a pre-task hazard analysis brings awareness to the dangers of the particular job. Part of this process is to check gear, first aids kits, and emergency contacts.\nAfter a pre-task hazard analysis is complete, it’s important to communicate the results clearly and regularly to team members. Using a DTA, or daily task analysis, to communicate the specifics of the work to be done each day, along with the hazards, is a great way to ensure that everyone on the site is prepared for the work and takes the appropriate precautions.\nSafety rules should be regularly communicated to employees.\nEnsuring that everyone on site has access to and is outfitted with the proper safety gear is critical to a drilling safety plan. Everyone onsite should be wearing a brimless, plastic hard hat. These hard hats should be inspected regularly for cracks or damage and replaced.\nWelders onsite will need both welding helmets and goggles. Employees working with cement, plastic or other possible-skin irritating substances should be wearing neoprene coated canvas gloves.\nBoth the onsite office and welding areas should have multi-purpose dry chemical extinguishers present.\nConducting safety gear reviews will help ensure employees have access to the gear that they need and that the gear is in good condition.\nMaking sure your worksite is in good condition is also part of a strong drilling safety plan.\nWalkways and work areas should be kept clear of loose materials. Elevated platforms higher than four feet should feature a handrail and toe board. If night work is going on, make sure that the area is properly lit.\nEnsuring there are proper containers for combustibles, trash, and oil rags can help keep your employees and your site safe.\nOne of the biggest concerns when it comes to drilling foundation work is falling hazards. It’s important to protect your team from falling hazards.\nFor drilled areas not currently active, cover the shafts with wooden mats or steel plates.\nIn areas where drilling is currently going on, either set steel casing at approximately 42 inches above grade or install a personal fall arrest system. Make sure that there is a physical perimeter with warning signs, and if possible, dedicated employees to watch the area.\nInspect What You Expect for Drilling Safety Plans\nThe key to any safety plan is to constant inspect what you expect. Reviewing safety policies with employees, inspecting safety gear, and doing site surveys are critical to ensuring that your worksite is a safe place for your employees.\nFoundation drilling is serious business.

91	nuclear transport protein importin alpha vs importin beta function xenopus which does binding	While both importin-alpha and importin-beta are involved in nuclear transport, they have distinct functions. Importin-beta acts as the engine of the complex, recognizing nuclear pores and moving through them, while importin-alpha serves as an adapter molecule that connects importin-beta with the cargo protein. In Xenopus, importin-alpha levels affect nuclear size, with higher levels leading to increased nuclear size.	"['|Home | About | Journals | Submit | Contact Us | Français|\nThe size of a cell’s nucleus is usually proportional to the size of the cell itself. How are the two linked? The answer lies, at least in part, in the import of one or more cytoplasmic cargoes into the nucleus.\nIt is rare to come across a basic question in cell biology that is almost entirely unresolved, but what determines the size of a cell or of an organelle is one such question1. Does the cell use a ‘molecular ruler’ to directly assess the size of its compartments, or does it use a surrogate, such as protein concentration, to determine how big its structures are? Reporting in Cell, Levy and Heald2 provide evidence that at least partly answers these questions in regard to the size of the cell nucleus.\nRegulation of nuclear size is perhaps one of the most striking, and enigmatic, examples of organelle-size control, because it is tightly linked to cell size3. Indeed, there is a constant ratio between nuclear and cell volumes (the N/C volume ratio), and deviations from it are associated with disease4. But how is this ratio regulated? To address this question, researchers have attempted5,6 to perturb the N/C volume ratio in yeast, but to no avail: neither nuclear-DNA content, nor varied growth conditions, nor drug treatments, could alter the ratio.\nAnother question is what aspect of cell volume affects nuclear size: is it the cell’s entire volume; the volume of only the cytoplasm; or perhaps that of another organelle? In multinucleated fission yeast, the size of each nucleus is proportional to its surrounding cytoplasm6, but how the cytoplasm affects nuclear size, if at all, has remained unknown.\nLevy and Heald2 study regulation of nuclear size in two related frog species — Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis — that differ in both body size and the number of chromosome copies per cell (ploidy). Xenopus laevis is larger and its cells are tetraploid, whereas X. tropicalis is smaller and its cells are diploid. The two species also differ in another aspect: the cells and nuclei of X. laevis are larger.\nAn advantage of Xenopus as an experimental model is that its nuclei can be assembled in a test tube using the chromatin (DNA–protein complexes) and extracts of its egg cytoplasm. This allowed Levy and Heald2 to ask, what is the main determinant of nuclear size in Xenopus: the DNA or a cytoplasmic factor?\nThe authors added sperm chromatin from either X. laevis or X. tropicalis to egg extracts from either X. laevis or X. tropicalis (Fig. 1a). They found that, although both extracts can trigger assembly of the nuclear envelope around the chromatin, the X. laevis extract forms larger nuclei than the X. tropicalis extract, regardless of the DNA used. This indicates that one or more cytoplasmic factors determine nuclear size.\nA hint of the underlying difference between the extracts from the two frog species came from the authors’ analyses of nuclear import — the process by which proteins are transported into the nucleus7. Both the rate of nuclear import and the maximum size of the imported cargo were greater in the nuclei reconstituted with X. laevis extracts. The capacity for nuclear import therefore might be a regulator of nuclear size.\nThe two extracts differed in two proteins that mediate nuclear import — importin-α and Ntf2. In X. laevis extracts, the levels of importin-α were higher and those of Ntf2 lower than in X. tropicalis extracts. Indeed, when Levy and Heald added active (phosphorylated) importin-α to X. tropicalis extracts they observed an increase in nuclear size. The role of Ntf2 in regulating nuclear size is less straightforward. Nonetheless, X. tropicalis extracts supplemented with both active importin-α and an inhibitor of Ntf2 activity form nuclei that are similar in size to those formed in X. laevis extracts2 (Fig. 1b).\nThat nuclear import affects nuclear size is perhaps not surprising, as a previous paper8 showed that, in the absence of import, the nuclear envelope — which forms around the chromosomes at the end of mitotic cell division — fails to expand. But in showing that, at least in vitro, import is a limiting factor for nuclear growth, Levy and Heald’s report provides a specific step that could be targeted for regulating nuclear size in vivo.\nWhich of the cargoes carried by importin-α are crucial for controlling nuclear size? From an engineering standpoint, enlarging a structure could require an extension of its underlying framework. Whether the nucleus has an internal framework — the ‘nuclear matrix’ — is debatable, but there is no doubt that the nuclear lamina serves as a framework supporting the nuclear envelope. Indeed, Levy and Heald found that the addition of lamin B3, a component of the nuclear lamina, to X. tropicalis extracts resulted in increased nuclear size. Thus, nuclear import may regulate nuclear size through controlling the availability of nuclear-lamina components.\nNeither yeast nor plants have lamins, which raises the question of how general is regulation of nuclear size by lamin import. Whether nuclear import itself affects nuclear size in yeast is unresolved5,6, although at least one study6 found that a prolonged inhibition of nuclear export increases nuclear volume by 50%. It could be, therefore, that nuclear size in yeast and plants also depends on nuclear import, not of lamin but of some other cargo.\nThe cell-free system Levy and Heald describe is remarkably useful for identifying proteins and processes that affect nuclear size. The next step will be to determine how such processes affect nuclear size within the cell, and whether they contribute to the N/C volume ratio. Levy and Heald did address this question by injecting importin-α into developing X. laevis embryos. They observed a transient increase in nuclear size in early stages of development, but whether cell volume is affected in any way remains unknown.\nWhen considering the scaling of nuclear size with cell size, one must take into account the increase not only in volume, but also in surface area4. An influx of material through nuclear import could lead to physical stress that signals for an increase in the surface area of the nuclear envelope. Alternatively, because the nuclear membrane is continuous with that of another organelle, the endoplasmic reticulum, the cell might regulate nuclear size by controlling the amount of endoplasmic-reticulum membrane that is allocated to the nucleus.\nNevertheless, geometry tells us that surface area increases at a slower rate than volume (surface area is a function of the radius squared, whereas volume is a function of the radius cubed). Intriguingly, a recent study9 on the scaling of transcription with cell size in yeast revealed that, whereas expression of most genes increases in proportion to the increase in cell size, the expression of genes encoding cell-surface proteins lags behind. How this size-sensing mechanism works isn’t clear, but it would be interesting to examine whether the abundance of proteins associated with nuclear-envelope expansion is also ‘size-sensitive’.\nLevy and Heald’s results2 uncover a process that affects nuclear size, providing a glimpse into a mechanism that may couple nuclear volume to cell volume. To fully understand the N/C volume ratio, researchers need biological tools — mutants and/or RNAi knockdowns — that perturb this ratio. So to anyone who thinks that all the interesting basic cell-biologi cal questions have been answered, here is one that is still wide open.', ""Importins deliver proteins into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex\nInside your cells, the process of protein synthesis is separated into two compartments. The first half of the job, when DNA is transcribed into RNA, is performed in the nucleus. The second half is then performed outside the nucleus, when ribosomes translate the RNA to construct proteins in the cytoplasm. This separation requires a continuous traffic of molecules: new RNA molecules must be transported out of the nucleus and nuclear proteins, such as newly-synthesized histones or polymerases, must be transported back into the nucleus. Huge tube-shaped nuclear pores act as the highway connecting the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and importins and exportins (collectively known as karyopherins) ferry molecules back and forth through the pore.\nImportins transport thousands of different proteins into the nucleus to perform the many tasks of storing, reading, and repairing the genome. However, it would be far too costly to design a special importin to carry each one inside. Instead, many nuclear proteins are built with a special tag—a short sequence called the nuclear localization signal—that tells the transport machinery to carry the protein into the nucleus. Importins recognize this signal, bind to the protein, and transport it through the nuclear pore.\nThe Import Business\nThe importin complex shown here (built from three separate PDB entries) transports proteins with nuclear localization signals. At the top in blue is importin-beta (PDB entry 1qgk\n). It is the engine of the complex, recognizing nuclear pores and moving through them. It wraps around the end of importin-alpha, shown at the center in green (PDB entry 1ee5\n). Importin-alpha is an adapter molecule that connects importin-beta with the cargo. In this picture, the cargo is nucleoplasmin, shown at the bottom in yellow (PDB entry 1k5j\n), a chaperone protein that is important in nucleosome assembly. Notice how the extended nuclear localization signal of this cargo is gripped by importin-alpha.\nOnce the importin-beta/importin-alpha/cargo complex gets inside the nucleus, the cargo must be released and the importins must be recycled back to the cytoplasm. The Ran protein, shown here in light red, is responsible for releasing the cargo. It binds to importin-beta and causes a significant change in shape, leading to the release of importin-alpha and the cargo. Then, the complex of importin-beta and Ran (shown on the left, PDB entry 2bku)\ntravels back through the pore. Outside, a GTP molecule in Ran (shown in bright red) is cleaved and the Ran dissociates, leaving importin-beta ready to carry the next cargo protein inside. Importin-alpha can't get back to the cytoplasm by itself, so it gets some help from CAS (a nuclear export factor), shown here on the right in purple (PDB entry 1wa5\n). CAS is similar to importin-beta, but moves through the nuclear pore in the opposite direction. It binds to importin-alpha and Ran and carries them out of the nucleus. Then, a similar cleavage of the GTP in Ran releases importin-alpha for another round of transport.\nExploring the Structure\nThe actual mechanisms that importins use to pull molecules through the nuclear pore are still a subject of active debate, but PDB entry 2bpt\ngives some hints of how it might be done. The thousands of proteins that make up the nuclear pore are covered with special amino acid sequences that are flexible and that contain many phenylalanines. One side of importin-beta binds to these special sequences. The structure shown here includes the full importin-beta (in rainbow-colored cylinders) and a few short pieces from the nuclear pore proteins (shown in spheres at the bottom, with the phenylalanine amino acids in red). Notice that the phenylalanines bind in pockets on the outer surface of the importin. Importin-beta may jump from site to site through the nuclear pore, guided by these special sequences.\nAs you take a look at these structures yourself, take a moment to explore the unusual fold of the chain. Importin-beta is folded like a spring, which then wraps into a big spiral that traps its binding partners inside.\n- M. Stewart (2006) Structural basis of the nuclear protein import cycle.

92	I'm trying to learn about soldering and I'm confused about temperature control. What's the difference between cheap and expensive soldering irons for temperature control, and what temperatures should I use for different soldering tasks?	Cheaper soldering irons (like those using 900M tips) have poor temperature control because their sensor is inside the heating element and loosely coupled with the tip, causing 10-20°C variations and delayed heating. For actual soldering tasks, different temperatures are needed: 360-410°C (680-770°F) is typical for stained glass work, with 360°C being better for beginners and slower work, while 410°C works for faster soldering. The temperature needs to be adjusted based on the specific task - higher temperatures (410°C or above) are needed for embedding wire or soldering brass rods, while lower temperatures (360-310°C) are better for decorative soldering and lead came work.	"['Usually a dedicated soldering station is used to control the temperature of a soldering iron, but this time, a PC, a DP832 power source, a DS1054Z oscilloscope, and a Python script were all used together to control a soldering iron.\nWhy use $3k+ lab equipment instead of a $30 soldering station?\nBecause I have a few cheap ($3-$4) soldering iron handles and a bag of fake Hakko 900M tips, but no soldering station for them, and I was curious to see how well these can perform in comparison with the other type of the fake Hakko tips that I have, the T12 series.\nT12 type are definitely better then 900M type. T12 are also five to ten times more expensive then 900M, but how worst the 900M series can be? Does the 900M deserve their space on a workbench?\nThere are some very cheap soldering iron handles available as spare parts. They usually work with 900M type tips, the heating element has 50W at 24V, and the temperature sensor is a 40uV/*C type K thermocouple integrated into the heating element. Mine were Gordak type handles.\nThese cheap soldering irons use Hakko 900M series type of tips, but despite their similar heating element and similar soldering tips, the temperature sensor is different between the Hakko and the clones. Hakko uses an RTD, while the rest of the other producers are using a K type thermocouple.\nThe total cost for a non-Hakko complete handle with one tip included and free shipping is about 3-4 USD, and a pack of 10 soldering tips is about 2-3 USD with free shipping.\nTo test these soldering irons, an adjustable power source (Rigol DP832) and an oscilloscope (Rigol DS1054Z) were used. Both the source and the scope have LXI, meaning they are remote controllable from a PC via SCPI commands sent over LAN (for acronyms please see the end section, ‘Acronyms’).\nThe oscilloscope probe is connected to the soldering irons thermocouple. The power source is connected to the heating element of the soldering iron.\nHow it works\nThe PC runs a Python script that sends commands to the oscilloscope and to the power source, in order to implement a PID temperature control loop.\nTemperature can be changed in steps of five degrees Celsius by pressing the Up/Down arrow keys. Python source code is available at https://github.com/RoGeorge/SCPI_solder_station.\nThe PC reads the thermocoulpe voltage from the oscilloscope, calculates the thermocouple temperature and sends commands to adjust the voltage of the power source that feeds the heating element. The temperature is kept stable enough to make a first impression about the heating power of these kind of soldering irons.\nThis solution was implemented mostly for testing purposes, to see how well various soldering irons and tips performs. It can be used for real soldering too, but not recommended.\nIf something goes wrong, this setup might become a fire hazard.\nJust in case you want to replicate it, do not leave it unattended.\n– Does this setup works?\n– Does these soldering handles needs a PID control loop?\n– No. For 900M soldering tips, the sensor is too loosely coupled with the tip. The sensor is inside the heating element, so keeping the heating element at a constant temperature does not imply the soldering tip will stay at a constant temperature too.\n– Can the tip temperature be properly calibrated?\n– No. The handle temperature can easily vary within 10-20*C from the room temperature, but there is no cold junction compensation for the thermocouple inside the handle. Assuming you measure the room temperature, and the sensor is perfectly coupled with the tip, the temperature offset can still vary in a range of 20*C from the set temperature, depending of the handle temperature variations.\n– Can these handles be used for occasional/hobby soldering?\n– Can these handles be used for heavy work or precision soldering?\n– No. The soldering tip arrives at the working temperature only 10-20 seconds later after the sensor temperature has stabilized, which makes any temperature control pretty useless. It seems that the 900M soldering is based mostly on the heat accumulated into the metal of the tip, but the temperature sensor is in the heating element, so the tip can not be maintained at a precise temperature during soldering. Also, no matter which tip model from the 900M series I choose, it can not provide enough heat to solder on a big ground plane.\nRTD – Resistance Temperature Detector\nPC – Personal Computer\nLXI – LAN Extensions for Instrumentation\nSCPI – Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments\nLAN – Local Area Network\nPID – Proportional-Integral-Derivative', ""Stained Glass Soldering Temperature\nStained glass soldering temperature is something I get asked about a LOT. Here are answers to common questions.\nStained Glass Soldering Temperature Questions\nTemperatures For The Hakko FX-601\nThe temperature you need for soldering a bead with the Hakko FX-601 is normally between 360C and 410C (680-770F).\nI say ‘normally‘ as it depends on a couple of factors including tip size, solder type and how quickly you move the iron along the seam. Those who are quicker have their stained glass soldering temperature set at 410C but if you solder more slowly you need to reduce the temperature to 360C.\n360C is a good temperature for starters as it gives you more time.\nHow Tip Size Affects Stained Glass Soldering Temperature\nSome say the size of the iron tip is more important than either the wattage or the temperature. My feeling is that they work in tandem and all feed into the optimum soldering experience. The most important thing is consistent temperatures and no cold spots.\nThe Hakko FX-601 comes with a small tip – 3/16″ – which is good for decorative soldering and delicate operations but not so good for running a bead. I’d suggest buying 1/4″ and 3/8″ for more control over your beaded seams.\nYou don’t have to worry that the larger tip will cause your solder to spill over. It sounds obvious but the width of the bead depends on the outer edges of the foil joint. The solder is not going spread out onto the glass if you use a wider tip.\nHow To Use The Iron Tip To Control The Temperature\nThe front edge of the tip is the coolest area, next is the side edge, the hottest area is the flat sides. You can control the melting solder by how high off the work you keep the iron.\nIf you want more heat change the angle of the iron tip – hold it flatter so that more of the iron tip is exposed to the solder. Do the reverse for a cooler iron, hold the tip more vertical (giving less of the iron tip to heat the solder) and the process will slow down. When you get super quick and confident you can turn the temperature up. You just have to move faster!\nYou’ll find the optimum temperature for YOU by experimenting. It will depend on your soldering speed and what you’re actually doing with the solder.\nWhat Stained Glass Soldering Temperature To Use For Different Tasks\nDon’t expect to set the heat dial and forget about it. Your soldering iron temperature needs to be tweaked in response to the job in hand. You’ll learn by experience what works for you but here are a few pointers:\nSet the temperature hotter (410C or even above) for these type of stained glass tasks:\nEmbedding wire, soldering brass rods into a lampshade, removing excess solder off a vase cap. Just remember to turn it down again afterwards otherwise melting of lead came could happen!\nIf the solder isn’t flowing and you’re not achieving a nice bead then try turning the iron up. I’d practice on some foiled pieces of scrap first if you’re inexperienced.\nSet the iron temperature lower (360-310C) for the following:\nDecorative soldering and soldering lead came, free-form solder art.\nTemperatures To Use For Different Solder Types\n50/50 can be heated to a higher temperature than 60/40 solder.\nLead-free solder doesn’t flow as nicely as 60/40 or 50/50. It reacts more like 50/50 and takes a lot of heat to make it flow nicely. When running a bead it’s better to work slowly, allowing the solder to heat up a little more. With practice and patience you can run a very nice solder bead with lead-free solder.\nHeat And Soldering Irons\nYou can see from the above pointers that there are various factors feeding into the stained glass soldering temperature question! Soldering irons are the final factor.\nThe good thing about the Hakko FX-601 is that the wide range of temperatures it offers means that it can be used for all sorts, from electronics to stained glass repairs.\nWeller irons achieve temperature control via a magnet in the (replaceable) tip which switches the iron on and off at the preset temperature. Two preset temperatures are available but you need to swap out the tip to change the temperature. These pertain to the number at the end of the tip – 7 = 700F, 8 = 800F.\nHakko uses modern electronics to provide an adjustable temperature. This is very useful as it can be easily adjusted it to suit the type of work you’re doing (copper-foil or lead) and the particular application.\nThe important thing to remember is that one temperature doesn’t work for all scenarios. I frequently adjust the stained glass soldering temperature as I work. The way it “feels” is more important than the actual temperature.\nhttps://everythingstainedglass.com/hakko-fx-601temperature-questionhttps://everythingstainedglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/212530_10-1.jpghttps://everythingstainedglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/212530_10-1-150x150.jpgFAQStained Glass ToolsCornerstone,Soldering Copper Foil,Soldering Lead Came,Soldering ToolsStained glass soldering temperature is something I get asked about a LOT.

93	How can game theory help with negotiations in both family situations and professional settings, and what are the key principles that make negotiations successful in both contexts?	Game theory helps in both family and professional contexts as a science of strategic thinking. In family settings, it offers practical solutions like the 'I Cut, You Pick' technique for fair division between children, and guides parents in handling scenarios like TV remote control disputes through auction-based approaches. For professional settings, negotiation principles apply across personal, business, and public situations, involving a blend of perceptual, persuasive, analytical, and interpersonal skills. Success in both contexts depends on understanding fairness, strategic thinking, and the ability to work toward mutually beneficial outcomes. The same skills that help parents negotiate with children can be applied to business negotiations, as both require careful consideration of others' interests and strategic decision-making to reach satisfactory agreements.	"['In 1944, the economist, physicist, mathematician and computer scientist John von Neumann published a book that became a sensation, at least among mathematicians – Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. Written with a colleague, Oskar Morgenstern, this volume of nearly biblical proportions is so dense and littered with mathematics that only a game-theory specialist could understand it – and some of them struggled.\nEven so, game theory has spread far beyond the boundaries of mathematics to become a valuable tool for explaining human behaviour. It’s used by diplomats, biologists, psychologists, economists and many others in business, research and global politics.\nGame theory can also be a useful tool for parents. Children can be tough negotiators, as parents know. And the stakes are high: the outcome of negotiations between parents and their children can affect a family’s happiness and the children’s futures.\nDespite its sometimes complicated mathematics, game theory is simple to explain: it’s the science of strategic thinking. Game theory does not cover all games, but only those in which an opponent’s or negotiator’s strategy affects your next move. It has nothing to do with solitaire, in which your ‘opponent’ – a deck of cards – has no strategy. Chess, on the other hand, is a beautiful example of a game-theory game, where two crafty strategists are continually trying to anticipate and block the other’s likely moves.\nEncouraging cooperation between children is a wonderful game-theory example. Some years ago, Robert Axelrod, a game theorist at the University of Michigan, asked the following question: when should a person cooperate, and when should a person be selfish, in an ongoing interaction with another? He set up a computer competition among game theorists, and he was astonished at what he found. The most sophisticated solutions failed to beat something called tit-for-tat, in which each player responds by doing what the other did. If the first cooperates, so does the second. And so on and so forth. If the first does not cooperate, neither does the second.\nAuctions are yet another subject of game-theory research, and useful for parents. Suppose your children all want to control the TV remote. Set up what’s known as a sealed-bid, second-price auction. Each secretly writes down what he or she is willing to pay. When the papers are opened, the highest bidder wins the right to buy the remote at $1 plus the second-highest bid. It’s far superior to a coin flip because the person who most wanted the remote got it.\nGame-theory deals depend upon fairness and, often, so do dealings between parents and children. Children are consumed with the idea of fairness. If a candy bar meant to be shared by two isn’t broken exactly in half, the one who gets the smaller piece will howl. Game theory offers parents a way around this.\nSuppose you break the candy bar into two pieces that are almost the same size, but not quite. And your children can see that they are different. You could do something that seems eminently fair: toss a coin. Your children can recognise the fairness in tossing a coin; nobody controls the outcome. What could be simpler? You toss the coin into the air. The winner gets the slightly bigger piece of candy; the loser gets the other. But something changes when the coin hits the floor. The winner now believes the decision was completely fair; the loser demands that he get a do-over. To him, it doesn’t seem fair at all.\nThe problem here turns on the meaning of fairness. The coin toss is fair, as we usually understand that. So what is the problem? In game-theory terms, the outcome was not envy-free. The loser desperately envies the winner. It’s not a very satisfactory solution for you or for one of your two children.\nHere’s a way to get a much better outcome. Suppose you have the remains of a birthday cake you want to divide between your two children. You have the same problem as you did with the candy: it’s difficult to cut two equal pieces. So you turn to the technique we call ‘I Cut, You Pick’: your daughter cuts the cake, and your son picks the half he wants.\nYour daughter will be as careful as possible to cut the cake into identical halves, because if she doesn’t, she will get the smaller one. Because it might not be possible to cut the cake into two exact halves, you designate your son to make the cut the next time you have cake. And you continue to take turns. This is fair, and game theory shows that people will recognise it to be fair. It’s far superior to the brutal coin toss.\nNow let’s make it a bit more difficult. The cake is half chocolate and half vanilla. Your son loves chocolate; your daughter prefers vanilla. If your daughter cuts the cake in a way that gives each of them half of the chocolate and half of the vanilla, the cut is fair. Each piece is the same size. But neither child is entirely happy, because each got some cake they didn’t want. Turn the cut the other way – and divide it into a chocolate half for your son and a vanilla half for your daughter, and both are far happier. Both cuts were fair, but the cut into chocolate and vanilla halves demonstrated what’s called Pareto optimality. Each was not only fairly treated, but also got the best possible outcome.\nGame theory can also be used to help the family to decide where to go on vacation, what to have for dinner, how siblings can learn to cooperate without mum or dad’s intervention – and many other problems that routinely turn up in the family.\nGame theory is a gift of evolution, which sculpted us to behave according to precise and illuminating mathematical rules. We use it all the time. Game-theory parenting is a way to help parents explicitly understand the rules and reflect on what the rules say about raising healthy and successful children. An understanding of game theory helps us become the parents we were meant to be. Parents and children might not be able to make their way through von Neumann’s often opaque book, but they don’t have to. They are all game theorists already. All they need are a few good rules. And that’s what game theory provides.', 'Negotiation refers to the process of interacting in order to advance individual interests through joint action. Contrary to what you might think, negotiations are not confined to the professional world; we often negotiate in our personal lives. The principles that guide successful negotiations in world politics are equally important in the business world as well as our personal lives. In fact, almost every transaction with another individual involves negotiation. As you will learn in this course, negotiation, conflict resolution, and relationship management are complex processes. Successful practitioners possess and apply a blend of perceptual, persuasive, analytical, and interpersonal skills that you will examine carefully in this course.\nIn the ever-changing environment of modern business, firms start and grow by virtue of successful negotiations and by developing long-term relationships among two, three, or more parties involved, either directly or indirectly, in various business processes. By the same token, such relationships can break down due to ineffective negotiating behavior and conflict management approaches. Such breakdowns can also occur because of misunderstandings and misperceptions of the other parties\' positions and interests.\nThis course will start with the conceptual framework of negotiations as it applies to all areas of negotiation in both the public and private sectors. As the course progresses, you will focus on business negotiation skills and strategies designed to help you maintain healthy business relationships. Specifically, you will learn about the concepts, processes, strategies, and ethical issues related to negotiation as well as appropriate conduct in multicultural business contexts. You will also learn to better understand the theory, processes, and practices of negotiation, conflict resolution, and relationship management so that you can be a more effective negotiator in a wide variety of situations. If you take advantage of the opportunities this course offers, you will be more comfortable and more productive managing negotiations as well as professional and personal relationships.\nYou will examine strategies that are effective as well as those that are not. If a strategy works, you will determine how well it works and discuss alternatives to the less effective approaches. You will also identify various patterns of negotiation and conflict resolution in different national and cultural contexts, and you will gain an understanding of the influence of national and cultural variations in the decision-making process.\nBy the end of this course, you will have developed an understanding of the principles, strategies, and tactics of effective negotiation, conflict resolution, and relationship management and enhanced your ability to assess the impact of interpersonal styles, personality, culture, and other variables that influence negotiation.\nUnit 1: What Is Negotiation?\nNegotiations (also referred to as ""bargaining”) take place in a range of contexts. While the objectives of this course focus on business negotiations, you will learn that negotiation principles apply to a vast and diverse range of personal, business, and public situations. You could find yourself negotiating a weekend curfew with your teenager or perhaps a new home purchase. In business you might negotiate a purchasing contract with a supplier, a new project with employees, or a merger between two major corporations. In the public sector, you might find yourself in the middle of a negotiation on anything from a new school board policy, the content of a new bill with your Congressional representative, or an international trade agreement with China. Regardless of the context, the basic principles of negotiation are the same. Whether you are involved in a friendly exchange or a high-stakes conflict resolution, you are essentially in a two-way communication for the purpose of reaching an agreement. The same skills that diplomats use to negotiate international peace agreements will help you become a more effective business negotiator.\nCompleting this unit should take you approximately 7 hours.\nUnit 2: Negotiation Strategies and Biases\nAccording to the Stanford Graduate School of Business, ""Successful bargaining means looking for positives in every possible circumstance.” You cannot accomplish this without careful planning. The product of the careful negotiation planning is your negotiation strategy. The strategy you use in a negotiation is heavily reliant on the outcome that you desire. An understanding of the principles, strategies, and tactics used by effective negotiators will help you become more confident in your ability to choose a negotiation strategy that will help you accomplish your goals. Perhaps more important than planning an appropriate strategy is to become knowledgeable about what motivates us and our counterparts to make decisions. In this unit, you will learn about various biases that affect our decision making and how to use this knowledge to overcome obstacles to clear, objective, and effective negotiations. In subsequent units, you will learn how to apply these concepts to specific negotiation theories in order to add or create value for all participants to the negotiation.\nCompleting this unit should take you approximately 13 hours.\nUnit 3: Processes and Phases of Negotiation\nAs you have progressed through learning materials in Units 1 and 2, you have learned that regardless of the inevitability of conflict in your life, you can choose from an array of negotiation approaches to manage the conflict effectively. In this unit, you are going to consider some basic principles from time-tested negotiation theory. You will explore both competitive and collaborative negotiation strategies. In addition, you will learn about four distinct phases in the negotiation process and how appropriate implementation of each phase will lead to effective negotiation. By the end of this unit, you will see that you do not always have to settle for your piece of the pie. Using a successful negotiation strategy can make the pie bigger for all concerned.\nCompleting this unit should take you approximately 15 hours.\nUnit 4: Managing Different Types of Business Negotiations\nIn this unit, you will learn about factors that are important for negotiating in an organizational context. Business negotiations can include negotiating your salary, ironing out contracts with your company\'s suppliers, settling contract issues with a labor union, or negotiating a merger. You will consider how to negotiate as the underdog in business-to-business transactions. Transformational negotiations can go beyond providing a win-win solution to a problem; they can help you build alliances. By the end of this unit, you will no longer look across the negotiation table and see an adversary; rather, you will learn to regard your counterpart as a partner engaged in a collaborative effort in building a long-term strategic alliance.\nCompleting this unit should take you approximately 14 hours.\nUnit 5: Conflict Resolution\nPerhaps you feel that conflict is an inevitable part of life. If you agree, you are not alone. Have you have ever driven a car in rush hour traffic? Have you ever been faced with an angry customer (or been that angry customer)? Are your coworkers or employees less than perfect 100 percent of the time? Any of these scenarios can result in conflict. Unless it is managed properly, conflict can damage an organization and destroy interpersonal relationships.\nIn this unit, you will learn how conflict can be a positive influence if it is managed properly. In fact, conflict that is effectively resolved can help personal and professional relationships grow and strengthen. You will explore some alternatives to the potential lose-lose outcome of conflict. By the end of this unit, you will be familiar with ways to diagnose conflict and apply new strategies to solving the problems associated with conflict.\nCompleting this unit should take you approximately 11 hours to complete.\nUnit 6: International and Cross Cultural Negotiation\nNegotiating across national and cultural boundaries raises additional challenges for participants. All of us are a product of the culture and geographical areas in which we were raised and now live. Culture creates biases in our perceptions, motivations, interests, and strategies, which may give rise to a host of conflicts in the negotiating process. Aspects of culture that may affect negotiations include such things as language, dialect, societal norms, business etiquette, religion, values, cuisine, hygiene, comfort, and personal preferences. International negotiations are also often impacted by historical events, nationalism, legal restrictions, tariffs, geographic distance, topographic conditions, multilateral alliances, and political conflicts.\nCompleting this unit should take you approximately 23 hours.\nOptional Course Evaluation Survey\nPlease take a few moments to provide some feedback about this course at the link below.

94	biodiversity hotspots comparison arctic vs great barrier reef species concentration	The Arctic tundra has relatively lower species concentration, supporting animals like musk ox, caribou, and arctic fox, while biodiversity hotspots like the Great Barrier Reef are much richer in species - coral reefs, though occupying less than 1% of the ocean floor, house more than 25% of marine life.	"['For millions of years, giants graced the murky depths of China’s Yangtze River. Known as Chinese paddlefish (Psephurus gladius), they could reach 7 meters (23 feet) in length. The fish used its swordlike snouts to sense electrical perturbations made by smaller prey. It would then snatch them in the dark.\nBut no more.\nThe species was declared extinct in 2019. It fell victim to overfishing and habitat loss.\nAnd it is not alone. Nature is in trouble. And few spots are exempt. Species are imperiled from winding rivers to windswept tundra to the dense tropical forests of Borneo.\nMore and more, habitat loss and human activities threaten the world’s plants and animals. One study estimates a million species face extinction within decades. Their loss is forever. Gone will be 1 million distinct answers to the basic question of how to make a living on planet Earth.\nEarth’s life is diverse. But that biodiversity is shrinking. The scale of the potential loss of species has many people and governments worried. Nature has inherent value. But there are direct impacts on people’s lives, too.\nThe natural world makes Earth livable. It drives key processes. These include cleaning the air, filtering water, cycling carbon dioxide and pollinating crops. To stem this biodiversity loss, governments are working on ambitious plans. Those plans would set aside more space for natural habitats. Nature, after all, needs room to flourish.\nOne plan now being discussed would protect 30 percent of land and sea across the globe by 2030. That number would reach 50 percent by 2050. Experts hope this will revive ecosystems and safeguard the diversity of Earth’s species.\nBut is 30 percent — or even 50 percent — enough? And enough for what exactly? Will it slow when and how many species go extinct? Will it protect everything that’s possible to protect?\nOne place to start is by preserving what’s left. Humans have altered more than three-fourths of Earth’s surface. There are 14 biomes (BY-oams) on land, such as tropical rainforest, tundra and desert. But in eight of those biomes, less than 10 percent of undeveloped wilderness remains. Researchers reported this in a 2016 study in Current Biology.\nMany species have already vanished. Besides the Chinese paddlefish there is the brilliantly blue Spix’s macaw. It’s a type of parrot. It has not been seen in Brazil’s forests since 2000. These are just two of many missing species.\nAt least for marine ecosystems, there’s research to support the 30 percent target as a starting point. There’s less firm evidence for land. But “the scientific consensus is telling us that we need [even] more ambitious targets,” says Oscar Venter. He’s a conservation scientist in Canada. He works at the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George. Targeting 30 percent of Earth’s land regions for protection by 2030, he says, is not what the best science says. It’s more a reflection of what might be possible to get governments to agree on.\nHow much is enough?\nDeciding how much of nature needs to be protected depends on the goal. That might be keeping a specific animal from going extinct. Or preserving a unique ecosystem. Or ensuring the future of a fish that people eat. Different goals require different types of protected areas.\nHow big to make a protected area “is important,” says Samantha Murray. “But it’s not the only thing that matters.” Murray is an ocean law and policy expert. She works at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. It’s part of the University of California, San Diego.\nWhen trying to prevent a specific animal species from going extinct, biologists first try to figure out the smallest share of habitat it needs to persist. Wide-ranging species, such as North American caribou, need about 10 percent of their natural range to be protected. Rarer species in microhabitats, such as a single valley or a specific island, “typically need much more,” Venter says. They might even need all of their remaining range to be protected.\nFiguring out such numbers is tricky. That’s especially true for little-studied species. Plus, it can be hard to design a protected area that meets the diverse needs of all the species within it.\nAnother approach focuses on protecting the rare slices of land and sea that brim with huge numbers of species. These are so-called biodiversity hot spots. They include Australia’s Great Barrier Reef and the Amazon River Basin. Parts of the U.S. Great Smoky Mountains are another hot spot. Protecting such areas will save many different animals and plants at once.\nFinally, some biologists argue for preserving vast tracts of wilderness not yet altered by human activity. The great boreal forests of Canada and Russia don’t harbor as many species as the Amazon. However, they do hold up to a third of the globe’s terrestrial carbon. That makes them a key part of the Earth process of pulling climate-warming carbon dioxide out of the air. Protecting such areas are crucial for solving both the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis, says Eric Dinerstein. He’s a conservation biologist at RESOLVE. It’s a conservation group based in Washington, D.C.\nDinerstein and others argue that the situation is now so dire that all approaches are needed to save what’s left. In short, he says: “We need to do it all.”\nThat same urgency is reflected in the recent flurry of proposals by scientists. Protecting half the planet would save 80 percent of the planet’s biodiversity, concluded biologist E.O. Wilson in his 2016 book Half-Earth. Dinerstein and his colleagues laid out a similar plan in the June 2017 BioScience. It calls for preserving half the planet in a way that covers a diversity of ecosystems.\nVenter of the University of Northern British Columbia and his colleagues came up with a bit smaller target. They figure biodiversity can be largely saved with protecting about 44 percent of wild areas. This team arrived at its number in a study posted at bioRxiv.org in November 2019. These researchers tweaked boundaries around existing protected areas. The global patchwork of protected areas they propose is big enough to preserve the 28,594 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, dragonflies and crustaceans for which the researchers have data. It also includes some of the world’s areas richest in biodiversity.\nBig goals, such as protecting 30 percent by 2030, are important for getting people around the world to act. “But ambitious targets are only good,” Venter says, “if countries are strategic in where they place protected areas.”\nProblems with big targets\nNot all biologists even agree that setting such targets is the best way to go. “A big single number [alone] isn’t going to help,” says Stuart Pimm. “And it misses what we need to do to protect biodiversity.” Pimm is a conservation biologist at Duke University in Durham, N.C. It’s better to focus on the most threatened biodiversity hot spots, he argues.\nMuch of Pimm’s work focuses on connecting forest fragments with natural corridors along which species like to travel. This can increase an animal’s habitat even when protecting lots more land isn’t feasible. Connecting fragmented habitats can boost biodiversity, research shows. And this is true for both animals and plants.\nBiodiversity also is not evenly distributed around the globe. Coral reefs, for instance, account for less than 1 percent of the ocean floor. They house, however, more than 25 percent of marine life. So asking all countries to aim for the same goals might be not work well. Some countries may need to protect more than 30 percent of their territory. Others may need less.\n“For instance, recent research has shown that we probably need 80 to 90 percent of the Amazon intact,” Pimm says. Otherwise, the rainforest may quickly transform into a drier savannah. And that would threaten the water cycle for all of South America.\nAlso, countries rushing to meet their goals might only choose to protect what is easiest. “Areas that are too cold, too hot or too remote” to have farms or businesses are easy targets. But they’re not always areas that need protecting most, Pimm says.\nThe United States could get to 30 percent pretty quickly by preserving sparsely populated deserts or high plains in the West. Most of the country’s biodiversity, though, is in the southeast. For instance, more unique salamander species are crawling around Appalachian streams and lakes than anywhere else in the world. And right now, much of their range remains unprotected. Similarly, protecting most of icy Greenland would meet the European Union’s 30 percent obligation. But little lives there.\nWhat does protection mean, anyway?\nProtected areas will need to be policed. And people who conduct illegal fishing, tree felling, hunting or pollution will need to be prosecuted. Unless that happens, protections don’t work. Conservation goals won’t be met.\nPlaces designated only on paper as protected “can give the illusion of protection where none really exists,” says Murray. She’s the Scripps ocean law and policy expert. “We could create the largest marine protected area in the world. But if we just walk away, it doesn’t do anyone any good.”\nHaving fully protected national parks across 30 percent of the globe is probably not something that will work, conservationists say. But there are other ways to meet these goals across the land and sea.\n“Indigenous lands in Canada are a great example,” Venter says. These lands allow for hunting and gathering activities. The large-scale clearing of habitat, however, is banned. And there is evidence that this approach works. Indigenous lands in Canada, Brazil and Australia had similar, or slightly higher, levels of vertebrate diversity than non-Indigenous protected areas in the same countries. Researchers reported this in November 2019 in Environmental Science & Policy.\nThe quarter of Earth’s land now owned, used or occupied by Indigenous communities holds about 80 percent of Earth’s biodiversity. That’s according to a 2008 World Bank report. So empowering these groups to manage their lands could help countries achieve their targets, Venter suggests.\nCountries around the world were supposed to meet in China this past fall to work out the details of new conservation targets for the next decade. But like many things in 2020, that meeting got cancelled because of COVID-19. It’s now due to take place later this spring.\nAleksandar Rankovic works at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations. It’s in Paris, France. He hopes the COVID-19 pandemic serves as a wake-up call about the importance of keeping wild places intact. Recent research has linked deforestation to a rise in diseases initially transmitted from animals to people. COVID-19 is one such disease.\n“The fact that we have a biodiversity-related global pandemic … is quite powerful as a symbol,” he says. Having governments reach a deal about how much to conserve “could be a big moment” in preventing a global extinction crisis.', 'Northernmost point on Earth, surrounding the north pole and including the northern edges of Europe, Asia, North America and Greenland.\nThe arctic is a habitat that is made up of almost no land at all. It is mostly frozen ocean. The ice pack of the arctic is about 9 feet thick (3 M). In the summer the polar ice pack drifts in the ocean under 24-hour daylight. In the winter it freezes solid, in 24-hour darkness. The arctic has no mountains, but includes the North Pole, the northernmost point on earth. The tallest spot is at sea level, an elevation of 0.\nThe part of the arctic that is land is called the tundra and includes some northern islands and the northern edges of Europe, Asia, North America and Greenland. The arctic tundra has no trees and the ground is frozen almost all year long with permafrost. The top layer of the soil, above the permafrost, does melt in the summer and grows hearty plants in the short 2-month growing season. Because the frozen permafrost sits below the soil, there is no place for melted snow to go, so the arctic tundra stays wet and boggy in the summer months. This makes it hard to walk on and a perfect habitat for water-born insects like mosquitoes. The mosquito season on the tundra may be short, but it is fierce!\nMany animals have adapted for life on the tundra including the: musk ox, caribou, lemming, arctic fox, arctic hare, tern, ptarmigan, snowy owl, arctic wolf, narwhal, walrus, and polar bear. Some animals like the polar bear survive the long, cold winters by hibernating. Others, such as the caribou, arctic wolf, fox and musk ox develop thick winter coats against the cold. The caribou use their sharp hooves to scrape away snow and ice to get to the grass underneath. Thay also have wide, hooves that help keep them above the snow, like snowshoes, so they can move across the tundra quickly. Many animals, such as ptarmigan and snowshoe hare, turn white in winter to blend in with the snowly landscape. The arctic ocean animals have thick layers of blubber to keep them warm in the frigid water. Animals have to be well adapted for survival in this extreme habitat.\nThe arctic tundra is a fierce habitat for plants too. They have to be able to survive long months of freezing temperatures, winds that dry them out in the winter and boggy melting permafrost conditions in the summer. Plants of the arctic include: arctic willow (shrub), arctic poppy, moss, cushion plants (which grow tight and low to the ground), like saxifrage, and moss campion. Another important food source for caribou that grow on the Arctic tundra are lichens. Lichens are plant-like but are actually a combination of fungus and algae working together to survive in some pretty extreme habitats.\nCritical Thing Questions:\n1. Name two physical adaptations that help animals survive on the Arctic tundra.\n2. Can you think of things humans have made to mimic the physical adaptations of the caribou for walking across the winter tundra?\n3. Describe two summer features of the tundra that make it a challenging place to live.\nWhen you research information you must cite the reference.

95	earliest pictures animals ancient egypt	The ancient rock carvings discovered near the Nile included scenes of various animals. These depicted people and dogs herding cattle, as well as a cluster of animals including two mythical part-lion beasts. The carvings also showed familiar native African species, specifically two ostriches, an ibex, and a bull.	"['The oldest-known representations of a pharaoh are carved on rocks near the Nile River in southern Egypt, researchers report.\nThe carvings were first observed and recorded in the 1890s, but only rediscovered in 2008. In them, a white-crowned figure travels in ceremonial processions and on sickle-shaped boats, perhaps representing an early tax-collecting tour of Egypt.\nThe scenes place the age of the carvings between 3200 B.C. and 3100 B.C., researchers report in the December issue of the journal Antiquity. During that time, Egypt was transitioning into the dynastic rule of the pharaohs.\n""It\'s really the end of prehistory and the beginning of history,"" in Egypt, study researcher Maria Gatto told LiveScience.\nScenes of a ruler\nGatto, a Yale University researcher, led the archaeologists who rediscovered the site in 2008. Archaeologist Archibald Sayce first sketched the carvings, found at the village Nag el-Hamdulab, in the 1890s, but the only record of Sayce\'s discovery was a partial illustration published in a book. [ See Images of the Egypt Carvings ]\nThe site was then forgotten until the 1960s, when Egyptian archaeologist Labib Habachi took photographs of the carvings, which he never published. It wasn\'t until one of these photos resurfaced in 2008 that Gatto and her team started searching for the site, which many people assumed had been destroyed in the interim.\nSome of the carvings have indeed been vandalized since the 1960s, but Gatto and her team found the etched rocks in a natural amphitheater west of Nag el-Hamdulab. They then compared the carvings to Habachi\'s 1960s photographs.\nThere are seven carvings scattered throughout the area, and many are tableaus of boats flanked by prisoners. One of the most extensive carvings shows five boats, one of which houses the white-crowned pharaoh, his fan-bearer and two standard-bearers. Falcon and bull insignia on the pharaoh\'s boat symbolize royalty, further emphasized by the four men with ropes standing alongside that boat, likely towing it along the Nile.\nA hieroglyph labels this scene a ""nautical following,"" a likely reference to the following of Horus, Gatto said. In this periodic royal jaunt across Egypt, the pharaoh cemented power and collected taxes. Thus, not only do the carvings represent the oldest known vision of a pharaoh, they may also show the oldest Egyptian tax campaign.\nScience news from NBCNews.com\nOther carvings include a scene of people and dogs herding cattle and a cluster of animals, two of them apparently some mythical part-lion beasts. The other animals are familiar native African species, including two ostriches, an ibex and a bull. Another scene shows the brewing and drinking of beer, perhaps a reference to a festival.\nThe style of the carvings and hieroglyphics place the creation of the images around 3200 B.C. to 3100 B.C., Gatto said. This would have been the reign of Narmer, the first pharaoh to unify Upper and Lower Egypt.\nBased on the symbols of power and control in the carvings, Gatto and her colleagues believe the artwork came from the first part of Narmer\'s reign, before he unified both parts of Egypt.\n""It seems that for Narmer it was important first to settle the situation in the South, to control the South, and then apparently move to the North, and at that time he unified Egypt and we have the first dynasty,"" Gatto said.\nThe next step for researchers, Gatto said, is to protect the site. That presents a challenge, not only because of the carvings\' outdoor location, but also because of recent political upheaval in Egypt.\n- Image Gallery: Amazing Egyptian Discoveries\n- In Photos: A Look Inside an Egyptian Mummy\n- Gallery: Europe\'s Oldest Rock Art\n© 2012 LiveScience.com.

96	I've heard that AI can help improve company culture and engagement, but what are both the potential benefits and the cybersecurity concerns that need to be considered?	AI can help improve company culture and engagement by enabling better communication and personalized content delivery to employees, which is crucial since 69% of employees were actively disengaged as of 2019. When content is more relevant, employees feel more included and important to the organization. However, there are significant cybersecurity concerns to address. Organizations must avoid several key mistakes: they need to understand how AI makes recommendations, assess vendor-provided AI models thoroughly, conduct independent security testing, and ensure they have staff with both AI and cybersecurity expertise. Additionally, while AI can automate certain tasks, it's important not to expect too much transformation at once. Organizations should implement AI gradually and carefully, as early cybersecurity AI may create a false sense of security, and hackers are increasingly using AI for attacks.	['What is Employee Engagement?\nEmployee engagement is a measure of how committed and involved an employee is at work, and is a key part of the employee’s relationship with the organization they work for. The number one driver of engagement is when an employee feels like their manager and leaders care about them.\nBut engagement is not the same as employee satisfaction, which is a measure of how content an employee is at work and with their organization. This term has become a common area of interest for organizations as it relates to many other important factors to business success, including employee retention, productivity, and even workplace safety.\nWhy Employee Engagement Matters\nEmployee engagement is important for many reasons. Unfortunately, most organizations misunderstand its importance and focus solely on engagement when they should also focus on things like employee access, employee experience, and employee satisfaction. These three other factors are key influences on how engaged an employee is at work.\nBut employee engagement matters because it indicates when an employee is actively engaged in their work or workplace culture. Although it is equally as important to focus on an employee’s job performance, engaged employees also actively participate in company culture and help drive culture. Research from Gallup has also shown that it is tied to many other critical business outcomes that clearly demonstrate the return on investment (ROI) of increased engagement.\nGallup Research on Employee Engagement\nGallup has conducted extensive research on this topic and its impacts on a company. In Gallup’s Employee Engagement Meta-Analysis, they found that when engagement improves, this results in improved employee performance. They found that better engagement led to 41% lower absenteeism, 17% higher productivity, 58% fewer patient safety incidents, and 70% fewer safety incidents. Improved employee experience also leads to an increase in quality with 40% fewer defects and 10% higher customer ratings. Employee engagement is positively correlated with profit as well with 21% higher profitability and 20% higher sales when employees are engaged. And highly engaged employees turnover less often.\nHow Do You Measure Employee Engagement?\nMeasuring employee engagement is often a difficult task because there are many different definitions of what it is. Many organizations use an annual employee engagement survey to measure engagement. These surveys are often composed of questions that help the organization measure eNPS (or employee net promoter score), employee satisfaction, and employee commitment to the organization.\nBut there are more ways to measure engagement. Many internal communications professionals will track engagement on internal messages. This includes tracking likes, comments, social shares, and general channel usage (e.g. logins and session duration). This helps understand which employees are using tools regularly and who are willing to go out of their way to engage on a message. That said, just because an employee doesn’t engage with content does not necessarily mean they are disengaged employees. Measuring content engagement is just one input that can be analyzed when assessing employee engagement.\nHow Do You Improve Employee Engagement?\nImproving staff engagement requires a strategy that looks beyond vanity metrics like content engagement. To improve this metric, you have to do more than improve content quality. A common trend in the workplace is to look to improve culture and engage employees with things like pool tables, events, or other workplace perks. But the truth is, that improving engagement requires holistically improving the employee experience. Here’s why.\nWhen you improve employee experience, you increase employee satisfaction. When employees are satisfied and have a supportive, inclusive, and positive work experience, employee engagement will go up.\nSo, how do you improve the employee experience? It starts with an employee listening strategy to collect employee feedback through things like employee surveys or focus groups. We also recommend measuring regularly and conducting employee engagement surveys to keep a finger on the pulse at your organization. To improve employee experience, you need to go beyond wants like fun workplace perks and focus on employee needs. What tools or information are they lacking to get their jobs done? Are their managers effective communicators and coaches? Are you providing them with a basic living wage and benefits package? Do employees feel connected to one another and respected? Tackling some of these basic needs are key to improving both employee experience and engagement.\nHow is Employee Engagement Tied to Employee Experience?\nEmployee engagement is intrinsically linked to employee experience. If employee experience is poor at your organization, it is likely that engagement will also be low.\nEmployee Engagement Trends\nEmployee engagement has remained fairly consistent over the last decade. Thirty years ago, 70% of employees were not engaged at work. In 2019, that number had barely changed; 69% of employees were actively disengaged.\nDuring the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic, however, we did see some slight increases in engagement. Despite some gains in workplace engagement, there are additional challenges we tracked in 2020. With 61% of American workers working remotely full time in 2020, this increased the need for connection, collaboration, and communication. And we see these same wants and needs among the deskless workforce.\nTo increase these three key areas of an employee’s experience will require a strong partnership between internal communications and human resources. It will also require a need to improve frontline manager communication by helping them to conduct daily or weekly team huddles (also called: team standups, pre-shift meetings, post-shift meetings). And internal communications professionals will need to focus on focus groups to keep a finger on the pulse of the employee body.\nAnother key employee engagement trend will be the importance of senior leaders to be transparent, authentic, and open. And this will create a great opportunity for internal communications professionals to demonstrate to executive leadership that they are strategic advisors.\nAnd last, one of the biggest trends is the importance of building an amazing workplace culture. Often high performing employees churn because of dysfunctional cultures and poor management, and great cultures attract top talent.\nHow Effective Communication Boosts Employee Engagement\nWhen an organization has effective internal communication, there is a positive impact on employee engagement. This is because an all-inclusive communication strategy gives all employees access to the information they need to do their job and feel supported. Without access to communication, or the ability to comment or provide feedback, it is difficult for employees to feel included and, therefore, to engage.\nHow Does theEMPLOYEEapp Help Improve Employee Engagement?\ntheEMPLOYEEapp improves employee engagement by giving all employees—from the office to the frontline—access to communication, resources, and senior leadership.\nOur mobile internal communications app also gives administrators the ability to target and personalize content to specific employee groups, which makes content more relevant to the intended audience. When content is more relevant, an employee will feel more included and important to the organization, in addition to feeling like the organization understands their role, their needs, and their wants.\ntheEMPLOYEEapp also is set up with many ways to engage, including likes, comments, social sharing, survey integrations, an employee directory, and a calendar. This gives employees a way to ask questions, provide feedback, get in touch with the right people or departments, and participate in company events.\nLearn more about how we can help:', 'Your company has started to use Artificial intelligence (AI), but are you effectively managing the risks involved? It’s a new growth channel with the potential to boost productivity and improve customer service. However, particular management risks need to be assessed in cybersecurity. Start by considering AI trends to put this risk in context.\nWhy Is AI an Emerging Cybersecurity Threat?\nArtificial intelligence is a booming industry right now with large corporations, researchers, and startups all scrambling to make the most of the trend. From a cybersecurity perspective, there are a few reasons to be concerned about AI. Your threat assessment models need to be updated based on the following developments.\nEarly Cybersecurity AI May Create a False Sense of Security\nMost machine learning methods currently in production require users to provide a training data set. With this data in place, the application can make better predictions. However, end-user judgment is a major factor in determining which data to include. This “supervised learning” approach is subject to compromise if hackers discover how the supervised process works. In effect, hackers could evade detection by machine learning by mimicking safe code.\nAI-based Cybersecurity Creates More Work for Humans\nFew companies are willing to trust their security to machines. As a result, machine learning in cybersecurity has the effect of creating more work. WIRED magazine summarized this capability as follows: “Machine learning’s most common role, then, is additive. It acts as a sentry, rather than a cure-all.” As AI and machine learning tools flag more and more problems for review, human analysts will need to review this data and make decisions about what to do next.\nHackers Are Starting to Use AI for Attacks\nLike any technology, AI can be used for defense or attack. Researchers at the Stevens Institute of Technology have demonstrated that fact. They used AI to guess 25% of LinkedIn passwords successfully after analyzing 43 million user profiles in 2017. In the hands of defenders, such a tool could help to educate end users on whether they’re using weak passwords. In the hands of attackers, this tool could be used to compromise security.\nThe Mistakes You Need to Know About\nAvoid the following mistakes, and you’re more likely to have success with AI in your organization.\n1. You Haven’t Thought Through the Explainability Challenge\nWhen you use AI, can you explain how it operates and makes recommendations? If not, you may be accepting (or rejecting!) recommendations without being able to assess them. This challenge can be mitigated by reverse engineering the recommendations made by AI.\n2. You Use Vendor-provided AI Without Understanding Their Models\nSome companies decide to buy or license AI from others rather than building the technology in house. As with any strategic decision, there’s a downside to this approach. You can’t trust the vendor’s suggestions that AI will be beneficial blindly. You need to ask tough questions about how the systems protect your data and what systems AI tools can access. Overcome this challenge by asking your vendors to explain their assumptions about data and machine learning.\n3. You Don’t Test AI Security Independently\nWhen you use an AI or machine learning tool, you need to entrust a significant amount of data to it. To trust the system, it must be tested from a cybersecurity perspective. For example, consider whether the system can be compromised by SQL injection or other hacking techniques. If a hacker can compromise the algorithm or data in an AI system, the quality of your company’s decision making will suffer.\n4. Your Organization Lacks AI Cybersecurity Skills\nTo carry out AI cybersecurity tests and evaluations, you need skilled staff. Unfortunately, there are relatively few cyber professionals who are competent in security and AI. Fortunately, this mistake can be overcome with a talent development program. Offer your cybersecurity professionals the opportunity to earn certificates, attend conferences, and use other resources to increase their AI knowledge.\n5. You Avoid Using AI Completely for Security Reasons\nBased on the previous mistakes, you might assume that avoiding AI and machine learning completely is a smart move. That might’ve been an option a decade ago, but AI and machine learning are now part of every tool you use at work. Attempting to minimize AI risk by ignoring this technology trend will only expose your organization to greater risk. It’s better to seek proactive solutions that leverage AI. For instance, you can use security chatbots such as Apollo to make security more convenient for your staff.\n6. You Expect too Much Transformation from AI\nGoing into an AI implementation with unreasonable expectations will cause security and productivity problems. Resist the urge to apply AI to every business problem in the organization. Such a broad implementation would be very difficult to monitor from a security point of view. Instead, take the low-risk approach: apply AI for one area at a time, such as automating routine security administration tasks, and then build from there.\n7. Holding Back Real Data from Your AI Solution\nMost developers and technologists like to reduce risk by setting up test environments. It’s a sound discipline and well worth using. However, when it comes to AI, this approach has its limits. To find out whether your AI system is truly secure, you need to feed it real data: customer information, financial data, or something else. If all this information is held back, you’ll never be able to assess the security risks or productivity benefits of embracing AI.\nAdopt AI with an Eyes Wide Open Perspective\nThere are certainly dangers and risks associated with using AI in your company. However, these risks can be monitored and managed through training, proactive management oversight, and avoiding these seven mistakes.']	['<urn:uuid:57a0d88c-48ba-4c63-937e-060fefc09097>', '<urn:uuid:75c20593-63bc-45e3-ac40-3a0820eb44e8>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	27	130	2141
97	lake water depth measurement tech compare boat stick vs new methods need info	In the past, measurements were taken using a rowing boat with a dipping stick to identify silt build up. Now, measurements are taken using more advanced technology that combines a total station and a Sonarmite echo sounder, which provide time-stamped data for real-time positioning and bed profiles.	"[""Links for the needed files: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jb44s54w4oqm6p8/Case%205%20-%20Hydrographic%20Survey%20%28May%202020%29.sdb?dl=0\nAiC produces tablet-based software for data collection from various devices including GNNS and total stations. Whilst these programs have their own features, they do not include modelling or design. Data needs to be exported from these programs and imported into n4ce.\nHere we will look at 4Site Sonar data captured using a total station and a Sonarmite echo sounder. Data from these devices are time-stamped allowing the real-time positioning and bed profiles to be identified, as shown below.\nThe site use here was at the inlet to yacht mooring on Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland, which had to be kept clear with a 1.2m draft. In the past, the rivers department took out a rowing boat with a dipping stick to identify silt build up. Although this is an inland lough it is sufficiently large to be tidal, with stream flows moving sediment.\nThe sonar data and total station data was merged within the 4Site Sonar software and exported into n4ce using an .EXP file format. The data from 4Site Sonar can be pre-processed to remove spikes and poor quality data due to the reflected signal from the Sonarmite.\nHydrographic Data Imported into n4ce\nFor the purpose of this survey, we will give the setup station A coordinates of 1000, 1000,100 and use a RO sighting to an arbitrary station for reduction (see above -88 point number and zero distance). If fixed points were known then real control values would have been used.\nAfter reduction, create a new model called Lough Neagh using the survey data supplied, then form a DTM. You should see the following when viewing this model graphically.\nHydrographic Survey with Contours Spacing (0.1m Brown and 1.0m Blue)\nHeight shading can be turned on using ALT+F9 and shading intervals and colours in DTM Settings. Here we are using 0.5 intervals with Blue, Green & Red.\nHydrographic Survey Data with 5.1m Clearance Plane.\nThe 3D model of the data is shown above with a plane representing the freeboard required for boats to navigate through the channel.\nThe exercise here is to dredge the channel to this bed depth of 5.1m for a width of 20m. The designed channel we create will be marked by buoys.\nWhilst we can use the survey data as is, we’re going to simplify the model by generating a 5m grid and use this grid as the basis for the design. Right-click over Models and generate a filename called Lough Neagh 5m Grid. Create the DTM for this model as shown below.\nForming a 5m Grid Model\nForming a 5m Grid Model\nThe contour intervals for the model should be set to Normal 0.1m and Highlight 1m. These contours will be used to lay down a centre line for the channel passage.\nCreate an empty model called Channel, then add the Grid model as a backcloth. Using Point --> Insert and the contours that indicate the slopes of the existing channel lay down a centreline with a code CL and a constant height of 5.1m, as shown below.\nInsert Points to CL at a fixed height of 5.1m\nWe need to define a trapezoidal channel profile, 20m wide with a bed level of 5.1m. This could be done by sweeping out a pre-define Template, but here we will use a simple solution defining each string separately. Using Lines-->Parallel create parallel 10m offsets from the centreline with a code BB.\nWe are now able to use these offset strings to generate a batter up to the existing bed profile, but before we do it's always useful to have a close spacing on points especially on long segments. We will use the Lines-->Densify-->All option to generate additional points along all strings at 5m spacing. In hindsight, we should have done this before generating the parallel offsets. It’s always good to think ahead!\nChoose the option Design Strings Batter All to generate batter slopes from the design to intercept the 5m grid model. Set the Up Batter Slope to 1 in 5, with a TB String Code and the Reference DTM to Lough Neagh 5m Grid.\nSetting Batter String Parameters\nSelecting Batter Options\nNote there are separate options for battering up, down or both together. Here we will choose the up option. The reference surface can be another DTM, a Datum or a height change. If all three are set the batter will stop at the first condition it satisfies. The batter extent should be set to 100%. If you are battering a feature with re-entrant corners this may cause cusps which can be automatically removed. Likewise, when working with external corners a fan angle allows smoothing of batter strings.\nSince the top parallel offset string sits above the reference DTM, no batter intercept will be found.\nNow form the DTM for the designed channel and view it with the 5m grid as a backcloth. It should look like this when viewed in 3D.\nFinal Design of the Channel\nViewing the Channel and 5m grid models in 3D we clearly see that there is material to be removed to the left of the centre line. The next task is to identify how much needs removing and then provide the boundary lines for locating the buoys, indicating the extents of the channel.\nPrism Volumes Using a Projected Surface and Swap Cut & Fill\nWith the Channel model on the screen select DTM Volumes Prisms. Since we have the final design on the screen we should check the Swap Cut & Fill to get the correct sign convention, remembering that our convention is:\n“What do we have to do to the current model to make it become the Reference”\nThe reference here is the existing bed profile, the 5m Grid model. You will be asked to identify the reference surface, as shown here. Select the Lough Neagh 5m Grid model.\nSelecting the Reference Surface for Prism Volume Calculations\nA Report in a rich text editor format will be presented together with a table that can be plotted graphically. Here we will present the results from the Report.\nReporting on Volume Calculations – Note Swapped Quantities\nHere we are only interested in the Cut quantity. It is suggesting that 515m3 has to be dredged out of the channel to give the freeboard required.\nSetting Out Coordinates\nThe next exercise is to generate coordinates for the location of buoys, indicating the extents of the channel. We could provide all of the points along the parallels we created at 5m intervals but this would be excessive. We only need them at 50m spacing.\nFirstly, create a new model called 50m Buoys and add the Channel model as a backcloth. Using Lines-->Copy Backcloth select both parallels forming the extents of the channel. Turn off the backcloth just leaving the two new strings on the screen.\nLines, Copy from Channel Backcloth\nThere are two options we can use to generate the 50m spaced points. Design-->String-->Construction-->Replace will replace the existing points with new points at the spacings indicated. These new points are linearly interpolated from original points along the line of the existing feature.\nThe second option uses the Densify option in the Lines menu. We used this earlier to generate additional points at 5m spacing. This time we will use the same option but add points to the List. This is an extremely powerful option and is used in conjunction with the Pick mode.\nSetting the Start Chainage to -0.01 and the Chainage Interval at 50m will generate 3 new points. The start chainage was set here to -0.01 so as not to conflict with the points previously generated at 5m intervals. Listed points will be identified with a blob, as shown below.\nDensify to Generate Points at 50m spacing\nThe Export CSV option can now be used in the Model Grid (spreadsheet), creating an export filter if necessary. You will have to select listed points first turning the listed points from a turquoise background colour to red, as shown here, then use the Export option.\nExporting Listed Points from the Model Grid\nNote an alternative solution to finding 50m spacing points is to use the Lines-->More-->Replace option. This replaces the original points in a line feature with points at the new spacing.\nSummary of Case Study 3\nQuite a few powerful tools were introduced here showing the flexibility of n4ce in its role as a “Geomatics Software Tool Box”!\nWe started by introducing you to the 4Site Sonar data capture product used in hydrographic surveys. Data from this package was then processed into a model in n4ce and a clearance channel was designed allowing boats to enter and leave their moorings with a clear freeboard. The position of buoys markers at 50m spacing was also established. The Sonar Boat could be directed to these positions - in real-time.""]"	['<urn:uuid:c8645589-fa57-4d05-8536-1e4dd39e7a5c>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	13	47	1471
98	industrial vs office workplace injury prevention solutions compare	For industrial workplaces, prevention focuses on equipment safety and avoiding physical accidents through the CDC's Traumatic Injury Prevention Program, particularly for vehicle operation and construction work. For office environments, prevention emphasizes ergonomic solutions like electric adjustable desks and keyboard trays, with recommendations such as standing at least once every hour to prevent back pain and musculoskeletal problems.	['Computers can perform repetitive tasks faster and with fewer mistakes than humans, so the first few years of computers being used in the business world were concentrated on automating a wide range of industrial processes.\nThe statistics speak for themselves: Worker productivity in the United States had been increasing at an annual rate of 1 percent to 1.5 percent since the early 1970s, but the productivity rate started to increase dramatically in the mid-1990s, and averaged 2.9 percent from 1995 to 2000. Many economists, noted that this rise in productivity occurred during the same period when computers became common in workplaces, and credit computer-related information technology for the increase.\nWhy Ergonomics Matters\nErgonomics is a science that helps align products to users and jobs to workers. The word ergonomics comes from a combination of two Greek words: ergon, which means “work,” and nomos, which means “natural laws.” Sometimes ergonomics can be referred to as human engineering, biotechnology, or human factors.\nNot only does ergonomics cover items that improve working conditions, it also includes how the products you use in your daily life are designed. But ergonomics can refer not only to the way objects are designed, but also the way they are arranged for optimum use.\nIt’s easy to look at ergonomics as an expense rather than an investment. But think about it this way: many people choose a car for its safety features, believing those features are worth the cost of protecting themselves and their families. Businesses who purchase ergonomic products for their employees demonstrate their commitment to their health and well-being. More and more organizations are beginning to realize the importance of helping their people prevent injuries that can be more costly down the line, when weighed against the costs for sick time, short- or long-term disability, and insurance premiums.\nOne of the most important employee perks is workplace ergonomics, which fosters a safety and health culture as a core value. People recognize the value of walking into a safe workplace; with the knowledge that their employer wants to keep their team healthy, employees are likely to be happier at work. Reducing ergonomic problems leads to fewer sick days, fewer injuries, and can reduce long-term, cumulative issues that can shorten a worker’s career. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons says office workers can help prevent back pain by standing at least once every hour to move around—at least stretch, if not walk around a little.\nErgonomics and Computer Workstations\nA lot of early ergonomics research was directed toward industrial professions. For example, the risks of musculoskeletal disorders for someone who operates a jackhammer may be high, that doesn’t negate the risk for office workers; however, risks to office workers wasn’t immediately recognized. In more recent years, experts have learned that ergonomic products are important in all types of workplaces.\nRepetitive motion injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome can occur when workers are improperly positioned or uncomfortable while working. Musculoskeletal problems can occur in workers in all industries, from the assembly line to the office. And the latest research demonstrates that too much sitting can be detrimental to your overall health.\nMore and more companies are creating ergonomic products for the workplace, like electric adjustable desks and under-desk keyboard trays. These products can help you work more comfortably, which translates into working more safely. Improving your workstation’s ergonomics can help you improve your posture, which in turn helps reduce fatigue, stiffness, and soreness.\nWhether you want to modernize your home office or your workplace, ergonomic products are the way to go—especially electric height adjustable computer workstations. These desks not only have the latest features, they’re ergonomically friendly and will blend perfectly with your modern design.', 'Work Injuries and Your Labor and Industry Claim\nWestcare Clinic can be a part of your injury claim team if you got hurt on the job. Washington’s Workers’ Compensation program can provide medical treatment for your injuries. We are proud to take workers’ compensation patients. Hard work is the backbone of our nation. When people work, inevitably, some of them will get injured on the job.\nWe handle workers’ compensation patients frequently, so we know how the claims process works for these cases. You do not want to get your claim denied because a health care professional somewhere else filled out a form incorrectly. We are here to help you, not cause bureaucratic headaches for you.\nBy providing all of the information the workers’ compensation program needs, we can help you avoid delays with your injury claim. Our experience in treating patients with workers’ compensation claims is to your benefit.\nTypes of Work Injuries\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), around 2.5 million Americans a year get hurt on the job badly enough to need treatment in the emergency room. This number means that 160 out of every 10,000 workers sustain severe injuries on the job annually.\nThe CDC says that the three leading causes of workplace injuries are:\nContact with objects and equipment\nOverexertion and bodily reaction\nSlips and trips without a fall\nWorkers age 24 or younger have the highest rate of emergency room-treated work injuries than any other age group. Nearly two-thirds of injured workers who need treatment in the emergency room are male. Almost one-fourth of all fatal work accidents involve motor vehicle crashes.\nThe CDC has a Traumatic Injury Prevention Program whose priority is to reduce the number of injuries and deaths from these work-related situations:\n- Performing job tasks by using industrial vehicles and machines\n- Motor vehicle collisions\n- Workplace violence\nThe Traumatic Injury Prevention Program is part of the CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). NIOSH researches health and safety issues in an effort to foster workplaces that are both safe and productive. You can find guidance on how to prevent workplace fatalities and injuries for specific types of work, like construction and agriculture, and particular circumstances, like highway work zone safety, electrical safety, and working in confined spaces.\nSome common on-the-job injuries are:\n- Fractures. When a worker falls from a height, has a slip or trip and fall accident, material or equipment drops on or strikes him, has an equipment or motor vehicle accident, he can break bones.\n- Ergonomic issues. Workers can be at risk of soft tissue injury and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) because of poorly designed workspaces and tasks that take a toll on the body. Repetitive like typing for eight hours a day can cause carpal tunnel syndrome, a compression of nerves in the wrist. Sudden or ongoing exposure to vibration or force can injure a worker. Awkward posture because of work areas designed without the worker’s safety or health in mind can lead to degeneration of muscles and bones.\n- Back or neck injuries. People who perform heavy lifting, physical labor, sitting or standing for long periods at work are susceptible to sudden or chronic back injuries. We have multiple treatment options for job-related back or neck injuries.\n- Lacerations and burns. Jobs that involve working with heavy machinery or electrical items carry a risk of lacerations or burns severe enough to need treatment in an emergency room.\n- Traumatic brain injury. A person can suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) at work in a slip or trip and fall accident, a fall from a height, or a job-related motor vehicle accident, to name just a few examples. A TBI can cause life-long impairment and lead to excruciating headaches. Some people have severe headaches for many years after a head injury. We have multiple treatment options for headaches.\nThese are but a few examples of work-related injuries. You can call us to find out how we can help you get relief from the pain of your workers’ compensation injury.\nWorkers’ Compensation Can Cover Work-Related Diseases\nMany people think of workers’ compensation as providing benefits when a person gets injured at work, but they do not realize that Washington’s workers’ compensation program can also apply to work-related illnesses and diseases. Some examples of these illnesses include:\n- Asbestosis. A person can get exposed to asbestos fibers on the job when performing repairs to equipment in older buildings, removing flooring or popcorn ceilings, and doing renovation work to commercial or residential property. Asbestosis can be extremely painful. We can perform nerve blocks and other interventions to improve the patient’s quality of life.\n- Cancer. Millions of people in America get exposed to carcinogens at work. Researchers estimate that between three and six percent of all cancer is the result of workplace exposure.\n- Throughout the workday, many people get exposed to infectious diseases. Sometimes a person merely catches a cold from workplace exposure, but unfortunately, a person can catch more severe diseases that have acute short-term complications and can develop into chronic impairments. Some of these conditions are painful. We have interventions available that can make a patient more comfortable both in the short term and long term.\nWestcare Clinic is your one-stop pain management and treatment center.\nWashington’s Worker’s Compensation Program\nOur state has a Workers’ Compensation Program that provides these benefits for people with work-related illnesses or injuries:\n- Medical treatment\n- Vocational rehabilitation to help the injured worker get back to work after getting released by the treating doctor or transition into a different type of work because of lasting impairment from the work-related injury or illness\n- Lost wages, in the form of Temporary Total Disability (TTD) payments and Temporary Partial Disability (TPD) payments\n- Lost future wages, in the form of Permanent Total Disability (PTD) payments and Permanent Partial Disability (PPD) payments\n- Additional claim-related benefits or expenses, like reimbursement for mileage\nIf a person dies from a work-related injury or illness, qualified dependents can receive some compensation. Depending on your situation, you might qualify for additional benefits.\nKey Points to Know\nIf a person has a work-related injury or illness and does not follow the strict rules of the Workers’ Compensation Program, the program can refuse to pay any benefits, even medical expenses and lost wages. It is vital to learn the regulations of the program immediately after an illness or injury on the job. Failure to do so could leave a person with a lifelong disability and a stack of unpaid medical bills.\nHere are three things to know about workers’ compensation:\n- Notify your employer immediately. If a person does not provide timely notice to the boss and use the correct notification form, that alone can destroy his claim for medical and financial benefits.\n- Unless it is an emergency, only use the medical providers on your employer’s approved medical providers list or a medical provider that your boss approved for you. If your employer allows you to get treatment from someone not on the usual list, make sure that you get that authorization in writing. If you go to a doctor, hospital, or another medical facility whom your employer does not approve, you will likely have to pay those costs out of your own pocket. The workers’ compensation program and your regular health insurance will not pay those medical bills.\n- Cooperate with your employer and the insurance company your boss uses for workers’ compensation claims. Sometimes people get frustrated with the bureaucracy, so they push back by refusing to sign medical records releases, complete or sign forms, or provide evidence the insurance company needs to process the claim. The worker loses when this happens, because failure to cooperate can be grounds for the insurance company to legitimately deny your claim.\nOf course, in the event of an emergency, a sick or injured worker should go to the nearest emergency room. Also, some employers will allow a worker to go to a doctor or facility that is not on the approved list if the worker makes a formal request and shows a convincing reason for the request. If there are not any doctors or facilities on the approved list who provide the type of treatment a worker needs, most bosses will be reasonable about authorizing “outside” treatment.\nWhen a person gets sick or hurt because of something that happened on the job, there are a lot of different things to juggle. For example:\n- Jumping through all the hoops to qualify for workers’ compensation benefits.\n- Dealing with the pain and inconvenience of the illness or injury.\n- Trying to get well again.\n- Worrying about whether the person will heal entirely or having lasting impairment from the illness or injury.\n- Stressing about becoming unemployed while at home, recuperating.\nWestcare Clinic can help with the pain at the time of illness or injury, as well as discomfort from treatments like physical therapy, and chronic pain issues. We can be a part of your treatment team for many work-related conditions. Illnesses and injuries often cause pain, and we can help restore your quality of life by reducing or eliminating your discomfort from a work-related disease.']	['<urn:uuid:102397f4-0955-41cb-80e5-b678cb44e4a1>', '<urn:uuid:95b8216c-e64b-474e-a1d7-1b1bc33daa99>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	8	57	2158
99	what did ancient brewers use to clear beer	Throughout history, brewers used various materials to filter beer including crushed beach shells, crushed carcasses of shrimp, cockroaches, locusts and beetles, coconut fibers, peanut shells and rice husks.	['by Courtney Llewellyn\nChemistry can be so much more than a class in high school in which you have to (try to) memorize the periodic table of elements. It can also be a very useful field of study when it comes to the safety of craft beverages.\nA recent study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry outlined an issue some wine makers and brewers need to deal with, based on how they filter their fermented goods. The study noted that filtration for alcoholic fermented beverages often use filter aids like diatomaceous earth (DE), which may contain elevated amounts of the heavy metals arsenic, cadmium and lead – and chronic dietary exposure to elevated amounts of these metals pose a risk to public health.\nAccording to U.S. Pharmacopeia standards, DE must not contain soluble arsenic and lead concentrations above 10 mg/kg to receive the food-grade designation. “This arsenic limit is … raising concerns that filter aids may potentially introduce heavy metals into beverages during processing,” wrote Benjamin Redan, Ph.D., with the U.S. FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, lead author of the study.\nRedan’s team evaluated the factors affecting the transfer of these heavy metals from DE to beer and wine in their study. They processed unfiltered ale, lager and red and white wines with three types of DE. According to Marianna Naum, Ph.D., in their experiments, they followed the recommendation of “The Handbook of Enology,” in which a winery would typically use approximately 0.2 to 2 g/L DE for filtration, and used 2 g/L.\n“Use of 2 g/L DE containing 5.4 mg/kg soluble inorganic arsenic for filtering beer and wine resulted in significant increases of 11.2 – 13.7 μg/L (microns per liter) inorganic arsenic in the filtered beverage,” the report found. No alterations were observed for lead and cadmium levels.\nAlthough the sources of the heavy metal contamination are still unclear, preliminary evidence suggests that use of filter aids may be one such potential source, the study said – but it also found some potential methods to decrease the heavy metal transfer. So what does that mean for those using these filter aids?\nThe History of DE and Brewing\nAccording to Alexey Makoveev of EP Minerals, one of the largest suppliers of DE, there have been myriad filter aids that have been used to filter beer for millennia – including crushed beach shells, crushed carcasses of shrimp, cockroaches, locusts and beetles, coconut fibers, peanut shells and rice husks. Drinkers usually enjoy clearer beers, so brewers through the centuries have tried many methods to make them possible. Today, those who make beer need to remove impurities or particles in beer down to the micron “haze” in the liquid, and they do so with filtration.\n“Surface filtration with cartridges, sheets or bag filters may work fine for other liquids, but these other approaches lack the capacity and flexibility to filter commercial volumes of beer,” Makoveev wrote on the EP Minerals website. “Filter aid filtration, more technically called dynamic depth filtration, usually employs diatomaceous earth (DE) as the filtration medium, and is the most cost-effective and flexible technology for clarifying beer, and it is the only true renewable filtration process used today in the brewing industry.”\nDE is not “earth” at all, but the skeletal remains of microscopic unicellular plants. Huge deposits of these plant remains are found in regions that were once covered by lakes, like Nevada.\n“We did not assess whether the geographical source of DE influences the heavy metal concentrations in the final beverage. However, it is possible that the source location may influence heavy metal content of DE due to natural variation,” Naum said.\nThe powdery DE is coated onto a filter surface to form a cake, and the cake of filter aid and retained solids are responsible for the filtration effect. It improves the clarity of beer or wine and helps to extend their shelf life.\n“DE and dynamic depth filtration are adaptable, and flexible,” Makoveev said. “They allow brewers to easily adjust their filtration to their own particular brewing standards which brings out the true ‘personality’ of their beer… DE is also chosen because it’s inert, it’s a good value, it’s readily available and because of its high efficiency and high throughput.”\nThe concerning news is that there have been several studies (recently in 2013 and 2015) demonstrating that different steps involved in processing and filtering wine and beer can alter the metal composition in the beverages. A study from Germany showed that mixing beer with DE may cause levels of arsenic to increase in the beverage.\nRedan and his team wanted to see if there was anything that could be done to stop that increase from occurring.\nThe Wash Experiments\nThe researchers from the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and their colleagues from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s Scientific Services Division came up with a hypothesis: rinsing the DE before the wine or beer went through it might decrease the heavy metals that ended up in the end products.\nTo test this idea, single batches of standard lager- and ale-style beers were brewed at the Fermentation Sciences Lab in the Department of Food Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Single lots of red and white wine were produced at a commercial winery without filtration. One, two, three or five liters of each beverage were pumped through a DE filter at 60 mL/minute. In order to test potential methods to decrease the heavy metal content of filter aids, water, a 0.1 percent citric acid solution and a 0.1 percent EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) solution were used to “wash” the DE before the alcoholic beverages were filtered through.\n“We wanted to extend these preliminary results to an actual filtration process to test if these results held in both wine and beer using different types of DE,” Naum said. “We did find it surprising that simply washing the DE could be a significant method of remediation” when it came to decreasing the heavy metals, especially the arsenic, she added. (The EDTA significantly reduced lead levels only.)\nArsenic concentration decreased by more than half by washing the DE filter for one minute with water and about 90 percent with the citric acid solution. No significant effect from washing was observed on cadmium concentrations. These treatments were selected because of previous work indicating that EDTA and citric acid have the ability to make heavy metals more soluble.\n“The washing-treatment data indicate that a large fraction of the inorganic arsenic in DE is highly soluble and thus can be removed from this filter aid by even a relatively short washing step,” the study stated.\nNaum said, “We hope that our experimental data can be used to inform the industry on potential steps they can take to reduce levels of these metals in their products. Our results indicate that those who use DE as a filter aid can select DE with lower amounts of heavy metals or wash the DE so that lower amount of heavy metals transfer to the filtered product.”\nIt should be noted that although heavy metal levels in the surveyed beer and wine samples had a large range of values, the results were consistent with other research indicating that differences in packaging, processing and the elemental composition of the soils where the raw input products are grown can all affect the heavy metal concentrations in the final product.\nAnd while laboratory-scale experiments such as this one have been shown to correlate to industrial-scale production, Naum said the research team hopes to perform a large-scale study to confirm their findings.']	['<urn:uuid:f04114b7-e956-4320-833f-7e2c8a0ff130>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	8	28	1269
100	In what ways do personal counseling sessions with young athletes address matters beyond their athletic performance?	Personal counseling sessions with athletes extend beyond sports performance to address their overall well-being. Coaches ask about academic progress, including how school is going, their most challenging classes, grades, and career plans. They also discuss whether athletes can maintain a healthy balance between their sport commitments, studies, and personal life, including time for family and friends. These meetings provide an opportunity for athletes to bring up any problems in these areas. Additionally, these sessions help develop essential face-to-face communication skills, which is particularly valuable in an era when young people primarily communicate through smartphones and social media.	['Benefits of individual postseason meetings\nOne of the most important times for McWilliams to listen to his players is during the postseason meetings he holds with all seventy players in his program. It takes a long time to conduct thorough, meaningful meetings with that many athletes, but McWilliams says it’s worth it. He said that coaches who do not hold such meetings— or hold them but do all the talking and don’t listen — are “doing themselves and their athletes a disservice.” With the right preparation, setting, and attitude, individual postseason meetings can help you accomplish many objectives. Here are a few:\n- Help athletes understand their strengths and weaknesses. Individual meetings are a great time to praise an athlete’s strengths and give specific constructive criticism about weaknesses they need to address. Too often we take it for granted that athletes know what they need to do to improve, but many times they do not. This is especially true of high school athletes. Zach Raber, who coached perennial state track and cross country power Carroll High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and now coaches at Trine University, sees a key difference between high school and college athletes in this area.\nWhile on the topic of improvement, you can ask athletes what their goals are for themselves and for the team. Together, you and the athlete can devise a plan to reach those goals. As with addressing weaknesses, don’t take it for granted that athletes know the volume and specific nature of the work needed to reach the next level.\n- Receive feedback about the season, your program, and your performance as a coach. This is where McWilliams’ point about the importance of listening applies the most.\n“I’ve changed my ways over the years,” he said.\n“I used to do all the talking. Now it’s more of me listening.” Raber agreed.\nHe likes to use open-ended requests and questions that give athletes an opportunity to talk in detail. Many start with the words “Tell me about….” For instance, “Tell me about your season.” Or “Tell me about our team culture.” What about reticent athletes who give brief answers? Prepare specific follow-up questions designed to get them talking: “What is the best aspect of our team culture?” “What suggestions do you have for improving team culture?” “What was the most satisfying part of the season for you?” “What was a challenge that you overcame this season?” Questions like these will often break the ice and get even the most introverted athlete to open up.\nA vital question that both McWilliams and Raber ask is “What can I do better as a coach?” It’s not always easy to listen to someone state where we have fallen short as leaders, but it is necessary if we want to improve. As McWilliams said, “If I’m going to become a better person and a better coach, I need to hear what they have to say about my performance. I think it’s important to do that. If you’re upfront and honest with your athletes, they’re not going to make stuff up. I think they understand that this is a learning process for me as a coach.”\nBoth McWilliams and Raber have received helpful suggestions from athletes. One player persuaded McWilliams to practice varsity and reserve players together instead of separately. The player thought that would give reserves a regular opportunity to show their progress to the head coach. Raber has taken to heart suggestions about designing team bonding activities, incorporating more cross-training, and moving long runs to different days for some runners.\n- Re-emphasize your program’s core values. For my high school cross country team, our core values include having fun, working hard for optimal improvement, and representing the school and community with class. In our individual meetings, I remind my athletes of these values and ask them how well we adhered to them. If we fell short on any of these values, I need to know, and I want my athletes’ suggestions for doing better. I don’t see everything that goes on, whether it’s on the bus, in a restaurant, at a motel during our overnight trip, or during a competition. If we had an incident that I didn’t know about, one that reflected badly on our program, I want to address it. Of course, an athlete may be reluctant to name names, and I respect that, but I can still ask what I can do better to prevent such incidents in the future.\nAs our first two core values indicate, effectively mixing fun and hard work is important to our program, so I always ask if we struck the right balance. If an athlete says he or she didn’t have fun, I know it’s unlikely that I will see that athlete again next season unless our discussion reveals why the athlete didn’t have fun and what we can do to improve the situation.\n- Enhance your athletes’ face-to-face communication skills. In a time when so much communication, especially among young people, takes place through a smartphone and on social media, face-to-face communication is increasingly rare. We owe it to our athletes to help them develop this indispensable skill. Provide a quiet, comfortable setting for your meetings, and use eye contact, smiles, and a relaxed but serious tone in your conversation. Again, listening is key. Give your athletes time to ponder a question and give a thoughtful answer. Ask follow-up questions to encourage more open and elaborate responses.\nBe patient. Your individual meeting may be the first time they’ve ever had this kind of experience with an adult.\n- Show your concern for them as students and people, not just as athletes. Ask how school is going. What’s their most challenging class? Are their grades where they want them? Is there anything you can do to help? What are their career plans?\nThough you don’t want to overstep your boundaries or make an athlete feel uncomfortable, you can elicit responses about their personal and social lives if you approach them sensitively. One way is to ask if their commitment to their sport and their studies (and part-time job if they have one) leaves them enough time and energy to devote to family and friends. If there are problems in these areas, this provides a chance for your athletes to bring them up.\n- Express your gratitude for your athletes’ contributions to your program. It’s a truism that without your athletes, you wouldn’t have a coaching job. When is the last time you thanked your athletes for their participation and commitment? Like everyone, athletes want to be appreciated. Young people have a plethora of options these days for how they can spend their time, and you should be grateful they have chosen to spend it with you and your program. I regularly thank my athletes as a group after an excellent practice, a solid effort in a competition, or good behavior on a trip, but I think the thank you’s I express in postseason meetings are especially valued because I cite specific actions or qualities that I appreciate for each athlete. That gives it a personal touch that can be particularly meaningful.\nIt’s also important to meet with those unsung heroes of any athletic program, the student managers. Theirs is too often a thankless job, but most of us would have a hard time performing our jobs optimally without their help. Most of what I’ve said about meetings with athletes apply to meetings with managers too. You may be surprised at the insights they offer.\n» Related: Transformational over transactional coaching\nStudies repeatedly show that when employees feel listened to and have a sense of autonomy, their job satisfaction is higher. Of course, our athletes aren’t employees, but I think the same factors influence their satisfaction with being on a team. When you listen to them and take their feedback seriously, they feel valued and part of something bigger than themselves. This helps build a strong team culture.\nBut keep in mind that you can’t expect individual meetings to go well if you haven’t laid a foundation of trust, caring, and open communication during your season. Work hard at that foundation daily and you will set the tone for positive and fruitful meetings.\nEven if you don’t have seventy athletes in your program like Coach McWilliams, you will have to devote a lot of time to individual meetings. But it is time well spent when you consider the many benefits to you and your athletes.\nRandy Hisner coaches cross country at Bellmont High School in Decatur, Indiana, and umpires high school and college baseball. He also has coached high school baseball and middle school track and basketball.']	['<urn:uuid:a2d45710-4f77-4c53-9597-f7d94766b75c>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T02:30:03.447076	16	97	1450
