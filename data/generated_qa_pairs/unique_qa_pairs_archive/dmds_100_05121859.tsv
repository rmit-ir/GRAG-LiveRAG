1	do temperature changes affect monarch caterpillar development on milkweed plants compared to climate effects on british butterfly lifecycles	Temperature changes affect butterfly development in both species, but in different ways. Monarch caterpillars undergo a specific development process on milkweed plants, where they consume milkweed foliage, shed their skin five times, and form a jade-green chrysalis with characteristic gold dots. British butterfly studies, particularly of the silver-spotted skipper, show that warmer temperatures in June allow caterpillars to grow faster and potentially get better quality food in their final growing stage. For both species, temperature affects emergence timing - warm conditions in July cause earlier emergence from chrysalises. The key difference is that Monarchs are specifically dependent on milkweed plants for their development, while British butterflies' lifecycle changes have been more directly linked to overall temperature increases, with documented effects on their size and distribution patterns.	"['MINDFUL OF MONARCHS\nSeptember 15, 2015\nFrom Rachel Carson’s windows there can be seen bees, butterflies and humming birds visiting a wealth of plants cultivated especially for pollinators including 3 varieties of milkweed (Asclepias): the low-growing A. tuberosa aka butterfly weed with bright orange blooms, the taller thin leaved A. incarnata aka swamp milkweed with raspberry colored flowers, and the familiar broad-leaved A. syriaca aka common milkweed. Except for a patch of incarnata all are now (mid September) without any blossoms.\nThe leaves of these milkweeds constitute important food sources for Monarch butterfly caterpillars. They only thrive on milkweed leaves. In addition, the milkweed blossoms provide nectar for adult Monarchs and other pollinators. The adult Monarch butterfly sips nectar and does not consume milkweed leaves.\nA handful of Monarch butterflies as single individuals visited our pollinator garden this year during August and early September\nMonarchs in Maine\nAbout this same time of year (on September 10th 1963) Rachel Carson observed Monarch butterflies passing Newagen Point in Maine on their annual migration to Mexico. Rachel’s now famous letter about this sighting to her friend Dorothy Freeman expressed her admiration for the remarkable journey of these insects, one of the longest known to be made by butterflies, and showed in her special poetic style a noble acceptance of her own mortality. (Always, Rachel: The Letters of Rachel Carson and Dorothy Freeman (1952-1964), ed. Martha Freeman, 1995)\nMonarchs and the “miracle bush”\nThe Monarchs that Rachel watched no doubt continued southward down the coast and through Maryland. There, in a more recent year, at a later time in September, (the first day of fall), migrating Monarchs were observed by the esteemed Maryland nature writer Tom Horton while he travelled by kayak along the Chesapeake Bay shoreline. The encounter he described with Monarchs first occurred as “a [Monarch butterfly] river floating over and around my kayak…all afternoon…singly or in pairs or threes…[part of] the annual migration that funnels the butterflies from across eastern N. America (U.S. and Canada) to a few winter roosts in central Mexico.” (“Monarchs” in The Great Marsh, Harp and Horton, 2002)\nToward sunset of that same day, Horton came across a once in a lifetime, wondrous sight – the butterflies had formed a vivid “cloak of living velvet” on the branches and twigs of a high-tide Marsh elder bush on the Chesapeake shore. The marsh elder is called by locals “miracle bush” because they say it is a miracle that anything like a shrub could grow out on the salt marsh. Returning the next morning at sunrise, to the shrub where the fluttering travelers had rested overnight, Tom watched them become airborne at 7:15 a.m, with the warmth of the first sun rays, to continue their migration “spreading beauty for all to see along [their] way…” (“Monarchs” in The Great Marsh, Harp and Horton, 2002)\nMetamorphosis: Creating A Living Jewel of Jade and Gold\nIn addition to the remarkable migration of the Monarchs (Canada, US, Mexico), a miraculous transformation occurs when the solitary egg deposited on the underside of a milkweed leaf by the adult Monarch butterfly develops into a yellow, white and black caterpillar constantly consuming milkweed foliage, shedding and eating its skin five times and then forming a jade-green chrysalis. The circlet of tiny gold dots that develop on it have resulted in the Monarch chrysalis being compared to “a piece of exquisite jade jewelry decorated with flecks of gold.” (the word “chrysalis” is from the Greek and translates as “gilded jewel box.”) (Ina Warren, Monarchs and Milkweeds Almanac, Vol l, 2011).\nIn the words of E.O. Wilson: “… mysterious and little known organisms live within walking distance of where you sit. Splendor awaits in minute proportions.” (Ina Warren, Monarchs and Milkweeds Almanac, Vol l, 2011)\nA Monarch Metamorphosis in Maryland\nThe thrill of seeing even one Monarch butterfly in 2015 is enhanced many fold by observing the Monarch caterpillar metamorphose into an elegant orange and black adult butterfly, as we were privileged to do during this past August — thanks to a patch of A. tuberosa and the ever observant Cliff Hall.\nSave The Monarch\nAwareness that the Monarch’s population has declined by 90% and that the effort to restore habitat for this iconic butterfly is directed from the highest government levels, intensifies the need for national participation.\nThe wondrous aspect of the restoration campaign is that any and all residents living along the Monarch migration path can contribute to this effort by creating habitat for monarchs, through growing one or more of these three varieties of milkweed plants (A. incarnata, A. tuberosa, A. syriaca) in a chemical-free area set aside for pollinators.\nBy Diana Post (with help from Munro Meyersburg)\nFor past View From Rachel’s Window articles click here', ""Butterflies unlocking our climate's secrets\nClimate change is having a dramatic effect on the lives of British butterflies - they are emerging earlier, changing in size and living in new habitats.\nMuseum researchers Steve Brooks and Dr Angela Self used digitised collections to track the changes native butterfly species have experienced over the last 140 years of unprecedented temperature fluctuations in Britain.\nBritish summers are getting warmer and our springs are blooming earlier, often bringing mild temperatures and blue skies as early as February.\nThe complex lifecycles of butterflies rely on delicate balances within the ecosystem, including heat and availability of food.\nTracking their habits can reveal important lessons about the state of the environment.\nAccording to Met Office data, average UK temperatures increased by 0.6°C between 1870 and 1970, and since then have increased even more rapidly, going up by 1.5°C in the last 40 years. This change is in part down to rising levels of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere, which has created a greenhouse effect.\nThe Museum's collections contain data on British butterflies stretching back beyond the nineteenth century - a valuable tool for researchers hoping to uncover long-term trends in our changing ecosystems.\nData at the click of a button\nThis data is now online for the first time thanks to the Museum's iCollections project, meaning Steve Brooks had access to 180,000 butterfly specimens on his desktop.\nWith Dr Phil Fenberg, a colleague at Southampton University, Brooks and Dr Self have been examining the lifecycle, size and distribution of the silver-spotted skipper, a butterfly that is most at home in short chalk grassland in the south of England.\nIt is well-suited to the study of climate change due to its annual reproductive cycle and habitat.\nThe researchers found that in warm summers the butterfly is larger and flies earlier in the year.\nBrooks said: 'Looking at how species respond to temperature is essential for understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of climate change.\n'Our study would not be possible without data from digitized collections paired with monthly temperature records.'\nWhy does temperature matter?\nIt was found that in the years when Britain experienced warm June temperatures, the adult male skippers had larger wings, and in warm Julys both sexes emerged from their chrysalises earlier.\nBrooks said: 'Caterpillars are in their final growing stage in June, so warmer environments could mean they can grow faster and may be getting better quality food.\n'In July the adult butterflies develop in the chrysalis and emerge earlier when it is warmer.\n'And the butterflies are on the wing in August, so warm Augusts mean they could venture further north than before.\n'Our study has shown these three responses to climate change together for the first time in a single species.'\nMore studies are still being done on the other British butterfly species, to find out which are emerging earlier, getting larger and expanding their homes in the north of the country.\nButterflies that were previously restricted to the south of England are expected to expand their range as the climate changes.\nBreaking the rules\nBergmann's rule, named after nineteenth-century German biologist Carl Bergmann, states that as temperatures increase, organisms get smaller.\nThis is because warm temperatures allow the metabolic rate of living things to speed up, meaning they need more food to achieve and maintain large body sizes.\nThe work has demonstrated the silver-spotted skipper goes against this rule, probably because the species produces one generation each year. This means it has longer to grow than species that produce several generations each summer.\nUnderstanding climate change\nBrooks' investigations into the changing lives of butterflies are helping scientists to understand how warmer global temperatures are affecting species in Britain.\nHe said: 'This work would have been impossible without access to the digital collections of British species, allowing us to examine large amounts of data.\n'Changes in butterfly size and habit will help us to understand the wider effects of global climate change on British organisms and ecosystems.'""]"	['<urn:uuid:cdf620a8-09a6-41d2-bc3b-8df8d000bc3c>', '<urn:uuid:d866495a-0a67-44a7-9e9b-69c3a8dcf5a3>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	18	126	1462
2	What exactly is a compact jump?	A compact jump involves lightly tucking in the knees and jumping from a high point, like a lifeguard chair. The water should be at least 5 feet deep for this type of jump.	"['Lifeguards use all kinds of skills and techniques to save victims from drowning, potential injuries of the neck and spinal areas and more! In this quiz, we\'ve compiled a list of 35 questions that will test your knowledge on lifeguard-related topics like jumps, types of rescues and medical devices.\nLet\'s take a look at some jumps. There are four types of jumps, or entries, that are used by lifeguards. Depending on the situation, a compact jump, stride jump, run-and-swim entry or a slide-in entry may be used. A compact jump is used to jump from high places, like a lifeguard chair, where a lifeguard loosely ""tucks in"" their knees to their rescue tube. A stride jump is typically used near the edge of the pool, where a lifeguard extends one leg into the water. For potential spinal injuries, a slide-in entry is used for both deep water and shallow water areas. This is so that the water remains undisturbed around the person being rescued. And finally, a run-and-swim entry is used for waters that have little to no depth, where a lifeguard literally runs in the water to save a victim.\nYou\'ll be quizzed on whistle blasts, CPR techniques and first aid treatment in this quiz as well. Let\'s see how well you do; try and score at least a 75% now!\nIf a lifeguard wants to tell someone to stop running (in a swimming pool area), how many short whistle blasts will they typically use?\nThe answer is one short whistle blast. A lifeguard will use this to get someone\'s attention for minor situations like running by the pool or diving into a shallow area of the water.\nWhich of the following vehicles are not typically used by lifeguards in a beach setting?\nLifeguards don\'t typically use a bicycle in a beach setting, as it would be difficult to actually ride a bike through sand. Instead, they use vehicles like inflatable boats (in the ocean), quad bikes and pick-up trucks.\nWhat is the 10:20 system?\nThe 10:20 rule is an important technique that is used by lifeguards in both swimming pool and beach settings. It\'s when a lifeguard scans the entirety of the swimming area for 10 seconds and is within a 20-second reach of all swimmers.\nOne long whistle blow (in a swimming pool area) is used to indicate that...?\nEverybody should clear the pool when a lifeguard blows the whistle with one long breath. This doesn\'t necessarily mean an emergency, either; it could simply be a drill.\nIf a lifeguard runs through shallow water to save someone, this is called a...?\nA run-and-swim entry involves a lifeguard running through shallow waters to save someone. This is entry is used when the water is typically no more than 3 feet deep.\nWhen should a slide-in entry be used?\nIf the victim has a possible injury of the neck or spine, a lifeguard will typically use a slide-in entry. This is when a lifeguard slowly slides into the pool without causing any disturbances in the water, as that could affect the potential injury even more.\nIf a lifeguard saves a conscious victim who is showing ""active"" signs of help, this is called...?\nAn active-victim rescue involves a lifeguard saving a conscious person, or someone who shows active signs of needing help in the water. This is opposite from a passive-victim rescue, when the victim may be unconscious.\nWhat is an AED?\nAn AED is a device used to reset a victim\'s heart rhythm by using two pads on specific areas of the torso. AED stands for ""automated external defibrillator.""\nWhich of the following is NOT a duty of a lifeguard?\nLifeguards should not talk to other lifeguards, as this can create a distraction from a potential victim. A lifeguard\'s primary duties are to clean the pool area, provide first aid for minor injuries, scanning the swimming area and performing rescue operations.\nIf a lifeguard needs to make other lifeguards aware of a situation, how many short whistle blows will they use?\nThe answer is two short whistle blows. This is used to alert other lifeguards to a potential emergency situation. If a lifeguard needs to leave his or her station to respond to an emergency or perform a rescue, the two short whistle blasts will let other lifeguards know that backup help might be needed.\nIf a lifeguard saves a victim who is unconscious or showing ""passive"" signs of drowning, what is this called?\nA passive-victim rescue involves saving a victim who may be unconscious or showing unusual signs of drowning. This is different from an active-victim rescue, in which the victim is conscious.\nWhat is a stride jump?\nA stride jump is done from the edge of a pool, when the lifeguard extends one leg forward during the jump, like taking a stride when walking. This entry is typically used when the water is at least 5 feet deep.\nThis type of jump involves lightly tucking in the knees and jumping from a high point, like a lifeguard chair. Can you name it?\nA compact jump involves lightly tucking in the knees and jumping from a high point, like a lifeguard chair. The water should be at least 5 feet deep for this type of jump.\nIf a swimmer is near the edge of a pool and shows signs of distress, which method should a lifeguard use to perform a rescue operation?\nIf a victim is near the edge of a pool and shows signs of distress, a lifeguard can simply pull the person out of the water by reaching out to assist them, perhaps with the help of a rescue tube or a rescue pole.\nWhen is a simple assist used?\nA simple assist is used in shallow waters. This could include helping a victim regain their balance in shallow waters or rescuing a submerged victim who is near the edge of the pool.\nIf a victim is facing away from you as they are drowning, which type of rescue operation should be performed?\nIf a victim is facing away from you as they are drowning, an active victim rear rescue should be performed. In this approach, the lifeguard will grasp the victim under the arms from behind, supporting the victim\'s shoulders while kicking and pulling them back towards the shore or the side of the pool.\nThis technique is used to ""drag"" a victim from the water and to a safe place. What is it called?\nThis technique is called a beach drag. It\'s typically used in a beach setting to gently pull a victim out of the water and to a safe location. This method shouldn\'t be used if the victim might have a back, head or neck injury, as being pulled along the ground could cause worse damage.\nIf a lifeguard is about to perform a rescue, how many short whistle blows will they use?\nThe answer is three short whistle blows. This is used to indicate that a lifeguard is about to perform a rescue operation.\nThis type of assist is used to help a person walk from the water and to a safe location. What is it called?\nA walking assist is used to help a victim walk from the water and to a safe location. This is done by placing the arm of the victim around the lifeguard\'s shoulders for support.\nHow many lifeguards are needed to complete a front-and-back carry operation for a victim?\nTwo lifeguards are needed to complete a front-and-back carry. The first lifeguard holds the legs of the victim, while the second lifeguard offers support to the torso area. This method is used to carry a person who\'s unconscious or unable to move out of shallow water.\nWhich of the following is NOT a technique to open a victim\'s airway?\nA variety of techniques are used to open a victim\'s airway, but a spinal maneuver is not one of them. The other three techniques in the answer list are used to open the airway to allow for oxygen flow into the victim.\nWhen should a spinal rescue be used?\nA spinal board is used for spinal rescues, which may indicate a potential head, neck or spinal injury. This type of rescue also works in both shallow waters and deep waters.\nWhich of these is NOT an oxygen delivery device?\nAn AED is not a type of oxygen delivery device. Instead, it\'s used to reset the heart rhythm of a victim with a life-threatening irregular heartbeat. The rest of answers in the list are in fact oxygen delivery devices.\nWhat does 30:2 mean with regards to CPR?\n30:2 is a rule-of-thumb technique that is used to perform efficient CPR on a victim whose heart has stopped beating. It consists of a pattern of 30 chest compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths.\nWhen performing CPR, how many chest compressions should be administered to a victim over a 1-minute span?\nThe range of chest compressions that should be administered over a 1-minute span is 100-120. This is accomplished via the 30:2 rule, which consists of 30 chest compressions, followed by 2 rescue breaths (this cycle is repeated).\nHow many long whistle blows are used to clear the pool due to an emergency?\nTwo long whistle blows are used to clear the pool due to an emergency. This may also be used to signal swimmers that the pool is now closed.\nA lifeguard should spend ______ seconds or less when checking a victim\'s pulse.\nA lifeguard should spend no more than 10 seconds when checking the victim\'s pulse. A lifeguard must work quickly in emergency situations, and too much time spent on checking for a pulse may delay required treatment to a victim.\nWhat does H.A.IN.E.S stand for?\nH.A.IN.E.S stands for ""High arm in endangered spine."" It\'s a type of position in which a victim is turned to his or her side so that the spine is not potentially damaged. It also keeps the airway open.\nWhich of the following is NOT a sign of respiratory distress?\nJaundice refers to a yellow color in the white part of a person\'s eyeball and the skin. Jaundice can be caused by a number of different underlying medical conditions, but it is not a sign of respiratory distress. A lifeguard should look for sweating, abnormal breathing, dizziness and a blue color around the lips to detect if someone is in respiratory distress.\nIf a victim is consciously choking, how many back blows should a lifeguard perform?\nFive back blows should be performed by a lifeguard to a victim that is actively choking. This may be followed by five abdominal thrusts.\nIf a victim has severe hypoxia, which oxygen delivery device should a lifeguard use?\nA bag-valve mask, or BVM, should be used for a victim who has severe hypoxia, which is when the body is severely lacking oxygen. Also called a manual resuscitator or self-inflating bag, works by forcing air into the lungs and providing ventilation. A non-rebreather mask may also be used.\nThe acronym SAMPLE is used by lifeguards to conduct a quick health assessment for a victim. What does the ""P"" stand for?\nThe \'P\' in SAMPLE stands for ""past medical history. S = symptoms, A = allergies, M = medications, P = past medical history, L = last oral intake and E = events (which led to the current situation).\nIf a victim\'s nose is bleeding, what should a lifeguard do?\nThe nostrils should be pinched together by the victim to stop a nose bleed. Lifeguards can also utilize an ice pack on the nose as well.\nHow should a lifeguard handle a snakebite?\nAn elastic roller bandage should be applied to the affected area. This type of bandage reduces blood flow and can help prevent swelling. Of course, if it\'s possible the snake was venomous, expert medical care should also be sought immediately. The rest of the answers in the list should never be used for a snakebite.\nWhat is the red tube called that a lifeguard uses for various rescue operations?\nA rescue tube is used for various rescue operations. It is bright red in color and held in a horizontal position, across the lifeguard\'s waist.\nHow much do you know about dinosaurs? What is an octane rating? And how do you use a proper noun?

3	As a Civil War researcher: did John Brown's execution and Jeremiah Staley's enlistment happen close together?	John Brown was hanged on December 2, 1859, and Jeremiah Staley enlisted in the U.S. Army on August 25, 1860, approximately 8.5 months later. Staley enlisted at the Carlisle Barracks for five years of service in Co. C of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry during James Buchanan's presidency.	"[""Peter Staley, in the category 20 years through 29, is on the 1840 U.S. Census in Air Township, Bedford County, PA. There are four young children, aged one to nine, and one female between the ages of 30 through 39.\nAlthough the Civil War enlistment registers indicate that Jeremiah Staley was born in Fulton County, Pennsylvania, the first U.S. Census on which I found his name recorded was in Middle Woodbury Township, Bedford County, in 1850. He, 9 years old, and his father Pete(r) Staly, 37, were living in the same dwelling and household of John and Margaret Clay. John was a “smith,” whose real estate was worth $1,200. They had a six-year old son, named Daniel. I believe the census taker made a mistake by not recording Peter and Jeremiah as a separate family, because also living in the same dwelling were John and Catherine Diltz, with their six-month old daughter. The Diltz family was given a separate family number from the Clay family.\nIn 1860, Peter Staley (47), his wife Catharine (46), and their daughter Mary A. (16) were living in Colerain Township, Bedford County. Peter was a farmer. Several searches for Catharine and Mary in the 1850 census in Bedford County turned up nothing. There are no known reasons why they are not listed. By 1870, Catharine (55) was a widow and was still living in Colerain Township, by herself. Her real estate was worth $600 and her personal estate was valued at $100. I could not find Catharine Staley on any census record in Bedford County, in 1880.\nIn the beginning of my research, the only Civil War data I could find for Jeremiah was his PA Veterans Burial Card, which gave Co. C, 5th U.S. Cavalry July 11, 1864 to July 11, 1867. But, it also listed August 25, 1860 to July 11, 1864 as dates of service. There is no Pennsylvania Veterans digital card file, in the State archives for him, because he enlisted in the U.S. Army. Therefore, in what company and regiment did he serve, beginning eight months prior to the beginning of the Civil War? Finding the history of the regular U.S. army regiments is much more difficult than locating information on any one state’s regiments and companies. An informative Web site was found on the 5th U.S. Cavalry, which eventually led to U.S. Army Registers of Enlistments, at Ancestry.com. Jeremiah Staley is registered in five books, the first of which gave the missing information. His first enlistment was in Co. C., of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry, from August 25, 1860 to July 11, 1864.\nBefore moving forward with Jeremiah’s long military history, 17 days after enlisting in the 2nd U.S. Cavalry, Jeremiah was recorded on the September 11, 1860 U.S. Census, in the Borough of Greencastle. Since the 1850 census, he had grown into manhood, was on his own, moved over two mountain ranges into Franklin County, and was living with J. Newcomer, a blacksmith, in Greencastle. Jeremiah was 20 or 21 years old, and his occupation was listed as “blacksmith.” If he and his father Peter were living with a blacksmith, in Bedford County, PA, perhaps both father and son had learned the trade of blacksmithing.\nNewcomer and his wife Catherine had four children – Charles (15), Jer. (13), Mary (11), and Susan (9). Their real estate was valued at $3,000, while their personal estate was worth $1,000. Also, in the household was E. Lindsay, female, (28).\nWithout the muster rolls, it is not known why there is a 17-day difference between the enlistment and being enumerated on the census. From the two pages in the Descriptive and Historical born in Fulton County and he enlisted at the Carlisle Barracks, for five years of service. Lt. Baker described him as 5’5” tall, with grey eyes, light hair, and a fair complexion. Jeremiah gave his occupation as farmer.\nWhen Jeremiah enlisted in the U.S. Cavalry (Regular Army), James Buchanan, born in a log cabin in Cove Gap just west of Mercersburg, was still President of the United States. He is the only U.S. President who never married. His niece, Harriet Lane, also from Mercersburg, acted as the mistress of the White House. Abraham Lincoln won the November presidential election, beating three opponents. South Carolina, the first state to do so, seceded from the Union on December 20, 1860. On February 8, 1861, the Confederate States of America was formed with Jefferson Davis as its president. Lincoln was sworn in as President of the USA on March 4, 1861. The Civil War began on April 12, 1861, when the CSA began bombarding Federal Fort Sumter, Charleston, SC. U.S. Major Robert Anderson relinquished control of the fort to the Confederate States of America on April 14. Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers, on April 15, to fight the CSA. By May, 11 southern states had seceded. The first Battle of Bull Run (Manassas) was fought and lost to the Confederacy, on July 21, 1861.\nOn August 3, 1861, President Lincoln ordered the organization of the 5th U.S. Cavalry from the 2nd U.S. Cavalry, in which Jeremiah was enrolled. Throughout most of the war, the 5th U.S. Cavalry was attached to the Army of the Potomac, except from September 1864 to March 1865, when it was attached to the Army of the Shenandoah. On July 11, 1864, Jeremiah Staley reenlisted, for three years, at Light House Point, VA, into Co. C., 5th U.S. Cavalry. His last place of residence was Green Castle; he was a “career” soldier, and 25 years old. During the war, Jeremiah, as a member of the 5th U.S. Cavalry, was involved in reconnaissance; defending Washington City; the Battle of Williamsburg, VA; the Battle of Antietam, September 16 to 17, 1862; the Battle of Fredericksburg; the Chancellorsville Campaign; Stoneman’s Raid, April 29 to May 8, 1863; the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1 to 3, 1863. Jeremiah got very near home after the Battle of Gettysburg, when the 5th rode to Williamsport, MD, Boonsboro on July 8, Beaver Creek July 9, and Funkstown, MD from July 10 to 13. By the beginning of 1864, the 5th was back in VA on the Rapidan River, Charlottesville, the Rapidan Campaign, and the Battle of the Wilderness May 5 to 7. They were at Cold Harbor May 31 to June 1; Sheridan’s Trevillian Raid, the Siege of Petersburg, and Sheridan’s Shenandoah Valley Campaign to the end of 1864. At the beginning of 1865, the men of the 5th were involved in Sheridan’s Raid from Winchester, the Appomattox Campaign, and witnessed the surrender of Lee and his army. The 5th U.S. Cavalry marched to Washington and took part in the Grand Review, in front of President Lincoln, on May 23. During the Civil War, the regiment lost seven officers and 60 enlisted men, who were either killed or mortally wounded. Disease killed two officers and 90 enlisted men.\nOn July 11, 1867, while in Atlanta, GA, Jeremiah was discharged, upon expiration of his second tour of duty. Over the next 20 days, time was spent traveling from Georgia to Washington, D.C., where on August 1, 1867, Jeremiah Staley, a career soldier, reenlisted for the third time. This was his second tour of duty in the 5th U.S. Cavalry, except he served in Co. K. He was 27 years of age, 5’5”, with hazel eyes, brown hair, and a ruddy complexion. A year and a month later, it is recorded in the “remarks” column of the enlistment book that Jeremiah deserted on September 11, 1868. All totaled, from this one page of 40 soldiers, there were 12 deserters, one death, and one dishonorably discharged soldier; all the rest were honorably discharged. Again, without the Jeremiah’s muster rolls, the specifics of what was going on are not known.\nThe last document which gives any information about his time in the service is the 1890 Special Veterans Schedule, which was enumerated during the 11th Census. Technically, if any veteran served more than one tour of duty, any and all tours were included on the Special Schedule. Jeremiah served three tours of duty, eight years and 17 days, from August 25, 1860 to September 11, 1868. Only his first tour of duty is included on the June 1890 Special Schedule. Charles Ruthrauff, the enumerator, in Greencastle, noted that Jeremiah was blind and that he had the “small pox in service.” The extent of his blindness is not known.\nTwo years later, on the July 22, 1870 census, after leaving the service, Jeremiah is recorded as working for the Railroad. He is not married. Leaping forward to information garnered from the cemetery headstone and the 1900 census, we know that Jeremiah married shortly after the 1870 census, which was recorded on July 22. Jeremiah and his wife Anna M. had a son Alburtis A., born on December 19, 1872. Their daughter Emma F. was born October 9, 1877. Two and a half years later, Anna died on April 16, 1880, aged 32 years, 4 months, and 6 days. She was born on December 10, 1847. A little over a year after her mother died, little Emma died, on June 21 1881, at age three years, eight months, and 12 days. They are buried beside each other in the Cedar Hill Cemetery. Anna did not show up on any census records with Jeremiah because they married after the 1870 census was taken and she died April 16, 1880, a month and a half before the 1880 census in Greencastle was recorded, the first few days of June.\nOn January 13, 1879, Jeremiah applied for his pension. Only Co. C, 5th U.S. Cavalry was listed on the application. After a couple hours of searching, page by page, I have been unable to find Jeremiah Staley in the 1880 U.S. Census, in Greencastle or Antrim Township. It is most likely because of a spelling error of either his first or last name, or it was incorrectly transcribed into the search engines. The 1880 census search will continue.\nThe U.S. Census records skip from 1880 to 1900, because of a fire that destroyed the majority of the 1890 census records. Jeremiah remarried 10 or 11 years after the death of Anna M, his first wife. Adding to the confusion is the fact that his second wife’s first name was, also, Ann or Anna, Annie E(lizabeth). The White family genealogy indicates that Annie E. was called “Lib.” Jeremiah and Lib were married in 1891. The 1900 census was recorded in Greencastle on June 14. Jeremiah and his second wife, Annie E., were living on Madison Street, in Greencastle. They owned their home, free and clear of a mortgage. He and Annie had been married for eight years. They had two daughters, Helen B., born June 3, 1892, and Ruth C., born October 14, 1893. Alburtis A., from Jeremiah’s first marriage, was born 20 years before Helen. He was a day laborer but had been out of work for most of the year. The three adults were all able to read and write.\nJeremiah Staley died on July 24, 1903, aged 61 years, 6 months, and 14 days. He is buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery, Section K, Lot 37, Antrim Township, Franklin County, PA. Annie, as Jeremiah’s widow, applied for his pension on August 21, 1903. She was left with two young daughters, aged 11 and nine.\nJeremiah was not a member of Greencastle-Antrim’s Corp. Rihl GAR Post #438, but by his grave is a GAR marker with a holder for the U.S. flag. Jeremiah died in July 1903, between meetings of the local GAR chapter. I surmise, from the minutes, that Post #438 provided the iron GAR markers for all Union soldiers, whether they were members of the GAR or not, until the October 2, 1903 meeting of the Post. The following is from the minutes of that evening. “On motion of Comrade J. R. Davison, it was resolved that the markers now on hand in this Post be hereafter used for members in good standing of this Grand Army of the Republic, only, and that this Post will petition the County Commissioners to furnish iron markers for the graves of deceased Union soldiers, who are not members of the Grand Army of the Republic.”\nJeremiah was buried alongside his first wife, Anna M., who died April 16, 1880, and their daughter Emma F., who died June 21, 1881. Annie E., Jeremiah’s second wife is not buried in the Staley family burial lot, perhaps because she remarried.\nHelen B. grew up and married Clifford K. White. Their children were: Kathleen, Clifford Jr. “Bud”, and Aria. Kathleen “Katty” married Glen Grosh. They had one son Thomas, who passed away.\nClifford Jr. and his wife Ruth had three children: Clifford III (wife Evelyn); Constance “Connie” (married Dan Vanderau); and Robert “Bob” (wife Debbie).\nJeremiah’s and Lib’s second daughter Ruth C. married a Beeler and they moved south.\nThe following is the transcription of Jeremiah’s discharge and reenlistment paper, which were donated, along with a photograph of Jeremiah, to Allison-Antrim Museum, by Clifford III and Evelyn White.\nTo all whom it may concern.\nKnow ye, that Jeremiah Staley, a private of Capt.

The Republicans initially nominate John Sherman, an Ohioan with moderate views on slavery, but Sherman’s support for a controversial anti-slavery book entitled The Impending Crisis derails his nomination. The Democrats counter with several nominations, including Thomas S. Bocock of Virginia and John A. McClernand of Illinois, but these nominees are also unsuccessful in part because of splits within their party. In February, the Republicans elect William Pennington as Speaker of the House with 119 votes, the exact number needed to win. The debates in Congress during this period are heated and many members carry weapons. Southern congressmen talk openly of secession in the event of a Republican presidential victory in November.\nJanuary, 1860—The Democratic Party of Alabama adopts a resolution which instructs the state’s delegates to the Convention in Charleston to “insist” on a clause in the national platform calling for a law to protect slavery in the territories. Moreover, the delegates are instructed to withdraw from the convention if such a clause is rejected.\nFebruary 2, 1860—Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis introduces a series of resolutions in the upper house which call for a federal code protecting slavery in the territories. The resolutions are passed by the Senate Democratic caucus, an action which further divides the party along sectional lines.\nFebruary 27, 1860—Abraham Lincoln delivers his famous Cooper Union Address in New York City, which presents a compelling case on the Founding Fathers’ objections to the spread of slavery. The speech is widely reprinted in northern newspapers and helps Lincoln secure his party’s presidential nomination.\nMarch, 1860—The Virginia House of Delegates overwhelmingly rejects a proposal by South Carolina to organize a convention of southern states.\nMarch 5, 1860—The Republican-controlled House of Representatives approves the formation of a committee to investigate alleged corruption and malfeasance in the Buchanan administration. The president criticizes the investigation as a partisan plot to besmirch his “personal and official integrity.” Hearings continue through June.\nApril 30, 1860—Fifty southern delegates to the Democratic national convention storm out of Institute Hall in Charleston, South Caroli na in order to protest their party’s unwillingness to endorse a federal code protecting slavery in the territories.\nMay 9, 1860—The newly-formed Constitutional Union Party opens its convention in Baltimore. John Bell of Tennessee becomes the party’s presidential nominee. Comprised mainly of conservative Whigs and Know-Nothings concerned about the gathering crisis, the party advertises itself as an alternative to “Black Republicanism” and Democratic demagoguery. The delegates refuse to adopt a platform, instead pledging themselves solely to the preservation of the Union and the Constitution.\nMay 16, 1860—The Republican convention opens in Chicago. William Seward emerges early as the party’s strongest presidential candidate, but is defeated by Abraham Lincoln on the third ballot. Lincoln has fewer enemies within the Republican ranks and is viewed by most members as a political moderate. The party platform calls for a higher tariff, a ban on slavery in the territories, federal money for internal improvement projects, and a homestead act.\nJune 11, 1860—Delegates who joined the walkout in Charleston meet in Richmond in an unsuccessful attempt to nominate a candidate and approve a party platform.\nJune 18, 1860—The Democratic national convention reconvenes in Baltimore after the Charleston impasse. Anti-Douglas delegates from Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Maryland, California, Oregon, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas withdraw from the meeting in order to protest the assembly’s decision to seat newly-elected, pro-Douglas state delegations. Stephen A. Douglas is nominated as the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate by the remaining delegates. Shortly thereafter, a group of disgruntled delegates assembles a competing convention in Baltimore which nominates John C. Breckinridge, a federal slave code supporter, for president. The Democratic Party is split into two sectional factions.\nJune 22, 1860—Under pressure from the Southern Democracy, President James Buchanan vetoes a homestead bill which calls for the distribution of 160 acres of government land to each citizen willing to improve it. The vote in Congress is along sectional lines. In the House, 114 of the 115 votes in favor of the bill are cast by free-state representatives, while 64 of the 65 “nays” come from slave-state Congressmen. Southerners realize that the homestead bill will disproportionately benefit the free states. The sectional divide within the Democratic Party strengthens the Republican Party’s chances for victory in November.\nJuly 6, 1860—In a letter intended for publication, New York City Mayor Fernando Wood proposes that Democrats run John Breckinridge unopposed in southern states and Stephen Douglas alone in northern ones in order to thwart Lincoln’s election.\nAugust 13, 1860—During a speech in Boston, William Seward describes Lincoln as “a soldier on the side of freedom in the irrepressible conflict between freedom and slavery.”\nAugust 25, 1860—From the steps of Norfolk’s City Hall, presidential candidate Stephen Douglas tells a crowd of seven thousand Virginians that he believes Lincoln’s election would not be a just cause for secession and that the federal government has the right to use force in order to preserve the Union.\nSeptember 5, 1860—Presidential candidate John Breckinridge tells a crowd in Lexington, Kentucky that Democratic rival Stephen Douglas espouses principles which are “repugnant alike to reason and the Constitution.”\nOctober 5, 1860—A massive “Wide-Awake” torchlight parade takes place in New York City. The Wide-Awakes were young Republicans who staged theatrical nighttime rallies during the campaign of 1860 to show their support for Lincoln’s candidacy.\nNovember 6, 1860—Americans go the polls and elect Abraham Lincoln as the sixteenth president of the United States. Lincoln receives 1,866,452 popular votes and 180 electoral votes from 17 of the 33 states. Not a single slave state endorses Lincoln. Stephen Douglas receives 1,376,957 popular votes and 12 electoral votes; John Breckinridge receives 849, 781 popular votes and 72 electoral votes; and John Bell receives 588, 879 popular votes and 39 electoral votes.\nNovember 9, 1860—Lame duck president James Buchanan convenes a cabinet meeting to discuss the national crisis that has been unleashed in the wake of Lincoln’s election. Like the country as a whole, his advisors are split over the issue of secession. Buchanan proposes a convention of the states with the object of hammering out a compromise. Secretary of State Lewis Cass (MI) argues that the Union should be preserved at all costs, even if that means using force. Attorney General Jeremiah Sullivan Black (PA) shares Cass’ opinion. Postmaster General Joseph Holt (KY) opposes both secession and Buchanan’s idea for a convention. Secretary of the Treasury Howell Cobb (GA) believes secession is legal and necessary. Secretary of the Interior Jacob Thompson (MS) agrees with Cobb and says any show of force by the U.S. government will force his native Mississippi out of the Union. Secretary of War John Floyd (VA) opposes secession because he believes it is unnecessary. Secretary of the Navy Isaac Toucey (CT) endorses Buchanan’s convention idea.\nNovember 10, 1860—Both of South Carolina’s senators, James Chesnut, Jr. and James H. Hammond, resign their seats. The legislature of South Carolina orders a convention to meet in Columbia on December 17 to decide whether or not the state should remain in the Union.\nNovember 13, 1860—The South Carolina legislature authorizes the raising of ten thousand men for the state’s defense.\nNovember 14, 1860—Alexander Stephens, the future vice-president of the Confederacy, addresses the Georgia legislature and speaks out against secession. He argues that the South should pursue a more moderate course and, “Let the fanatics of the North break the Constitution, if such is their fell purpose.”\nNovember 18, 1860—The Georgia legislature authorizes one million dollars for weapon purchases.\nNovember 23, 1860—Major Robert Anderson issues a report from Charleston which identifies Fort Sumter as the key to the defense of the city’s harbor. In addition, he argues that secession is a fait accompli in South Carolina.\nDecember 4, 1860—President Buchanan sends his State of the Union message to Congress, which attempts to appease both northerners and southerners. He views secession as a consequence of the “intemperate interference of the Northern people with the question of slavery” and urges the North to respect the sovereignty and rights of the southern states. At the same time, Buchanan condemns secession and signals his intent to defend any federal forts in the South that come under attack. Both sides are displeased with the speech. The House of Representatives creates a Committee of Thirty-three (one member per state) to study the country’s crisis and issue recommendations.\nDecember 8, 1860—The first rupture in Buchanan’s cabinet occurs when Secretary of the Treasury Howell Cobb (GA) resigns his post. A former unionist, Cobb has come to believe that the “evil” of Black Republicanism is “beyond control” and must be met with resistance. The same day, a group of South Carolina congressmen visits the White House and encourages Buchanan to relinquish federal property to their state.\nDecember 10, 1860—South Carolina congressmen meet with Buchanan and promise that their forces will not attack U.S. forts before the issue of secession is debated, or the two governments reach an agreement, as long as the military status quo is maintained.\nDecember 12, 1860—Secretary of State Lewis Cass (MI) resigns over Buchanan’s decision not to reinforce the federal forts in Charleston.\nDecember 13, 1860—Twenty-three House members and seven Senators from the South make a public announcement calling for the creation of a Southern Confederacy.\nDecember 17, 1860—South Carolina’s Secession Convention opens in Columbia.\nDecember 20, 1860—Delegates to South Carolina’s Secession Convention vote 169 to 0 to leave the Union. President Buchanan is stunned by the news. The Palmetto State’s decision emboldens secessionists in other southern states.\nDecember 26, 1860—Major Robert Anderson moves his small force from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter. He believes the former location will soon be attacked and that the change of location is necessary to “prevent the effusion of blood.” South Carolinians view the troop transfer as a violation of their agreement with Buchanan to maintain the status quo.\nDecember 29, 1860—Secretary of War John B. Floyd (VA) resigns over Buchanan’s decision not to overrule Anderson’s troop transfer.\nDecember 30, 1860—South Carolinians seize the Federal Arsenal at Charleston, making Fort Sumter the last piece of federal property in the state controlled by the United States government.\nJanuary 8, 1861—President Buchanan sends a special message to Congress which endorses Senator John J. Crittenden’s proposal to resurrect the old Missouri Compromise line. Also, Buchanan places the onus of responsibility for solving the crisis on the legislative branch. The last southerner in the president’s cabinet, Secretary of the Interior Jacob Thompson (MS), resigns.\nJanuary 9, 1861—Mississippi secedes from the Union. In Charleston, southern guns fire on the Star of the West as it attempts to re-supply Fort Sumter. The ship withdraws and sets course for New York.\nJanuary 10, 1861—Florida secedes from the Union. Lieutenant Adam Slemmer moves his small federal garrison from Barrancas Barracks at Pensacola to Fort Pickens on Santa Rosa Island. Slemmer refuses repeated surrender demands from Florida authorities, allowing Fort Pickens to remain in Union hands for the duration of the war.\nJanuary 11, 1861—Alabama secedes from the Union.\nJanuary 14, 1861—The chairman of the Committee of Thirty-three, Thomas Corwin (OH), presents the group’s report to the House of Representatives. Recommendations include a Constitutional amendment guaranteeing slavery where it exists, a repeal of northern “personal liberty laws”, and jury trials for fugitive slaves. The committee does not unanimously approve of the proposals.\nJanuary 16, 1861—The Crittenden Compromise is defeated in the Senate.\nJanuary 19, 1861—Georgia secedes from the Union.\nJanuary 21, 1861—Five senators from Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi bid farewell to their colleagues in the upper house. Among them is Senator Jefferson Davis, future president of the Confederacy.\nJanuary 26, 1861—Louisiana secedes from the Union.\nJanuary 29, 1861—Kansas is admitted to the Union sans slavery.\nFebruary 1, 1861—Texas secedes from the Union.\nFebruary 4, 1861—The convention of seceded states opens in Montgomery, Alabama as a Peace Convention called by Virginia gets underway in Washington. One of the delegates at the latter meeting is former president John Tyler. Louisiana Senators Judah Benjamin and John Slidell resign their seats.\nFebruary 8, 1861—Delegates in Montgomery adopt a provisional constitution for the Confederate States of America. The document contains only a few variations from the U.S. Constitution, among which are a clause protecting slavery and one that prohibits tariffs designed to protect domestic industry.\nFebruary 9, 1861—Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens are elected Provisional President and Vice-President of the Confederacy respectively. Both men are considered political moderates. In Tennessee, voters reject a call for a secession convention.\nFebruary 18, 1861—Jefferson Davis is inaugurated as president of the Confederacy during a ceremony in Montgomery, Alabama.\nFebruary 23, 1861—Abraham Lincoln arrives in Washington on a special train at the behest of his security team. The President-elect’s clandestine journey is lampooned by a number of newspaper cartoonists, who inflate wild rumors that he was disguised as a Scotsman.\nFebruary 27, 1861—The Peace Convention proposes six constitutional amendments to Congress—most relate to the impasse over slavery. None passes. The House of Representatives rejects a call for a constitutional convention and the Crittenden Compromise.\nFebruary 28, 1861—The House passes a measure supported by President-elect Lincoln which prohibits the federal government from interfering with slavery in states where it exists.\nMarch 1, 1861—Confederate President Jefferson Davis appoints P.G.T. Beauregard as commander of southern forces guarding Charleston. Congress organizes two new territories, Nevada and Dakota, and passes the Morrill Tariff Act, which raises taxes on imports.\nMarch 4, 1861—Abraham Lincoln is inaugurated as President of the United States in Washington. He tells the crowd gathered around the Capitol that he has no intention of interfering with slavery, but that secession is illegal and the Union perpetual.\nMarch 5, 1861—Lincoln learns from Major Anderson that Fort Sumter must either be re-supplied or abandoned within a matter of weeks. The president understands that surrendering the fort would mean a loss of federal sovereignty, but that sending supplies would likely start a war. He loses sleep over the situation.\nMarch 29, 1861—After days of deliberation and careful consultation with his cabinet, Lincoln decides to re-supply Forts Sumter and Pickens.\nApril 4, 1861—In an 89 to 45 vote, the Virginia State Convention rejects an ordinance of secession.\nApril 6, 1861—Lincoln dispatches a State Department employee to inform South Carolina Governor Francis Pickens that the federal government will re-provision Fort Sumter. The president makes it clear that no additional troops will be sent to the fort if supply ships are allowed to land.\nApril 10, 1861—Confederate Secretary of War LeRoy Walker authorizes Beauregard to use force if the federal government attempts to re-supply Fort Sumter.\nApril 11, 1861—Major Anderson refuses a request from the Confederate government to surrender Fort Sumter.

4	As an environmental health researcher, I'm curious about how dust storms' impacts on infrastructure differ between China's manufacturing regions and coastal areas - can you compare the types of structural damage seen in these different zones?	In China's manufacturing regions, dust storms combine with mining dust, salt, and industrial chemicals, creating particularly corrosive conditions for infrastructure. When these storms move through heavy manufacturing corridors, the mixed pollutants compound the potential for damage. In coastal areas, the dust storms can cause different types of structural impacts - the particles contain high levels of salts that can corrode buildings and built infrastructure. Additionally, both regions face infrastructure challenges like damage to roads, swimming pools, and construction infrastructure such as oil pipelines that may become buried during storms. The storms also disrupt transportation and energy supply systems across both areas, though coastal regions like Japan experience fewer incidents due to ocean protection.	['It takes more than just gritting your teeth and bearing it\nOf all the weather conditions you may have imagined experiencing on a trip to East Asia, rolling storms of dust were probably not what immediately came to mind. They are infrequent; however, at some point in the year, each year in the 2010s, every place in China from Beijing to Hong Kong and even out over Taiwan experienced at least one such event. Korea sometimes gets nicked; Japan has been affected much less frequently thanks to its ocean shield.\nDesertification - in particular the growth of the Gobi Desert in mid-northern China, stretching eastward ever closer to Beijing - is a major concern to the central government. Not only are there implications about being able to grow food for a big country, but the storms disrupt transportation and energy supplies as well. The areas most routinely affected have high concentrations of ethnic minorities - and when supply lines are cut to the big cities, sometimes tempers get short. If you’re trying to manage “social harmony”, if you want to keep the economy growing without supply shocks, if you want jobs in the cities and the countryside, and if you don’t want to have to import your food from foreign countries, then you have to solve this problem.\nAnother issue with these storms is that their tracks often take them over the key mining and extraction regions in the central part of the country, and then over some of the heaviest manufacturing corridors before moving into key population centers. Mining dust, salt, and industrial chemicals latch onto the grit in the air, compounding the health dangers.\nHow can you prepare?\nSandstorms usually happen in late Spring - mid Summer, and take some time to get going. They have more mass to move so the systems are slower than rain or wind. They usually begin in the far west - Xinjiang and Gansu provinces. Storms will be well-covered in the national media; in the weeks before your trip, check news sites like the China Daily several times.\nIf it looks like storms will be developing, pick up several packs of disposable face masks at your local pharmacy. Also pack a lightweight scarf or kerchief, and saline for your eyes and nose.\nWhen a storm arrives\nSometimes the storm arrives in shades, slowly materializing over several days. Other times it crashes in with lightning and rolling clouds. When it comes:\nStay inside as much as possible - your local agency contact will advise you if plans need to change.\nCheck your windows, and plug any gaps with towels.\nKeep your electronics packed up as well as you can. Cameras, spinning hard drives, and touchscreens are especially susceptible to damage.\nStay clean - keep your eyes, ears, and nose clear with damp cloths and saline. Pay extra attention to your child, as younger tissues are more sensitive. Chemical toxicity is tied to how much time you’ve been in contact with a substance, so frequent cleaning - regardless of how dirty you may look - is the best policy.\nKeep hydrated - and keep your water bottles tightly capped.\nIf you must go out, cover up with a light scarf and face mask.\nWith awareness, common-sense preparation, and keeping calm while hunkering down, you and your family will remain safe.', 'Sand and dust storms cause significant negative impacts on society, economy and environment at local, regional and global scale. There are three key factors responsible for the generation of sand and dust storms – strong wind, lack of vegetation and absence of rainfall. The environmental and health hazards of such storms cannot be reduced permanently, however its impact can be reduced by taking appropriate measures.\nAs the dust cloud rises, it reduces the horizontal visibility which can impact human life in many ways. The fine suspended particles also contain contaminants, bacteria, pollens, which cause negative health impacts such as allergies and respiratory diseases. Dust also carries air borne pollutants such as toxins, heavy metals, salt, sulphur, pesticides etc which cause significant health impacts when people inhale the contaminated dust. Dust can corrode buildings and other built infrastructure as it contains high level of salts, especially in the GCC countries. The major impacts of sand and dust storms are listed below:\nEnvironmental and Health Impacts\n- Poor air quality – This is due to increase in contaminant loads and dangerously high level of breathable suspended particles in the air during sand and dust storms.\n- Increase in environmental hazards relating to transportation, building and health.\n- Dust deposition on landscape can cause drying of leaves, retard the growth of plant and cause damage to crops.\n- Suspended dust particles in water can obstruct the penetration of sunlight into the sea floor and hence affect marine life cycle.\n- Ill heath from inhalation of fine suspected dust particles and pollutants present in the dust\n- Road accidents and aviation hazards due to poor visibility\n- Delay in landing and take-off of air flights and restricted ship movement\n- Increase in stress associated with crop damage\n- Damage to physical structures such as buildings, roads, swimming pools etc. due to dust deposition\n- Costs associated with cleaning of infiltrated dust inside the house and building and cleaning of vehicles\n- Cost of removing sand from road and buildings\n- Costs associated with accidents, material loss, delay in flights, delay in movement of vehicles,\n- Costs associated with clearing of buried construction infrastructure such as oil pipelines due to sand and dust during the storms\nReducing the Effect of Sand and Dust Storms\nThe effects of sand and dust storms can be reduced by using a number of health & safety measures and environmental control strategies. Large-scale sand and dust storms are generally natural phenomena and it may not be always practicable to prevent it happening. However, control measures can be taken to reduce its impacts. Localised small-scale dust emission due to human induced activities can be reduced by using temporary mechanical methods such as concrete barrier, mulching, tree buffer etc.\n- Take appropriate control of dust raising factors such as increasing the vegetation cover where possible. It helps in stabilization of the soil, sand dunes and form windbreaks.\n- Use of native plants and trees as buffer can reduce wind velocity and sand drifts at the same increase the soil moisture\n- Design buildings appropriately and conduct air infiltration testing during building commissioning.\nSome health and safety measures that should be taken to minimise the adverse impacts due to the dust storm are:\n- Take extra precautionary measures for vulnerable population group such as children, elderly and sick people.\n- Use dust masks – Dust masks have filters which can filter out small particles and contaminants. Hence, mask should be used during the dust storms. Put a wet towel or tissue on the nose and mouth and drink lots of fluid.\n- Clean your face, nose and mouth frequently to prevent any dust entering into lungs and inhale some water through your nose in order to clean the nose of dust particles.\n- Close the doors and windows tightly, pulling all curtains up and put wet towels on the small holes that may be round windows\n- Restricting outdoor activities and staying inside the house.\n- Speer MS (2013) Dust storm frequency and impact over Eastern Australia determined by state of Pacific climate system.

5	what original meaning first second third world terms cold war	The terms First, Second, and Third World were originally designed to describe a country's access to nuclear weapons and ideological placement on the democracy-socialism spectrum. First World meant nuclear-capable democracies like the United States, Second World referred to Soviet nations, and Third World comprised countries that were up for ideological grab.	['Toward a Better Understanding of Emerging Markets\nBy Veronica Peterson\nThe conventional account of the current financial industry’s concern with what are referred to as the Emerging Markets begins in the Cold War at the World Bank Group. The World Bank was founded after the Second World War as an umbrella organization to “end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity” by making leveraged loans to countries ravaged by war and to countries whose poverty could be attributed to other reasons (usually their non-democratic political orientation). From this arise the questions economists are asking today: What exactly causes a market to “emerge”? What markets actually belong to this group?\nThere are some more recent reasons why we have begun to rethink our understanding of emerging markets. After the financial and global economic crisis in 2009, the countries within the Emerging Markets category, responded differently from the developed economies as well as from each other (see figure 1). Even still, current discussions about a great “de-coupling” of markets operate under the old assumptions that led to the surprise market performances in the first place.\nThe financial industry’s concern with emerging markets is divorced from a context that relates our own understanding of these places with the realities of the people living in them. By examining both, we can reveal possibilities and establish a foundation for challenging the status quo. This article sets the stage for a series of pieces to come in the future on emerging markets and relevant issues.\nA Rose by Any Other Name\nThe Emerging Markets are all about access. Specifically, the degree to which outsiders can tap into domestic markets. The term “Emerging Markets” is attributed to Antoine van Agtmael of the International Finance Corporation, a branch of the World Bank Group who coined the term due to the opening of formerly closed countries to foreign direct investment. By the 1980’s, opportunities were increasing for international business in Third World countries and van Agtmael wanted to set up a fund that would give investors a line in on the coming fortune. But investors were not interested in a “Third World” fund; the term’s connotations were too negative. “Emerging Markets”, on the other hand, depicted an inevitable prosperity, nations emerging from the depths of economic depravity into the warm embrace of their developed brethren. The exact same countries were at play; only the pernicious charge of “Third World” was relegated to the trash bin of politically incorrect.\nIt is helpful to remember that the terms “First”, “Second”, and “Third” were designed to describe a country’s access to nuclear weapons and their ideological placement on the democracy-socialism spectrum. The United States was the paradigm of the First World, a nuclear capable democracy, “Second World” was used less often as the term “Soviet Reds”, perhaps a more common way of describing that sphere. The Third World, then, was comprised of countries up for ideological grab. Because our own political identity is very much wrapped up in our economic identity, and since we were “developed” and the Third World was not, the term evolved to be less concerned with nuclear status and more so with economic status. It began to describe nations of closed markets and abject poverty (regardless of nuclear capabilities) thereby linking economic orientation to physical well-being in the Western culture while ignoring the devastating effects of imperial and colonial legacies on the economies in question.\nInstitutions like the World Bank, in addition to providing the funds to rebuild Europe after the war, were set up to nudge those Third World countries closer to the free market, but more importantly, away from the socialist end of the spectrum. The successfulness of their endeavors is another topic in and of itself, but what is important to take away is that the name change from Third World to Emerging Markets was done in order to soothe the worries of the Western investor. These were individual countries, grouped together in a Western cultural imagination. With the US the clear victor in a war that drew in the entire world, considering its system as the best for organizing resources, knowledge and power was an entirely understandable conclusion. Had it not just been proven on the global battlefield? Therefore, it did not matter that Brazilians and Chinese would not, under ordinary circumstance, put themselves in the same group. For Western purposes, the only relevant characteristic was the freeness of Brazil or China’s markets. Since both were closed and now starting to open, it was only a matter of time until they caught up with the rest of the developed world.\nTo a certain extent this is true, and the opening of markets has been the fastest way to raise living standards but when we look at particulars we start to see some problematic assumptions underlying this understanding of the world. Mainly, that in the course of our entire existence as human beings, two cultures rarely develop the exact same way and thinking that they do has led to calamitous policies and events. Justin Yifu Lin, a former chief economist of the World Bank, has shown how it is possible to develop economies within structured economies, citing China’s mix of special economic zones where free markets can develop but the economy as a whole is controlled. One may philosophically disapprove of the Chinese Communist Party but cannot ignore the country’s meteoric economic growth.\nAnother way to look at it is that around the world, humans perform similar actions but attribute vastly different meaning to those actions. For instance, humans figured out how to ferment grain into alcohol while separated by oceans and deserts. In some situations, consuming alcohol is a social activity and in others, religious. The same object: alcohol, the same activity: imbibing, but totally different meanings. We can say the same thing about the creation of money and the operation of the market resulting in totally different formulations of meaning. If we consider a market a place where two parties exchange things of value, why these two parties are involved is rarely a question asked by economists. On the other hand, for most people (and institutions), why they are spending money is dearer than how they must go about it.\nIn the US, the freeness and distinctiveness of markets (the idea that the market is separable from other aspects of our life) is central to our understanding of the world. This is why economists are unconcerned with why two people may want to meet in the market. That is the efficiency of the market in and of itself. But ours is not the only way to make meaning nor is it the only way markets are used. To expect everyone to hold meaning the same way we do is to ignore the vast formulations of human perception.\nAll of this is a long-winded way to say that arguing over what we should call this group of previously non-open markets is counter-productive and ultimately the wrong question to be asking. What we name something is integral to formulating our own cultural understanding of the world. By naming these disparate countries as one, we therefore think of them as one. Changing the name from “Third World” to “Emerging Markets” doesn’t change any of the underlying assumptions. Instead, we should look at the places we currently do have the opportunity to invest and think critically about each individual place. By focusing on the more discrete actors, by taking the economies as their own, we can better analyze their intricacies, networks, and global implications.\nOne of the reasons Emerging Markets are included in portfolios is precisely because they were supposedly unconstrained by the limits of emerged markets. Then came globalization and we assumed that the world would act in unison. Anthropologists have been showing how the increase in global flows, communication, technology, materials, knowledge, etc. does not necessitate a uniform culture. People must still respond to local forces. To group them all together, therefore, is to put oftentimes competing and chaotic forces into the same basket and then wonder why they acted in such a way.\nWe can see this in the reactions of the individual parties to the drop in oil prices last year. Some stock markets were unaffected; others tanked. It wasn’t the degree to which a market was open or closed, how long it had been “emerging” or any such factor, but the degree to which it was exposed to the oil industry. A logical conclusion, but holding the whole basket would have left the investor drooping under its weight. A lot of people bailed out of emerging markets as a whole during the oil drop. Evaluating each market on their own terms would have allowed the investor to determine which markets to stay in (China, India) and which may not make the best long term investment (Russia).\nThe emerging markets, as a group and individually, are volatile. They areplaces that most Western investors are unfamiliar with. The name of companies don’t ring any bells and cultural factors have implications for the market that may not be so obvious; the month long Spring Festival in China artificially depresses economic data in January or February depending on where the lunar cycle falls. Yet never before have there been so many ways to selectively invest in the so-called Emerging Markets and often in surprising ways (plenty of global corporations are exposed to markets that are generally closed to outsiders).\nThe less that is known about an investment, the greater the chance of price inefficiencies. It takes time, effort, and the ability to look at each market through the lens of its participants to find these inefficiencies and test your convictions. Questioning the conventional explanations and worries of the industry (including the media) will form a strong foundation that can be applied to any type of investment but serve especially well when entering less familiar investment territory.']	['<urn:uuid:7ebe33cb-765a-435d-ad84-e4f5d475ee47>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	10	51	1649
6	What is the fundamental issue with brilliant constitutional law theories like those proposed for interpreting vague clauses in the Constitution?	The fundamental issue is that brilliant constitutional interpretations conflict with the principle of consent of the governed. The Fourteenth Amendment was drafted by John Bingham, who, based on his public speeches, was likely not as intelligent as modern law professors. It's difficult to believe he could have had in mind notions so ingenious that no one thought of them until modern scholars came along. Since a brilliant theory is by definition one that wouldn't occur to most people, there's a logical problem: how can most people have agreed to something they couldn't even conceive of? This makes such brilliant interpretations inherently suspect.	['In most fields of intellectual endeavor, the highest praise is reserved for brilliant insights that overturn conventional thinking and common sense. Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity, for example, changed completely the way we think about the interrelationship of time and space. Economists and legal scholars, always looking over their shoulders at the “hard sciences,” traditionally have applied the same standards in their own fields. But actually, “brilliance”—new ideas that turn conventional thinking on its head—should count heavily against an economic or legal theory.\nMy first example, the famous “Coase Theorem,” is an especially good illustration of a theory done in by its own brilliance, because it derives from the boundary between law and economics. Before Professor Ronald Coase’s work two decades ago, the accepted wisdom was that legal rules could improve economic efficiency by preventing firms from imposing costs on outsiders. For example, people pollute because the cost is imposed on their neighbors, or society in general, not on themselves. If they had to pay the whole cost of their pollution, they wouldn’t do it.\nCoase stood this notion on its head, showing that legal rules are virtually irrelevant because, with or without them, people can negotiate to reach the efficient result. For example, even without laws against pollution, pollution victims could band together and bribe polluters to shut down. Pollution is inefficient if the costs borne by pollution victims exceed the benefits to the polluter—and, Coase triumphantly asserts, these are exactly the circumstances in which rational victims would bribe the polluter to stop. There is a tale, possibly apocryphal, that when Coase first presented this paper at the University of Chicago, his audience was astounded and was persuaded of his theory’s validity only after hours of argument. Since then, the Coase Theorem has spawned a huge literature and has become a cornerstone of the conservative academic movement called “law and economics.\nAlthough many scholars have attacked the Coase Theorem, the best reason to reject it is that it is simply too brilliant. The reason the Theorem astounded Coase’s audience is that we do not commonly observe people behaving as the Theorem contemplates. If we did, the Theorem would hardly be surprising. Saying that pollution victims pay bribes is startling precisely because it does not really happen.\nIn other words, brilliance is not merely evidence that a theory is invalid, but a likely cause of its invalidity. If the idea that victims could bribe polluters is startling, people are not likely to think of it themselves. If they do not think of it themselves, they are not likely to do it. If only a brilliant person can think of doing something, it is unlikely that most people will adopt that course of conduct. Most people, after all, are not brilliant.\nEconomics assumes that, by and large, people behave rationally, or at least that they act as if they were rational. Indeed, rationality has been said to be the core assumption of economics, distinguishing it from the other social sciences. When critics argue that real-life people and firms are incapable of performing the complicated mathematical calculations involved in modem economic theories, economists respond that whatever decision-making process they do use, people who act according to the theory will prosper and survive, while their competitors will be forced out of the market. But this illustrates the fundamental defect of brilliant theories. If a brilliant theory is true, it should have been discovered in the marketplace. Because it has not been discovered—or else it would not now be considered brilliant—it is very likely false.\nExamples of truly brilliant economic theories abound. Unfortunately, most are simply too brilliant to be true. For example, “rational expectations” theory—another modish conservative school of thought—asserts that the government cannot control the economy. Whenever the government tries to do so, consumers and businesses cleverly adjust their own plans in a way that cancels out the effects of the government’s action. If economic actors are smart enough to predict and then cancel out the effects of the government’s actions, however, they must also be smart enough to realize that the government actions cannot have any truly lasting effect. Moreover, firms realizing that government actions are always ultimately ineffective should have a major competitive advantage, because their planning will not be distorted by the misconception that government policies have effects. Given this advantage, these firms should dominate the marketplace. Thus, rational expectations theory, far from being considered brilliant, would be nothing more than a cliché—if only it were true.\nA final example: the theory of “efficient capital markets” holds that there is no way to predict the future course of the stock market because all currently available relevant information is already factored into the current price. According to this theory, investors who trust entirely to luck, numerology, or astrology will beat out those who pay money to brokers, investment counselors, and other experts. Hence, these “naive” investors should dominate the market. In reality, however, the theory sharply conflicts with most investors’ view of the market. This theory, like those discussed earlier, is just too much of a surprise to the rational economic actors who are its subjects.\nThe common thread in this discussion is rationality. It is all well and good for a theory about electrons to be a total surprise to physicists. If electrons were believed to be largely rational creatures, however, we would not expect to find truths about electrons that surprised the electrons themselves. Most social sciences tend to view human behavior as irrational, so the fact that a theory is surprising is not itself suspicious, because we might lack an understanding of the irrational parts of our behavior. It is much more suspicious, however, to claim—as economists do—that people behave rationally but nevertheless are ignorant of the factors that make their behavior rational. Of course, it is not necessarily impossible that people have all been unconsciously acting as if they believed in an economic theory that economists themselves find startling and novel. But is it likely?\nThe core problem is that if an economic theory is true, then people who behave rationally will act as if they knew the theory. If people are consistently acting this way, however, it is unlikely that the theory will be a surprising novelty. If people are not consistently acting this way, the theory cannot be true.\nThe case against brilliance is strongest in economics simply because economics takes the most positive view of human rationality. If a theory is brilliant, by definition everyone in history prior to its discovery was systematically wrong about something. The whole thrust of economic theory, however, is against the likelihood that everyone has been wrong.\nAnother field where brilliance should be counted as a disadvantage is constitutional law—an area in which brilliant scholarship has recently become rampant. Consider just two particularly brilliant recent theories. Dean John Hart Ely of Stanford Law School has addressed the question of how to interpret certain vague clauses in the Constitution, such as the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (“No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States”). Allowing judges an open-ended license under these clauses would be undemocratic, but to ignore the clauses would also be improper. Hence, Ely argues, judges should apply the clauses to strengthen democracy by striking down legislation that in some way encumbers the democratic process. This is Ely’s famous “representation- reinforcing” theory of judicial review, so-called because the courts reinforce representative democracy.\nProfessor Ronald Dworkin argues, by contrast, that the open-ended clauses of the Constitution are based on specific conceptions of equality, freedom, and justice. In interpreting these clauses, however, judges should rely not on the particular conceptions of the framers but rather on the deeper philosophical concepts that lie behind these conceptions. Thus, in exercising judicial review, judges should not be concerned with how the framers of the equal protection clause construed the concept of equality, or even with how the average citizen today understands equality, but rather with the true meaning of equality. Dworkin’s theory, like Ely’s, takes the constitutional text as the starting point, but then adds a brilliant gloss of its own.\nUnfortunately, these theories share a flaw, a flaw endemic to brilliant legal theories. The Fourteenth Amendment was not written by Ronald Dworkin or John Hart Ely. Its primary drafter was a man named John Bingham. Bingham had a certain flair for sermonizing. But, based on his public speeches, it seems doubtful that he was as intelligent as the average law professor, let alone Ronald Dworkin and John Hart Ely. It is hard to see how he could have had in mind a notion so ingenious that no one thought of it until Ronald Dworkin and John Hart Ely came along.\nNot everyone agrees that the intent of the framers is what counts in constitutional interpretation. But virtually everyone agrees that a bedrock principle of law is consent of the governed. A brilliant theory is by definition one that would not occur to most people. The general problem with brilliant legal theories is: How can most people have agreed to something that they could not conceive of?\nSupreme Court decisions often fall victim to similar brilliant interpretations. Perhaps the mos famous recent example is Justice Rehnquist’s 1976 opinion in National League of Cities v. Usery, which struck down the federal minimum wage for state employees. Two brilliant Harvard professors have argued that Rehnquist’s opinion actually established a constitutional right to welfare. In his treatise, American Constitutional Law, Professor Lawrence Tribe explains that Justice Rehnquist “seemed sometimes to lay the foundations for precisely such a theory”; that some of the language “may be read to suggest” this theory; that the theory makes sense of “an otherwise problematic distinction”; and that a tension in the cases “may well reflect an unarticulated perception” that the theory is correct. A footnote adds that the author doubts whether any other explanation makes sense. Only through this brilliant re-interpretation, then, can the Court’s decision be salvaged.\nOf course, this interpretation was so dazzlingly brilliant just because it was painfully obvious that Justice Rehnquist had no such thing in mind. Indeed, the only members of the Court who were remotely likely to be receptive to a constitutional right to welfare were the liberals, all of whom dissented from Justice Rehnquist’s opinion. There is something inherently suspect about an interpretation so clever that it never would have occurred to the speaker or the audience.\nIf my arguments are correct, then the standards for judging academic work in economics and constitutional law should be reconsidered. There is a tendency for high-flying theorists to scoff at those whose work stays closer to the ground. Icarus, too, was scornful of pedestrianism.\n(But what if, as several readers have wittily suggested, this article itself suffers from the vice of brilliance? Would not its thesis then be self-contradictory and, hence, necessarily false? Although clever, such an argument is misplaced. Even if this article were brilliant, its thesis is only that brilliant first-order theories about the legal system and the economy are generally false. Thus, the attempted contradiction fails at three points: (1) the charge that this article is “brilliant” is damaging but unproven; (2) the thesis is that most brilliant articles are false; this could be one of the rare exceptions; and, most importantly, (3) this article does not present a first-order theory about economics or law, but rather a meta-theory about scholarship in those areas. The article’s thesis, therefore, does not apply to itself.)\nDaniel A. Farber is professor of law at the University of Minnesota.

7	effective discussion management techniques controlling participation conflict resolution tips	To manage discussions effectively, several key techniques should be used. First, set discussion time limits in advance and encourage new speakers by asking for those who haven't spoken yet. Control participation by ensuring no one speaks twice while others haven't spoken once, and address 'windbags' who try to monopolize discussion. For conflict management, never allow members to argue directly with each other - all remarks should be addressed to the chair or mediator. In mediation specifically, parties should remain silent while others are speaking, and the mediator can use private caucuses to discuss issues separately with each party. These techniques help maintain focus, ensure equal participation, and lead to productive outcomes while minimizing confrontation.	"[""Think of the many hours you spend on planning for your system—things like budget forecasting, strategic planning, and disaster preparation. Do you put the same forethought into organizing your meetings? Probably not. Both board and committee meetings tend to be loosely thought-out and implemented by the seat of the pants.\nThis is unfortunate. Because, just as meticulous preparation leads to a seemingly effortless party, good meeting plans lead to better meetings.\nBEFORE THE GAVEL STRIKES\nWhy meet at all? Some groups have to come together because statute or their governing documents require so many meetings per year. However, studies also show that many meetings are a waste of time. Generally, the best reasons for meeting as a group are for decision-making, problem solving, planning, and evaluation. By contrast, if the sole purpose of a meeting is to give information, there may be easier ways to accomplish that, such as via a letter or e-mail.\nWhat are the desired outcomes? There’s a difference between discussing a reassignment plan and adopting one. Your meeting plan should reflect such differences. For example, if the desired outcome is to adopt a recommendation, you should arrange the meeting so there is a specific proposal, followed by discussion and a vote (with consideration on how to verify a close vote). To plan an effective agenda, it’s essential that you know your desired outcomes.\nWho is responsible for each item on the agenda? Far too often, the presiding officer handles everything on the agenda. This is understandable, in that the chairman usually feels most responsible for a meeting’s success. However, meetings run more smoothly, are more inclusive, and likely will be more productive if you give other board members responsibilities as well. Even allowing a board member to report on a project can help prepare that member for future leadership roles. Also, you’re likely to have better attendance if people have a part on the agenda. And members are more likely to feel they’re an important part of the board if they do more than sit and listen.\nHave you confirmed the setting? Meetings often fail not because of the items on their agenda, but because of the atmosphere in which they occur. Rooms that are too large or small, hot, cold, or noisy can affect participation. Plus, have you tested all the equipment—lectern, microphone, overhead projector—to make sure it won’t malfunction during an inopportune moment?\nEven a room’s layout can drastically alter the atmosphere. Auditorium or “classroom” style seating, for example, usually leads to less participation by members. In contrast, an oval or circle arrangement invites discussion. That said, depending on the purpose of the meeting, an arrangement around a table can result in too much member participation. A compromise often used for board meetings is a horseshoe pattern, with the presiding officer at the leadership position at the open end. This layout encourages participation, but acknowledges the chair is running the meeting. While board meetings are often arranged based on what works best for the camera, the effect of room arrangement on participation should not be ignored.\nDo you follow the standard order of business? The general outline in which business is taken up during a meeting is known as the “order of business.” Parliamentary procedure books, including Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised (11th Edition), recognize a “standard” order of business, the sequence of which will vary depending on the type of meeting:\nHave you created an effective agenda? As the structured order of business suggests, there’s nothing more important to a successful meeting than a well-planned agenda. At a minimum, a good agenda has a start and an end time for the meeting. Obviously, knowing in advance when the meeting will end requires careful planning and a review of every item on the agenda.\nSome boards also like a start and end time for each individual item. (See “Sample Timed Agenda”) Such scheduling is a good idea if you’re trying to rein in long meetings or have several controversial items to be considered. If you do adopt a timed agenda, realize that the start and end points are locked in. When the designated time for finishing an item arrives, your presiding officer announces that the allotted time has elapsed; a vote is taken if the item is for action. Obviously, you can always vote to modify a timed agenda. By contrast, if you don’t adopt a timed agenda, any times listed next to your items of business are for guidance only.\nSample Timed Agenda\nShould you require agenda items in advance? Some governing documents require that business items be submitted in advance. Without question, it helps in planning your agenda to know if there will be one or 10 business items. Plus, allowing items to be brought up on the fly can lead to poorly thought-out motions—and even if you require prior submission, you probably have a mechanism to suspend the rule on a case-by-case basis.\nIs everyone prepared? Distribute the agenda and any documents needed for the meeting in advance, even if only by e-mail. In addition, make sure everyone on the agenda knows his or her role.\nDOWN TO BUSINESS\nStart on time. Delaying a meeting encourages members to be late and punishes those who were on time.\nStick to the agenda. Stay focused on your desired outcomes by using an agenda. An agenda—particularly a timed one—can keep the meeting from getting bogged down on one issue. If you’re using a timed agenda, stay on track by ending each item on time.\nHave an endpoint. Similarly, to avoid unproductive tangents and circular discussions, establish an end time in advance—and adjourn the meeting when you reach it.\nPreempt debate. Resolve non-controversial items through “general consent” or “unanimous consent.” Under this method, the presiding officer asks, “Is there any objection to...?”—for example, “Is there any objection to ending debate?” If no one objects, debate is closed. If a member objects, you can resolve the matter with a motion and vote. Otherwise, you can use general consent to adopt reports and motions, approve minutes, and end debate. In fact, try to place a “consent agenda” near the start of the meeting that includes all non-controversial items, such as adoption of the minutes. Any member can request that an item be removed from the consent agenda and placed on the regular agenda for consideration and vote. The remaining consent-agenda items are then unanimously approved as a unit without discussion.\nManage discussion. Set the discussion time prior to addressing potentially lengthy issues: “Is there a motion to limit total debate to 30 minutes?” (Such a motion requires a two-thirds vote.) And encourage new discussion—and prevent repetition—by asking for speakers who have not spoken.\nAlternate pro and con. After hearing from a proponent, ask, “Is there anyone who wishes to speak against the motion?” When no one wishes to speak on a particular side, ask for unanimous consent to end debate: “Is there any objection to closing discussion? Hearing no objection, discussion is closed.” If people from both sides do continue to speak, pay attention to the length and quality of their remarks. When the discussion seems to have reached the point of diminishing returns, ask for a motion to end discussion: “Is there a motion to close debate?” Most parliamentary books allow debate to be closed with a two-thirds vote.\nEncourage and equalize participation. Discussion at meetings is often monopolized by a single person, but several formal parliamentary rules are designed to prevent this. For example, no one should speak a second time while there are members who wish to speak a first time. Ask, “Is there anyone who wishes to speak for [or against] the motion who has not yet spoken?” If a member has not participated during a discussion, your presiding officer might even ask, “Mary, do you have any thoughts on this matter?” If you’re following formal procedure—such as during a particularly controversial issue—once a member has spoken twice to a motion, he or she is finished on that motion for the day.\nUse proper procedures. Several states have adopted or considered legislation that mandates a parliamentary authority for board meetings. For instance, some school boards are required to follow the most recent edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised. If your state has such language, you should obviously follow it. However, even in the absence of a statutory mandate, proper procedure can help turn long, confrontational meetings into short, relatively painless ones.\nUse informal procedures when practical. Smaller boards can be less formal. In fact, formality can actually hinder business in a meeting of fewer than about a dozen. As a result, Robert’s Rules of Order Newly recommends that in smaller boards:\nSome smaller boards don’t like this informality and stick to formal procedure at every meeting. Certainly, even informal boards should be more formal on matters of sufficient importance or controversy. That means observing limits on debate to keep the meeting on time and using formal votes to help avoid legal challenges.\nControl interruptions and digressions. Digressions are matters off-point to the issue under discussion. A good presiding officer might acknowledge a tangential issue that has been raised, but note that it’s not relevant to the discussion and should be taken up later. (If you do make such a promise, remember to follow up on it.) Some boards and committees use a chalkboard or flip chart to “park” such digressions. Similarly, take care to deflate any windbags in attendance. If a member attempts to monopolize discussion, you may have to nicely state that because the member has already spoken, other opinions are needed.\nManage conflict. During meetings, members should never get into an argument—or even a direct discussion—with each other. If a confrontation begins between two members, your presiding officer should remind everyone to address all remarks to the chair.\nEnd on a positive note. You cannot thank your volunteers too often—especially these days, when people can come up with many alternatives to serving on a school board. Thanking members for their time is not only gracious, but likely will result in greater enthusiasm for the board’s work. And that in turn can lead to even better meetings.\nJim Slaughter is an attorney, Certified Professional Parliamentarian, Professional Registered Parliamentarian, and serves on the Board of Governors of CAI’s College of Community Association Lawyers (CCAL).

They are actually made up of the intro; claim of the complication; information event; identity of the complications; bargaining; and ultimately, settlement.\nThe mediator will often introduce him or even herself to the gatherings and clarify the duty that the mediator will take, insure that he/she is a neutral individual whose objective is actually to guarantee are actually result that is actually each reasonable and only for each event included. The mediator will certainly outline what the procedure is going to be actually in the mediation and cover the procedure that ought to be complied with.\nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUE\nAfter the introduction the mediator will give each celebration the option to reveal the concern as well as inform their side of the tale. It is actually crucial right now that the party not talking is silent. The entire point of mediation is actually ahead to an acceptable contract, when celebrations begin bickering with each other the aspect of mediation is dropped.\nRELEVANT INFORMATION PARTY\nIf they have actually not currently been accepted the mediator, the mediator is going to seek something such as a brief detailing the simple facts, proof and every other significant info that may help the mediator decided. After this the mediator will certainly talk to questions of the gatherings one by one to clear out reasons, each budgetary as well as psychological, for why that party has actually functioned in a specific method or why they seek a particular end result.\nIDENTIFICATION OF THE ISSUE\nThis action is actually rather self-explanatory. The mediator, with the information received with briefs and also previous discussion will explain what he/she really feels is actually the center of the concern.\nOnce the problem or even concerns have been actually figured out the bargaining method will definitely begin. The negotiating session is actually one of the most innovative of the steps. It can involve various types of emphasis featuring team processes, discussion groups and also hypotheticals. An usual usage is actually the “caucus.” Often the mediator will certainly put a recommended settlement on the table and also need the participants to amend the settlement till they happen to a practical solution. Another route is actually that the mediator is going to meet each party privately to make arrangements. The private meetings are personal and also offer an atmosphere, outside the viewpoint of the other party, to conceptualize and review emotions as well as worries.\nThe length of time will it take to mediate?\nMediation, typically will cost in between ₤ 3,000 as well as ₤ 4,000 which is actually divided between the celebrations. This consists of the cost of readying papers, the mediator’s charges, representation, etc. It is likewise a lot less opportunity consuming and the typical mediation gets approximately 3-5 times depending on the difficulty of the issue. Like anything else, this is the cost as well as a tip as well as opportunity linked with mediation might get longer and also cost additional. Either technique, it is less pricey, quicker, as well as much more efficient than visiting trial.\nDo you require family mediation?\nIs your life being thrown off by a disagreement? Expert assistance is available right now. Our experts in London can provide you with a free, no-obligation assessment of your alternatives.\nThe advantages of mediation in fixing family disagreements\nToday marks the end of family mediation full week. Within this blog site our company sum up the mediation method and also, as taken into consideration in our historical blog sites, analyze the key advantages of mediation and other techniques of disagreement settlement as a technique of solving the useful agreements adhering to separation.\nThe family mediation process\n- Phone call – mediation normally starts along with the mediator possessing a quick preliminary call with each of the gatherings. The function of this particular phone call is actually to talk to the gatherings regarding the mediation method and look at separately along with all of them whether there are any problems which would mean that mediation is actually not suitable.\n- Specific conferences – adhering to the preliminary calls, the mediator is going to have a conference along with each party independently (this is actually frequently phoned a Mediation Details Examination Meeting (MIAM)) to go over the background briefly and also detail a bit even more concerning the mediation method. The preliminary appointments are actually confidential consequently the material will definitely certainly not be actually reviewed along with the various other party.\n- First joint meeting – abiding by the personal conferences, if the gatherings want to wage mediation, they will certainly arrange a joint treatment along with the mediator. The initial appointment is actually made use of to look at the Arrangement to Moderate form, manage any type of acting or pressing problems and to set the plan for future treatments.\n- Further joint appointments – the emphasis of future meetings will certainly depend upon the problems the events desire to deal with but this will usually entail discussion around the agreements for the youngsters adhered to through an evaluation of the gatherings’ financial disclosure and an expedition of feasible financial settlement.\nIn the occasion that an agreement is actually gotten to, the mediator can easily tape the relevant information and also decisions in a variety of documentations contacted:\n- Open Financial Declaration- this files the parties’ financial info as laid out in the financial disclosure delivered. This is an open as opposed to without prejudice record.\n- Record of Understanding- this documents the dialogues in mediation and also the general selections reached. This is a favorably file and may not be revealed in any type of courthouse procedures.\n- Parenting Strategy- this records the setups for the youngsters and every other issues parents wish to record in regard of the everyday treatment of their kids.\nAny deal reached out to in mediation is not legitimately tiing till the celebrations have actually possessed individual lawful tips on it. Once this has actually taken location, one of the event’s lawyers are going to usually switch the Notice of Comprehending right into an order which may be housed at court for approval through a judge.\nThe advantages of family mediation\nThere are actually a variety of advantages to the mediation method, a few of which are laid out below. Mediation is actually not correct for everyone as well as the mediator as well as a party’s very own solicitor will look at any kind of problems which may create mediation unacceptable or complicated. The perks consist of:\n- The mediator will definitely motivate the parties to specify the schedule and also confirm what they really want to deal with in mediation. You can take care of concerns crucial to your very own family as well as those which may not otherwise be relevant in a court procedure.\n- Mediation sessions can be actually scheduled an opportunity and also place convenient to you and the mediator. You pick the duration of your time between sessions as well as handle its own pace.

8	What happens to rocket parts after launch?	Different rocket parts have different fates after launch. For the Space Shuttle, the solid rocket boosters would parachute into the Atlantic Ocean for recovery and reuse, while the external tank would burn up during reentry. Modern rockets like SpaceX's Falcon 9 are also pursuing reusability - they've developed systems to recover their payload fairings, using ships with large nets to catch them as they descend by parachute. Some booster stages are expendable and end up in the ocean, while others are designed to be recovered and reused to reduce launch costs.	['If you’re fascinated by space exploration, you’ll love learning more space shuttle facts about NASA’s space shuttle program.\nFor 30 years, these iconic winged spacecraft carried astronauts into low Earth orbit on missions that expanded our knowledge of the universe.\nRead on to discover 15 fascinating facts about the space shuttles!\n1. The Space Shuttle Could Orbit Earth in 90 Minutes\nOne amazing capability of the space shuttles was their speed. At around 17,500 mph in low Earth orbit, they could circle the entire planet once every 90 minutes. This allowed astronauts to see up to 16 sunrises and sunsets every 24 hours during their missions!\n2. Nasa’s Space Shuttle Program Flew 135 Missions From 1981 to 2011\nFor three decades, NASA’s space shuttle program conducted revolutionary missions in Earth’s orbit. Columbia began the journey with its launch in 1981, and Atlantis concluded it with its final flight in 2011, accomplishing 135 incredible flights in the program. Just imagine all the scientific discoveries, construction projects, and astronaut adventures that occurred during those 30 years of space shuttle missions!\n3. The Space Shuttle Traveled at 17,500 Miles per Hour in Orbit\nUndoubtedly, the space shuttle astonished many with its immense speed as it orbited Earth. Traveling at 17,500 mph or approximately 5 miles per second, it could journey from New York to Los Angeles in under 3 minutes. Consequently, this extreme velocity enabled astronauts to circle the globe every 90 minutes while they were in low Earth orbit aboard the shuttle.\n4. The Space Shuttle Was the World’s First Reusable Spacecraft\nThe space shuttle program introduced a game-changing innovation with the reusable design of the orbiters. Unlike previous spacecraft, which were single-use, engineers could refurbish and relaunch the space shuttles after each mission. Consequently, this reusability enabled NASA to complete many more flights and experiments than disposable rockets would have allowed.\n5. The Space Shuttle Launched Vertically Like a Rocket\nContrary to traditional horizontal takeoff airplanes, the space shuttle launched vertically into the sky. The orbiter is connected to a large external propellant tank and two solid rocket boosters. Upon liftoff, the combined thrust propelled the shuttle upwards on a pillar of fire, until it reached 28 miles high and the boosters separated. Subsequently, the engines continued to push the orbiter into orbit, eventually reaching speeds over 17,000 mph.\n6. The Space Shuttle Program Ended In 2011 After 30 Years of Service\nAfter completing 135 missions, NASA retired the space shuttle fleet in 2011. The program successfully launched over 350 astronauts into space and played a pivotal role in building the International Space Station. Although the shuttle accomplished many achievements over its 30-year lifespan, NASA decided to explore new spacecraft designs. Consequently, this decision marked the end of an iconic era in human spaceflight. Nevertheless, the shuttle’s legacy continues to live on through ongoing microgravity research and as inspiration for future generations.\n7. Space Shuttles Could Carry Large Payloads Into Orbit\nThe space shuttle’s payload bay, designed to carry satellites, space station components, and other cargo into space, boasted a large open area. Measuring 60 feet long and 15 feet wide, it held the record as the largest bay ever flown on a spacecraft. The bay doors opened like a clamshell, revealing the contents inside.\nOver the years, shuttles have delivered some of NASA’s most important assets into orbit, including the Hubble Space Telescope and parts of the International Space Station. Critically, the ability to haul oversized payloads was essential for constructing the space station, which necessitated hundreds of deliveries over multiple missions. Without the shuttle’s spacious cargo hold, the orbiting outpost, where research is conducted 250 miles above Earth today, might not exist.\n8. Many Scientific Experiments Were Conducted Aboard the Space Shuttles\nThe space shuttles offered unique opportunities for scientific research, thanks to the onboard microgravity environment. Over the years, they hosted hundreds of experiments in various disciplines, such as astronomy, materials science, medicine, and more. Astronauts conducted work on everything from studying crystal growth to measuring the effects of zero gravity on the human body.\nMany experiments necessitated that the crew operate equipment and record data during the mission. The mid-deck lockers supplied storage and power for self-contained payloads. Consequently, with ample crew time and room for bulky gear, the shuttles facilitated research that paved the way for new innovations and breakthroughs not possible on Earth.\n9. The Space Shuttle Was Made up of an Orbiter, External Tank and Solid Rocket Boosters\nThe space shuttle system comprised three main components. Most iconic among them was the winged orbiter, which housed the crew compartment and payload bay. The external tank, providing liquid propellant for the orbiter’s engines, was the only non-reusable part and would detach before reaching orbit. Flanking the system, two solid rocket boosters provided most of the thrust at liftoff. After burnout, the boosters parachuted into the ocean for retrieval.\nOnce in space, the orbiter utilized its onboard engines to maneuver. Consequently, this innovative design allowed the shuttle to be partially reusable, thereby reducing costs. Furthermore, the ability to launch large cargo and return to Earth rendered the space shuttle unique among spacecraft, both before and after its 30 years of service.\n10. The First Space Shuttle Flight Was in April 1981 Aboard Columbia\nThe space shuttle program embarked on its maiden voyage on April 12, 1981. The orbiter Columbia carried a crew of two astronauts into orbit, successfully completing a two-day test flight. For the first time, a spacecraft launched like a rocket but landed like an airplane. Consequently, the launch drew massive crowds at Cape Canaveral, all eager to witness the new era of reusable spacecraft.\nAlthough the overall design proved sound, the program never quite realized the ambitious goals of low-cost, frequent flights. Additionally, budget cuts following the Challenger disaster also hampered the program. Nevertheless, over its 30 years of service, the space shuttle accomplished many firsts. It deployed satellites, hosted Spacelab science missions, assisted in building the International Space Station, and inspired a generation to reach for the stars.\n11. Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour Were the Other Space Shuttles\nAfter the success of Columbia’s maiden flight, NASA built four more space shuttles. Challenger joined the fleet in 1983, quickly followed by Discovery and Atlantis in 1984. Endeavour was constructed later as a replacement for Challenger after the tragic accident in 1986. Each orbiter had its own unique history and achievements.\nDiscovery deployed the Hubble Space Telescope. Atlantis docked with the Russian Mir space station. Endeavor was the baby of the fleet, built from replacement parts, yet still accomplished important missions. The space shuttle program demonstrated the possibilities of reusable spacecraft. While it fell short of ambitions, the iconic winged orbiters inspired generations and paved the way for future exploration.\n12. The Orbiter Had a Cargo Bay, Robotic Arm, and Living Quarters\nThe space shuttle orbiter was an engineering marvel. At the heart of the vehicle was the 18-meter payload bay, large enough to fit a school bus inside! The robotic Canadarm could grapple and maneuver large satellites and components during missions. Above the bay was the crew cabin, holding up to 8 astronauts on extended stays.\nWhile spartan, it provided limited living amenities like sleeping bags, storage lockers, and a toilet. The complex vehicle performed flawlessly for over 30 years of service. Despite the two losses, the design proved sound overall. The space shuttle expanded our capabilities substantially over earlier capsules. It enabled the construction of the International Space Station and the deployment of spacecraft like the Hubble. The orbiter was a versatile spaceship and workhorse of the shuttle program.\n13. The External Tank Contained Liquid Hydrogen and Oxygen Fuel\nThe iconic orange external tank was the single-use fuel tank for the orbiter’s three main engines. At 153 feet long and 27 feet wide, it was the “gas tank” of the shuttle system. The tank used a lightweight aluminum-lithium alloy to hold over 1.6 million pounds of propellant. The top third stored liquid oxygen at -297°F. The bottom two-thirds held liquid hydrogen at -423°F. Several hours before launch, the cryogenic fuels were loaded into the tank.\nDuring ascent, pumps sent the liquids into the orbiter through 17-inch diameter lines. The tank jettisoned 8.5 minutes after liftoff and burned up on reentry. The external tank was the only major component not reused. Building and fueling new tanks constituted a substantial cost but were essential for each mission.\n14. The Solid Rocket Boosters Provided Most of the Launch Thrust\nAt liftoff, the shuttle was propelled by two white solid rocket boosters. Each 149-foot tall booster provided 2.8 million pounds of thrust for the first 2 minutes of flight. They burned a mixture of aluminum powder and ammonium perchlorate. After burnout, the SRBs were jettisoned and descended by parachute into the Atlantic.\nThey were recovered, refurbished, and reused on future missions. This made them the only major reusable component besides the orbiter itself. The boosters were manufactured by Thiokol in Utah. New sets were stacked onto the mobile launcher platform between missions at Kennedy Space Center. The SRBs combined with the main engines to create 6.5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff – the most powerful vehicle ever flown.\n15. The Space Shuttles Completed Over 21,000 Orbits of Earth\nDuring 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, the five space shuttle orbiters circled Earth a total of 21,152 times. The longest mission, STS-80 aboard Columbia, completed over 445 orbits and traveled 18 million miles in nearly 18 days. On average, shuttles orbit Earth every 90 minutes while in space. At an orbital velocity of 17,500 mph, they saw a sunrise or sunset every 45 minutes.\nOver the 30-year program, shuttles logged over 542 million miles – equivalent to going to the Sun and back over 1,400 times. While in orbit, shuttles helped build the International Space Station, launch interplanetary probes, conduct scientific research, and deploy commercial satellites.\nHow Fast Does the Space Shuttle Go On Take-Off?\nThe space shuttle can reach speeds over 100 mph in the first minute after liftoff. At launch, its three main engines and two solid rocket boosters produce up to 6.5 million pounds of thrust.\nHow Fast Does the Space Shuttle Go From 0 to 60?\nThe space shuttle can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in about 6 seconds after liftoff. The solid rocket boosters provide most of the thrust at launch.\nWhat Is the Fastest Spacecraft Speed?\nNASA’s Parker Solar Probe holds the record for the fastest spacecraft speed, reaching speeds over 213,200 mph (343,000 km/h) relative to the Sun in 2022. Helios 2 set the previous record in 1976 at 156,600 mph (252,000 km/h).\nDoes It Take 1 Hour to Get to Space?\nNo, it takes the space shuttle about 8.5 minutes to reach orbit, which is considered the edge of space at an altitude of around 100 km or 62 miles above Earth’s surface. The shuttle accelerates rapidly after launch to achieve an orbital velocity of about 17,500 mph.\nThe space shuttle was a reusable spacecraft system operated by NASA for human spaceflight missions. At launch, its three main engines and solid rocket boosters produced tremendous thrust to accelerate the shuttle to over 100 mph within the first minute. The shuttle could reach orbit in just 8.5 minutes, traveling at speeds over 17,000 mph.\nWhile no longer in service, the space shuttle program demonstrated advanced technologies and capabilities that paved the way for continued human space exploration and research. These space shuttle facts highlight the immense power and speed required to break free of Earth’s gravity and reach the final frontier.', 'A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket provided a spectacular show to morning commuters across Southern California on Thursday after taking off from Vandenberg Air Force Base with Spain’s PAZ radar satellite and a pair of SpaceX prototype broadband satellites. Falcon 9 streaked into the morning sun as it climbed skyward while observers on the ground remained in the dark and were stunned by the expanding clouds of gas emanating from the rocket and the various components it shed on its way into orbit.\nThursday’s launch marked SpaceX’s fourth mission of the year and the 20th orbital space launch of 2018, involving a re-used Falcon 9 first stage from a 2017 VAFB mission and debuting SpaceX’s “Payload Fairing 2.0” designed for operational recovery and re-flight missions as the company continues its push toward making more and more elements of their launch system re-usable to slash costs for accessing space.\nBlasting off from SLC-4E at Vandenberg at 14:17 UTC, 6:17 a.m. local time, the 70-meter tall Falcon 9 fired its first stage for the first two and a half minutes of the mission before the MVac-powered second stage took over for a direct boost into a 514-Kilometer Sun Synchronous Orbit. The twice-used Booster was not planned to be recovered and, like a number of recent expendable missions, went through a series of flight tests after separation before finding a watery grave in the Pacific Ocean. These post-separation maneuvers contributed to be powerful display painted into the outer atmosphere by Falcon 9 and visible across most of California.\nThe launch of PAZ, coming after years of delays and a launch vehicle switch, was initially expected on Saturday but slipped into this week as SpaceX took additional time to review what it called “an upgraded payload fairing.” Sources have since confirmed that this indeed referred to the long-awaited “Fairing 2.0” that SpaceX hopes will lead to considerable progress in the area of fairing re-use by the end of the year.\nInstalled atop the rocket’s second stage, the Payload Fairing is tasked with protecting the vehicle’s payload while out in the elements waiting for launch and during the extreme aerodynamic environments encountered during atmospheric ascent. Falcon 9 flies with one of the largest payload fairings currently in operation under a “one size fits all” architecture as opposed to other launchers that can use differently sized fairings to accommodate payloads of various sizes.\nThe 13-meter long, 5.2-meter diameter payload fairing maintains the rocket’s aerodynamic profile while flying through the dense atmospheric layers before splitting open and separating in two halves roughly three to four minutes into the mission when its protection is no-longer needed in order to discard unnecessary weight.\nSpaceX earmarked the fairing as a desired re-use item early on because of two major factors: a) its cost being around 10% of the total cost for a Falcon 9 and b) its all-composite construction being a time-intensive process creating a potential bottleneck in the company’s plans for a rapid mission cadence.\nThe survivability of SpaceX’s baseline fairing design was proven in 2015 when large chunks of a fairing half washed up in South Carolina after floating for one month in the Atlantic. Video obtained from cameras installed on that fairing delivered a stunning look at its journey back to Earth and also confirmed SpaceX was actively pursuing fairing re-use. An initial controlled landing attempt on the April 2017 Falcon 9 mission with SES-10 returned one fairing half mostly in one piece; however, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk recently characterized the re-usable fairing development as “surprisingly complex.”\nThe step-up to Fairing 2.0 was incremental with several of the previous generation fairings introducing some of the recovery systems with all eventually coming together in the upgraded fairing design that consists of fewer parts, is lighter in mass and allows for faster manufacture. From an external appearance, Fairing 2.0 seems to be slightly larger than its predecessor, growing around 0.1 meter in diameter and length based on imagery of the PAZ vehicle, but what differentiates it from the baseline Falcon fairing resides on the inside and at the fairing base in the form of an upgraded structural interface.\nEach fairing half has its own avionics system, pressure vessels holding Nitrogen gas, a manifold of lines transporting propellant to a series of cold gas thrusters and a compartment for an auto-steering parachute. One particular area improved on Fairing 2.0 was the chute attachment since the baseline fairing introduced a turbulent airflow that made the chutes only partially effective, resulting in trouble on the way back to Earth, especially in the accuracy department.\nAs the fairings separate from the ascending rocket, they are to employ their thrusters to stabilize from their initial tumble and enter a pre-determined orientation for atmospheric re-entry. The auto-steering chute will then be tasked with guiding each fairing half toward a recovery boat positioned to ‘catch’ it.\nA vessel going by the name of “Mr. Steven” made a first appearance last year, featuring a four-armed contraption to support the fairing recovery, described by Musk as a “giant catcher’s mitt.” Recent photos of Mr. Steven have shown a net was added in between the four metal arms and the ship departed the Port of Los Angeles before noon on Tuesday to be ready to catch a fairing half.\nThe launch of PAZ and the two MicroSats was handled by the first “Sooty” Falcon 9 booster to launch from the West Coast, having flown back in August 2017 with the FormoSat-5 satellite for Taiwan. Still sporting the sooty attire from its first voyage to space, Booster 1038 was only outfitted with grid fins on Thursday to enable some post-separation flight testing toward a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean as a means of disposal since the Block 3 booster was not deemed suitable for anything beyond two missions.\nB1038 was the final Block 3 booster to roll off SpaceX’s production line and may very well be the last Block 3 vehicle to fly. Following last-year’s debut of the slightly improved Block 4, SpaceX now plans to roll out the Falcon 9 Block 5 – the final iteration of the workhorse launcher – in April for a Geotransfer Mission out of Cape Canaveral.\nThe primary passenger for Thursday’s mission was PAZ, an X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar Satellite commissioned by Hisdesat and the Spanish Government for multi-mission use in the defence and security sectors, for Earth observation and commercial exploitation of high-quality radar imagery at a ground resolution exceeding one meter. PAZ, Spanish for ‘peace,’ is the first member in the country’s Program for Earth Observation by Satellite (PNOTS) that is to include PAZ as radar component and the upcoming Ingenio optical-imaging spacecraft for multi-band imagery collection.\nAstrium (now operating under Airbus) was awarded the contract for PAZ in 2008 with an initial goal of launching in 2012. However, the satellite was forced to remain on the ground when its Dnepr rocket fell victim to the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine; eventually prompting Hisdesat to switch launch providers to a 2017 launch slot on SpaceX’s manifest.\nThe 1,350-Kilogram PAZ satellite employs a hexagonal satellite platform with a diameter of 2.4 meters and a length of five meters, hosting a large XSAR antenna on one of its side panels operating at a center frequency of 9.65 GHz and a peak transmit power of 2,260 Watts, capable of operation in various imaging modes including high-resolution spotlight and wide-area ScanSAR to deliver a multitude of data products. Auxiliary payloads include an AIS ship-tracking terminal and GNSS occultation instrument for atmospheric profiling.\nAmong the services provided by the PAZ mission is geo-information intended to enhance surveillance of the Spanish territory and other parts of the globe, improve the security of the Spanish borders, support operations of the Spanish armed forces, provide data for natural disaster assessment and mitigation, and support risk and crisis management. Data from the satellite will also be used to support operations against piracy in the waters off Somalia and to control the illegal traffic of immigrants into and through Spanish waters.\nPAZ has a planned service life of seven years, but Hisdesat is confident the spacecraft will last for at least ten – in part because of the performance of its predecessors, the German TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X that have been in operation since 2007 and 2010 and will be set for a coordinated extended mission with PAZ co-located in their orbital plane to maximize coverage.\nRiding shotgun alongside PAZ were SpaceX’s MicroSat-2a and 2b, the first prototypes from the company’s satellite venture operating out of Redmond, Washington to develop the “Starlink” Internet constellation. The two 400-Kilogram satellites are the first of over 11,000 Starlink satellites to be launched by SpaceX to establish a global Fixed Satellite Services architecture capable of bringing Internet access to all corners of the Earth.\nSpaceX announced the Starlink venture in 2015 but has since been extremely tight-lipped about it, only noting that it is still in its development phase. However, filings made with the Federal Communications Commission indicate SpaceX is planning to launch a series of prototypes in 2018 to fully characterize signal and transmission capabilities before pressing into the deployment of the operational constellation as early as next year.\nAccording to 2017 documentation, Starlink is to consist of two constellation segments: 4,425 satellites in 83 orbital planes at an altitude of 1,200 Kilometers operating at the Ku/Ka/V-Band frequencies and 7,518 satellites in a Very Low Earth Orbit at 340 Kilometers operating solely in the seldom-used V-Band spectrum. The MicroSat-2a and 2b satellites are identical and only host Ku-Band links to test the data throughput capabilities, pointing of broadband arrays, and ground station handoffs. They will complete one communications demonstration every day for six to 12 months from an orbit of 1,125 Kilometers, according to FCC documentation.\nFalcon 9 was wheeled out to the launch pad at SLC-4E on Tuesday with less than 24 hours to go until Wednesday’s instantaneous launch slot. Upper level winds just 1.8% above allowable limits thwarted plans for launching on Wednesday and SpaceX went into a 24-hour recycle.\nCountdown operations picked up again in the late hours on Wednesday and ran like clockwork as Falcon 9 checked off a series of tests before being handed over to computers to orchestrate the complex tanking sequence picking up at T-70 minutes to load the two-stage rocket with around 155 metric tons of chilled Rocket Propellant 1 and some 360 metric tons of sub-cooled Liquid Oxygen.\nFalcon 9 was venting gaseous oxygen as it headed into the fast-paced events of its final countdown sequence to chill down its nine Merlin 1D engines, switch to battery power, retract the Strongback structure and achieve flight levels on its fuel and oxidizer tanks with close-out of LOX load right at the T-2-minute mark. A final GO was voiced from the Autonomous Flight Termination System as Falcon 9 assumed control at the one-minute mark and the Launch Director gave his final approval with half a minute on the clock.\nThe bright green flash of Falcon’s igniter mix lit up the rocket’s business end at T-3 seconds as all nine engines soared up to a cumulative launch thrust near 700 metric-ton-force under close watch by computers. Hold-downs released the rocket at precisely 14:17:00 UTC, right at first light and still 21 minutes before sunrise – creating the right ingredients for another spectacular display in the SoCal skies similar to that of December’s Iridium-4 mission that occurred at evening twilight.\nRising from its launch pad, Falcon 9 climbed vertically before pitching and rolling onto its flight trajectory to the south-south-west, headed toward a 97.44° orbit. As the vehicle went through the sound barrier, thrust on the nine Merlin engines was reduced for Maximum Dynamic Pressure before Falcon 9 went back into full thrust mode for another minute of first stage flight – ascending into sunlight as it rapidly gained altitude.\nThe first stage shut down two minutes and 29 seconds into the flight after boosting the vehicle to a speed of 1.87 Kilometers per second, departing the stack via four pneumatic pushers that sent the stages on their opposite ways three seconds after MECO. Immediately after staging, the MVac-powered second stage went into start-up mode and ignited its 95,000-Kilogram-force engine on a planned burn of 6 minutes and 18 seconds to directly inject the stack into its target orbit – flying an initial lofted trajectory to climb to the target altitude before pitching down to accelerate to orbital velocity.\nFairing 2.0 had its big moment two minutes and 59 seconds into the flight when it dropped away from the climbing rocket and began its trip back toward Earth. At least one half of the fairing featured recovery hardware and was headed for an attempt to maneuver toward the fairing recovery vessel deployed underneath the rocket’s flight path around 510 Kilometers from the launch pad.\nThe fairing half pegged for recovery successfully managed to descend from space and deploy its parafoil, but missed Mr. Steven “by a few hundred meters,” according to Elon Musk. Apparently the half splashed down intact and future plans of increasing the size of the chutes may make the feat of catching it easier.\nFor the first stage, separation marked the start of a data-gathering exercise on its return regime. December’s Iridium-4 mission and the GovSat flight in January both disposed their boosters via soft splashdown landings after collecting data on flight environments not possible for operational returns to deliver valuable information for the continued refinement of the booster return sequence.\nStage 2 was lightly loaded on Thursday, carrying a total payload upmass of around 2,200 Kilograms whereas the vehicle’s theoretical capacity to the target orbit was 8,600kg with RTLS landing of the first stage and 11,700kg with ASDS recovery. Real time calls made by the launch team indicated Stage 2 performed admirably throughout its burn, spending the last 15 seconds in terminal guidance to ensure an on-target injection of the PAZ satellite and its two companions.\nShutdown of the second stage was called right at the T+9-minute mark and the guidance engineers confirmed a good orbit was achieved. The PAZ satellite was sent on its way just after clocks hit T+11 minutes, starting a decade-long mission to deliver high-quality radar imagery and ship-tracking data to the Spanish Government and commercial customers. SpaceX did not cover the separation of the two MicroSats and details on their mission are unlikely to be coming forward given the secrecy with which the project reached the launch pad.']	['<urn:uuid:04e11e99-106f-4d65-81b6-49472955f0f9>', '<urn:uuid:4366b5ca-d134-41d9-a334-7ad5231b7d84>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	7	91	4350

10	mixed race relationship impact society demographic	Intimate partnerships between people of different ethnicities act as powerful agents of social and demographic change. They erode barriers between ethnic groups by fostering interactions within partners' personal networks and reshape the ethnic identities of future generations, as their children typically identify with multiple ethnicities.	['Doctor of Philosophy\nSchool of Geography and Sustainable Communities\nIntimate partnerships between people of different ethnicities signal the decreasing social and cultural distance between ethnic groups. Such partnerships are also powerful agents of social and demographic change. They can further erode barriers between ethnic groups by fostering interactions within partners’ personal networks. Equally, they can re-shape the ethnic identities of future generations as their children typically identify with multiple ethnicities. A geographic perspective on mixed-ethnicity partnerships reveals that these processes of change are spatially uneven. Prejudices against mixed-ethnicity couples persist among some segments of society, and vary geographically. By shifting the scale of ethnic diversity research to the household, a geographic perspective on mixed-ethnicity partnerships sheds new light on ethnic landscapes, challenging established understandings of diversity and segregation across cities. Yet to date, distributions of mixed-ethnicity couples have seldom featured in social geographic analysis, and not at all in the Australian context. This is a significant oversight given rising rates of mixed-ethnicity partnering.\nThis thesis accordingly addresses the question, ‘How does a focus on Australian mixed-ethnicity couples and individuals advance established understandings of ethnic residential geographies?’ It adopts a mixed-methods approach, structured around distinct quantitative and qualitative components. Empirically, the focus is on couples involving an Anglo-European partner, and a partner from a visibly different ethnic minority group. The quantitative component of the study utilises customised census data to conduct Australia’s first-ever geographical analyses of mixed-ethnicity couples and individuals. It adopts finer-grained ethnic groups that have been conflated within broader pan-ethnic or racial categories in much existing geographical research on this topic. The qualitative component draws on in-depth interviews to explore mixed-ethnicity couples’ residential decision-making processes.\nResults portray the unique residential geographies of mixed-ethnicity couples in Australia. Mixed-ethnicity couples exhibit dispersed settlement patterns that do not align with those of their constituent ethnic groups. Broadly, their residential distributions are skewed towards moderately diverse, inner city localities and fall in-between those of ethnically homogeneous couples, affirming similar findings in the small number of comparable international studies. Their residential geographies counter ethnic majority and ethnic minority groups’ tendencies towards residential clustering. Mixed-ethnicity individuals have similarly dispersed residential patterns. Yet there are multiple geographies of mixed-ethnicity couples and individuals, that vary across ethnic groups. Analysis of subsequent interviews seeks to explain these distinctive geographies. Its findings are surprising, considering the importance ascribed to neighbourhood ethnic diversity in existing international geographic literature on mixed-ethnicity couples. ‘Conventional’ factors (e.g. proximity to jobs) dominated the interviewees’ accounts of residential decision-making. While the couples interviewed did not choose particular neighbourhoods based on their ethnic composition, they did enjoy diverse locales where they described feeling normal, or even invisible. Many preferred diverse contexts for raising mixed-ethnicity children.\nThis thesis concludes that a focus on intra-household ethnic diversity is essential for understanding Australia’s ethnic geographies. For instance, it shows that some suburbs often labelled ‘ethnic enclaves’ are actually key sites of ethnic mixing within the home. It also demonstrates how the geographies of mixed-ethnicity couples speak back to broader theories of ethnic residential segregation, none of which sufficiently account for the observed results. Equally, this thesis has implications for theories regarding mixed-ethnicity couples’ residential outcomes, generating new insights into the ordinariness of their decision-making processes. Taken together, mixed-ethnicity couples’ distinctive residential patterns and explanatory narratives suggest that they do not feel tethered to existing ethnic landscapes, underscoring their role as change agents.\nTindale, Alexander, Residential patterns of Australian mixed-ethnicity couples: advancing understandings of ethnic geographies, Doctor of Philosophy thesis, School of Geography and Sustainable Communities, University of Wollongong, 2018. https://ro.uow.edu.au/theses1/318\nThis thesis is unavailable until Thursday, September 05, 2019']	['<urn:uuid:d8f94bae-55fe-49ec-a0b3-5c97c6c80dc4>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	6	45	600
11	I'm working on improving my defensive boxing skills and wondering about movement strategies - what are the key principles of effective movement to make myself a harder target to hit in the ring?	A good boxer employs multiple movement strategies to become a harder target to hit. You should move your head, come in and out, and circle your opponent - following the old adage that a moving target is always harder to hit. Good footwork is also crucial - your feet should coincide with the movement and placement of punches. This helps you control the punching distance and keep your chin protected in the shoulder of the hand you just punched with.	['1. Listen to your body and take it slow and easy when you are loosening up or doing your warm-ups. Never, ever, disregard an injury, no matter how slight.\n2. Dress appropriately by always wearing loose, comfortable clothing and the proper shoes—sneakers for running and boxing shoes for sparring.\n3. You do your roadwork six days a week, taking one day off and include intervals of sprints and uphill climbs. If you only have time for one exercise, make that exercise running. You must run no matter what the weather is like.\n4. If you start an exercise, you must complete it! You can lighten up or slow down but you never quit. Once that bell sounds there is no quitting.\n5. Each workout needs to be goal oriented.\n6. Skill tasks should be done first, don’t let fatigue interfere with learning. In other words you do your conditioning last.\n7. Take the extra time to insure that you wrap your hands properly.\n8. Shadow box for form using the mirror – it’s the best coach in the gym.\n9. You first work on your stance, which means chin down, hands up, elbows in, knees bent, weight on the balls of your feet and maintain the triangle.\n10. Always keep in mind that speed and form are the most important considerations.\n11. Workouts should be short and spirited. You never sit down during a workout – keep moving.\n12. The use of the heavy bag is for working on combinations and developing power.\n13. Supervised sparring should only be done when you’re fresh and can learn.\n14. You spar with smaller men for speed, and the bigger men for power.\n15. Always use the large gloves for training and sparring (16 ounce).\n16. Always put Vaseline on your face before each sparring session.\n17. There is a good reason for sparring for 3 minute intervals. It gives your mind an opportunity to develop a 3 minute mental clock, the same time period they use for rounds in real competition.\n18. Avoid dehydration by always having a sufficient supply of water on hand.\n19. Never give in to your body, remembering that your mind is a million times stronger.\n20. As quick as you throw a punch at your target, you quickly bring it back to the on-guard position.\n21. Why they say your jab is so important: 1) it measures the distance between you and your opponent, 2) it’s used to set up other punches and 3) you can score with it as a solid blow.\n22. Since the Hook is the most difficult punch to throw properly, it’s important you perfect the jab and right hand first. The power of this punch is generated by body torque and turning the punch over. It’s thrown as if you are hitting your opponent with your shoulder.\n23. You never make the uppercut the last punch of a combination. Likewise, you always follow the right with a hook and the left with a straight right to close you up defensively.\n24. A good boxer moves their head, comes in and out, as well as circles an opponent, recalling that old adage, a moving target is always harder to hit.\n25. Good footwork means your feet coincide with the movement and placement of punches. What you want to do is control the punching distance and keep your chin in the shoulder of the hand you just punched with.\n26. Abdominal exercises should be done in every workout.\n27. Always cool down and stretch after a training session.\n28. Keep things consistent: sleep (a minimum of 8 hours), regular meals, and exercise, which excludes any use of drugs or alcohol.\n29. Never lose weight unnaturally e.g. with pills or supplements. Make your diet a way of life.\n30. After learning all the angles, all the tricks from as many coaches as possible, you then move on to the coach that makes you feel the most comfortable and you can truly trust.\nBy: Jim Wyatt – Sport of Boxing']	['<urn:uuid:8713f427-3e73-4618-ab15-9eb009bb34c2>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	33	80	674
12	I've been analyzing real estate market stability during the pandemic, and I'm wondering how the Japanese market specifically performed during the COVID-19 period of 2020-2021 - what was its performance like?	The Japanese real estate market was relatively stable compared to other countries during the 2020-2021 COVID period, with high demand and steady occupancy and utilization rates showing little to no fluctuations.	['Goldman Sachs significantly increased its investments in the Japanese real estate market to satisfy a high demand, which was stable even in the face of financial uncertainty due to the coronavirus pandemic. More details continue in the article.\nGoldman Sachs (GS), one of the chief financial services and investment banking corporations on the planet, has elaborated on its plans to invest $2.3 billion (250 billion yen) in the Japanese real estate market in 2022. As of 2021, GS already holds property investment portfolios worth over $1 billion on the Japanese market.\nThe company’s focus is to satisfy the demand for service centers, logistics and data hubs, and to answer the need for more facilities and factories. Commercial property aside, apartments and residential buildings are also of special attention, as the expansion of new infrastructure (jobs) will necessitate housing needs.\nIt is known that the Japanese real estate market was relatively stable compared to other countries during the 2020-2021 COVID period of the pandemic. The demand was high, occupancy and utilization rates were steady with little to no fluctuations. With low interest rates, the Japanese market is one of the most alluring in Asia; from consistent turnovers in investments, it has earned a top spot on the global property stage.\nGoldman Sachs is one of Japan’s leading foreign investor firms. In 2008, an acute financial crisis nearly sunk all investments in Japan, with economic stability and levels returning last year. Collaboration with other overseas investors resulted in 140 billion dollars of assets in 2020 alone and encompassed a third of all real estate deals during the previous year.\nInterest for GS in building new data centers and logistics hubs is due to the significant increase in market demand for communication and e-commerce services. Therefore, GS’s investment activity is planned to raise the prices on the Japanese real estate market, which will positively contribute to the reinvigoration of the local economy and national GDP.\nIn 2020, Goldman made a significant purchase of fifty-two thousand square feet in Osaka, with plans of turning it into a large logistics center by 2024. Another targeted aim is to buy property at a reduced rate from struggling landowners with large and stable tenants on their territory, like headquarters or factories, i.e., reconstruction of a building into a Faurecia Clarion Electronics base and repurposing space in Tokyo for Tiffany & Co.\nIt is projected that GS, as evidenced by the latest series of mergers & acquisitions, is preparing for even more significant investments in upcoming years throughout Japan and the world.\nReference: Founded in 1869 in the US, Goldman Sachs is today a global giant in the financial & investment areas. It offers clients asset and equity management, commercial and investment banking services, M&A, brokerage, commercial banking and credit. As of 2020, it operates with over $2 trillion under its asset management umbrella, generated $9.5 billion net income (with operating revenue of $44.6 billion) and employs more than 40,000 workers worldwide. The company has six major headquarters around the globe. It is traded at NYSE, included in the S&P 100 & 500 indexes. It has various commercial & financial interests in thousands of companies around the globe, ranging from mining & oil to infrastructure and IT, including Ukraine real estate.']	['<urn:uuid:2dae87d5-7929-4320-9b04-d2928963613a>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	31	31	543
13	What happens when you turn verbs into nouns?	When verbs are turned into nouns (called nominalizations), they follow specific grammatical rules. For instance, while you can say 'The present was received by my mother-in-law', the nominalized version 'The receipt of the present by my mother-in-law' is controversial in terms of grammaticality. Some nominals allow by-phrases while others don't.	['We will now talk you through a journal article written by Benjamin Bruening. We understand that this article is rather overwhelming so we will try and summarise it for you! If there are any words that you don’t understand please refer to the glossary at the bottom of the page.\nBy Phrases in Passives and Nominals\nVolume 16, Issue 1\n“By Phrases in Passives and Nominals” is a recent article related to syntax. It’s about by-phrases (exactly what they sound like; phrases beginning with by), and how they assign theta roles in sentences.\nTheta roles simply describe what a word does in a sentence. There are many different theta roles; for example agent, goal and theme. If a word has been assigned the role of agent, then it is likely to be the subject of the sentence and is performing the action described.\nFor example, in the sentence:\nMy mother-in-law received the present\nMother-in-law has the agent role,which has been assigned to it by the verb.\nPassive sentences, such as this one, do not always have agent roles:\nThe present was received\nHere, the agent is not specified, but if we want to say who received the present while keeping the sentence in the passive, we can add a by-phrase like this:\nThe present was received by my mother-in-law\nHere the by-phrase is assigning the agent role to mother-in-law.\nTheta roles can be a bit overwhelming and we understand that! So don’t worry! If you want to know more about theta roles, look here.\nThere is a long standing claim that by-phrases can assign certain theta roles in passive sentences that they cannot in other types of sentence, such as nominalisations. In a nominalisation, a word that is not usually a noun is used as a noun, for example:\nThe receipt of the present (*by my mother-in-law)\nHere, the verb receive has been nominalised. (See here for more about nominalisation.)\nBruening disagrees with the idea that by-phrases in passives behave differently to by-phrases in nominals. So, to start, he uses some examples to show how they do appear to behave differently.\n“The present was received by my mother-in-law” and “The receipt of the present (*by my mother-in-law)” are two of these examples. In the first sentence, which is a passive, the agent role is assigned by the word “by”. But when we try to use the by-phrase in the same way in the second sentence, a nominal, the result is ungrammatical.\nAnother pair of examples:\nHarry is feared by John\n*The fear of Harry by John\nThese show the same pattern – the by-phrase is fine in the passive, but becomes ungrammatical in the nominal. (A * before a phrase or sentence means that is is ungrammatical.)\nHowever, in Bruening’s judgement “The receipt of the present by my mother-in-law” is perfectly acceptable, so he argues that in some nominals, by-phrases are allowed. Here are some examples he uses to back up his argument:\n… after the date of receipt of the letter by the GDS\nThe start date must be at least ten days after the receipt of the form by Gift Processing.\nThese examples were found using Google searches, and show by-phrases in nominals which are grammatical. However, there are still some nominals which don’t allow by-phrases, such as “*The fear of Harry by John” from the previous example. So, we need to look at the differences between the nominals which do allow by-phrases and those that don’t, to find out why this is!\nBruening also argues that a rule explaining why only certain nominals allow by-phrases should not be a rule just about by-phrases, because two other types of adjuncts follow the same pattern as by-phrases (so they are not allowed in the same types of nominals that by-phrases are barred from). This means that a single, general rule can cover all three of these adjuncts.\n(An adjunct is an optional addition to a sentence, and can be omitted without making the sentence ungrammatical. For example, “by John” is an adjunct to the sentence “Harry was feared by John”. Removing it leaves “Harry was feared”, which is a grammatical sentence by itself.)\nThe other adjuncts which behave in the same way as by-phrases are comitatives and instrumentals.\nComitatives show accompaniment, for example:\nThe ushers seated 50,000 ticket holders with the security guards\nHere, the meaning is that the ushers and the security guards were both seating ticket holders – so “with the security guards” is comitative.\nInstrumentals show what was used to do something, for example:\nThe enemy sank the ship with a torpedo\nHere, “with a torpedo” is instrumental, as the torpedo was used to sink the ship.\nSo, what is it that makes all three types of adjunct ungrammatical in certain nominals? According to Bruening, these adjuncts need there to be an agent role. Some examples might help you to understand:\nThe ship was sunk\nThe ship sank\nCan you see the difference between these two sentences? Let’s try adding a by-phrase to each of them:\nThe ship was sunk by a torpedo\n*The ship sank by a torpedo\nThe first sentence makes perfect sense, but the second is ungrammatical. This is because the verb in the second sentence doesn’t have an agent role, while the first does. If a by-phrase assigned agent roles by itself, we would expect to be able to add them even to verbs which wouldn’t otherwise have an agent, like “sank” from the second example.\nInstead, Bruening suggests they fill the agent roles, rather than adding them. “The ship sank” doesn’t imply that something caused the ship to sink – it just sank. So it doesn’t make sense to add a by-phrase to this sentence. In the sentence “The ship was sunk“, however, we expect that something caused the ship to sink. A by-phrase can therefore be used to show what it was.\nThis article shows that by-phrases are interesting in their functions- they can be added to passives but adding them to certain nominals makes them ungrammatical.

14	seafood health benefits food safety risks	Seafood offers significant health benefits - people who eat it regularly have lower risks of heart disease, stroke, macular degeneration and dementia. It's an important source of lean protein, vitamins, minerals and Omega-3 fatty acids. However, proper handling is essential for food safety. Raw fish must be kept below 40°F, while cooked fish needs to be at 140°F or higher to prevent bacterial growth. Cross-contamination must be avoided by using separate utensils and cleaning surfaces thoroughly with hot soapy water after handling raw fish.	"['Is seafood safe to eat?\nYes. Properly handled seafood is safe to eat and important for human health.\nPeople who regularly consume diets high in seafood tend to have lower risks of conditions such as heart disease, stroke, macular degeneration and dementia in older adults. for more details see here.\nSeafood is an important source of lean protein, vitamins, minerals and the all-important long-chain Omega-3 fatty acids.\nHow much seafood do I need to eat?\nThe optimal amount of seafood every individual needs to consume depends on their age, gender and stage of life. You can find more details here.\nWhat species are high in Omega-3?\nOily fish are the highset in Omega3 fatty acids with salmon and sardines being at the top of the list. As fish acquire omega-3 from their food, their diet directly influences their Omega-3 content.\nHere is a more detailed list of the omega-3 content in different seafood species\nCan I eat seafood if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?\nYes. Seafood is very important in the development of the foetus and baby’s brain. However, some caution must be taken to avoid large intakes of mercury. You can find more details here.\nFrom what age can I feed seafood to my children?\nFish can be included as part of a balanced diet in your baby’s diet from six months of age. For more details on portions and intake visit this link.\nWhere can I buy seafood?\nYou can buy seafood at your local supermarket, farmers markets, fish markets and some deli shops.\nHow do I know if the seafood I am buying is fresh?\nThere are several things you can look at to determine the freshness of seafood. Generally, seafood that smells fresh, looks glossy, moist and undamaged is a good choice. You can find more details here.\nIs fresh seafood better than frozen?\nIt is a myth that chilled seafood is always of better quality than frozen. Often, fish that was frozen shortly after capture will be of better quality than something that sits in your fridge for a couple of days before you cook it.\nMore details here\nIs canned seafood a good option?\nCanned seafood is a convenient alternative to fresh or frozen. Its nutritional value is often comparable to that of other seafood. It is important to note however that canned seafood is often not from Australia.\nHow do I clean/ handle my seafood?\nYour fishmonger can clean your fish for you, if you’d like to have a go at home, this resource can help.\nWhile handling seafood, make sure you keep it clean, moist and separate from other foods. You can find more details about handling seafood correctly here.\nWhat’s the safest way of storing seafood at home?\nSeafood must be stored cold to ensure its quality and safety. Here you can find detailed information on how to do this correctly.\nHow do I cook seafood?\nSteaming, grilling, baking or frying are just some of the many ways in which you can cook seafood. For detailed instructions and recipe ideas visit this link.\nHow do I minimise the smell of seafood in my house and on my hands?\nIn the fridge - Use cling wrap to protect and contain the smell of fresh seafood when you put it in the refrigerator, which should be set close to 4°C.\nIf possible, place it in a shallow sealed container full of ice and store in the refrigerator, but don’t allow the seafood to soak in water as the ice melts, this will cause the quality of the seafood to deteriorate.\nIn the house – You can soak fish in milk for 20 minutes before cooking. The protein in the milk binds with the compounds that cause the fishy odour, extracting them from the fish.\nLemon juice can be squeezed over the fish before cooking. It will neutralize odors and leave the fish with a citrus flavour.\nGood ventilation will help. Before cooking, shut any inside doors to keep the smell from spreading through the house, while opening kitchen windows and doors to allow the smell to disperse. Use your ventilation fan if you have one.\nCooking methods can also influence odour. Frying can create a stronger fishy smell than cooking fish in foil or paper in the oven.\nWhile cooking, leave a small bowl or cup full of white vinegar near the stove. It absorbs the odours.\nOn your hands - Washing your hands in vinegar, lemon juice, hand sanitizer or with toothpaste may help remove the fish smell.\nWhy does fish smell ‘fishy’?\nFish tissue contains an odourless chemical called trimethylamine oxide. Once fish is killed and exposed to air, this chemical breaks down into derivatives of ammonia and can smell bad. However, fresh, properly handled seafood should have a fresh smell, anything with a strong unpleasant smell may be old.\nWhat can I do with the seafood waste in my home?\nYou can dispose of fish waste in your general waste garbage bin or use it in the garden, by digging it into the soil. Make sure the waste is dug deeply enough so wildlife and neighbourhood dogs and cats will not be able to dig it back up. Adding seafood waste to the soil can improve plant health, prawn shells for example, can help control nematodes, a type of microscopic roundworm that attacks the roots of plants like roses as well as tomatoes and fruit trees. More details here.\nWhere can I find some quick and easy seafood recipes?\nOn our consumer site Fishfiles you will find many great seafood recipes and helpful fish information.There are numerous cookbooks focussing specifically on seafood. The web and Pintrest are also full of good recipes.\nHow do I know if the seafood I buy is from a sustainable source?\nOne of the keys to buying sustainable seafood is knowing where it comes from and how its fishery is managed. All Australian fisheries are managed for sustainability, so buying legally caught local seafood which is in season is a good choice.\nFor a scientific assessment of Australia’s key wild catch fish stocks visit http://fish.gov.au/\nShould I buy species classed as overfished?\nYes. You can buy these species because, in Australia, fisheries managers may allow limited harvest of overfished species at a rate that will rebuild the species numbers and also sustain fishermen, local communities and the many jobs involved in seafood consumption.', ""Cleanliness: A clean working environment is essential in the prevention of contamination when working with fish. Be sure to wash hands thoroughly before and after handling raw fish. The work area, cutting boards, and utensils must be thoroughly cleaned with hot soapy water after being exposed and should not be used for other foods until properly cleaned. This will prevent cross contamination of bacteria from the fish to other foods.\nWhen working with other foods at the same time as preparing and cooking fish, be sure to use different utensils for each food. Do not use the same platter for cooked fish as was used for the raw meat, unless it has been properly washed and dried before using. If any preparation of the fish is done on a cutting board, it should be thoroughly scrubbed with hot soapy water after each use and periodically cleaned with a bleach solution consisting of 1 tablespoon of bleach per gallon of water.\nHandling Market Fish: Fresh or frozen fish should be purchased just before leaving the market so it is exposed to unsafe temperatures for as short a time as possible. It should be placed in a plastic bag to prevent any leakage from contaminating any other foods. Bring a cooler along to store the fish in while traveling home or pack the fish in ice. To maintain the quality of the fish, it needs to be kept at a temperature under 40°F. Do not allow the fish to set in a hot vehicle for any length of time unless stored properly. After purchasing it should be taken home and refrigerated as soon as possible.\nWhen cooking and serving fish, the meat must be handled properly to prevent contamination. Use a different platter and cooking utensils for cooked fish than what was used for the raw fish, unless they have been properly cleaned and dried after exposure to the raw fish. Be sure the raw fish does not come in contact with foods that have already been cooked or foods that do not require cooking before being consumed, such as raw vegetables and fruit.\nIf taking cooked fish to be served at another location, be sure to pack the fish so it maintains the proper temperatures. If you are keeping it hot, it should maintain at least a 140°F temperature and if it is cold, it must be kept at or below 40°F.\nHandling Fisherman's Catch: Keeping your daily catch safe from bacteria can be a challenge unless you are ice fishing. See the tips below for warm weather fish handling.\nIt is necessary to cook the fish completely to eliminate the chance of food borne illness. The safest manner in which to check for doneness is to check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer in several locations. Internal temperature should be a minimum of 145°F when checked in the center of the thickest area of the fish. If a meat thermometer is not available, check for doneness by using a fork to check if the fish flakes easily and to see if its appearance is opaque and not translucent and raw looking.\nDeep-frying, also known as deep-fat frying, is a popular cooking method used for fish. It is a process of immersing food in a pan containing hot oil, which cooks the food quickly, producing a crispy surface covering a tender and moist interior. Because of the large quantity of hot oil that is used for deep-frying fish, there are some safety concerns that must be considered when using this cooking method. The safety concerns are listed below.\nChecking the Temperature of the Oil: A temperature between 350°F and 375°F is an ideal range for deep-frying. The correct temperature can be determined with the use of a candy thermometer. Another method that can be used is to place a cube of bread into the oil and if it browns in 45 to 50 seconds, the oil is at the correct temperature. The oil should not need to reach over 375°F to fry the fish. Oil above this temperature will brown the fish too quickly, not allowing it to cook properly all the way through. The undercooked fish poses a safety concerns.\nAny cooking oil can be used for deep-frying provided it does not smoke or burn at temperatures that may reach as high as 375°F. For a healthier choice, oil low in saturated fat is best to use because the food will absorb a small quantity of oil during the cooking process.\nProperly preparing fresh fish for storage will allow it to be stored for a longer period of time and maintain its quality. Fresh caught fish should be gutted and cleaned as soon as possible and then stored at the proper temperature until ready to cook. For the best flavor and quality, fish should be prepared for eating within 24 hours of catching but if stored properly it is safe to keep refrigerated for 2 to 3 days.\nFresh caught or market fresh fish should be stored at a temperature 40°F or below and cooked fish should be kept at a temperature 140°F or higher to keep it outside of the temperature zone in which bacteria, that causes food borne illness, grows quickly. The danger temperature zone is a range between 40°F and 140°F. Raw fish can be stored in a refrigerator for 2 to 3 days. Leftover cooked fish can be stored for up to 3 or 4 days. If raw or cooked fish is not going to be used within the recommended time, it should be frozen to prevent it from perishing.\nRaw fish can be stored safely in a refrigerator at 40°F or lower for 2 to 3 days. Oily fish will store longer than lean fish and whole fish will store better than steaks and fillets. There are several factors listed below that will have an affect on how well the fish will store.\nFollow the instructions below to store fresh fish in the refrigerator properly.\nCooked Fish Leftovers: Cooked leftovers should be cooled and refrigerated as soon as possible, limiting the amount of time the fish is exposed to room temperatures. Never leave the fish at room temperature for more than two hours. Store it in a shallow covered container to allow the fish to cool to the proper temperature more quickly. Cooked fish can be stored for up to 2 to 3 days in a refrigerator at 40°F or less. If leftovers are not going to be used within this time, they can be frozen and stored for up to one month.\nFresh fish can be stored at 40°F or less for 2 to 3 days but if it is not going to be used within that time, it should be frozen to prevent it from perishing. Freeze the fish while it is as fresh as possible. Proper handling of the fish is also necessary to produce a quality frozen product. The same factors stated above will have an affect on the quality of the fish when it is frozen. Be sure the fish has been cleaned properly before freezing. There are several methods that can be used for freezing fish. The method you select may depend on if you are freezing whole fish, large cuts, steaks or fillets. Also, take into consideration how much freezer storage room you have available. Fish should be frozen in a freezer at 0°F or less. Several methods are shown below.\nDouble Wrapping: This method works well on smaller whole fish, steaks and fillets. It saves freezer storage space and the individual pieces thaw easier when you are ready to use them.\nFreezing in a Block of Ice: This method works well for smaller pieces, such as steaks and fillets. Freezing in a block of ice protects the fish from being exposed to any air because the air cannot penetrate through the ice. This guards the fish against freezer burn. This method requires more room in the freezer for storage and is a little more work when it comes to thawing the fish.\nGlazing: This method works well for whole fish or large cuts. Glazing seals the fish with a thick layer of ice to protect it from exposure to air. Once the fish have been glazed they will require less freezer space.\nWhen using any of the freezing methods, be sure to mark the packages with contents and the date so you can be certain of how long it has been stored in the freezer and what it contains.\nBe sure all wrapped packages are sealed tightly and any fish frozen in ice is completely covered with ice to prevent ice crystals from forming on the fish. Ice crystals form because moisture has been drawn out of the fish, causing it to become freezer burned. Freezer burned areas of the fish become distasteful and tough or dried out. Store bought frozen fish should be left in the original package and place in the freezer as soon as possible. For extra protection place the store bought package in a freezer bag before placing in the freezer.\nFreezing Cooked Fish Leftovers: If you have cooked fish leftovers that are not going to be eaten within 2 or 3 days, you can freeze them for extended storage. Place the cooked fish in shallow covered container to allow the fish to freeze more quickly. Cooked fish can be stored in the freezer for up to one month.\nIt is always best to freeze and store frozen food in a freezer unit, rather than a refrigerator freezer. The freezer units will maintain a temperature of 0°F or below, which will allow food to be stored for longer periods of time. A refrigerator freezer will generally only maintain a temperature of 10°F to 25°F and is opened more often, which causes fluctuation in temperature. If fish is stored in a refrigerator freezer, it should be used within one to two months. The chart below shows storage times for fish when stored in a refrigerator or freezer.\nSuper-Chilling fish is a good method of storing fish that needs to be transported a distance when freezing capabilities are not available. If stored properly, fish can be kept fresh for up to 6 or 7 days. See instructions below for super-chilling.\nToday there is considerable concern regarding the PCB and mercury levels of the water in which the fish live, thus raising the PCB and mercury levels found in the meat of the fish. Consequently, fish are beginning to be listed into groups of species that should be consumed and species that should be avoided. It is generally agreed that most farm-raised varieties of fish are safe to eat (farm raised salmon are an exception because they typically require significant amounts of mackerel, herring, and other fish as feed, however, if the source is dependable and uses environmentally sound practices, then farm raised salmon can be considered safe to consume).\nThe charts below list the fish varieties harvested in their natural habitat that are considered safe and those that are questionable or known to be unsafe.\nMercury affects the development of cognitive, motor, and sensory functions in the brain. It is especially harmful to unborn children and young children. The more mercury a person takes in its body and the longer the exposure time to the mercury, the more serious the affects can be. This is why unborn children and young children run more of a risk. The FDA advises that young children, pregnant women, women of childbearing age who may become pregnant, and nursing mothers should not consume fish that are known to have high levels of mercury. The FDA suggest that the pregnant women and nursing mothers also limit the amount of low mercury level fish to 12 ounces per week. The EPA suggests even a more strict limit on low mercury level fish, which is 8 ounces of uncooked (6 ounces cooked) fish one time per week and only 3 ounces of uncooked (2 ounces cooked) fish one time per week for young children. Men and women outside of this group should also limit the amount of fish with high levels of mercury to occasional consumption. Variables such as, the ability of a persons body to tolerate mercury, the level of mercury in the fish, how much fish is consumed, and the body weight of the person consuming the fish will all have an affect on the risks of the mercury consumption.""]"	['<urn:uuid:be1ac7d0-f17c-4ffe-873e-9de6b1187f34>', '<urn:uuid:ae7b1e07-e154-49fb-bcf0-69e811540329>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	6	84	3148
15	I'm interested in old religious manuscripts and want to learn about how they capture history. What's the difference between the St. John's Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls in terms of their creation process and historical significance?	The St. John's Bible and Dead Sea Scrolls represent two very different approaches to religious manuscript creation. The St. John's Bible is a modern creation, the first handwritten illuminated Bible commissioned by a Benedictine monastery in 500 years. It was completed in 2011 after 15 years of work by six calligraphers and six illuminators using medieval techniques. They used calfskin vellum, hand-ground ink from 19th-century Chinese ink sticks, and gold leaf for illumination. In contrast, the Dead Sea Scrolls are ancient manuscripts discovered between 1947-1956, dating back to around 200 BCE to 68 CE. They were written primarily in Hebrew and Aramaic on animal skins, papyrus, and one on copper, using carbon-based ink with no punctuation. The Dead Sea Scrolls are considered the greatest manuscript discovery of modern times, containing the oldest known biblical manuscripts, while the St. John's Bible represents a modern revival of traditional manuscript creation.	"['These handwritten illuminated marvels are being handbound to share with the world.\nPHOENIX – Scribes with quills in hand were once the conduits of history, connecting ink to vellum, painstakingly preserving the records of the world.\nThen, in the 1400s, the printing press virtually put scribes out of business.\nLater came the Internet and hand-held devices, relegating handwriting to the bottom shelf of an ever-increasingly paperless world.\nBut the art of handwriting is not completely lost. In fact, it is being showcased in a special way at the Franciscan Renewal Center in Paradise Valley this Easter season.\nMore than 15 years ago, the Benedictine St. John\'s University in Minnesota began work on its millennium project, a seven-volume, handwritten illuminated manuscript containing all 73 books of the Catholic Bible.\nTo share it with the rest of the world, creators are producing 299 museum-quality volumes, all handbound in Phoenix, called the Heritage Edition.\nJim Triggs, executive director of the Heritage Edition, said the seminal edition is the first handwritten illuminated Bible commissioned by a Benedictine monastery in 500 years. One of the reproductions is finding a permanent home at Paradise Valley\'s Franciscan Renewal Center, he said.\nTriggs said the St. John\'s Bible is the first handwritten Bible of its scale since medieval times.\nThe Heritage Edition consists of 1,150 pages bound into seven volumes, each 2 feet by 3 feet when open and weighing about 20 pounds. They present the books of the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, through calligraphy and illumination, a technique used to embellish the work with luminous colors, especially gold and silver.\nTriggs said the mission of the project is to ignite the spiritual imagination of people around the world.\nThe original St. John\'s Bible is a work of art sprung from handmade authenticity and detail, a rarity in these modern times, Triggs said.\n""This is one of those things — you can read an article about it, but when you see it live, there\'s a wow factor,"" he said. ""Whenever I\'ve done a presentation about this Bible, inevitably there is somebody who starts crying because they get so emotionally wrapped up in the art.""\nThe original manuscript sits in the Hill Museum & Manuscript Library on the campus of St. John\'s University. The Heritage Edition sets are currently in production, with the binding being done at Phoenix-based Roswell Bookbinding, one of few companies in the world with the specialized capabilities to complete such a project.\nTriggs said so far 100 sets have been acquired by institutions around the globe, ranging from libraries to churches of many different denominations, including the Vatican in Italy and St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London.\nArizona State University also has a set that was donated in 2010 and is available for viewing at Hayden Library.\nThe Franciscan Renewal Center, or the Casa, as it is more informally known, has four volumes, with the remaining three to arrive as funds become available.\nWhen applicable, the Casa is using the Heritage Edition volumes for mass and Easter ceremonies.\n""The Franciscan Renewal Center (and ASU) has works of art in their own right. No two seven-volume sets are identical,"" Triggs said. ""That\'s because many of the illuminations required final hand treatments to the gold and silver in order to make them true to the artistic intent of the original.""\nThe original manuscript was completed in 2011, but Arizonans got their first glimpse of original folios when it toured and was exhibited at the Phoenix Art Museum from December 2007 to March 2008.\nSteve Nelson, a former trustee of the Phoenix Art Museum and a St. John\'s alumnus, said the response was so great and the Heritage Edition so important that Arizona should have a set readily accessible to residents in perpetuity.\nNelson said he and four other St. John\'s alumni families decided to give the Heritage Edition to the Casa.\nThey have raised $100,000 for the four volumes and need about $50,000 more to complete the set.\n""The Casa is the perfect home for this Bible,"" Nelson said. ""The Franciscans and Benedictines have a long history through the ages.""\nCasa Friar Joe Schwab said prayer and interaction with the Benedictines in Italy 800 years ago led St. Francis of Assisi to develop his faith and ultimately form his own ""Order of Friars Minor"" — the Franciscans.\nThe early Franciscans began using Benedictine facilities as they grew in number during the early Renaissance, he said.\n""To this day, the (Franciscan) friars give the (Benedictine) monks a basket of fish as a symbolic rent for the church, while the monks give the friars a gift of olive oil in return as a recognition of the long-lasting esteem and recognition between the two orders,"" Schwab said.\nThe St. John\'s Bible is the lifelong dream of Master Calligrapher Donald Jackson.\nJackson, who lives in Wales and is the senior scribe to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II\'s Crown Office at the House of Lord, has said that it is akin to re-creating the Sistine Chapel.\nIt has won praise across the world — Smithsonian Magazine called it ""one of the most extraordinary undertakings of our time,"" and Pope Benedict XVI called it ""a work for eternity.""\nJackson was not available for comment, but Triggs said Jackson oversaw the Bible\'s development at every stage, which took more than 15 years to complete.\nIn the 1990s, St. John\'s Abbey at St. John\'s University began looking for a millennium project centered on the Bible. Jackson, a longtime friend of the university and abbey, pitched the idea of a handwritten manuscript containing all 73 books of the Old and New Testaments in the Catholic Bible using medieval techniques and materials.\nThe $8 million project consisted of six calligraphers and six illuminators working closely with biblical scholars, theologians and art historians at St. John\'s University.\nDiane von Arx, one of those illuminators, worked on parts of the Old Testament.\nThe pages were designed and typeset on computer, she said. After proofreading, the scribes copied the text onto calfskin vellum with hand-ground ink from 19th-century Chinese ink sticks.\nFor colors, a number of materials was mixed with egg yolk and water to make paint that is thicker than the black ink and loaded onto the quills using brushes — goose quills for the main body of text, turkey and swan quills for heavier letterforms.\nGold leaf was used to illuminate the Bible\nVon Arx said the Heritage Edition is a high-end reproduction printed on special specified Monadnock paper made at a New Hampshire mill especially for the project.\nIt was printed by John Roberts Co. in Minneapolis. The gold leaf was replicated with a variety of foil embossing methods done by McIntosh Embossing Inc. in Minneapolis and finally bonded at Roswell Bookbinding in Phoenix.\nIt was quite an honor to work on the project, von Arx said.\n""In the scope of Bibles and art and scripture, it is certainly the project of the millennium,"" she said. ""It is the most comprehensive and important project I will work on.""\nRoswell Bookbinding was founded in 1960 and built its foundation on rebinding books for the Phoenix Public Library and then other libraries in the state. In 1970, it started binding new books and expanded from there, President Mike Roswell said.\nThe company now specializes in high-end books and has worked on prestigious projects, but Roswell said he had never had to fly to another state to interview for a job.\nIn 2008, he traveled to St. John\'s to compete for the project against two other binders, one in Germany and one in England.\nRoswell said binding the Bible is 25 percent mechanical, done on a new stamping press, and 75 percent by hand. A team of five bookbinders, some of whom have a lifetime of experience making bindings by hand, are working on the project, including Roswell.\nThere is an incredible amount of work that goes into binding such a unique book, he said.\n""The sheer size of each book makes it difficult,"" Roswell said, adding that he has never seen so many people curious about the binding of a book.\n""The most fascinating part of this is how many people have come through to see the Bible,"" he said. ""People actually come down to the bindery to see us work on it. They\'ll call us and say. \'Hey, I\'m in Arizona on vacation. Can I come in and look at it?\'""', '1.The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in eleven caves along the northwest shore of the Dead Sea between the years 1947 and 1956. The area is 13 miles east of Jerusalem and is 1300 feet below sea level. The mostly fragmented texts, are numbered according to the cave that they came out of. They have been called the greatest manuscript discovery of modern times. See a Dead Sea Scroll Jar. 2. Only Caves 1 and 11 have produced relatively intact manuscripts. Discovered in 1952, Cave 4 produced the largest find. About 15,000 fragments from more than 500 manuscripts were found.\n3. In all, scholars have identified the remains of about 825 to 870 separate scrolls.\n4. The Scrolls can be divided into two categories—biblical and non-biblical. Fragments of every book of the Hebrew canon (Old Testament) have been discovered except for the book of Esther.\n5. There are now identified among the scrolls, 19 copies of the Book of Isaiah, 25 copies of Deuteronomy and 30 copies of the Psalms .\n6. Prophecies by Ezekiel, Jeremiah and Daniel not found in the Bible are written in the Scrolls.\n7. The Isaiah Scroll, found relatively intact, is 1000 years older than any previously known copy of Isaiah. In fact, the scrolls are the oldest group of Old Testament manuscripts ever found.\n8. In the Scrolls are found never before seen psalms attributed to King David and Joshua. 9.There are nonbiblical writings along the order of commentaries on the OT, paraphrases that expand on the Law, rule books of the community, war conduct, thanksgiving psalms, hymnic compositions, benedictions, liturgical texts, and sapiential (wisdom) writings.\n10. The Scrolls are for the most part, written in Hebrew, but there are many written in Aramaic. Aramaic was the common language of the Jews of Palestine for the last two centuries B.C. and of the first two centuries A.D. The discovery of the Scrolls has greatly enhanced our knowledge of these two languages. In addition, there are a few texts written in Greek.\n11. The Scrolls appear to be the library of a Jewish sect. The library was hidden away in caves around the outbreak of the First Jewish Revolt (A.D. 66-70) as the Roman army advanced against the rebel Jews.\n12. Near the caves are the ancient ruins of Qumran. They were excavated in the early 1950\'s and appear to be connected with the scrolls.\n13. The Dead Sea Scrolls were most likely written by the Essenes during the period from about 200 B.C. to 68 C.E./A.D. The Essenes are mentioned by Josephus and in a few other sources, but not in the New testament. The Essenes were a strict Torah observant, Messianic, apocalyptic, baptist, wilderness, new covenant Jewish sect. They were led by a priest they called the ""Teacher of Righteousness,"" who was opposed and possibly killed by the establishment priesthood in Jerusalem.\n14. The enemies of the Qumran community were called the ""Sons of Darkness""; they called themselves the ""Sons of Light,"" ""the poor,"" and members of ""the Way."" They thought of themselves as ""the holy ones,"" who lived in ""the house of holiness,"" because ""the Holy Spirit"" dwelt with them.\n15. The last words of Joseph, Judah, Levi, Naphtali, and Amram (the father of Moses) are written down in the Scrolls. 16. One of the most curious scrolls is the Copper Scroll. Discovered in Cave 3, this scroll records a list of 64 underground hiding places throughout the land of Israel. The deposits are to contain certain amounts of gold, silver, aromatics, and manuscripts. These are believed to be treasures from the Temple at Jerusalem, that were hidden away for safekeeping.\n17. The Temple Scroll, found in Cave 11, is the longest scroll. Its present total length is 26.7 feet (8.148 meters). The overall length of the scroll must have been over 28 feet (8.75m).\n18. The scrolls contain previously unknown stories about biblical figures such as Enoch, Abraham, and Noah. The story of Abraham includes an explanation why God asked Abraham to sacrifice his only son Isaac.\n19. The scrolls are most commonly made of animal skins, but also papyrus and one of copper. They are written with a carbon-based ink, from right to left, using no punctuation except for an occasional paragraph indentation. In fact, in some cases, there are not even spaces between the words.\n20. The Scrolls have revolutionized textual criticism of the Old Testament. Interestingly, now with manuscripts predating the medieval period, we find these texts in substantial agreement with the Masoretic text as well as widely variant forms. 21. Some of the Dead Sea Scrolls actually appeared for sale on June 1, 1954 in the Wall Street Journal. The advertisement read — ""The Four Dead Sea Scrolls: Biblical manuscripts dating back to at least 200 BC are for sale. This would be an ideal gift to an educational or religious institution by an individual or group. Box F206.""\n22. Although the Qumran community existed during the time of the ministry of Jesus, none of the Scrolls refer to Him, nor do they mention any of His follower\'s described in the New Testament.\n23. The major intact texts, from Caves 1 & 11, were published by the late fifties and are now housed in the Shrine of the Book museum in Jerusalem.\n24. Since the late fifties, about 40% of the Scrolls, mostly fragments from Cave 4, remained unpublished and were unaccessible. It wasn\'t until 1991, 44 years after the discovery of the first Scroll, after the pressure for publication mounted, that general access was made available to photographs of the Scrolls. In November of 1991 the photos were published by the Biblical Archaeological Society in a nonofficial edition; a computer reconstruction, based on a concordance, was announced; the Huntington Library pledged to open their microfilm files of all the scroll photographs.\n25. The Dead Sea Scrolls enhance our knowledge of both Judaism and Christianity. They represent a non-rabbinic form of Judaism and provide a wealth of comparative material for New Testament scholars, including many important parallels to the Jesus movement. They show Christianity to be rooted in Judaism and have been called the evolutionary link between the two. The rugged terrain of the Qumran area.

16	salt trade west africa importance	Salt was important in West Africa because people needed extra salt to replace what their bodies lost in the hot climate. It was used to preserve and flavor food. Through trade in gold and salt, Ghana reached its peak power in the 800s and 900s C.E.	['The most common crops are peanuts, sorghum, cotton, rice, cassava, coffee, and livestock. One of the most important crops for countries like Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana is cacao, which is grown in the fertile soil of the wet areas.\nWhat food does West Africa produce?\nTo most West Africans, foods like yams, corn, cassava, rice, and groundnuts are indispensable in their diet. Other common foods are green vegetables, dried peas, pumpkin, squash, eggplants, okra, garlic, and tomatoes. A few common dishes in West Africa are gari and fufu.\nWhat is farming in West Africa?\nWest African agriculture ranges from nomadic pastoralism in the far north to root-crop and tree-crop systems in the south. … These food crops are among the top five harvested crops in the Sahelian countries — Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad.\nWhat are the main crops grown in Africa?\nAfrica produces all the principal grains—corn, wheat, and rice—in that order of importance. Corn has the widest distribution, being grown in virtually all ecological zones. Highest yields per acre are recorded in Egypt and on the Indian Ocean islands of Réunion and Mauritius, areas where production is under irrigation.\nWhat vegetables grow in West Africa?\nVegetables. Vegetables are a part of any West African meal. Some commonly eaten vegetables include black-eyed peas, eggplant, pumpkin and other squashes, okra, as well as a staggering variety of both farmed and foraged green leafy vegetables, little known or used outside of the African continent.\nWhich West African country has the best food?\nNigeria. Planning a trip to Africa’s most populous country? Do yourself a favour and try some of Nigeria’s most famous dishes. The country boasts a delicious array of traditional foods – a combination of meat, maize, vegetables, and spices.\nIs West Africa Rich?\nCompared to other regions on the continent, West Africa has the greatest number of countries with more than 30 percent of the population living on less than $1.90 a day. … Five of Nigeria’s richest men have a combined wealth of US$29.9 billion – more than the country’s entire national budget for 2017.\nWhat type of farming is most common in Africa?\nPeasant and subsistence farming is the basic form of agriculture in most parts of the continent.\n- Agricultural practices in Africa are extremely varied. …\n- Two other important African root crops are potatoes and plantains. …\n- Two other grain crops, wheat and barley, are raised on a limited scale.\nWhich agricultural practice is popular in West Africa?\n|Empirical + BLS||West Africa||Global|\n|DSSAT||Niger, Burkina Faso||Millet (two cultivars), sorghum|\n|Empirical||West Africa||Cassava, groundnut, maize, millet, sorghum|\n|DSSAT||Gambia||Groundnut, maize, millet late, millet early|\nWhy was salt important in West Africa?\nSalt was used to preserve and flavor food. It was especially important in West Africa as people needed extra salt to replace what their bodies lost in the hot climate. Through trade in gold and salt, Ghana reached the height of its power in the 800s C.E. and 900s C.E.\nWhat is the largest crop in Africa?\nUnder the current conditions in Africa, the most extensive area of land (455 million hectares) is suited to the cultivation of cassava, followed by maize (418 million hectares), sweet potato (406 million hectares), soybean (371 million hectares) and sorghum (354 million hectares).\nWhat is a major problem in Africa?\nToday, Africa remains the poorest and least-developed continent in the world. Hunger, poverty, terrorism, local ethnic and religious conflicts, corruption and bribery, disease outbreaks – this was Africa’s story until the early 2000s.\nWhat is Africa known for producing?\nAfrica is a major producer of important metals and minerals. … Africa’s two most profitable mineral resources are gold and diamonds. In 2008, Africa produced about 483 tons of gold, or 22 percent of the world’s total production. South Africa accounts for almost half of Africa’s gold production.\nCan Apple grow in West Africa?\nApples love to grow in African soil. … Being predominantly a temperate fruit requiring very low temperatures, the apple fruit has for a long time been considered exotic but yes, Apples are grown commercially for local consumption and export within numerous East, West and Southern African countries.\nWhat is the most popular fruit in Africa?\n#1 – Pineapples\nThe pineapple is a very popular and widely consumed fruit in many parts of Africa. It is second only to bananas as the most important harvested fruit. Despite the perfect fit that Africa’s tropical climate and soils have for pineapples, very few countries on the continent are big producers of the fruit.\nWhat fruit is native to West Africa?\nFor probably as long as people have lived in Africa, they have eaten culturally and traditionally important indigenous fruits such as baobab, desert date, black plum, and tamarind.']	['<urn:uuid:097e9510-9893-434c-865b-c880cdbc7ab2>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	5	46	791
17	What are some good plants that I can grow in my garden to help feed butterflies with nectar throughout the summer?	Several nectar plants are ideal for butterflies, including Lavender, Wild Mallow, Thyme, Oregano, St. John's Wort, and Carthusian Pink. It's important to choose simple, single flowers rather than large, showy, exotic ones. You should also try to spread flowering periods over the whole summer, including early spring-flowering plants, and choose a very sunny spot for the butterfly bed.	"['TIPS FOR INSECT-FRIENDLY OASES\nJoin us and create a habitat for our butterflies and other insects. The insects are not only beautiful, but also fulfil an important function, such as pollinating plants.\nYou only have a small balcony or windowsill?\nThat doesn’t matter. Even a few pots of herbs already provide food.\nYou have a small (front) garden?\nThat\'s even better, of course. Throw out the stones and give yourself and our insects a treat - flowering plants. Put native plants between your beautiful cultivated shrubs with their double flowers. Native plants don\'t take much work because they are adapted to our conditions. Plus, they are often more digestible for our butterflies. Packets of seeds can also be purchased at the offices and stores of the BUND Naturschutz.\nYour neighbours think the ""weeds"" in your garden are messy?\nExplain to them that such flower beds are very important for insects. Perhaps your neighbours have also already heard about insects dying out worldwide. Mrs. Lölhöffel has also had a sign designed especially for uncomprehending neighbours, which you can stick into your flower bed and which proclaims: This bed is something very special. It is a Merianin bed and was planted for our butterflies.\nYou can find more information in our brochure Merianin 2018+: New habitat for insects.\nWe are search-\nHousing shortage for insects\nand their family planning!\nWE ARE SEARCHING FOR\nuntidy corners in gardens\nand open spaces – small or large –\nas asylums for insect offspring\nwith plants as food for caterpillars,\nsand pits for mining bees,\nbrushwood piles + deadwood piles\n+ piled up stones\nfor other bees + moths + beetles.\nAll nursery asylums are helpful!\nMerian & her team\nA QUESTIONNAIRE AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nDue to rapid and disastrous climate change, in recent years it has become increasingly difficult to grow new flower meadows. On one hand, periods of drought prevent the seeds from germinating. On the other hand, storms that are often only short but too violent can wash away a great deal of soil together with germinating seeds.\nA thorough evaluation of areas – such as monotonous green spaces or wasteland – which you wish to revitalise as flowering areas is therefore absolutely necessary. Our questionnaire, which you can download and fill in, is meant to help you with this.\nTips for flower meadows\nInsect-friendly plants grow well in soil that is poor in nutrients. If necessary, sand should be mixed into the soil. In a quiet corner of the garden, plant an appropriate selection of garden plants and wild plants. Nibbled leaves will not do any harm there, but show that insects live there that are now often threatened by extinction.\nRecommendations for your environment\nIf you cannot transform your own spaces, we recommend that you should nonetheless start taking action in your neighbourhood. This website contains many suggestions on how you can motivate the owner of the apartment building where you live or the management of the company where you work to transform outdoor spaces from dull lawns into colourful flowering areas. Get involved when it comes to public spaces, the verges of tram lines and sports facilities, school playgrounds, kindergartens!\nMany ideal sites for small insect and butterfly gardens are still unused. Even undemanding wildflowers and herbs in pots and containers on sealed surfaces and balconies are attractive for butterflies. Water tanks at the bottom of the containers significantly reduce the work required for watering. Thus, many bleak corners can still be revitalised by simple shrubs or summer flowers being sown.\nSurviving in winter\nSome moths overwinter in cellars or attics, but also outdoors, e.g., in walls covered in dense ivy or other climbing plants on the house wall. If possible, build up piles of stones and brushwood for overwintering in a quiet spot in the garden.\nEDIBLE NURSERY FOR CATERPILLARS\nIn general, for butterflies to settle anywhere at all, they need ""host plants"" on which they can lay their eggs. When the caterpillars have hatched, these become their ""food plants"" on which they pupate. Sometimes they are so voracious that only thin stems remain, but as compensation for this small loss, the new butterflies unfold their wings.\nMany species have specialized.\n""Delicious"" food plants for butterflies:\nGroße Brennnessel (Urtica dioica) – Tagpfauenauge (Aglais io)\nKleine Brennnessel (Urtica urens) – Kleiner Fuchs (Aglais urticae)\nBrombeere (Rubus fruticosus) – Grüner Zipfelfalter (Callophrys rubi)\nWilde Möhre (Daucus carota) – Schwalbenschwanz (Papilio machaon)\nStockrose (Alcea rosea) – Malven-Dickkopffalter (Carcharodus alceae)\nRotklee (Trifolium pratense) – Rotklee-Bläuling (Polyommatus semiargus)\nIn larger gardens and open spaces\nalder buckthorn (Frangula alnus) – holly blue butterfly (Celastrina argiolus)\nred currant (Ribes rubrum) – comma butterfly (Polygonia c-album)\nhawthorn species (Crataegus spec.) – black-veined white butterfly (Aporia crataegi)\nWild hedges, e.g., with sloes, are visited by more than 120 butterfly species.\nSome of these ""host and forage plants"" are presented here.\nABSOLUTELY VITAL FOR BEES, BUTTERFLIES ETC.\nMost butterflies live on nectar from flowers. Colourful flower meadows, native wild plants and herbs are ideal.\nTip: Only simple, single flowers are suitable. Large, showy, exotic flowers attract very few.\nBees have a noticeably shorter sucker proboscis than butterflies. Flowers with flatter calyxes should therefore also be planted for them. If possible, spread flowering periods over the whole summer, including early spring-flowering plants. Butterflies only survive in areas free of poisons and pesticides. Choose a very sunny spot for the butterfly bed.\nTempting nectar plants\nBesenginster (Cytisus scoparius)\nNickende Distel (Carduus nutans)\nBlühender Efeu (Hedera helix)\nGroße Fetthenne (Hylotelephium telephium)\nKönigskerzen-Arten (Verbascum spec.)\nLavendel (Lavandula angustifolia)\nDuftveilchen (Viola odorata)\nWilde Malve (Malva sylvestris)\nKelch-Steinkraut (Alyssum alyssoides)\nThymian (Thymus vulgaris)\nWasserdost (Eupatorium cannabinum)\nSchlehdorn (Prunus spinosa)\nEchtes Labkraut (Galium verum)\nOregano (Origanum vulgare)\nKartäusernelke (Dianthus carthusianorum)\nEchtes Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum)\nA popular shrub is the Butterfly Bush (Buddleja davidii). However, amongst the shrubs you plant you should also plan for native species that do not, like this one, only provide food in summer.\nMaking Gardens and Green Spaces More Insect-Friendly\n“Each flower counts.” This slogan brings together members of the public to exchange ideas and plan activities. Insects, bees and butterflies – we all are well aware that a lack of these humming and buzzing creatures as well as the absence of wild flowers indicate a threatening, devastating imbalance in our natural environment. Information events are a great way of motivating citizens to become active and involved.\nHints on how to organise information events\n- to involve a broad spectrum of civic institutions, private individuals, clubs and associations in order to stimulate synergies and possibly form action alliances.\n- Using a figurehead like our ambassador Maria Sibylla Merian proves to be personal and inspiring.\n- Wherever possible try to plan concrete follow-up activities, e.g. communal re-planting activities in nurseries, community centres, on open and neglected sites.\n- Cafés with home baking create a pleasant atmosphere and attract many additional visitors.\n- Plant and seed exchanges are easy to organise as many amateur gardeners usually have cuttings to give away.\n- Fundraising is usually easier to organise than you may think. Statutory bodies may offer grants. It is advisable to do your research well in advance.\n- As regards targeted publicity, a personal approach works best in our experience. Distribute handouts locally, use social media and websites of civic organisations, place illustrated features in local papers, etc.\nOur Example in the South of Nuremberg\nIn March 2020, shortly before the Corona crisis we organised an event in the Southern district of Nuremberg in association with Bund Naturschutz (the German section of Friends of the Earth International), Einkorn association (small local non-commercial eco initiative), AWO (workers\' welfare organisation) and a great number of volunteers. In a convivial atmosphere visitors were able to experience a stimulating mixture of historic information and practical advice. In these still rather green southern districts there are many private gardens as well as brownfield sites which can easily be transformed.\nInformation brochures and little bags of seed at the entrance\nVenue in two colourfully decorated rooms\nBuffet with generous selection of dishes\nMerianin winter cake\nMargot Lölhöffel took on the role of Maria Sibylla Merian during an animated ""interview"". Many fellow citizens did not know that this famous researcher, artist and book illustrator lived with her family in Nuremberg for some time where she tended her small garden and kept many insects and caterpillars in her home. Margot also provided an insight into Maria Sibylla Merian\'s everyday life: her chances for developing their own individual potential in Nuremberg, ""a city of gardens"" at that time, her ability to assert herself as a sometime single parent and a female artist, and her extensive travels through Suriname at the end of the 17th century.\nFor a number of years our historic patron has been representing a regional project alliance whose aim is the promotion of urban rewilding initiatives. At the public event on 20th March 2020, detailed information was available about some of these initiatives, eg the City of Nuremberg\'s “InsektenReich“ (Insect-Kingdom) project, or the “Sandachse“ (Sand-dunes Nature Reserve) partly maintained by BUND Naturschutz. In addition, there was a ""Herbs and Wild Plants Swap Shop"", and visitors were given ideas for domestic gardens under the theme of ""New ideals of beauty – authentic and wild instead of decorative and exotic.""\nIn his presentation, Stefan Mümmler, a renowned environmental educationist and insect expert, provided some practical advice. Here is a short summary:\n- Only very few insects have to rely on ""bee hotels"". It is more important to provide open ground and a suitable selection of plants. For example, many butterflies have specific needs, that is to say that they need several specific plants for their development: for laying eggs, to feed the caterpillars, and to provide nectar for the hatched butterflies.\n- It is important to provide variety of flower species. Chose native wild herbs suitable to particular soils and climates, e.g. simple, open-shaped varieties which are suitable for the poor soil found in the Southern part of Nuremberg, to which no organic matter has been added. If commercially available seed mixtures are used it is important to check the varieties and their suitability for different light conditions (full sun, partial shade).\n- Wild hedges and trees with many blossoms (fruit trees, willow, hawthorn) are very beneficial.\n- Don\'t forget to add early flowering plants: provide plenty of spring flowering bulbs, winter aconite, and allow early wild herbs (formerly called ""weeds"") to spread.\n- Leave some perennial shrubs and nettles after flowering over the winter season.\n- ""Insect hotels"" only work if they are protected from the weather, are easily accessible, and South facing. Holes drilled into wood may have to be smoothed with a file to prevent injuries to insects. It may also be necessary to use wire mesh as a protection from greedy birds.\n- You can also hang up horizontally bundles of reeds (or other hollow plant stems, or commercially available small cardboard tubes) with a diameter of 2-9mm and cut to a suitable length. Eggs are usually deposited one behind the other.\n- Provide water in a large bowl or basin and top up regularly.\n- On sandy areas you can provide open ground for mining bees, or leave bare soil under large trees in your garden.\n- Deadwood (especially oak) should be left to rot down to provide a ""nursery"" for insects.\n- Piles of stones provide hiding places and a winter habitat.\n- Many of the above suggestions are suitable for small spaces, e.g. balconies. Herbs are easy to grow in pots and planters and help create symbolic and actual green axis.\nLast but not least, the mystery of the ""Merianin Cake"" was solved at the cake buffet. In her acclaimed book about insects in Suriname, Maria Sibylla Merian describes the taste of pineapple, unknown at the time in Europe: ""This fruit tastes like a mixture of grapes, apricots, black currants, apples and pears. The taste is delightful and strong. Once it has been cut its scent fills the entire room."" Margot Lölhöffel used these 5 types of fruit to create a tasty cake which she offered to the visitors.\nSo why not invite your neighbourhood to hands on campaigns and activities? We look forward to receive photographs and reports about your own events on the topics described above.\nInsect houses - large and small\nExample worth imitating: shallow bowls with insect-friendly houseleek and wall pepper\nInsect-friendly plants to take home\nNice project for younger children: ""raised-bed"" made of old flower pots, painted with acrylic paint\nChildren’s corner for colouring drawings\nProfessionals and non-professionals hand in hand\nQuotation from the website of “Palmengarten” in Frankfurt (public palm and botanic garden): ""In recent decades, the number of flying insects in Germany has declined by 70 percent. Climate change, intensification of agriculture, construction and sealing of habitats - all this is destroying the insects\' livelihood."" (1)\nIt is of particular concern that this decline is also connected to the dramatic extinction of entire species. This already crucial loss cannot solely be stopped with new agricultural regulation. Densely populated areas must also be naturally restructured and restored.\nIn its attractive ""Flower and Insect House"" the Frankfurt Palm Garden provides not only a wealth of illustrative material about the ecological relevance of insects, but also flyers in German and English with information on how to improve their natural habitats. The nature-oriented design of all gardens and even every balcony is important.\nWith the consent of the Frankfurt Palm Garden, two links to these leaflets are available here. It is to be hoped that these attractive handouts will also inspire authorities in other cities to offer similar consulting services. This is particularly desirable for Nuremberg with respect to its preparations for the ""Landesgartenschau 2030"" (Bavarian State Garden Exhibition).']"	['<urn:uuid:e7896184-1d29-4561-9fa5-44fd6eebdfb4>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	21	58	2296

19	What should I do if I notice some email addresses on my mailing list are constantly having delivery problems and showing up as soft bounces?	If messages are continuously bounced from addresses showing soft bounces (temporary delivery failures), you should remove these subscribers from your list. While soft bounces can occur due to temporary issues like full inboxes or vacation messages, persistent soft bounces indicate these addresses should be removed.	"[""The only way to measure the return on investment (ROI) of an email marketing campaign is to monitor performance down to the individual message level.\nThis means that marketers must dive head first into the sea of analytics in order to find insights into the successes and failures of their email campaigns. By doing this, marketers can learn how to optimize future messages for better performance.\nHowever, there is currently little in the way of standards when it comes to email analytics – even though there are undoubtedly some metrics that every marketer should be aware of. Luckily, Website Magazine has compiled a list of some of the most valuable metrics available, in order to help marketers take a step closer to receiving better results in the inboxes. Check them out below:\nOpen Rate –\nThis metric measures the number of emails opened against the number of emails that were delivered. A high open rate is a good sign because it shows that a message was not only delivered to the intended recipients, but that the subject line was also enticing enough to receive a click. That being said, marketers should keep in mind that an opened email doesn’t necessarily mean that the recipient engaged with the message.\nBounce Rate (Soft and Hard) –\nThe bounce rate refers to the proportion of email addresses that failed to receive a message. However, there are two different types of bounces – a soft bounce and a hard bounce. A hard bounce is the result of a bad address or technical failure, which means that marketers should remove these addresses from their list. Conversely, a soft bounce occurs when a mail server is temporarily unable to accept an email, which could be the result of a full inbox or even an automatic vacation message. This means that the message may be seen eventually, but marketers should pay attention to these subscribers and remove them from their list if messages are continuously bounced.\nClick (and Click-Through) Rate –\nThe click rate compares the total number of clicks a message receives to the total number of messages that were opened, which can be valuable for measuring engagement rates with specific messages. That being said, marketers can also pay attention to the click-through rate, which refers to the total number of clicks a message receives compared to the total number of messages delivered.\nConversion (and Adjusted Conversion) Rate –\nConversion rate is among the most important metrics to monitor because it is a very good indicator of the return on investment of an email campaign. This metric refers to the total number of conversions compared to the number of messages that have been delivered. On the other hand, the adjusted conversion rate compares the total number of conversions to the total number of clicks.\nAverage Order Value –\nMarketers can measure their email campaign's average order value by dividing the total revenue of conversions by the number of total conversions.\nRevenue per Email –\nTo determine a campaign's success, marketers can measure how much revenue each individual message brings in by dividing their campaign’s total revenue by the number of messages that have been delivered.\nDelivery Rate –\nThis metric is a good indicator of how strong a subscriber list is, marketers simply need to divide the number of messages delivered by the number of messages sent.\nUnsubscribe Rate –\nA high unsubscribe rate is a sign that an email campaign’s content isn’t relevant to the marketer’s subscriber list. This metric can be discovered by dividing the total number of unsubscribed addresses with the number of messages delivered.\nEmail Forward Rate –\nThis metric tells marketers how many times a message was forwarded from the original recipient to a new recipient. The forward rate can be calculated by dividing the number of messages forwarded by the number of messages delivered.""]"	['<urn:uuid:6fc0f55a-60b3-4d57-bf53-13fc0175697a>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	25	45	644
20	corporate governance mechanisms big companies applicable small medium businesses what effective	Several corporate governance mechanisms from big companies can be applicable and effective for small and medium businesses. These include well-developed policies, procedures and processes, risk management systems, strategic planning, transparency and disclosure, reporting, and employee management systems. Implementing these principles of corporate governance can have positive effects for companies of any size.	"['Bundaleska, Elena and Dimitrova, Makedonka and Nikolovska, Zdenka (2011): Corporate governance and small & medium businesses. Published in: Зборник на трудови од 4та меѓународна конференција “Business Development 2011"" (November 2011)\nDownload (119Kb) | Preview\nCorporate governance refers to a set of internal policies, rules, and procedures that a company follows on a regular basis to ensure that it operates in a fair, equitable, and appropriate manner for the benefit of the company, its management and its stakeholders. It is almost always thought about in the context of big publically listed companies. However, it is just as important for privately held, small and medium sized businesses to adhere to good corporate governance policies and practices. One of the reasons being their accountability as key economic drivers and job creators in most of the countries (example: in 2009, there were 27.5 million businesses in the United States, according to US Office of Advocacy estimates`1). As businesses grow and stakeholders increase, good corporate governance becomes even more important, as there are many people with vested interests. Yet many small and medium businesses do not necessarily pay attention to the concepts of corporate governance. Most of them do not even have the necessary structure and knowledge organize and implement it.\nThis Paper discusses how corporate governance applies to small businesses. It explains the mechanisms related to sound corporate governance in big companies, such as well developed and implemented policies, procedures and processes, risk management systems, strategic planning, transparency and disclosure, reporting, employee management systems, etc. and recommends which of these mechanisms may be applicable and effective for small and medium businesses.\nAs there is a buzz among the businesses that legislation requiring small and medium businesses to adhere to similar if not exact rules on corporate governance as big publically listed companies, is being considered, this Paper shall discuss whether the government should impose its will to the small and medium business environment, or leave it up to the discretion of the businesses.\nAs a final note, having discussed all of the above, the Paper shall conclude that every company, no matter what size it is, will see the positive effects of implementing the principles of corporate governance.\n`1 Kobe, Kathryn. 2007.

21	What's needed to force someone into arbitration in California?	Under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.2, one only needs to show the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate the controversy and that a party refuses to arbitrate.	"['For most general contractors, subcontractors, consultants and design professionals, arbitration clauses in construction contracts are common and familiar provisions that typically require all disputes under these agreements to be submitted to arbitration (rather than filed in court). In many instances, arbitration is preferred to litigation, court hearings and trials in that arbitration is usually cheaper than litigation, provides greater procedural flexibility to the parties, results in a faster resolution of the dispute, and allows for greater privacy and confidentiality for the parties. Alternatively, some parties prefer traditional litigation wherein rulings are subject to appeal and disputes are adjudicated in an open and transparent courtroom where judges are mindful that their rulings will be made a matter of public record. Therefore, despite the presence of written agreements to arbitrate, parties sometimes refuse to arbitrate their controversy and, instead, proceed to directly file an action in state court.\nCalifornia Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.2 provides procedures for enforcing arbitration agreements and reads: ""On petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists. . . ."" To satisfy Section 1281.2, courts previously required the petitioner to not only show that the parties entered into a written agreement to arbitrate the controversy, but also that the petition demonstrate that it made a demand to arbitrate that was refused by the respondent.\nIn Hyundai Amco America, Inc. v. S3H, Inc. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 572, the Court of Appeal recently streamlined the procedure by which the petitioning party may compel arbitration after a civil lawsuit has already been filed. In\nHyundai, S3H entered into a subcontractor services agreement with Hyundai Amco to provide mechanical system design and construction services for the mechanical systems to be installed in the United States headquarters building of Hyundai Motor America, Inc. The agreement included an arbitration provision and a California choice-of-law provision. During construction and after Hyundai Amco provided S3H with more than $4.7 million in progress payments, S3H told Hyundai Amco it was dissolving its business and was abandoning its obligations under the agreement. S3H further advised Hyundai Amco that while S3H\'s sub-subcontractors had been paid for work through February 2013, S3H had no intention of paying these contractors for their work in March 2013.\nOn May 21, 2013, Hyundai Amco wrote S3H asserting that S3H had breached its obligations under the agreement and demanded that S3H cure the dispute. Thereafter, with no apparent further communication between Hyundai Amco and S3H, Hyundai Amco filed a complaint in the Orange County Superior Court against S3H asserting causes of action for breach of contract, conversion, fraud by concealment, fraud by intentional misrepresentation, fraudulent transfer, constructive trust, and equitable subrogation.\nS3H filed a motion to compel arbitration under Section 1281.2 that was denied by the trial court. The trial court concluded that because S3H had failed to allege it made a demand to arbitrate that was refused by Hyundai Amco, it had failed to meet its burden of proof. S3H appealed and the Court of Appeal reversed the trial court. Citing to the specific language in Section 1281.2, the Court of Appeal noted that ""[t]he statute does not include a requirement that the petitioning party have made a demand for arbitration, only that the other party has refused to arbitrate."" (Emphasis added) The Court reasoned that ""Hyundai Amco\'s filing of a lawsuit rather than commencing arbitration proceedings as required by the agreement affirmatively establishes Hyundai Amco\'s refusal to arbitrate the controversy."" So long as the lawsuit filed relates to the parties\' performance under the agreement, the filing of the lawsuit, itself, is sufficient to show a party\'s refusal to arbitrate the controversy under Section 1281.2 and justifies granting the motion to compel arbitration.\nIn light of the Hyundai decision, petitioners seeking to compel arbitration in state court actions will not need to prove that they made a demand for arbitration (barring the existence of this express requirement in the agreement) and can satisfy Section 1281.2\'s burden of proof that the respondent refuses to arbitrate the controversy by summarily directing the court to take notice that the filing of the lawsuit alone affirmatively establishes such refusal. This ruling is likely to result in an increase in the number of successful motions to compel arbitration in a variety of cases (including construction cases) while giving pause to parties that are considering filing actions directly in state court to seek relief under agreements containing arbitration provisions.']"	['<urn:uuid:622ec992-eb08-4d94-9668-29d72facef12>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	9	30	776
22	I'm researching resource constraints in production systems - how do raw material limitations affect both healthcare packaging sustainability and traditional manufacturing decisions?	In healthcare packaging, traditional recycled materials are largely unsuitable due to FDA and EU regulations, but sustainable alternatives like sugar cane-based polyethylene are emerging as viable raw material options. Similarly, in manufacturing, raw material constraints directly impact production decisions, as shown in the Lego example where production is limited by available inventory of six large blocks and eight small blocks.	['Let’s begin our study of LP with an example of an important class of problems known as the product mix problem. This exercise follows Prof. Norman Pendegraft’s original, published in his article Lego of My Simplex on ORMS Today 24:1, p. 8, February 1997.\nExample Problem: Lego Tables and Chairs\nS. Claus & Company, the renowned North Pole enterprise, manufactures tables and chairs from Lego blocks for worldwide distribution. A table can be assembled from two large blocks (yellow) and two small blocks (blue). A chair requires one large block and two small blocks, as illustrated below:\nThe marginal contributions to profit for tables and chairs are $16 and $10, respectively. Assume that demand for Claus’s Lego products is virtually unlimited and that all other production resources are plentiful and available. For the upcoming production run, Claus has six large blocks and eight small blocks in components inventory, as shown below:\nDetermine the product mix (i.e., the number of tables and chairs to be produced) for the upcoming production run such that total contribution to profit is maximized. (Claus is actually a nonprofit enterprise. All proceeds are donated to charitable causes.)\nBefore modeling this problem, you may wish to try solving it on your own. It should not be too hard since this is, after all, a toy problem.\nTo solve the problem with LP, let’s follow the steps discussed previously. Note that Step 0 (recognizing the problem) has already been done by virtue of the problem statement. In the real world, the analyst should prepare (or obtain) a written problem statement analogous to the one above prior to embarking on problem modeling.\n1. Define the Problem\nLP problem definition requires the specification of two basic elements: an objective and a set of constraints.\nObjective: maximize total contribution to profit\nComments: The assumption that demand is “virtually unlimited” means there is no demand constraint for this problem. In general, market demand imposes a constraint on production: produce no more than can be sold. By the same token, all other resources necessary for production are assumed to be plentiful and therefore yield no constraints for this model.\n2. Define the Decision Variables\nPut yourself in the position of the production manager: What decision is required from the manager so that production can begin? Clearly, the production staff must be told how many units to assemble of each product. Once they know that, production can begin. Thus,\nLet x = number of tables to be assembled (in the upcoming production run)\nIn mathematics, variables represent unknown quantities. Initially, we don’t know how many tables and chairs should be assembled. But by using variables, we can model and solve the problem. The solution to the problem consists of the values that will be determined by LP for each of the decision variables. LP will be able to find the optimal solution if we are successful in formulating a correct model, which is the next step.\n3. Collect the Necessary Data\nThe problem statement for this example included the data: the parameters. In the real world, the analyst must obtain the data.\n4. Formulate a Model\nLP model formulation basically consists of expressing the objective and each constraint algebraically in terms of the decision variables:\n4A. Objective Function\nThe stated objective is to maximize total contribution to profit. Claus generates its profit from two products: tables and chairs. Thus, the total profit contribution must equal the sum of profits derived from tables plus the profits obtained from chairs. That is to say, we know that the objective function must have two terms, and that they are summed.\nConsider first the contribution to profit due to tables. Each table contributes $16 to profit. Claus will produce x tables, where x is still to be determined. Consequently, the contribution to profit due to x tables is 16x , in dollars. Analogously, the profit contribution due to chairs is 10y. Finally, the total profit contribution is the sum of these two terms. Therefore, the objective function is:\nMax 16x + 10y\nIt is common practice to express the objective as a formal equation. Creating a new variable Z to stand for total profit contribution, we have:\nMax Z = 6x + 10y\nEither expression is accepted as valid in LP formulations. Note that Z is not a decision variable, which are independent variables, but a dependent variable added to the model for convenience. Dependent variables depend on other (independent) variables for their values — in this case, Z = ƒ ( x , y ). Independent variables have their values assigned independently by the decision maker (or by LP).\nNote: Since Z is a dependent variable, it is not usually defined formally, as was the case with the decision variables.', 'What does sustainability mean to healthcare packaging?\nIn 1987 the World Commission on Environment and Development defined sustainability as “Sustainable development meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”\nThere are a variety of initiatives that are underway and being proposed for consumer goods packaging. However, the demands placed on many types of healthcare packaging preclude some of these sustainable initiatives. The mantra of ‘Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle’ is severely limited by FDA and EU regulatory requirements for healthcare packaging. For example, there are significant restrictions on reuse or recycling of materials for healthcare products and their packaging. Compostable packaging materials are currently unlikely candidates for healthcare packaging due to concerns about shelf life limitations and sterilization compatibility.\nOn a more positive note, continued advances in materials have made and may continue to make it possible to reduce the amount of packaging used. It is often possible to use thinner or lighter materials for packaging through the use of laminates and coextrusions as well as using newly available polymers, copolymers and additives. These new materials often perform at such a high level that reductions in the amounts of packaging used can reach 20 to 50% depending on the application and existing package structure and sterile barrier system. Because of the potential for cost savings involved, this type of packaging reduction has gone on for many years. Yet, there are still opportunities to reduce the amount of packaging used in many healthcare applications. In addition, package reduction can also be achieved by changes to package design and/or package format.\nWhile the feasibility of including recycled materials into healthcare packaging remains dubious given the current regulatory environment, the potential to recycle healthcare packaging into other applications is more promising. There exists a significant quantity of potentially recyclable material that is lost to landfill due to lack of infrastructure to capture it in a way that would facilitate recycling. The lack of a defined cost effective recycle stream for these materials is a contributing reason for this loss.\nAn additional option is for materials to be channeled into an energy recovery system. In this process materials are incinerated and the energy released in burning is converted to generate electricity. This option does not have the same limitations of materials streams as the recycle process in terms of multi-layers film structures. The EPA identifies that 90% of all potentially infectious medical waste in the US is incinerated. A move towards making this practice into energy recovery systems may offer a better alternative to landfill waste of medical packaging systems.\nAn encouraging development is the recent establishment of industry related groups focused on sustainability in healthcare. The Healthcare Plastics Recycling Council (HPRC) is one organization. The HPRC website describes the group as follows: “HPRC is a private technical coalition of peers across the healthcare, recycling and waste management industries seeking to inspire and enable sustainable, cost-effective recycling solutions for plastic products and materials used in the delivery of healthcare.” Another organization of note is Practice Greenhealth. The website describes this organization as follows: “Practice Greenhealth is the source for environmental solutions for the healthcare sector and lends support to create better, safer, greener workplaces and communities. Practice Greenhealth is a nonprofit membership organization founded on the principles of positive environmental stewardship and best practices by organizations in the healthcare community.” The Flexible Packaging Association (FPA) has also been actively engaged in pursuing the end of life options for food and medical packaging.\nAn evolving area to explore in packaging sustainability is the source of the raw materials. While recycled materials are not suitable for healthcare packaging, the use of raw materials from sustainable sources can be explored further. One source of sustainable materials suitable for healthcare packaging is familiar polymers made from new sources of hydrocarbons. For instance large scale production of polyethylene using sugar cane as the raw material has recently become a reality. Other similar processes will likely be developed over the next few years to produce other common polymers from sustainable sources, not petroleum or natural gas. Of course, any new material must be tested to prove its suitability for the intended use. If the basic polymer chemistry is unchanged, there is a high likelihood that these new materials will perform like their petroleum based analogs. The new materials lack long term performance data making the willingness for assuming initial risk a potential barrier.\nReferring back to the definition above, “Sustainable development meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” As this relates to packaging it should be noted that the system that creates our ability to package and protect healthcare products, must be evaluated on the broadest possible scale; what materials are used to make the package, how efficiently can it be made to benefit the environment and at the same time provide product protection, maintenance of sterility and aseptic presentation. Consider also available options for end-of-life removal and destruction of the packaging to recover the components with a lower consumption of resources. The manufacture, use and removal of these materials have a broad environmental impact that should be considered.\nAny interest in sustainable packaging should be discussed with your packaging supplier to help determine what options for sustainability are best for your application.']	['<urn:uuid:cfdaaf7e-21ea-446f-84eb-5a9169e9f7dd>', '<urn:uuid:d4dc8af3-c53d-4a30-805a-30aa15bcb173>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	22	60	1686
23	how florida supreme court picks main justice cases	The primary justice for each case at the Florida Supreme Court is selected at random before oral arguments are scheduled, with each justice being assigned the same number of cases.	['By Kristin A. Norse, of Kynes, Markman & Felman, P.A.\nIn January of this year, Governor Ron DeSantis appointed the Honorable Robert J. Luck to be the 88th justice of the Florida Supreme Court, filling one of three vacancies left at the end of 2018 by the retirements of Justices Barbara Pariente, Fred Lewis, and Peggy Quince. At the time of his appointment, The Record had only recently published a Judicial Profile of Justice Luck covering his background and experience leading up to his appointment and service on the Third District Court of Appeal. For those seeking to learn more about Justice Luck the person, you can find that article here. Having thoroughly delved into those matters but hoping to commemorate his elevation to the Florida Supreme Court, the Section asked Justice Luck if he would be willing to answer a few more in-depth questions about how his prior experiences and interests shape his perspective and approach as a justice. He graciously agreed to do so.\nCongratulations on your appointment! Now that you have served as a justice for a few months, was there anything about your new position that surprised you or that you didn’t expect?\nThere is something that was not personally surprising to me, but that I find others—even judges and attorneys—find surprising, and that is the amount of work the Florida Supreme Court does that is not the traditionally well-known task of resolving cases. When most people think of the work of the Florida Supreme Court, they think of work similar to what the United States Supreme Court does, reviewing briefs, holding oral argument, issuing written decisions. But the Florida Supreme Court is also the head of The Florida Bar and the Judicial Branch. One of its largest dockets is the one involving disciplinary proceedings for lawyers and judges. And then there are the policy making and rule making tasks the Court does, each policy and rule requiring careful consideration.\nWhen I try to explain it to others, I describe the Court as wearing three hats. The first is the one you see on television or other media, deciding cases. The second is overseeing the Bar, with its more than 100,000 lawyers across the country. And the third is overseeing the branch, including over 600 judges and thousands of employees. Each role takes a tremendous amount of time and thought.\nYou previously clerked for an Eleventh Circuit judge, the Honorable Ed Carnes, and worked as a federal prosecutor. Then you served as a circuit court, then a district court judge, and now serve as a justice in the Florida state court system. What are some of the biggest differences you see between the federal courts and the state courts?\nOne of the biggest differences between the federal and state judicial systems are the resources available to the judiciary. At the appellate level, for example, 11th circuit judges have four law clerks and a staff attorney, and then there is a central staff with 50 to 70 attorneys. We do not have the same resources in the state appellate system.\nAt the trial level, federal district court judges have 2-3 law clerks. But state circuit or county court judges are not assigned individual law clerks, and rely instead on access to a law clerk who works for a group of judges.\nAnother significant difference between the two systems is how cases are processed at the trial level—both in criminal and civil cases. Federal criminal prosecutions are proactive. There is typically a thorough investigation made before any arrest. Once the arrest is made, the case can progress relatively quickly because the groundwork is already laid. The state criminal system is more reactive. Arrests may be made early in a case and then a more thorough investigation ensues as part of the criminal prosecution process.\nOn the civil side, there is also a difference in how the litigation process works. In the federal system, the judiciary drives the litigation schedule. Once a case is filed, a scheduling order is issued that sets the course and schedule for the case and triggers deadlines. Litigants are required to comply or actively seek extensions.\nIn the state system, the attorneys and litigants are primarily responsible for moving the case forward. They have to file the motions and schedule the hearings that move the case forward.\nIn this respect, it’s striking to me that you can have two courts blocks away from each other that operate so differently.\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to each system, depending on the circumstances. I think you’ll hear praise or complaints regarding both. In a federal case, the court-imposed structure may push a case forward more quickly even when the litigants may need additional time or the subject matter might ideally merit it. In the state system, there can be frustrating delays when lawyers or litigants struggle to move a case forward. In the end, both systems can learn from each other.\nYour experience has also spanned both civil and criminal practice. Which do you find more interesting, or what aspects of each do you find most compelling?\nI find both areas of law interesting and don’t prefer one over the other. And there are things I find compelling in both.\nI find civil litigation compelling and interesting because of its diversity—it covers a lot of ground. For those who remember looking at the shelves of books, Florida Jurisprudence used to span about 60 volumes, and of those 45 to 50 involved civil litigation, with only 10 to 15 addressing criminal law. When I was assigned to a circuit civil division, it was not unusual to find myself presiding over a case that involved a cause of action or statute I had never previously heard of.\nCriminal law is compelling to me because every criminal case implicates individual liberties and governmental power.\nYou also have the experience of serving in all three branches of government. Has that given you any unique insights into your role as an appellate jurist?\nHaving the opportunity to work in each branch of government—for me, having worked in the executive branch with the Department of Justice and in the legislative branch as a legislative aid for two senators on Capitol Hill—has given me a greater understanding and respect for the role that each branch plays in our system of government. But this experience is not unique to me. Chief Justice Canady and Justice Muniz, for example, have also worked in the executive and legislative branches.\nI would assume one of the biggest differences between your position as a district court judge and your position as a justice is that now you are considering each case with six of your colleagues, not two. How does that change the dynamics of the decision-making process? Do you approach oral argument differently? Do you approach your discussions with the other justices differently than you did when you were trying to persuade other district court judges of your position?\nThe goal in both cases is the same—we are trying to find the right answer. That means the approach is generally the same. The dynamics are different only in that conferences are a bit longer with seven justices rather than three judges. But the greater number means there are more bright minds in the room, and I believe that helps lead to a better result, particularly when you are talking about cases with statewide application.\nMy preparation for oral argument is the same. But with more justices asking questions, it can be harder to jump in with the questions you want to ask. So I find myself being a bit quieter on the bench in a typical oral argument, and perhaps prioritizing the questions I want to ask.\nOne interesting distinction is the way conferences are conducted. At the Florida Supreme Court, the primary Justice speaks first and then each justice speaks in the order of seniority. As a result, because I’m the second-most junior justice, there is not always a lot for me to add or say by the time the discussion reaches me. At the Third District Court of Appeal, the general practice was to have the primary judge speak first and then the other judges spoke in reverse order of seniority. That meant I was often offering my opinion or insights in a case before my colleagues.\nThat brings up another question appellate practitioners may be interested in. How is the primary justice selected for each case?\nAs in the district courts of appeal, a primary judge is selected at random before oral arguments are scheduled and in a manner that each justice is assigned the same number of cases.\nDo you think you will have a different approach to your work philosophically as a justice than you did as district court judge? For example, does the fact that your decisions will have statewide impact affect how you approach them or think about them?\nI don’t think there’s a different approach philosophically. Again, the goal is the same—to get it right. But the task is different. A number of district court cases involve “error correction.” The opinion describes the law and how it should have been applied to a particular set of facts. In the supreme court, the task in resolving cases often involves sorting out conflicts in the law or addressing questions of great public importance. The conflict cases and those presenting unresolved issues of great public importance provide an appreciably different task than the cases typically decided by a district court of appeal.\nOne distinction between the supreme court and the district court, of course, is the more limited jurisdiction and the necessity of deciding on a regular basis when it is proper to exercise jurisdiction when it is discretionary. What factors go into that discretionary decision on jurisdiction? What are you looking for in deciding which cases merit further review?\nMuch has been written in the case law on this topic, and there is not much more to add. But the numbers do tell a story. Historically the supreme court has taken up to 90% of cases in which a district court has certified conflict or a question of great public importance. I think that speaks to the deference the supreme court affords to district court judges and the priority the Court places on assisting district court judges who are struggling to answer difficult and important questions and seeking guidance from the court.\nIn your prior profile article, you mentioned enjoying reading historical biographies. What historical figure most intrigues you? What period of history is of the most interest to you?\nThe “most intriguing historical figure” is one of those impossible questions, because it is so difficult to pick one. But as I am asked to choose, I would have to say George Washington. At the time of his presidency, it was outside anyone’s experience that a person as revered and powerful, entrusted to run a country he himself had helped create, would willingly cede that power and position to effectively become a gentleman farmer. He did it for the good of the country, to set that important precedent. During the difficult winter at Valley Forge, and in the difficult years before and after, he held the army together until France could provide assistance. I’m not sure there are many people throughout history who could have accomplished what George Washington did or make a similar mark.\nI am currently working my way through the history of the Florida Supreme Court, reading now the third volume of the compendium prepared by the Florida Supreme Court Historical Society. The book is extremely well researched and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the court.\nAnother way in which you have been able to experience both sides of a coin is that you had the experience of both running for election and appointment. What are your thoughts on both processes?\nThis is another area where I can see the advantages of both selection processes. There are great judges across the state who are serving through each of these processes.\nIt’s interesting to note that Florida voters have been asked numerous times if they want to switch away from the election of judges to a system of pure appointment, but the voters consistently say no.\nAs for my own experience, running for election required me to go into the community and meet citizens and leaders I would not have otherwise met. It allowed me to see places I may not have otherwise seen. That made me a better judge and a better person.\nWhat do you think is one of the biggest challenges facing the legal system today?\nAs a justice of only a few months, it may be harder to answer that question. But one of the biggest challenges we face is access to justice—solving the problem of providing legal services to underserved or unserved populations. How do we ensure everyone who needs a lawyer has access to one? How do we ensure lawyers can provide services to all of the citizens that need them? This is a problem that is the subject of discussion and action by the Access to Justice Commission, The Florida Bar Pro Bono Committee, and the Florida Bar Foundation, as well as many local legal aid societies and local bar associations. It is a discussion we may need to continue for years to come.\nOn a more personal note, do you think being a parent has changed the way you think about some of the cases that come before you?\nIt hasn’t changed the way I look at cases. But I do believe being a parent has made me a better person and a better judge. It has taught me to be more patient, and to be a better listener and communicator. And it has changed my life priorities. Being a parent has certainly heightened my desire to serve, and to leave the state in as good or better a place for my children and others.\nAchieving appointment as a Florida Supreme Court Justice is really a pretty high pinnacle when it comes to career goals. Having accomplished that, what remaining goals do you see for yourself?\nMy main goal is to tackle this job and to do it well. During my interviews with the Judicial Nominating Commission, I was asked a question along the lines of what judge or justice I most admired. When I think of the many justices that have served, one that comes immediately to mind is Justice Arthur England, who I had the honor of working with at Greenberg Traurig. He joined the supreme court at a time of great turbulence for the Court. He helped right the ship and turn it into the fine institution it is and has been. He was such an agent for positive reform for the judiciary and the practice of law—spearheading the revision of Article V, helping to institute the IOTA system with its benefits to legal services, reforming tax and administrative law, etc. If I can be half the person and justice that he was, I’ll feel that I’ve done a job worthy of the position.\nThank you so much for your time and your willingness to share your views with our members.\nKristin Norse is a partner at Kynes, Markman & Felman, P.A., where she practices exclusively in the areas of appellate practice, litigation support, and trial consulting in state and federal courts.

24	Can a pet cat and a wild raccoon both give you rabies?	Yes, both cats and raccoons can transmit rabies to humans. The rabies virus is transmitted through bites or through saliva contact with wounds or mucous membranes. Both domestic animals like cats and wild animals like raccoons are known reservoirs of rabies, and the disease produces a fatal acute viral encephalomyelitis.	['Cat-scratch Disease: Bartonella henselae, a rickettsial organism, is associated with cat-scratch disease. In young cats a chronic, asymptomatic bacteremia can occur. The disease can be transmitted to humans by bites, scratches or licks and can result in regional lymphadeopathy, fever, headache and splenomegaly. In immunocompromised people, a severe systemic or recurrent infection can occur.\nPrevention: The use of appropriate handling techniques and protective clothing should minimize the likelihood of exposure to bites and scratches from cats.\nRabies: The incidence of rabies in wildlife in the United States has increased in recent years and there is a possibility of transmission to dogs and cats with uncertain vaccination history. Rabies is very rare in the laboratory environment but any random source animal or wild animal showing central nervous system signs must be considered a potentially rabid animal. The rabies virus is most commonly transmitted to other animals or humans by the bite of a rabid animal or by introduction of saliva containing the virus into skin wounds or intact mucous membranes. Rabies produces a fatal acute viral encephalomyelitis.\nPrevention: Pre-exposure immunization should be available to personnel working with or caring for animals of uncertain vaccination status or those who work with wildlife known to be reservoirs of rabies.\nToxoplasma: The coccidian parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, has its complete life cycle in cats. Humans can act as an intermediate host for the parasite and can become infected with T. gondii by fecal material from infected cats. Toxoplasma usually produces an asymptomatic infection or a mild infection with flu-like symptoms. Infection in immunosuppressed people can be much more severe. Infection of a previously uninfected pregnant woman can result in death of the fetus or birth defects.\nPrevention: Personnel should practice good personal hygiene which includes frequent washing of hands after handling animals or animal waste. Proper disposal of cat feces and litter before the infective form of the parasite develops will also prevent spread of this disease.\nCryptosporidia: Cryptosporidium species have a worldwide distribution and can be found in many animal species including cats. Cryptosporidiosis is caused by protozoan parasites that live in the intestines of mammals. Cryptosporidiosis is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and can cause diarrhea in humans. Usually the diarrhea is self-limiting but in immunocompromised individuals the disease can have a prolonged course.\nPrevention: Appropriate personal-hygiene practices which include washing hands after contact with animals or their waste should prevent spread of this organism.\nGiardia: Giardia species are present in wild animals and laboratory animals, including dogs and cats. Giardia is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Human infection can be asymptomatic or cause nausea, abdominal cramping, and intermittent diarrhea.\nPrevention: Good personal hygiene which includes hand washing after contact with animals or their waste will help prevent spread of this organism.\nCampylobacter: Campylobacter species can be found in pet and laboratory animal species. Transmission to humans is by the fecal-oral route and can produce an acute enteritis. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting.\nPrevention: Use of personal protective clothing, good personal hygiene, and sanitation measures will help to prevent the transmission of the disease.\nRingworm: Dermatophytes, which are fungi, cause ringworm in humans and animals. Infection in animals may be inapparent and is transmitted to humans by direct contact with infected animals or by indirect contact with contaminated equipment or materials. Dermatophytes produce flat, circular lesions that are clear in the center and crusted and red on the periphery.\nPrevention: The use of protective clothing, disposable gloves, and hand washing along with good personal hygiene will help to reduce the spread of dermatophytosis in a laboratory animal facility.\nSalmonellosis: Along with a variety of other species, Salmonella, and other enteric bacteria are capable of causing disease in humans. Salmonellae are transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Infection produces an acute enterocolitis and fever with possible secondary complications such as septicemia.\nPrevention: Use of protective clothing, personal hygiene which include hand washing after contact with animals or their waste, and sanitation measures prevent the transmission of the disease.\nAscariasis: Toxocara canis, the dog ascarid or round worm, is a cause of larva migrans syndromes in children. The ascarid of cats, Toxocara cati, is also capable of causing disease in humans. When eggs of either species are accidentally ingested, they will hatch and the infective stage larvae will migrate outside of the intestinal tract (larva migrans). Liver, lungs and other organs and tissue can be permanently damaged by the migrating larvae. Infected children may be left with permanent vision or neurologic damage.\nPrevention: Appropriate testing and treating of research dogs and cats for intestinal parasites will prevent the spread of ascarid between animals and lower the risk for personnel. Good personal hygiene to include hand washing after contact with dogs and cats and their waste will help prevent this disease in humans.\nHookworms: Ancylostoma caninum, Ancylostoma braziliense, Ancylostoma tubaeforme and Uncinaria stenocephala, are the hookworms of dogs and cats. People can also become infected when the larvae in soil or on other surfaces are ingested or directly penetrate the skin. These parasites then migrate under the skin creating cutaneous larva migrans syndromes characterized by pruritic, linear eruptive lesions. A. canium larvae are capable of penetrating into other tissues and inducing symptoms of visceral larva migrans or can migrate and mature in the intestine and cause an enteritis.\nPrevention: Appropriate testing and treating of research dogs and cats for intestinal parasites will prevent the spread of hookworms between animal and lower the risk for personnel. Good personnel hygiene to include hand washing after contact with animals or their waste will help prevent disease in humans.\nRisk assessment- UC Davis\nOccupational Health and Safety in the Care and Use of Research Animals, National Research Council; National Academy Press, 1997.\nCenter for Disease Control- Division of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases', 'What is rabies?\nRabies is a fatal viral disease affecting the central nervous system. It is transmitted from infected mammals to man. Transmission is through the bite of an infected animal. The virus can also be transmitted by contact with saliva to mucus membranes or an open wound that recently bled. In the United States rabies is prevalent. In Otsego County, animals test positive for rabies every year.\nWhich animals can be infected with rabies?\nAny warm blooded mammals including man can be infected with rabies. Commonly raccoons, skunks, fox, coyotes, and bats have rabies. Domesticated animals such as dogs, cats, ferrets, cows, and horses can also be infected with rabies.\nWhat are common signs of an animal infected with rabies?\nA change in an animal’s behavior is usually the first sign of rabies. A wild animal may appear tame or an usually friendly pet may become aggressive. This is due to the virus attacking the part of the brain that controls behavior. Other signs can be staggering, convulsions, frothing at the mouth, paralysis and a change in voice.\nWhat are symptoms of rabies in humans?\nEarly symptoms include irritability, headache, fever and sometimes itching or pain at the site of exposure. The disease eventually progresses to paralysis, spasms of the throat muscles, convulsions, delirium and death.\nHow can rabies be prevented in humans?\nIf you are exposed to rabies through the bite of an infected animal or suspected animal, rabies post exposure treatment is necessary. Treatment for rabies requires prompt scrubbing of the bite, followed by the administration of rabies immune globulin (dosage dependent of weight) and four doses of rabies vaccine given in the arm muscle on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 after exposure. If the wild animal is available for testing, due to the long incubation period, treatment can usually be delayed until rabies is confirmed. Rabies can usually be confirmed in 2-3 days\nRabies is a fatal viral infection!\nIn both people and animals, once symptoms occur rabies is almost always fatal. The incubation period is the time between exposure and onset of symptoms. This can range from 10 days to months. Once symptoms occur, treatment is ineffective. Due to the long incubation time, disease can be prevented with intervention following a bite. Vaccination of pets (dogs, cats and ferrets) and livestock offers protection against rabies. There is no post exposure treatment for unvaccinated animals and these animals, if in contact with a rabid animal or suspected rabid animal, are required, by NYS law to be euthanized or kept in a double locked quarantine for 6 months at owner’s expense.\nWhat if I am bit by a pet dog or cat?\nIf you are bitten by a pet, that animal needs to be observed for 10 days for signs of rabies. NYS law requires all dogs, cats, and ferrets to be vaccinated for rabies. Pet vaccination is the first line of defense for humans. Pets may be confined, with the local health department’s approval, at home and observed by owners under the direction of the health department. If you are bitten by a stray dog or cat, that animal needs to be safely captured and sent for rabies testing.\nWhat can be done to prevent the spread of rabies?\nExposure to rabies may be minimized by removing all stray dogs and cats, having all pets vaccinated and staying away from all wild animals especially those acting abnormally. To control the spread of rabies in wild animals such as raccoons, the New York State Department of Health has recently been distributing a form of bait containing rabies vaccine in wooded areas inmunize the animals.\nFor more information see']	['<urn:uuid:1356c876-0717-4da5-aff5-1017422847b1>', '<urn:uuid:c3275a30-3520-4662-8bd1-7869479688e6>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	12	50	1577
25	specialist requiring knowledge hydrophone monitoring systems long term data collection environmental research deployment locations challenges	Hydrophone monitoring systems face different challenges based on their deployment methods. The RemOs2 project demonstrates long-term underwater deployment challenges, requiring equipment that can operate continuously in harsh conditions, handling both tiny biological sounds and intense anthropogenic noise while surviving permanent submersion. The system is deployed 40 meters from Heligoland in the North Sea. On a larger scale, NOAA operates various deployment types: SOSUS arrays in military-significant areas, the Pioneer Seamount Observatory off California's coast as the first civilian deep-water array, and portable hydrophone systems in the equatorial Pacific, Gulf of Alaska, and North Atlantic. Future developments aim to combine cabled observatories, autonomous instruments, and new technologies to create a global monitoring network, though this will require extensive partnerships between agencies and international collaboration.	"['Underwater observatory takes Sound Devices USBPre 2 on a deep dive to record hydrophone signals and electric fields for marine biology research off the coast of Germany.\nHeligoland in the North Sea – A marine biology study at the Zurich University of the Arts is currently being conducted to dive deeper into central issues influencing pollutants in inland waters on the coastal region of Germany through the North and Arctic Seas. The RemOs2 Underwater Observatory, a part of the Coastal Observing Systems for Northern and Arctic Seas or COSYNA, had the goal of amassing knowledge from the academic community by combining the collected data and research of all marine biology institutes.\nRemOs2 is transported by a winch on a sled 40 meters from Heligoland, a small group of German islands in the North sea, to examine the underwater animal world, including plankton, with a stereo camera system, an ultrasonic sonar, and a high-resolution hydrophone.\nAs a continuation of RemOs2, Zurich University designed its own probe and module, ""Computersignale”, to record hydrophone signals and electric fields that can be heard 24/7 via livestream. Since the module and all of its components are permanently underwater, the project team chose the Sound Devices USBPre audio interface because of its robust build and audio quality. The USBPre 2’s high-performance limiter and high pass filter also helped to cut through the immense range of underwater noise and low frequencies. These features and its Linux system compatibility made the USBPre 2 an ideal fit for the project.\nWe caught up with the initiator of the RemOs2, Zurich University of the Arts Professor Hannes Rickli, and Rycote’s Chief Technology Officer Timo Klinge, to learn more about this unique project:\nQ: How many students and professors are involved in the RemOs2 project?\nA: Prof. Rickli: The project involves two working groups:\n- A working group of Prof. Dr. Philipp Fischer, Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), two postgraduates, and two undergraduates from the Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (https://www.awi.de/en/science/special-groups/scientific-diving/scientific-projects.html)\n- A working group of myself, one postgraduate, and two research associates from Zurich University of the Arts (https://www.zhdk.ch/forschungsprojekt/544365).\nQ: Can you describe the importance of high quality audio relative to the research that is being conducted?\nA: Prof. Rickli: We are setting up a long-term recording of the underwater audiosphere off the shore of the North Sea island of Heligoland. Within the experimental field MarGate, (https://www.awi.de/en/science/special-groups/scientific-diving/margate.html) we are planning to record continuously for several years. Noises of anthropogenic origin dominate in the recordings, like the clattering sounds of the underwater observation infrastructure in the current and the passing boats. Rare and far weaker are acoustic signals from animals. In order to be able to reproduce the very high dynamics and range of frequencies occurring, we need specially designed hydrophones and sound cards. The equipment must be stable and durable. It is planned to build a parallel system off the shore of Spitzbergen in the Arctic Ocean in 2018 for comparative surveys. Originally, the project was initiated from the perspective of art. In the meantime, there has been several years of technical cooperation with the AWI fish ecologists, and the results are put at the disposal of the scientists.\nQ: What is the process in which audio is being captured? What mics into the USBPre 2, and how does it interface with the master unit?\nA: Prof. Rickli: We record animal sounds, like from seals, marine mammals, and fish, and want to contrast these organic sounds with human-made acoustic emissions such as marine engines and wind parks. We’re capturing audio using the Ambient Recording TC4042 Spherical Hydrophone and the Sound Devices USBPre 2.\nQ: What is the “master unit” being used to record the audio?\nA: Prof. Rickli: The USBPre 2 is attached to a Gumstix DuoVero COM board via a powered USB hub. A custom yocto-based Linux system is running on the system-on-chip, which currently limits the supported sampling rate to 48 kHz.\nQ: What was Ambient Recording’s and Timo Klinge’s role in this project?\nA: Prof. Rickli: Since the AWI has already carried out major projects in the area of long-term hydroacoustics (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PALAOA) and for these projects Ambient Recording has delivered the devices, Prof. Fischer referred us to this company in Munich where Timo Klinge helped us with his knowledge of underwater acoustics and audio and set up the selected Hydrophone TC 4042 and the USBPre 2 interface.\nQ: While this is a first-time pairing of Sound Devices with RemOs2, but Ambient Recording has relied on Sound Devices in the past. Can you tell us what about the USBPre 2 led to its recommendation for this type of scientific exploration?\nA: Timo Klinge: I had the pleasure to supervise and design a lot of special underwater audio systems in the past 13 years, and every single one had very unique requirements. However, what counts most when you work in extreme conditions is that your equipment is robust enough to withstand all possible circumstances. Your second thought of course is the audio quality. This particular use case scenario was very unique as the module needed to work for months, possibly years in a small plastic box submerged in the ocean. The system had to cope with huge dynamic difference from tiny scratching sounds of tiny crabs or worms on the bottom of the sea, to the extreme amplitudes of tanker engines and cavitation noises of enormous propellers, without any access to the microphone gain. Additionally, the power consumption needed to be as low as possible and the setup as small as possible. The USBPre 2 was the only interface delivering all these options in one small box:\n- It provided low noise high quality analogue microphone preamps, so we didn’t have to fear that quiet sounds are masked by too high self-noise of the amps.\n- It is powered via USB, so no additional power source was required.\n- It features professional limiters with short attack to cope with the high level of passing ships without distorting the signal.\n- It features 24-Bit recording with high sampling rates to additionally increase the signal to noise ratio.\n- It works straight with the Linux based control circuit designed by Valentina Vuksic.\n- It is very compact and designed to work in the field. Thus it provides a far better resilience to humidity than e.g. studio interfaces.\n- It can be calibrated, so we can replicate the setup for a second RemOS2 if required one day.\nSo, to sum it all up without the USBPre 2 we wouldn’t have been able to do what we did.\nTimo Klinge joined Rycote Microphone Windshields Ltd as their new CTO in April 2017. He still supervises the audio aspects of the RemOS2 project in close cooperation with Ambient Recording.', ""Just as microphones collect sound in the air, underwater hydrophones detect acoustic signals in the ocean. Most hydrophones are based on a special property (piezoelecticity) of certain ceramics that produce a small electrical current when subjected to pressure changes. When submerged in water, a ceramic hydrophone produces small-voltage signals over a wide range of frequencies as it is exposed to underwater sounds propagating from any direction (read Ocean Acoustics for a discussion of how sound is produced and transmitted through the ocean). By amplifying and recording the electrical signals produced by a hydrophone, sound in the sea can be measured with great precision. Although a single hydrophone records sound arriving from any direction, several hydrophones can be simultaneously deployed in an array, and the resulting signals can then be manipulated to “listen” in any direction with even greater sensitivity than a single hydrophone element.\nWhether within an array or as a single element, the hydrophone is the basic sensor of underwater acoustics. Currently, several technologies are available for acoustic exploration of the ocean.\nFor decades, the U.S. Navy has used a device called a sonobuoy to record the sound of enemy submarines. This simple device can be deployed either from an aircraft or a surface ship. The sonobuoy includes a single underwater hydrophone and a radio transmitter to send the recorded signals back to the aircraft or ship. By deploying multiple sonobuoys in a pattern, the location of the “target” can be determined. Sonobuoys have been used in ocean exploration as well to record marine mammal calls and listen for earthquake activity. The short life span of the device (a few hours) prohibits long-term monitoring of ocean sounds.\nA much more expensive, but permanent, technology for acoustic exploration is the installation of a hydrophone array connected to an underwater communications cable. Since the 1960s, the U.S. Navy has operated such a SOund SUrveillance System (SOSUS) for military applications in many areas of the world ocean. With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the end of the Cold War, the U.S. Navy offered the civilian scientific community “dual use” of SOSUS to evaluate its value in ocean environmental monitoring.\nSince 1991, NOAA has successfully used these arrays to detect submarine volcanic eruptions in the northeast Pacific and blue whale movements in the same area. The range of the system is such that volcanic tremors from south of Japan have been successfully detected and located using SOSUS arrays deployed off the coasts of Oregon and Washington. Access to SOSUS is restricted, both in the sense that the data are classified and can only be used in a secure facility. The arrays also do not cover the entire world's oceans as they are deployed only in areas of military need. The cabled nature of SOSUS allows real-time acquisition of the acoustic data, but at a high cost; the total investment in SOSUS is estimated at more than $16 billion.\nThe Sound in the Sea 2001 Expedition to Pioneer Seamount offshore of California installed the first long-term cabled acoustic observatory in the deep ocean. During the 1990s, an expensive underwater cable was laid to Pioneer Seamount to conduct an oceanographic experiment that has since concluded. In support of ocean exploration, NOAA has assumed responsibility for the cable. The Pioneer Seamount Acoustic Observatory is the first deep-water civilian (non-classified) hydrophone array for long-term monitoring of ambient ocean noises and their effects on the marine environment. The array consists of four hydrophone elements suspended vertically in the water above the sea floor. The acoustic data are collected at a small Air Force base in coastal California, and are immediately accessible to both scientists and the public via the World Wide Web.\nDiagram of the Autonomous Underwater Hydrophone (AUH) mooring. The schematic is not to scale, but does show the main mooring components and their locations in the water column. Click image for larger view.\nIn the mid-1990s, based on the success of earlier work with SOSUS, NOAA developed portable hydrophones that can be deployed anywhere in the world ocean. These devices consist of a single ceramic hydrophone attached to a water-proof pressure case that contains all of the batteries, computers, clocks, and other electronics required to maintain the hydrophone for several years. They have been used successfully in marine mammal studies and seismic studies, and have even been used to detect landslides on the south shore of Hawaii from a range of more than 5,000 km. These instruments have the advantage of portability; that is, they can be deployed anywhere in the world ocean. Another advantage is that these instruments are relatively inexpensive compared to a cabled system such as SOSUS. The major disadvantage is that data cannot be currently provided in real time; one must wait until a ship revisits the deployment site and recovers the instrument. It is anticipated that improvements in global cellular telephones in the coming years will make real-time transmission from inexpensive hydrophone moorings a reality. Portable hydrophone arrays are currently deployed in the equatorial Pacific, the Gulf of Alaska, and the North Atlantic south of the Azores (in partnership with NSF and Oregon State University). In 2002, Sound in the Sea in partnership with scientists in France, deployed a new hydrophone array in the Atlantic north of the Azores as part of the SIRENA project.\nSOSUS provides excellent real-time acoustic coverage in areas of military interest. Opportunities exist for additional cabled acoustic observatories at several sites around the global ocean, from abandoned military arrays as well as commercial telecommunications cables. Over the next decade, NOAA and its partners plan to install numerous hydrophone arrays around the global ocean as part of the NOAA Ocean Exploration Program. These arrays will include additional cabled sites, similar to Pioneer Seamount, as well as autonomous hydrophone instruments and other new technologies for deployment in ocean regions inaccessible from cabled arrays. The scope of this effort will require additional partnerships, both with other U.S. agencies and universities, as well as international participation. The final result will be an observational system able to identify oceanic phenomena at a global scale.\nTo learn more:""]"	['<urn:uuid:d7647276-eb71-4361-9304-e7186ce65c58>', '<urn:uuid:964e8873-df6a-4acd-b7ec-8513e1c68413>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	15	123	2146
26	As someone studying asteroid impacts, I've been wondering about Earth's early history - when was the last massive asteroid impact that caused all ocean water to boil and evaporate?	The last large impact that was powerful enough to cause all oceanic water to boil and evaporate is thought to have occurred around 4 billion years ago.	['Every year, tens of thousands of meteorites fall toward Earth. Most of them are very small, about the size of a stone, and end up disintegrating in the atmosphere. But occasionally, these asteroids can have slightly more worrying dimensions, even reaching a few kilometers long. When a this happens, huge blasts leave enormous craters on the Earth’s surface. The most famous example contributed to the demise of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Today, however, we are not out of danger. Indeed, a large asteroid hasrecently been detected, and it’s moving towards us…\nAsteroids or Meteorites?\nWhat’s the difference?\nAsteroids are rocky objects wandering in space, generally orbiting around a star or planet. They are too small to be spherical like planets, a shape that results from the planets’ own gravitational pull. The largest asteroids are about 900 km in diameter, and the smallest, called meteoroids, are even smaller than a stone.\nWhen asteroids cross a planet’s orbit, they are likely to collide with the planet, particularly in the case of meteoroids. You’ve probably seen one entering Earth’s orbit: it zoomsthrough the atmosphere at a high speed, and friction with the air causes it to heat up and ignite, leaving a bright and fleeting trail in the night sky. They are shooting stars.\nGenerally, friction causes them to disintegrate when entering the atmosphere, so they rarely make it to the Earth’s surface. The rocky fragments that reach the Earth’s surface without disintegrating are called meteorites.\nWhat we refer to as “shooting stars” are in truth meteoroids entering Earth’s atmosphere and catching fire. The fragments that manage to reach the Earth’s Surface are called meteorites.\nWhere Are Asteroids?\nThere’s a belt between Mars and Jupiter packed with asteroids orbiting the Sun. Most of the asteroids in the solar system are located there. There are millions of them—many measuring more than 1 km in diameter—, but the total mass of these bodies is less than 6% of the Moon’s mass. Their orbit around the Sun is stable, but some get deflected and cross through the path travelled by the planets. This asteroid belt is thought to have resulted from Jupiter’s imposing gravitational pull; during the first stages of the solar system, the pull was so powerful that it prevented these fragments from aggregating and forming another planet.\nNot all asteroids are in this belt. Others can be found orbiting other planets. These asteroids are called Trojans. Jupiter is the planet with the most Trojans, since it has the greatest gravitational pull of all the planets in the Solar System. There are also centaurs orbiting the Sun, but they are beyond the asteroid belt among thegiant planets. Last but not least, some asteroids labeled as NEO (Near Earth Objects) greatly interest us because they move close to Earth. Their orbits cross our planet’s orbit, so they are monitored closely…\nDepending on its size, composition, and path, an asteroid hitting a planet will form a crater on the planet’s surface. An object measuring a few dozen meters in diameter will produce a very powerful blast, much greater than the power of an atomic bomb.\nToday, tens of thousands of meteorites hit the Earth every year, but this is not an uncommon event. Shortly after the solar system was formed, impacts with relatively large and small asteroids were much more frequent on all the planets. The planets were under intense and relentless bombardment! The craters on the Moon’s surface bear witness to that. So, how is it that there are no craters similar to those on the Moon on the Earth’s surface? Why is it that the Earth’s surface does not resemble the Moon’s, with its distinctiveSwiss cheese look? The answer issimple: Earth experiences erosion, a phenomenon barely found on our satellite. It is a process of wear caused by the air, water, and living organisms on the planet. Together, they are capable of erasing these geological scars from the planet’s surface.\nTo have an idea, erosion over a few hundreds of millions of years could flatten the Pyrenees and transform them into a plain.\nImpacts with Earth\nDuring the first stages of Earth’s formation, intense asteroid showers were commonplace. Fortunately, the rate of impacts decreased over the years and life appeared. The last large impact—a powerful explosion which caused all oceanic water to boil and evaporate—is thought to have occurredaround 4 billionyears ago. Water on Earth has been in the liquid state since then, a necessary condition for the appearance and sustainment of life as we know it.\nImpacts, however, kept occurring. The most famous one contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs; it hit an area near present-day Mexico about 65 million years ago. The resulting explosion was much more powerful than dozens of thermonuclear bombs together, sending large amounts of dusty debris and vapor into the atmosphere, reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface over a very long time.\nThat said, this wasn’t the last impa ct to hit the Earth. Smaller asteroids regularly hit the surface, so astronomers closely scan the night sky and calculate the paths followed by the objects nearest to Earth. In fact, a relatively large asteroid coming Earth’s way was recently detected, and it is expected to be rightabove us by 2029. This is not science fiction!\nThe Moon is thought to have formed when a huge asteroid hit the Earth and the impact tore out a fragment that ended up orbiting around it.\nThe Mysterious Tunguska Incident\nAt 7:17 a.m. on June 30, 1908, a huge explosion lit up the skies of Tunguska, a forest region in central Siberia, Russia. The blast knocked down trees and burned forests over an area larger than 2,000 km2. People on horses were knocked down and glass was shattered as far as 400 km away from the blast. The conductor of the Trans-Siberian Express had to stop the train for fear of derailment. The energy from the blast has been estimated as the equivalent of 10 or 15 megatons (the Hiroshima bomb released “only” 0.015 megatons of energy). But strangely enough, no crater was formed. Today, the scientific community believes that a blast occurred shortly before the meteorite impacted the surface, approximately 8 km above it. The meteorite was about 80 meters in diameter, mostly composed of ice, and likely to have been a fragment of a comet. Since then, similar cases have been reported.\nAn Asteroid Approaches Earth\nPresently, about 4,000 objects roaming in space are treated as NEOs. When one of these bodies gets closerthan 0.05 Astronomical Units (7.5 million kilometers) to the Earth, it is classified as a PHA, a Potentially Hazardous Object. Their name is well deserved: if one of these objects hit the Earth, the consequences for our civilization would be devastating. As of today, we know of about 800 objects PHAs. One of them in particularly worrying: Apophis.\nAccording to some reliable calculations, Apophis is a large asteroid that may reach our planet around 2029. Although we know now that there won’t be a full impact, the encounter will be so close that the effects could nonetheless be disastrous. Alarm bells are starting to ring, and scientists are already undertaking measures including projects aimed at deflecting it. One such project is run by a group of Spanish investigators: the Quijote Project.\nIn truth, accurately calculating the path of an asteroid is still a daunting task. Scientists believe that Apophis may not be such a real threat, but bearing in mind that a powerful asteroid impact occurs every 40,000 years, it is not a bad idea to try to be ready for any other similar threat.\nAsteroids or Planets?\nOther rocky bodies are not large enough to be considered planets, or small enough to be labeled as asteroids. Pluto, lurking in the outer fringes of the solar system, is the most paradigmatic example. Until very recently Pluto was considered a planet, despite being smaller than the Moon. Astronomers solved this problem by naming cases such as Pluto ‘dwarf planets’. Pluto attained this status in August, 2006, together with Ceres and Eris, which used to be labeled as asteroids.\nWas Life Hitching a Ride on Meteorites?\nIs it possible that we are all aliens? That’s what panspermia, a scientific hypothesis claiming that life may have appeared on Earth transported by meteorites. Although the theory does not have many proponents, it has recently received some experimental backing. Jacek Wierzchos, a chemist at the Universitat de Lleida (Spain) has taken part in the experiment.\nA sample of lichens and microorganisms was sent into space on the Photon M3 spacecraft that was launched last September from Baikonur (Kazakhstan). Two weeks later, the spacecraft returned to Earth and the living organisms were still thriving. “If organisms are capable of surviving a trip through spapce, we can’t ignore the fact that life may have reached Earth from space,” says Wierzchos, the man who designed this experiment together with Carmen Ascaso and Asunción de los Ríos, from IRN-CSIC (Spain’s Institute of Natural Resources, Madrid), Leopoldo García Sancho, from the Universidad Complutense of Madrid, and Rosa de la Torre, from INTA (Spain’s National Institute for Aerospace Technology).\nMaybe life did not reach Earth traveling inside meteorites, but a large amount of organic matter—the type of matter that living organisms are made of—definitelyhas reached continues to reach Earth—confined inside of meteorites ever since Earth was formed.']	['<urn:uuid:b182da61-ec14-48e5-bb4a-82ecf7f5136f>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	29	27	1564
27	Which genocide center came first in Australia?	The Armenian Historical Society of Australia (AHSA) was founded in 2008, while the Jewish Holocaust Centre opened its doors in 1984, making the Jewish Holocaust Centre the earlier of the two genocide education centers in Australia.	"['""Knowledge and information can be powerful tools in the struggle for human rights, especially when secrecy, silence, and denial of atrocities - whether historic or contemporary - continue to violate the rights of people living today"" Clint Curle, Canadian Museum of Human Rights, April 2013.\nThe Armenian Genocide Education Website Australia (AGEWA) is a project of the Armenian Historical Society of Australia (AHSA).\nAGEWA is designed to assist Australian history studies teachers and their students with the tools to respectively teach and learn about a major international human rights issue - the Armenian, Greek and Assyrian Genocides.\nFounded in 2008, the AHSA is a not for profit organisation established with the objective of gathering and recording the contributions of the Armenian-Australian community, researching the mutual history of the Armenian and Australian peoples and promoting and educating the Australian public about major episodes in the history of Armenia.\nAHSA is a member of the History Council of New South Wales.\nThe Genocide of the Armenians perpetrated by the Ottoman Turkish government between 1915 and 1923 is one of the greatest crimes against humanity and civilisation. The systematic campaign of mass deportations and killings adopted by the Ottoman authorities during this period resulted in the annihilation of up to 1,500,000 innocent Armenian men, women and children, and deprived survivors of their once historic homelands and possessions. Furthermore, this event transformed a multi-cultural Ottoman society into a largely mono-ethnic Turkish nation state. According to many Holocaust scholars, the Armenian Genocide provided a blueprint for the Jewish Holocaust and other genocides in the 20th and 21st centuries. Genocide is considered to be the ultimate form of intolerance.\nLittle known, however, is the strong Australian connection to this historic event. Many Anzacs serving in the region bore witness to the Armenian Genocide with some even helping to rescue survivors. Australian newspapers reported the massacres and deportations as they occurred which aroused deep sympathy from the Australian public. This led to a massive humanitarian campaign by Australians to provide aid, food and shelter to the victims and survivors of the Armenian Genocide as they escaped violence.\nThis website provides Australian middle and senior secondary students with Australian resources to learn about this historic event, its relevance to Australia and its present day implications, within the extent of the Australian Curriculum - History.\nThe Teachers Resources page catalogues those areas in the current NSW history syllabus, as well as the Australian Curriculum - History, where there is scope for teaching the Armenian Genocide.\nSourced primarily from Australian archives, background information regarding the Armenian Genocide and related topics such as the Greek Genocide, the Assyrian Genocide, Anzac Eyewitnesses, Australia’s Response to the Armenian Genocide, Genocide Denial and Recognition and Just Resolution can be found on this website.\nThis is supplemented with video, images, maps, reading lists, student exercises and research tools to assist Australian history teachers and students make an independent historical enquiry into one of the most well documented examples of extermination in modern history.\nThe United Nations General Assembly has recognised Genocide as a fundamental human rights issue. As the historical record has demonstrated, any society is capable of committing genocide given the right circumstances. It is therefore not the intention of this website to stereotype any particular ethnic group. The AHSA hopes that through education, these acts are never again repeated.\nThe AGEWA would like to thank Dr Panayiotis Diamadis, history lecturer at the University of Technology, and Vicken Babkenian, independent researcher for the Australian Institute for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, for their assistance in providing research material for the contents of this website.', 'The Jewish Holocaust Centre is Australia’s largest institution solely dedicated to Holocaust education, research and remembrance. We exist to keep the voices of Holocaust survivors alive through education and memorialisation, to combat antisemitism, racism and prejudice.\nFounded by Holocaust survivors in 1984, we have educated more than 700,000 students and currently house more than 1,500 Survivor testimonies and approximately 20,000 artefacts.\nWe are currently rebuilding our Museum with plans to re-open in late 2022. Our education programs and events are continuing in our temporary site.\nThe Jewish Holocaust Centre is dedicated to the memory of the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators between 1933 and 1945.\nWe consider the finest memorial to all victims of racist policies to be an educational program that aims to combat antisemitism, racism and prejudice in the community and fosters understanding between peoples.\nOur museum opened its doors in 1984, when a dedicated and passionate group of people, including many Holocaust survivors, came together for a singular purpose: to educate the public about the events of the Holocaust with a view to preventing antisemitism and racism in society.\nFollowing a generous donation from the late Mina Fink in memory of her late husband, Leo Fink, an old double-storey building (a former dance school) was purchased at 13 Selwyn Street Elsternwick and subsequently turned into a space suitable for a museum and a library.\nThe centre was almost entirely run by volunteers, mostly Holocaust survivors. Many of them retrained to become educators, archivists, librarians and curators, whilst also seeking input from experts in these fields. upport came from the community of survivors and their descendants.\nFrom the time they first opened their doors, schools and visitors came in increasing numbers to learn about the Holocaust from these eyewitnesses.\nIn 1990, the museum was remodelled and the Smorgon Family Auditorium was created, doubling the size of the museum area as well as providing larger facilities for hosting educational programs and seminars.\nThe continuing support of the community enabled further extensions to the museum in 1999. The Hadassa and Szymon Rosenbaum Research Centre was opened by the then Governor-General of Australia, Sir William Deane.\nThe Jewish Holocaust Centre was granted incorporation in November 2000, with a new Board of Management, representing five community organisations, including B’nai Brith Anti-Defamation League and Kadimah Yiddish Cultural Centre.\nAround this time the organisation began professionalising, employing its first paid Executive Director, curator and educator. Gradually the centre employed paid staff more widely across the organisation. This was made possible by the establishment of a fundraising arm – the Jewish Holocaust Centre Foundation – in 2003.\nDuring this period visitation from schools increased to the level of over 20,000 per year, reaching 23,000 by 2016. After exploring options of simply expanding, a decision was made to rebuild. Thanks to the wonderful support of the community as well as the Federal and State Governments this dream is now becoming a reality, with building commencing in 2020.\nIn 2019 a large endowment enabled the establishment of the Judy and Leon Goldman Centre for Holocaust Education, as an adjunct to the museum, ensuring the ongoing sustainability of our education programs.\nOver the years, volunteers and the JHC have gained many distinguished honours, including the Westpac Museum of the Year and the Victorian State Government’s Multicultural Award. The work and achievement of individual volunteers have been recognised in Australia Day and Queen’s birthday honours. In 2010, following a remodelling of the museum, it was awarded the prestigious Small Museum, Permanent Development Award at the Museum and Gallery National Awards (MAGNA).\nThe success of the museum over so many years is a testament to the incredible efforts of the hundreds of Holocaust survivors who voluntarily gave so much time and energy to ensure their messages would be heard. Their legacy lives on in every corner of the museum.']"	['<urn:uuid:003ac89c-f822-4e96-9cda-ca35d05fea31>', '<urn:uuid:f34116c1-63f3-477c-86f7-751fbdbea9ce>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	7	36	1243
28	What are the potential risks of anesthesia in pets, and which safety measures are implemented to prevent complications?	The risk of anesthetic reactions is approximately 1 in 100,000 animals, ranging from mild swelling to severe outcomes like anaphylactic shock. To prevent complications, several safety measures are implemented: requiring pre-procedure fasting to prevent aspiration pneumonia, providing effective pain relief, using local anesthesia and epidural techniques where applicable, combining multiple anesthetic methods to minimize individual risks, and maintaining continuous monitoring through dedicated staff and equipment. Additionally, IV fluids are administered to maintain hydration and help clear anesthetic agents, while emergency equipment and drugs are kept ready for unexpected complications.	"['Q. How do vets ensure the safe use of general anaesthesia on pets?\nThere are different depths of general anaesthesia, which are dependent on the procedure type.\nFor example, the depth may be lower when the purpose is only to keep the dog still. Like during dental x-rays, scaling and polishing, ultrasound-guided biopsies, and skin disinfection for surgery.\nHowever, for more invasive procedures, such as surgery, a higher depth of anaesthesia is necessary to be able to perform the procedure safely.\nWith that said, administering anaesthesia is a dynamic process, which may change during the course of a procedure based on the circumstances.\nNonetheless, vets can often keep the depth of anaesthesia to the lowest by:\n- giving effective pain relief before and during the procedure\n- employing local anaesthesia and epidural techniques where applicable. That helps to cut pain responses to the brain from the procedure location\n- employing more than one method of maintaining general anaesthesia at the same time. For example, gas and injectable anaesthetics help to minimise the overall risks related to each anaesthetic agent\nBesides employing the appropriate type, quantity, and combination of anaesthetic options, the most important aspect of maintaining anaesthetic safety is thorough monitoring of your dog’s anaesthetic depth and vital signs both during and after the period that she is under anaesthesia.\nThe vet team achieves this with a:\n- variety of equipment to measure your dog’s vital signs, such as heart rate, ECG, blood pressure, oxygen in the blood, and carbon dioxide in the breath\n- dedicated trained veterinary professional who is not a part of the main procedure. Their role is to measure and monitor vital signs and adjust the depth of anaesthesia along the way appropriately\nWhile this level of intensive monitoring will add to the cost of the procedure, it is essential in order to ensure the safety of your dog.\nQuestions on general anaesthesia to ask the vet:\n1. Will my pet receive a pre-anaesthetic blood test, physical examination, and health evaluation before the procedure?\n2. What kind of anaesthetic monitoring equipment would you use on my pet? For example:\n- Pulse oximetry (measures oxygen in the blood)\n- Capnography (measures carbon dioxide in the breath)\n- Blood pressure and method of measurement (a doppler machine is ideal for cats and small dogs)\n- Body temperature\n- Heart rate and ECG\n- Respiratory rate\n3. Is there a dedicated and trained anaesthetist who will be monitoring my pet’s anaesthesia and vital signs throughout the procedure? They should otherwise not be a part of the procedure itself\n4. Will you place an intravenous catheter during the procedure (for access to the vein in an emergency, as well as for other injections and drip administration if indicated)?\n5. Will I get to talk to the anaesthetist-in-charge before the procedure to discuss anaesthetic risks and the concerns I may have?\n6. Is there a range of sedation or anaesthesia drugs available for pets with different chronic health conditions? Different drugs may have different side effects and thus may have different safety profiles for various health conditions\n7. What kind of emergency equipment, drugs, and training of the vet team are available in the rare event of an unexpected but severe anaesthetic complication?', ""As is the case for us, our four-legged friends may require anesthesia as part of a surgery or procedure. Puppies receive anesthesia when they are spayed or neutered, and most pets receive anesthesia at least once more during their lifetimes.\nGeneral anesthesia is achieved by administering drugs that suppress your dog’s nerve response. During general anesthesia, your dog is in an unconscious state, so she is unable to move and doesn’t feel any pain. Anesthesia can also be administered locally, to numb a specific area or part of the body—such as a tooth, area of the skin, or the spinal column.\nHow risky is anesthesia for your dog?\nThere are always risks when any anesthetic agent is administered to a patient, regardless of the length of time the patient is anesthetized. In fact, it is estimated that approximately 1 in 100,000 animals will have some sort of reaction to an anesthetic agent.* Reactions can range from mild to severe and include a wide variety of symptoms, such as swelling at the injection site to more serious outcomes such as anaphylactic shock or death. While these statistics seem alarming, your dog is just as much at risk getting into the car to go to the veterinary hospital for the anesthetic event. The good news is there are many things you can do to reduce your dog’s risk!\nFasting for several hours prior to anesthesia, as directed by your veterinarian, is important to reduce your dog’s risk. If your dog has not fasted prior to anesthesia, she could vomit and possibly aspirate food or fluid into her lungs, even with intubation (tube to keep the airway open). This could potentially result in a condition called aspiration pneumonia, which can be life-threatening.\nHow to minimize the risks of anesthesia on your dog\nMake sure your veterinarian knows your dog’s complete history before the anesthetic event. Her vaccine history, lifestyle, and any medications she takes all influence how she may respond to anesthesia. Your veterinarian may recommend a presurgical examination and diagnostic tests that help identify any underlying conditions that should be addressed before your dog undergoes anesthesia.\nRecommended diagnostic tests usually include:\n- Chemistry tests to evaluate kidney, liver, and pancreatic function, as well as sugar levels\n- A complete blood count (CBC) to rule out blood-related conditions\n- Electrolyte tests to ensure your dog isn’t dehydrated or suffering from an electrolyte imbalance\nAdditional tests may be added on an individual basis. Your veterinarian will recommend the right thing for your best friend.\nIn addition to blood tests, your veterinarian may recommend the following:\n- The placement of an intravenous (IV) catheter as part of the anesthetic preparation. The catheter can be used to provide anesthetics and intravenous fluids to keep your pet hydrated; additionally, if needed, it would serve as a pathway to directly administer life-saving medications, should a crisis arise.\n- Intravenous fluids to help maintain hydration and blood pressure. IV fluids also help your pet with her recovery process by aiding the liver and kidneys in clearing the body of anesthetic agents more quickly.\nWhat to expect on the day of the anesthetic/surgical event\nYour veterinarian and/or veterinary staff will answer any questions you may have before your dog receives anesthesia. They may ask you to review and sign a consent form that describes all of their recommended services prior to the anesthetic event and during the procedure. It is very important to review the forms and have all your questions answered.\nHow your dog is monitored during anesthesia\nSeveral safeguards are put into place to help reduce your dog’s risk during anesthesia.\n- The surgical assistant/veterinary technician: A technician or assistant is present during the anesthetic event to monitor your dog’s vital signs and to help adjust anesthetic levels, under the direction of the veterinarian.\n- A heart rate monitor counts your pet’s heartbeats per minute. Anesthesia and other factors, such as surgery itself, can affect heart rate. By monitoring your dog’s heart rate, your veterinarian can make anesthetic adjustments quickly.\n- An electrocardiogram (ECG) monitors your dog’s heart rate and heartbeat pattern. It can detect abnormal heartbeats called arrhythmias. If an arrhythmia is detected, your veterinarian can make suitable changes in anesthesia.\n- Core body temperature may be monitored, especially if your dog is undergoing a prolonged surgical procedure. Changes in body temperature can cause dangerous complications.\n- A blood pressure monitor measures your dog’s blood pressure. When used in conjunction with other monitoring equipment, it provides detailed information on your pet’s cardiovascular condition.\n- Pulse oximetry may be used to monitor the amount of oxygen in your dog's blood and her pulse rate.\n- Carbon dioxide( C02) is often monitored together with oxygen, as it helps determine if your pet is receiving the right amount of oxygen during anesthesia.\nHow soon after anesthesia will your dog be back to normal?\nRecent improvements in anesthetic agents allow for a quick recovery, and your dog should almost be back to normal when you pick her up after the anesthetic event. She may seem more tired than normal when she goes home. This has as much to do with the stress of her visit to the veterinary hospital as to the anesthetic itself!\nMake sure you follow all go-home instructions for your dog, including feeding instructions.\n*This information came from material written by Ernest Ward, DVM.\n© Copyright 2009 Lifelearn Inc.

29	kidney scarring symptoms treatment outcomes	FSGS causes nephrotic syndrome with proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. The main treatment starts with steroids, though many cases are steroid-resistant and require immunosuppressive medicines. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are used to reduce protein loss. The long-term outlook is concerning - after 10 years of follow-up, 25% of patients require kidney transplantation due to irreversible kidney failure, with risk of disease recurrence in the transplanted kidney.	"['Causes proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome with or without renal insufficiency.\nProteinuria occurs due to the dysfunction of the glomerular filtration barrier.\nThe glomerular filtration barrier is tripartite with a fenestrated endothelium, glomerular basement membrane, and podocytes, the latter are epithelial cells with interdigitated foot processes interconnected by multi-protein slit diaphragms (Manchuca E et al).\nHistologic pattern of injury that characterizes broad spectrum of diseases with different underlying pathophysiologies.\nAccounts for approximately 20% of cases of nephrotic syndrome in children and 40% of such cases in adults.\nMajority of cases are secondary, not primary.\nAnd estimated incidence of 7 per million (Kititakara C et al).\nIncidence increasing in adults for past few decades.\nThe most common problem of glomerular disorder resulting in end-stage renal disease in the US.\nPrevalence of 4%.\nDiagnosis confirmed by histopathologic testing.\nCardinal abnormality glomerular scarring.\nFocal refers to involvement of a subgroup of glomeruli and segmental refers to involvement of a portion of the glomerular tuft.\nPrimary injury is to the podocytes, with proliferation of mesangial, endothelial and epithelial cells in early stages.\nPrimary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis presumed to be a circulating permeability factor diffusely toxic to podocytes.\nMutations in podocyte genes are associated with genetic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.\nGenetic forms are usually resistant to steroid therapy and often progress to end-stage renal disease.\nFamilial forms are associated with mutations in genes that encode podocyte proteins.\nMYO1E mutations are associated with childhood onset, corticosteroid resistant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (Mele C et al).\nEarly disease is focal with involvement of a minority of glomeruli, and segmental with involvement affecting a portion of the glomerular globe.\nAs the disease progresses more widespread and globular glomerulosclerosis develops.\nIn later stages there is shrinkage and or collapse of the glomerular capillaries and eventually sclerosis.\nProposed mechanisms for the process include: viral, toxins and high intraglomerular capillary pressure.\nUsually starts in the deeper juxtamedullary glomeruli and extends to the superficial nephrons.\nCharacteristic lesion: segmental solidification of the glomerular tuft in the perihilar region and sometimes in the peripheral areas.\nEventually global glomerulosclerosis develops.\nDiffuse foot process fusion occurs mainly in the sclerotic segments. In\nDefining feature is proteinuria, which is typically associated with hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia and peripheral edema.\nNephrotic syndrome in children is defined as proteinuria of greater than 1 g of urine protein per square meter of body surface area per day, albumin level of less than 2.5 g, cholesterol total of greater than 200 mg/dL and edema.\nNephrotic syndrome in adults defined is a urine protein level of more than 3.5 g per day, albumin level less than 3.5 g/dL.\nApproximately 75-90% of children and 50-60% of adults have associated nephrotic syndrome at presentation of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.\nThere are many subsets of disease including a cellular variant, a collapsing variant, and tip lesions.\nClassification includes primary (idiopathic ) and secondary forms.\nMay be a primary process, or a secondary process associated with drugs, viral infections, and diseases that affect the renal mass and glomerular hemodynamics (Barisoni L et al).\nPrimary forms include: focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, progression from minimal change disease, progression from immunoglobulin M nephropathy, progression from mesangial proliferate glomerulonephritis, superimposed on other primary glomerulonephritis conditions and variant of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.\nSecondary forms include: familial, virus associated, drug-induced and adaptive.\nSecondary FSGS is a response to reduction in the number of functioning nephrons from or am abnormal stress on initially normal nephrons.\nApproximately 80% of cases are primary and idiopathic.\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis and the related disorder minimal change disease are podocyte diseases.\nPodocyte foot process injuries correlate with nephrotic proteinuria.\nAlterations in podocyte shape causes rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, a process which is a reversible with glucocorticoids therapy in minimal change disease but it is lrreversible and progressive in focal segmental glomerulonephritis.\nPrimary FSGS may respond to immunosuppressive treatment.\nSecondary FSGS treatment is centered around unloading the pressure on glomeruli using renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibition.', ""This information from Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) is about Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). FSGS is not one but many different diseases.\nHow does the urinary system work?\nThe urinary system consists of the kidneys, ureters, the bladder and urethra. The kidneys filter the blood to remove waste products and produce urine. The urine flows from the kidneys down through the ureters to the bladder, where it is stored until we go to the toilet. It passes through another tube called the urethra to the outside when urinating (peeing).\nThe kidneys contain millions of tiny filtering units called glomeruli. As blood passes through the tubes in the glomerulus, waste products pass through the walls of the tubes to form urine. Blood cells and other things such as protein cannot pass through the walls because they are too big.\nWhen someone has focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), some of the glomeruli are damaged and become scarred. This stops them working properly, so that protein can pass through the walls of the glomerulus and into the urine. This means that the child develops nephrotic syndrome.\nWhat are the symptoms of FSGS?\nThe main symptom of FSGS is the development of nephrotic syndrome, that is, swelling due to increased fluid in the body. Nephrotic syndrome occurs because the kidneys leak protein. This results in low protein levels in the blood, which means that fluid is shifted out of vessels into tissues. This causes puffiness, particularly around the eyes, abdomen, feet and legs, and weight gain. The medical word for this puffiness is oedema. As the kidney leaks protein, the urine’s appearance changes so that it appears foamy, which is a sign of proteinuria.\nHow is FSGS diagnosed?\nThe doctor will ask lots of questions about how the child became ill and examine them. Various tests will be needed to confirm or rule out FSGS:\n- Urine tests to see how much protein is present in the urine.\n- Blood tests to check general health, and possibly genetic tests, which we will discuss with the family.\n- Kidney biopsy to see if any areas contain scarring.\nOther tests may also be needed if the results of these tests are not completely clear.\nWhat causes FSGS?\nThere are many different kinds of FSGS. Some are caused by inherited diseases and can thus affect several members of the family. In other cases the cause is unknown and it might be caused by an autoimmune reaction, where the body starts to attack itself after mistakenly recognising itself as the ‘enemy’.\nHow common is FSGS?\nWe do not yet know exactly how many children each year are affected by FSGS but at GOSH, we have looked after at least 66 children with this condition over the last 15 years.\nReports vary but it would seem that between seven and 10 per cent of kidney biopsies to investigate proteinuria lead to a diagnosis of FSGS. It seems to be more common in certain racial groups but again we do not yet know why.\nHow is FSGS treated?\nNormally the first sign of FSGS is nephrotic syndrome, where protein is continuously lost in the urine. The child will start with the standard treatment for nephrotic syndrome, which is steroid medicine.\nMany cases of FSGS do not respond to steroids, so are called 'steroid resistant'. In those cases, we try immunosuppressive medicines that damp down the immune system. Unfortunately a large proportion of FSGS does not respond to this kind of medicines.\nWhether the child is taking steroids or immunosuppressive medicines, families may need to postpone some of their child’s immunisations while taking the medicines. It should also be reported to the family doctor (GP) if a child comes into contact with chicken pox unless he or she has already had it. Other precautions are included in our medicines information sheets.\nWe also use a group of medicines called ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors and ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers) to reduce the protein loss and blood pressure. Diuretics (water tablets) are also prescribed to reduce the puffiness.\nIt is important that the amount of protein lost in the child’s urine is monitored closely. We may ask families to do these measurements every day at home, using a dipstick. We would explain how to do this. These measurements will need to be recorded alongside details of the child’s steroid dose and any other medicines for each day, which should be brought to each clinic appointment, as they are a good indicator of how treatment is working.\nDiet also plays a part in treating FSGS. We may suggest reducing the amount of salt used at home. Our dietitian will explain exactly what needs to be done and will be available for advice afterwards.\nWhat is the outlook for children with FSGS?\nFSGS is a chronic condition. An infant's health may improve for a while, but many children do not respond very well to the treatment. In others who respond the symptoms might come back. If this happens, he or she will have to start taking the steroid or immunosuppressive medicines again.\nOver time, more areas of the glomeruli become scarred, which affects the child’s overall kidney function. FSGS may eventually progress to irreversible kidney failure, although this could take many years.\nIn our experience of caring for children with FSGS at GOSH, three in 100 children died and a quarter of patients had irreversible kidney failure requiring kidney transplantation having been followed up for 10 years.\nOnce a child’s kidney function has dropped to a level where it is affecting his or her daily life, we would discuss dialysis and transplantation. This is called renal replacement therapy (RRT) and aims to keep children well until a transplant is possible. There is unfortunately a risk that the disease will come back in the transplanted kidney.\nOur patients provide us with a range of extraordinary stories.

30	Could you explain how both ancient plate movements beneath Earth's surface and the atmosphere work together to influence our planet's climate?	The interaction between plate movements and atmosphere influences Earth's climate in several ways. Underground, the movement and subduction of tectonic plates affects volcanic activity and CO2 emissions, which impacts atmospheric composition. In the atmosphere, gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor create a greenhouse effect that maintains Earth's average temperature at about 60°F (16°C). The distribution of continents and mountain ranges, created by plate tectonics, affects wind patterns and ocean currents. For example, the Himalayan mountains, formed by plate collision 40 million years ago, influence monsoon seasons and the El Niño Southern Oscillation, demonstrating how both geological and atmospheric processes work together to shape global climate.	"['Where do old plates go to die? For the most part, down subduction zones to mix with their original source, the mantle. Earth-Pages has covered evidence for quite a few of the dead plates, which emerges from a geophysical technique known as seismic tomography – analogous to X-ray or magnetic resonance scans of the whole human body. For 20 years geophysicists have been analysing seismograms from many stations across the globe for every digitally recorded earthquake, i.e. virtually all of those since the 1970s. This form of depth sounding goes far beyond early deep-Earth seismometry that discovered the inner and outer core, various transition zones in the mantle and measured the average variation with depth of mantle properties. Tomography relies on complex models of the paths taken by seismic body waves and very powerful computing to assess variations in the speed of P- and S-waves as they travelled through the Earth: the more rigid/cool the mantle is the faster waves travel through it and vice versa. The result is images of deep structure in 2-D slices, but the quality of such sections depends, ironically, on plate tectonics. Most earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. Such linearly distributed, one-dimensional sources inevitably leave the bulk of the mantle as a blur. Around 20 different methodologies have been developed by the many teams working on seismic tomography. So sometimes conflicting images of the deep Earth have been produced.\nThe technique has come of age now that superfast computing and use of multiple models have begun to resolve some of tomography’s early problems. The latest outcome is astonishing: ‘The Atlas of the Underworld’ catalogues 94 2-D sections from surface to the core-mantle boundary each of which spans 40° or arc – about a ninth of the Earth’s circumference (see: van der Meer, D.G., van Hinsbergen, D.J.J., and Spakman, W., 2017, Atlas of the Underworld: slab remnants in the mantle, their sinking history, and a new outlook on lower mantle viscosity, Tectonophysics online; doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2017.10.004). Specifically, the Atlas locates remnants of relatively cold slabs in the mantle that are suspected to be remnants of former subduction zones, or those that connect to active subduction. The upper parts of active slabs are revealed by the earthquakes generate along them. At deeper levels they are too ductile to have seismicity, so what form they take has long been a mystery. Once subduction stops, so do the telltale earthquakes and the slabs ‘disappear’.\nThe slabs covered by the ‘Atlas’ only go back as far as the end of the Permian, when the current round of plate tectonics began as Pangaea started to break-up. It takes 250 Ma for slabs to reach the base of the mantle and beyond that time they will have heated up and begun to be mixed into the lower mantle and invisible. Nevertheless, the rich resource allows models of vanished Mesozoic to Recent plates and the tectonics in which they participated, based on geological information, to be evaluated and enriched. Just as important, the project opens up the possibility of finding out how the mantle ‘worked’ since Pangaea broke up, in 3-D; a key to more than plate tectonics, including the mantle’s chemical heterogeneity. Already it has been used to estimate changes in the total length of subduction zones since 250 Ma ago, and thus arc volcanism and CO2 emissions, which correlates with estimates of past atmospheric CO2 levels, climate and even sea levels.\nSee also: Voosen, P. 2016. ‘Atlas of the Underworld’ reveals oceans and mountains lost to Earth’s history. Science; doi:10.1126/science.aal0411.\nLee, H. 2017. The Earth’s interior is teeming with dead plates. Ars Technica UK, 18 October 2017.', 'Global Climate Patterns, Global Climate Change\nThe long-term distribution of heat and precipitation on Earth\'s surface is called global climate. Heat from the sun keeps the Earth\'s average temperature at about 60°F(16°C), within a range that allows for biological life and maintains the planet\'s life-sustaining reservoirs of liquid water. Astronomical variations and atmospheric shielding cause incoming solar radiation to fall unevenly on the Earth\'s surface. Ocean currents and winds further redistribute heat and moisture around the globe, creating climate zones. Climate zones have characteristic annual precipitation, temperature, wind, and ocean current patterns that together determine local, short-term weather, and affect development of ecologically adapted suites of plants and animals. Changes in the astronomical, oceanographic, atmospheric, and geological factors that determine global climate can lead to global climate change over time. The term climate is reserved for regional patterns of temperature and precipitation that persist for decades and centuries. Local atmospheric, oceanic, and temperature phenomena like storms and droughts that occur over hours, days, or seasons, is generally referred to as weather.\nAstronomical factors affecting global climate change\nEnergy from the sun drives the Earth\'s climate. Changes that affect the amount of solar radiation reaching the planet, called insolation, and that alter the distribution of sunlight on its surface, can cause global climate change. Each minute, the Earth\'s outer atmosphere receives about two calories of energy per square centimeter of area, a value known as the solar constant. In spite of its name, the solar constant varies over time. Astronomers have, for example, observed a correlation between the solar constant and changes in the pattern of sunspots, or solar storms, on the Sun\'s surface.\nThe Earth\'s position with respect to the Sun over time affects its climate. During its annual circuit around the sun, the Earth\'s present elliptical orbit brings it closest to the sun in January (perihelion), and carries it farthest away in July (aphelion). The planet receives about 6% more solar energy in January than in July. The Earth\'s axis, a line through the poles, is tilted 23.4° with respect to the sun. Consequently, the Sun\'s rays strike the northern hemisphere most directly on June 21st, the summer solstice, and the southern hemisphere most directly in December 21st, the winter solstice. The equinoxes, on April 21st and September 21st, mark the dates when the Sun shines directly on the equator, and day and night are the same length around the globe. Orbital geometry and axial tilt together determine the Earth\'s pattern of seasons. Variations in this astronomical geometry would cause climatic variations.\nIn the 1920\'s, the Serbian astronomer, Milutin Milankovitch, proposed an astronomical explanation for long-term, cyclical global climate changes that caused the Pleistocene ""ice ages"". By observing variations in the Earth\'s orbital geometry and axial tilt, and calculating the time for a complete cycle of change to occur, Milankovitch predicted a pattern of varying insolation and global climate change. According to his theory, three socalled Milankovitch cycles—precession, obliquity, and eccentricity—repeat approximately every 21, 41, and 100 thousand years, respectively. The 21,000-year precession cycle occurs because the direction of the Earth\'s spin axis changes over time, much in the way a spinning top wobbles. This phenomenon, called the precession of the equinoxes, causes a particular season, northern hemisphere summer for example, to occur at different places along the Earth\'s orbital path, and hence, at a different time of year. During the 41,000-year obliquity cycle, the tilt angle of the Earth\'s axis changes, altering the intensity of the seasons. Changes in the shape, or eccentricity, of the Earth\'s orbit cause the 100,000-year Milankovitch cycle. The Earth\'s present orbit is almost circular, so the difference in insolation between aphelion and perihelion is fairly minor. When the orbit becomes more elliptical, the Earth receives more radiation at the perihelion, and less at the aphelion. The eccentricity cycle also modulates the precession and obliquity cycles; the most intense northern hemisphere summer, for example, would occur when the June solstice coincided with the perihelion of an eccentric elliptical orbit, and the axial tilt was at its highest.\nGeological data from the most recent portion of the Earth\'s history seem to support Milankovitch theory. The pattern of insolation variations that Milankovitch predicted generally matches the pattern of polar ice sheet advance and retreat since about two million years ago. Observations of northern hemisphere glacial features, deep sea cores that record the amount of water stored in glacial ice, and sea-level records all corroborate the timing of global cooling and warming predicted by Milankovitch theory. The correlations are more difficult to prove farther back in geologic history.\nGeological factors affecting global climate\nGeological changes on the Earth\'s surface can also affect global climate. The distribution of continental landmasses and ocean basins affects the pattern of global atmospheric and oceanographic circulation, and the shape, or topography, of the Earth\'s surface directs winds and ocean currents. According to the widely accepted, and well-supported theory of plate tectonics, the continents move, ocean basins open and close, and mountain ranges form over time. The continents have assumed new configurations on the Earth\'s surface throughout geologic history, and geologists know, from examination of fossil environments and organisms, that the movement of landmasses had significant climatic effects. For example, during the Cretaceous Period, about 100 million years ago, continents covered the poles, and a warm ocean called Teethes circled the equator. An intense period of volcanic activity added insulating gasses to the atmosphere. The Cretaceous was the warmest and wettest period in Earth history. There is no evidence of Cretaceous polar ice caps, shallow seas covered many continental interiors, and tropical plants and animals lived on all the continents. The collision of the Indian subcontinent with Asia, and formation of the Himalayan mountain range about 40 million years ago is another example of a plate tectonic event that caused significant climate change. The Himalayas obstruct equatorial winds and ocean currents, and contribute to major climatic phenomena, namely the monsoon seasons of southern Asia and the Indian Ocean, and the El Niño Southern Oscillation in the Pacific Ocean.\nChanges in atmospheric composition and anthropogenic global warming\nThe Earth\'s climate is strongly affected by the way solar radiation is reflected, absorbed, and transmitted by the atmosphere. Presently, about 30% of the incoming solar energy reflects back into space, the atmosphere absorbs about 20%, and the remaining 50% reaches the Earth\'s surface. The major gaseous components of Earth\'s atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and carbon dioxide. Other components include relatively small amounts of neon, helium, methane, krypton, hydrogen, xenon and ozone gases, water vapor, and particulate matter. Except for relatively uncommon natural events, such as volcanic eruptions, the composition of the atmosphere stays constant over long periods of time.\nThe structure and composition of the atmosphere function to maintain the Earth\'s surface temperature within the phase boundaries of liquid water, and to protect organisms from damaging ultraviolet radiation. Gases, like ozone, in the outer atmosphere reflect or absorb much of the incoming short-wavelength solar radiation. Much of the sunlight that reaches the Earth\'s surface is re-radiated into the atmosphere as longer-wave-length infrared energy, or heat. Gases in the middle and lower atmosphere, namely carbon dioxide and water vapor, absorb this infrared radiation, and the temperature of the atmosphere increases, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. This heat, trapped in the atmosphere, drives atmospheric and oceanographic circulation, keeps the oceans liquid, and maintains global climate zones. The greenhouse effect makes the Earth livable for biological organisms, including humans.\nIn the last century, humans have burned large quantities of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas to operate factories, generate electricity, and run automobile engines. Because carbon dioxide is always produced during the combustion of a carbon-based fuel, these activities have significantly increased the concentration of that greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Many scientists now believe that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide will enhance the greenhouse effect, and lead to global warming. If global warming should occur, a number of terrestrial changes could follow. Some simulations predict melting of the polar ice caps, increasing volume of water in the oceans, and inundation of coastal cities. Models also show changes in ocean currents and wind patterns and redistribution of the Earth\'s major climate zones. Such events would have severe consequences for human agriculture, fishing, and civil planning, as well as for the natural environment. The complexity of the inter-related systems that create global climate, however, makes predicting the climatic effect of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide extremely difficult. The issue of anthropogenic global climate change remains a subject of heated debate among scientists and policy makers.\nSee also Atmospheric circulation.\nAhrens, C. Donald.

31	What medical imaging is used to diagnose sports-related hip injuries?	For hip pointer injuries, doctors may order X-rays or an MRI scan to check for bone fractures or damage to surrounding tissue. They might also order an MRI or a computerized tomography (CT) scan to check for any damage to internal organs.	"[""Lisa finally got the chance to start for the varsity volleyball team, and she really wanted to impress the coach. But on one play she got overeager and collided with a teammate while going for a spike. She landed flat on her side on the hard gym floor. Lisa felt a sharp, strong pain in her hip and had to be helped off the floor.\nAfter being taken out of the game, Lisa iced her hip and took some acetaminophen. But the next day her hip still hurt and was swollen and bruised. Her mother took her to see the doctor. It turned out Lisa had a hip pointer, a bruise to one of the bones of her hip.\nYour hip joint involves two bones. Your hipbone is called the iliac (pronounced: ILL-ee-ack) crest and the top of your leg bone (femur) is called the greater trochanter (pronounced: troe-KAN-tuhr). A hip pointer is a bruise to one of these bones or to the surrounding soft tissue (muscles, cartilage, tendons, etc.).\nIn rare cases, a hip pointer can also cause what's known as an avulsion fracture, where part of the bone is pulled away by the attached muscle.\nSince the bones in your hips don't have a lot of muscle and fat for padding, they're more susceptible to bone bruises. Bone bruises can be painful and take a while to fully heal.\nHip pointers are caused by a sudden impact that's hard enough to bruise your iliac crest or greater trochanter or cause damage to the soft tissue of your hip.\nSome of the more common causes of hip pointers include:\nAs with most sports injuries, how painful a hip pointer is or how long it takes to heal depends on the severity of the injury. Most hip pointers will be only a minor inconvenience and can be hard to see. But if you have a serious hip pointer, you'll know it.\nLook for these symptoms:\nIf you see a doctor about a hip pointer injury, he or she will examine the area for swelling and bruising. That might include pressing on your hip to see how tender the area is. The doctor will ask questions about how the injury happened.\nIn some cases, the doctor may call for X-rays or an MRI scan to see if there is a bone fracture or damage to the surrounding tissue. A doctor might also order an MRI or a computerized tomography (CT) scan to rule out any damage to internal organs.\nDoctors don't need to do a lot for most hip pointers. Your doctor will most likely recommend crutches. He or she may also prescribe medication to ease the pain.\nSome of the things you can do at home to treat a hip pointer include:\nSevere hip pointers can result in a hematoma or fracture, or in damage to internal organs like the spleen. These types of more serious hip pointer injuries might require a doctor's help. If you have a hematoma and get fluid buildup in your hip, a doctor may need to drain it.\nSurgery for hip pointers is rare. Most can be easily treated and heal in their own time. But if a hip pointer doesn't respond to other treatments (or if a CT scan or MRI reveals internal damage), surgery may be necessary to correct the condition.\nIt can be hard to prevent a hip pointer. They happen suddenly and can be difficult to see coming. Still, you can help reduce your chances of getting one by following a few simple guidelines when you play sports or exercise:\nConditioning exercises that strengthen specific areas of the body are good ways to protect yourself from hip pointers.

32	what evidence shows bed rest duration affects MI outcomes	Based on systematic reviews, there is no evidence that bed rest duration has any significant link with cardiac death, reinfarction, or arrhythmias in uncomplicated myocardial infarction patients. Studies showed no association between bed rest duration and all-cause death (RR 0.85, 95%CI 0.68 to 1.07) or cardiac death (RR 0.81, 95%CI 0.54 to 1.19). The incidence of reinfarction also showed no association with bed rest duration (RR 1.07, 95%CI 0.79 to 1.44). While thromboembolic complication rates were lower with shorter bed rest, this difference was not statistically significant.	['Any opinions, findings, conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of NursingAnswers.net.\nEvidence-based in nursing is the practical, clinical application of the best research in patient care. Nursing Knowledge International translates the best evidence into the best nursing research, education, administration, policy and practice. Nursing Knowledge is committed to providing a comprehensive synthesis of the best nursing evidence, proven nursing expertise and practical clinical application that take into account individual patient, family and community values decision making, in order to provide the most consistent and best possible care to patients. Health care delivered in ignorance of available research evidence, misses important opportunities to benefit patients and may cause significant harm.\nWe are a group of four BSN-RN students, we assigned in this project to evaluate the nursing practice in clinical area if it evidence based or not and to identify the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of EPB into practice using different strategies to overcome the barriers.\nBed rest is recommended to patients with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) upon initial hospitalization. Reasons for immobilization have included reduction in myocardial load, evidence of further malperfusion, and moderation of remodeling process. In last two decade, the influence of bed rest on patient outcomes following AMI has not been thoroughly investigated. In this project we investigate the practice of this issue in cardiac care unit at Salmaniya medical complex and compare it with the evidence based practice by review literatures, meta-analysis and clinical trials. We conclude to the final result and raise our recommendations. (Jacqueline K, 2004).\nReason for choosing the topic:\nFrom our experience as cardiac staff nurses we had faced a lot of difficulties to convince a patient with uncomplicated MI to be in complete bed rest especially after 12 hrs post hospitalization. [“Patients with uncomplicated MI: patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction who are free of recurrent ischemic discomfort, symptoms of heart failure, or serious disturbances of heart rhythm.”(American Heart Association, 2004). As their chest pain has been relieved, they will try to convince themselves and others that they are in a good health, and can achieve their activities of daily living. Therefore, it is difficult to obligate them to be in complete bed rest. Usually the nurse will face a dilemma whether to mobilize the patient with uncomplicated MI or not as there is no clear protocol for the mobilization. In addition, if the nurse decides to mobilize the patient she/he will be in trouble, questionable, and accountable for any risk that might be happened for the patient. On the other hands, if the nurse doesn’t mobilize the patient, the patient won’t be satisfied and his psychological demands won’t be met. Moreover, the cardiac nurses are aware about the significant impact of the psychological status of the MI patient on the heart workload, health, and efficiency. If the patient hasn’t been satisfied, he would be anxious, nervous, and agitated which in turn will stimulate the sympathetic nervous system to release adrenalin and nor-adrenalin hormones that’s lead to increase the heart rate, and vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction will increase the venous return which means the increase of the pre load of the heart. In addition, the peripheral resistance will increase as a result of the vasoconstriction and that causes the increase of the after load of the heart. Both, increase of the preload and after load are dangerous as it will expose the MI patient for re-infarction, heart failure, and lethal arrhythmias.\nAlso, we have known that Mohammed Bin Khalifa cardiac center is mobilizing the patient with uncomplicated MI after 24hrs. As we aimed to try our best to standardize our care according to the accredited agencies, we have decided to find an evidence base about the mobilization of the patient with uncomplicated MI, and to apply it in our unit.\nTitle of our Topic:\nDuration of Bed Rest for Uncomplicated Myocardial Infarction\nIs prolong bed rest safer than early mobilization for uncomplicated MI patient?\nPopulation: Uncomplicated MI patients.\n*To keep a patient with uncomplicated MI at bed rest for more than 48hrs.\n* To keep a patient with uncomplicated MI at bed rest for 12-24hrs\n3. Comparison: comparing whether early mobilization of a patient with uncomplicated MI is safe as a mobilization after prolong bed rest.\n4. Outcomes: Early mobilization (2-12 days) doesn’t harm the patient and doesn’t contribute with developing of any complication such as death, re-infarction, and arrhythmias. It is considered to be safe as prolonged bed rest.\nThe used guidelines for mobilization of pts after an acute MI in SMC was stated in the management of acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) included in ” Evidence- Based Guideline for Management of Cardiac Cases in Secondary Case Settings in the kingdom of Bahrain” Which was developed by Dr. Anwer Jamsheer, Dr. Rashid Al Bannai and Dr. Tayseer Garadah (Consultants Cardiology) and was supervised and final reviewed by Dr. Abdul Hai Al awadi (Assistant Undersecretary for Hospitals).\nIt was mentioned in the above guidelines that “The patient is kept in bed rest until otherwise ordered by the physician” and the nurse should ask on daily bases about the allowed activity privileges for the pts (bed rest, bedside commode, sit out of the bed, walk around the bed, toilet bed side in the first two days and lastly the full mobilizing). It was suggested also that it is the responsibility of the nurse to ensure range of motion exercises (ROM), deep breathing and positioning while the patient is in the bed rest. Moreover, it was declared to explain to the patient the needed rest and to teach him the allowed exercises and help him, if needed. However, it was not mentioned who should do that. Guidelines explained in the “cardiac rehabilitation for patient with STEMI (phase I -in patient care)” the full carried out protocol for the mobilization of pt after an acute MI. This includes:\nFull bed restrictions in the first 2 days, including bed side wash, shaving and bed pan.\nPassive form of mobility for arms and foot ruling can be given at frequency of three times per day.\nIn uncomplicated cases the transfer to step down can be arranged on day three. With the mobilization around the bed and allow free toilet access under supervision.\nOn day four and five patient can walk in the corridor and allowed to go one flight or go for symptom limited exercise test.\nIt was noted that the source of information for these guidelines is the last literature review up to date / version 16.1: ACC and AHA, GHA pocket Guidelines and ECS2007, but actually there was no effective date rather than revision date mentioned.\nThis protocol was followed in most of cases but there were some exceptions. Extended bed rest was advised for pts who are unstable or had some complications after MI like lethal arrhythmias, heart failure or recurrent ischemia etc. Such cases were not mentioned specifically in the guidelines although it was mentioned in the original source of information after we have reviewed it.\nThe 1996 ACC/AHA Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Acute MI has found evidence on the continued practice of “coronary precautions” although it was advocated since 1960s that some of theses precautions are no longer applicable in the current practice. In the earlier years patients with STEMI were kept in bed rest for several weeks in order to decrease myocardial oxygen demand but then it was reveled that extended bed rest is more harm than good and it would delay the recovery. 2004 ACC/AHA Guidelines recommended that “Patients with STEMI who are free of recurrent ischemic discomfort, symptoms of heart failure, or serious disturbances of heart rhythm should not be on bed rest for more than 12 to 24 hours” In addition, it is mentioned that patients with hemodynamic instability or continued ischemia to have bedside commode privileges. Both practices are not seen in SMC as Pt with STEMI who described as stable will be in bed rest for 48 hours while unstable pt (complicated MI: patients who have recurrent ischemic discomfort, symptoms of heart failure, or serious rhythm disturbances) will be in bed rest for several days up to one week.\nWhile searching for relevant data and protocol that could answer our PICO question and prove which is the safest and more beneficial for patient post uncomplicated myocardial infarction ,mobilization after 48 hours or less, we interviewed the experts in our institution (Salmaniya Medical Complex – SMC) who are consultant cardiologist in Coronary Care Unit(CCU) ,while interviewing Dr. Hayat Al-Mahroos, she stated that there is no clear protocol is being followed and mobilization depend on the patient condition, how ever the followed and common protocol is 48 hours post uncomplicated myocardial infarction which is not being reviewed long time back, although recent studies encourage early mobilization after 12 ours from bed to chair and after 24 hours pt can walk with the help of cardiac rehabilitation nurse ,in her management she stated still she is mobilizing the patient with in 48 hours because other cardiologist mobilizing the patient with in 48 hours and perhaps mobilizing the patient with in different durations may confuse the nurses ,in addition thrombolytic protocol is for 48 hours and nurses used to mobilize the patient once the protocol is finished ,so that if she asked to mobilize the patient with in 24 hours or to be shifted to step down the nurse will replay ” patient still on protocol and didn’t finish the 48 hours ” she stated we don’t discuses the issue as long there is no harm for the patient and we leave the patient till he finished the protocol to avoid confusion to the nurses ,more ever the setting of CCU doesn’t encourage early mobilization ,the room of the patient has to have comfortable chair so that patient can be early mobilized ,the role of the cardiac rehabilitation should be extended to participate in mobilization of in patient ,early mobilization will definitely improve patient confidence and moral and will help in early discharge that will allow more vacancies for needed patient.\nOn other hand ,Dr. Rashid stated that post uncomplicated myocardial infarction , the patient will be on bed rest for 48 hours and that according to American college of cardiology and guidelines ,he stated that he agree with current protocol and going on line with American guidelines as it is the safest practice because this institution has always consciousness about health practice and has became a reference and source of evidence based practice on international level ,however he stated no enough trial were done on 24 hours bed rest.\nIn contrast, Dr. Tayseer stated that he is following the British guidelines that recommended 48 hour’s protocol; he stated mobilizing the patient in the 24 hours may induce lethal arrhythmias which could be fetal.\nEarly mobilisation for patients following acute myocardiac infarction:\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies\nOlga L.

33	how do flavonoids from costmary compare with chrysanthemum medical benefits chemicals	The flavonoids in costmary extract primarily demonstrate benefits in reproductive medicine by protecting sperm cell membranes from free radical damage and oxidative stress during freezing processes. In comparison, chrysanthemum's flavonoids show a wider range of medicinal properties - they exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, protect against bacterial infections, demonstrate anti-tumor activities, and provide antioxidant protection across multiple types of cells and tissues. Chrysanthemum's flavonoids work together with other compounds like volatile oils, organic acids and polysaccharides to provide these diverse therapeutic effects.	"['عنوان مقاله [English]\nنویسنده [English]چکیده [English]\nIntroduction: The Artificial insemination technique is based on sperm cryopreservation that induces irreversible damages to sperm (Purdy 2006), which may result in loss of sperm motility, viability, plasma membrane integrity, and ultimately male fertility (Baghshahi et al. 2014). Physical and chemical damages during cryopreservation are associated with significant amounts of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation of the phospholipids in the membrane by free radicals (Chatterjee et al. 2001). The removal of ROS is catalyzed by antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Numerous non-enzymatic defenses (vitamin C, vitamin E, and glutathione (GSH)) are also employed to provide protection. An imbalance between free radical production and their removal results with ageing allowing progressive damage to occur. Therefore, for protecting the sperm against oxidative damage, numerous researchers have investigated the effects of a various synthetic and natural antioxidants on spermatozoa during cryopreservation processes (Malo et al. 2010). Various plant products contain antioxidant compounds such as flavonoids, tannins, coumarins, xanthons, phenolics, lignans and terpenoids. For this reason, there is a growing interest in using them as natural antioxidants. Several studies have shown that the use of herbal antioxidants during the freezing-thawing process of sperm had positive effects on sperm quality (Daghigh Kia et al. 2016; Vahedi et al. 2018). The herb of costmary (Tanacetum balsamita L.) contains phenolic compounds, such as flavonoids and phenolic acids (Shahhoseini et al. 2019). It has been shown that costmary exhibit antioxidant effects due to phenolic compounds (Bączek et al. 2017). Purpose: The aim of current study was to evaluate the effect of Costmary extract as a natural antioxidant on post-thawed ram sperm quality. Material and methods: This study was performed at the Iranian Moghani sheep Breeding Center located in Jafarabad city, Province Ardebil, Iran. Four mature and fertile rams (3-4 years old, mean live weight of 70±4.2 kg), were used in this study. Ejaculates were collected twice a week for 8 weeks by an artificial vagina (42-43°C). Only samples containing spermatozoa with greater than 70% motility were accepted for experiment. To eliminate individual differences, semen samples were pooled and processed for extending. The pooled ejaculate was diluted (37 ◦C) using egg yolk-citrate extender containing different concentrations of Tanacetum balsamita extract (0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mL/dL). Diluted semen samples were aspirated into 0.25 ml straws and equilibrated at 4°C for 3 h. After equilibration, the straws were placed on liquid nitrogen (LN2) vapor for 8 min, then plunged into liquid nitrogen, and stored in a liquid nitrogen tank until thawed and used for evaluation of sperm parameters. The frozen straws were thawed individually in a water bath (37 ◦C) for 30 s for evaluation. A computer-assisted sperm analysis (HFT CASA, Hooshmand Fanavar Tehran Co, Iran) was used to analyze sperm motility and velocity characteristics. Sperm viability was assessed using a modification of the eosin-nigrosin staining method described by Evans and Maxwell (1987). Sperm membrane functionality was evaluated using the hypoosmotic swelling test (HOST) (Revell and Mrode, 1994). For the assessment of the sperm morphology abnormalities, at least three drops of each sample were added to Eppendorf tubes containing 1 ml of Hancock solution (62.5 ml formalin (37%), 150 ml sodium saline solution, 150 ml buffer solution and 500 ml bi-distilled water). The prepared slides were assessed by phase-contrast microscopy using a 400× magnification. All data were analyzed by completely randomized design using the GLM procedure of SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, 2004). Results and discussion: Samples cryopreserved in 8 and 12 mL/dL Tanacetum balsamita extract had higher total motility and progressive motility compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The percentage of VSL, VCL and VAP were higher (p < 0.05) in the extender containing 8 and 12 mL/dL extract compared to control and 16 mL/dL groups. LIN parameter was higher (p < 0.05) in 8 mL/dL compared to 16 mL/dL extract (46.83±3.82 vs. 40.52±3.23). For parameter STR, the highest value (p < 0.05) was observed at 8 and 12 mL/dL of extract (81.09±7.56% and 80.27±7.18%, respectively). The highest (p < 0.05) percentage of sperm viability and plasma membrane integrity were observed in groups containing 8 and 12 mL/dL extract. Percentage of acrosome abnormality was higher (p < 0.05) in 12 mL/dL extract groups (21.25%) compared to control and 2 mL/dL extract groups (26.70% and 27.23%, respectively). Some studies have reported that herbal antioxidants reduce the free radicals following the freeze–thawing process (Ashrafi et al. 2013). In the present study, treatment of costmary extract resulted in a significant improvement in motility parameters, viability and membrane integrity of frozen-thawed ram sperm. The main constituents found in the herb of costmary extract are polyphenolic compounds, such as flavonoids and phenolic acids (Faraloni, 2018). Among flavonoids there are mainly glycosides of luteolin, apigenin and quercetin while phenolic acids are represented mainly by chlorogenic, caffeic and dicaffeoylquinic acids. The attacks of ROS during cryopreservation lead to reduction of oxygen and it is related to lipids peroxidation of the sperm membranes that destroys the structure of the lipid matrix. Flavonoids increase membranes integrity by preventing of free radicals production and lipid peroxidation in the membrane that induce oxidative damage to the membrane components (Daghigh Kia et al. 2016). Therefore, costmary extract may play a protective role against oxidative damage and scavenge produced free radicals from cells. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study showed that supplementation of extender with 12 mL/dL Tanacetum balsamita L. extract has a beneficial effect on the quality of frozen-thawed ram semen.', 'The Composition of chrysanthemum extracts and their pharmacological functions\nChrysanthemum is a widely planted cash crop worldwide, due to its high ornamental and medicinal values. In addition, as a frequently used material in traditional Chinese medicine, studies have revealed that chrysanthemum extracts are complicated mixtures of flavonoids, volatile oils, organic acids, polysaccharides and other minor components, which possess pharmacological effects against many pathological conditions such as toxin-induced cell loss, bacterial infection-induced inflammation, reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative stress and tumor formation induced by various stimuli. In this mini review, we collected and summarized the current understanding on the composition and pharmacology of chrysanthemum extracts originally published in both Chinese and English, and aimed to broaden the readership, in order to build up the basis for eliciting more valuable investigations in this topic.\nOhmiya A.

34	local wood small items sustainable benefits	Small items made from local wood offer both practical and environmental benefits. From Document 1, you can make useful items like pens, key chains, small bowls, and Christmas ornaments from smaller branches. From Document 2, using local wood is more sustainable as it requires less energy to transport and supports local businesses with responsible forest management practices.	['Local woods – Part III\n9 surprising things you can make out of local wood\nYou’ve found some local wood and it is ready for the lathe. So what to do with your wood? Sometimes walking into your shop feels like shopping on December 24th. So many choices and so little time! One problem with so many choices is the need for practicing technique before tackling a really special burl or grained wood for a large bowl. Using up smaller branches and cutoffs gives you extra practice, in preparation for a bigger project, while still letting you make some beautiful and useful items to stock your inventory for seasonal sales. Here are 9 ideas for taking some of the smaller pieces in your wood stash and producing useful items from them.\nThese smaller items are great for filling out price points for craft sales and Christmas venues.\n1. Pens, Key Chains, and Bottle Toppers\nBlanks for pens or key chains are small and easy to retrieve from smaller branches. Try not to include the centre or pith. You might be able to drill that section out for your brass tube. Work on larger pieces before cutting out the actual pen blank for the pens you want to turn. Areas to select are points where there are branches or wrinkled bark. These are places where you are more likely to find figure in the wood. Straight branches let you see the texture and grain of the regular wood. I was surprised by the whiteness of Columbia Hawthorne the first time I turned it. Remember to make the blank larger in diameter as there might be blemishes that need to be adjusted for. The length of the blank will be determined by the pen/key/bottle hardware that you are using. Bottle tops usually require a greater diameter than for the pens or key chains.\n2. Fobs for window blinds and fan chains\nThese little items are useful for adding a personal touch to blinds or fans. You also don’t need any hardware to produce them. Turn the small blocks between centre and include a spigot to go into a jam chuck or a mechanical chuck. It is best to drill out the hold for the chord or chain while the item is still on the lathe. These can use up lots of small blocks that are produced when you cut out larger items like bowls or billets.\n3. Small bowls\nThese are turned like regular bowls but are usually smaller because of getting branches from an orchard or limbed tree. You could easily include a natural edge to the bowl. Do be careful to secure the blank to the lathe even though it is a small piece of wood. Crotches of the trees are good spots to take bowls from because that is where the tree is stressed and the figure is formed in the wood. As the bowls are small you should turn them with quite thin walls, 1/4 ” or less. This would allow the bowls to contract and move without splitting, adding character and charm. These bowls could be used for catching change on a bedside table or paper clips on a desk.\n4. Toy tops\nToy tops are turned the same way as fobs but without the hole in the centre. An obtuse angle (greater than 90 degrees) is better for spinning than a sharp one. Use a right angle layout square to give you an idea of the angle on the lathe. The spindle part for spinning needs to be fairly thin but sturdy enough to survive being a toy. You will have to experiment to find the shapes that work best for you.\n5. Spurtles, Stirring Sticks, and Wands\nA spurtle is a stirring stick used to cook oatmeal. A blank at least 1″ in diameter should be used. These are excellent items to practice your spindle turning techniques. On the other hand, a wand is a stirring stick with a thin end! Be creative with the decorations on the handle and careful not to give it to too young of a magician.\n6. Small Vases\nWood is Fun has some pictures showing how to turn a small vase out of off-cuts. Small pieces of local wood would work just as well. This example uses glass tubes to hold the flowers in but you could call the vase a weed pot for dried local flowers. Local flowers and local woods are a great combination.\nThis is a wooden ball winder from Norway. The main points are a handle that fits nicely into a Lady’s hand, a reasonable length to the shaft for winding the wool onto, and a slight taper on the shaft so that the ball, when finished, slides easily off the end. A decoration between the handle and shaft serves as a place to tie the yarn onto. This requires a very smooth surface for the shaft so that the yarn doesn’t catch on it. I normally sand to 800 grit and steel wool then finish with carnauba wax.\n8. Little boxes\nI have done a few of these. The nature of the box seems to flow from the wood you are turning. Take a 2″ to 3″ diameter branch 5″ or so long. Turn a spigot on one end (the larger end) for your chuck. Don’t turn the branch round! (see box on the right) Move to the middle of the branch or a little higher and start turning the branch round and leaving the bottom portion natural. You’ll have to follow the usual box procedures for shaping and finishing the top and bottom. Remember that you are using the whole branch and the hole for the box can extend below your turn line. The end result is quite charming.\n9. Christmas Tree Ornaments\nThis is an open-ended category. You can make wooden icicles out of local wood that is not heavy. In my area, I would use Trembling Aspen as it dries very light. (see picture) You could also turn balls or bells as ornaments as well. There are ornament kits similar to key chains that can be turned on standard pen turning mandrels and bushings.\nActually, anything you normally turn can also be turned from local wood. The uniqueness of local woods could make any of these projects quite attractive at the local market or craft fairs. Consider combining different species and doing segmented turnings to add variety to the results. These items are quite small and finishing with carnauba wax or oil finish with shellac provides enough of a sealant to eliminate the dangers of cracking or splitting as the item dries.\nSo what treasure did you find in your stash? Share pictures and I’ll post them online. I’m going to try some Christmas Tree ornaments from Grand Forks Linden wood.', 'The most sustainable wood choices for your building projects are woods that are grown locally and are well managed. Depending on where you live, the best type of sustainable wood will vary. However, nature tends to be smarter than we are. If your local wood producer is managing certain types of trees, they will likely work well for your building projects.\nFor example, Mathew Kelty, who teaches about forest ecology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst said “In the northwest, Douglass fir is everywhere. There is also a lot of western red cedar, which is soft, but doesn’t decay. It’s often used for shingles for that reason.” Kelty added that in the northeast region a lot of spruce and fir is used due to its abundance. DIY Resource: http://www.networx.com/article/managed-forests-make-for-more-sustainabl\nThe idea of sustainable wood products is larger than what specific woods to use. Sustainability in relation to wood products has more to do with appropriate land management, biodiversity of plants and animals, and the integrity of the soil according to Emily Boss, director of the Massachusetts Woodlands Institute. “We prefer to use the term ‘responsible management’ of wood over ‘sustainable,’” said Boss. “Responsible management is the goal,” she added.\nWhen you are looking for sustainable wood products, it is important to know if they are certified woods and by whom. One of the best certifications comes from the Forest Stewardship Council. The FCS logo is an excellent indicator that you have chosen woods that have been properly and responsibly managed. It is also a good idea when researching local sustainable wood sources to look at certifications your state provides. Boss said in Massachusetts, for example, a new certification was created approximately a year ago called the Commonwealth Quality program. There are also similar programs in Vermont and Maine, Boss said. “There are no quick answers (regarding sustainable wood products). But, FCS takes into account how the workers are being treated, indigenous people’s issues; there are a lot of variable when talking about sustainable wood products,” said Boss.\nThe best sustainable woods travel the least distance from harvest to consumer. “Local soft and hardwoods use less energy to transport. If you are supporting a local business, you can get to know then, know how high their land management standards are,” said Boss. Boss said that good land management also take invasive species such as bittersweet and and wild rose into account as they take over and are destructive to native trees and plants.\nBoss said that typically in the New England region, oak, white pine, sugar maple, red maple, and birch are the most commonly used woods for lumber production. It’s also good to know where the wood is being processed. In other words, do you have a local saw mill? DIY Resource: http://www.hometalk.com\nBeware of using tropical woods such as teak, rosewood or ebony for custom woodworking. Many tropical areas of the world where these woods are harvested have not been responsibly managed, and over-harvesting often causes environmental, political and social harm to indigenous peoples.\nTo sum up how to find the most sustainable woods, look for certified woods from managed forests that travel the shortest distance from harvest to consumer.']	['<urn:uuid:b36162fa-f021-40cf-bdd4-89d4a0e97229>', '<urn:uuid:b46c9caa-dfa8-44bd-a9c9-e36d1684f406>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	6	57	1671
35	vasco de gama sea route impact trade colonization india	Vasco de Gama's discovery of the sea route to India had profound impacts on trade and colonization. His route, called the Carreira da India, helped establish Portugal as a dominant trading and military power. The discovery helped Portuguese traders avoid the Mediterranean, Persian Gulf, and Arabian peninsula, ensuring their monopoly over the lucrative spice trade. This led to three centuries of European struggle for spice trade control, particularly in Malabar, known as the 'land of pepper'. The Portuguese expanded beyond spices into other products, establishing secure outposts on Africa's eastern coast. The route revived Portugal's economy and benefited spice growers with better prices, improved cultivation, and enhanced hinterland navigation and trade. Archaeological evidence from the Esmerelda shipwreck, including Portuguese coins and military artifacts, provides tangible proof of Portugal's naval dominance in the Indian Ocean.	"['Vasco de Gama\'s ship, rich in treasure and history, is found near Oman\nThe discovery is a treasure trove of gold coins, historic artifacts, and hints about Portuguese exploration in the Indian Ocean.\nResearchers say they have discovered the earliest known shipwreck from Europe’s ""Age of Exploration,"" a ship from the fleet of Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama named the Esmerelda.\nThe shipwreck is a treasure trove of historical artifacts, say archeologists. Not only is the ship’s history an intriguing story of piracy, greed, and tragedy, but the wreck can also teach scholars about the Portuguese during their ""Golden Age of Navigation.""\n“There’s a lot to learn from the artifacts after the fully archeological study is completed,” David L. Mearns, whose company, Blue Water Recoveries, excavated the shipwreck, told The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interview. “This collection provides physical, tangible proof of the military power of the Portuguese and how they dominated other countries through their naval power.”\nThe Esmerelda sailed with de Gama in the early 16th century, from about 1502 to 1503. De Gama is famous for discovering a sea route to India in the last years of the 15th century. His discovery of the route, called the Carreira da India, helped establish Portugal as a dominant trading and military power.\nDespite its utility, the Carreira da India was a dangerous route for sailors – about 20 percent of the ships that traveled the route in the first century and a half after its discovery were lost at sea. Prior to the discovery of the Esmerelda, the oldest-known shipwreck discovered in the area was the São João, which wrecked in 1552.\nThe story of how the Esmerelda came to ruin is a tale of avarice and ignorance. The ship was one of five ships that de Gama left behind in the Indian Ocean under the command of his maternal uncles, Vicente and Brás Sodré.\nAlthough the Sodré brothers were tasked with protecting Portuguese factories on the coast of India, they instead engaged in piracy, raiding Arab ships throughout the Gulf and leaving no survivors.\nAfter months of raids, the five ships took shelter in April by a small island, known today as Al Hallaniyah. When the locals warned the Sodré brothers that their ships were in danger due to an impending storm, the brothers scoffed at their concerns.\nWhen Mr. Mearns’s team first began researching the shipwreck, he told the Monitor, “We weren’t archeologists. Our skill was with the research.”\nThe team first conducted historical research in libraries and archives in Europe, primarily in Lisbon, Portugal. They read survivor accounts in order to locate the shipwreck’s location.\nMearns told the Monitor that the team identified two potential sites, but initial investigation at the first site came up empty. At the second site, however, divers found cannonballs that eventually led them to the shipwreck. The Esmerelda was discovered in 1998.\nYet, the team was hamstrung by a lack of funds and experience. “We really thought we weren’t capable of doing it,” Mearns says. “So we postponed it [the excavation] until we found the right teammates, so we could do it the right way.”\nThe ship was finally excavated in 2013. “We used a grid system to excavate,” said Mearns’s fellow researcher David Parham, “just like an archeological dig on land.” The team used airlifts and suction to remove the sand from the site and push it to one side while they completed the excavation.\nAccording to National Geographic, researchers found over 2,800 individual artifacts at the wreck. These include Portuguese coins (both gold cruzado coins from the reign of Joao II and silver índio coins for trade with India), a ship’s bell cast in 1498, and what appears to be a copper alloy astrolabe bearing the Portuguese royal coat of arms.\nAccording to Dr. Parham, the find is significant for the depth of information it provides about Europe’s involvement in the Indian Ocean.\n“This is the earliest European vessel found in the Indian Ocean,” Parham told the Monitor. “It gives us an idea of the level of armaments, information about how the ship was provisioned in Portugal, where it was provisioned on the coast of Africa, and the ships it raided in the Indian Ocean.”\nAlthough the crew undoubtedly perished with the ship, researchers were unable to find human remains, either with the wreck or on the island. It is likely that the climate decomposed the bodies.\nBy law, artifacts from the shipwreck belong to the Omani government. According to Mearns, the excavation is the first of its kind near Oman, and it carries cultural and historical significance for both the Portuguese and Omani governments, as it represents some of the earliest communication between Europe and Gulf countries like Oman.', ""Vasco da Gama is known as the hero of the age of discoveries, the European historical era from the 15th to 18th centuries. He discovered a new sea route from Europe to the far east around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa. Gama started from Lisbon in 1497 and reached Panthalayani Kollam, a port on the Malabar coast near Calicut, after sailing for ten and a half months.\nAccording to Adam Smith, “the two greatest incidents in world history” are the discovery of America by Columbus and the finding of the new sea route to India by Gama. Historians describe Gama’s arrival as an entente cordial that allowed the east and the west to meet without an intermediary.\nGama was born in 1460 as the third son of Estêvão da Gama, a minor provincial nobleman, who was commander of the fortress of Sines, a coastal town in Alentejo province in southwestern Portugal. The Portuguese kings at the time were in search of newer options to build up the royal treasury in order to reduce their dependence on the feudal nobility. Spice trade with the east was one of their prime targets. Several expeditions were mounted to open up a new route to the east, and Gama, with his proven seafaring capability, was among the chosen ones to lead one of those.\nHe set sail from Lisbon on July 8, 1497, and braving several hardships, managed to reach the Malabar coast on May 20, 1498. With his voyage, Gama showed the western world the immense possibilities of trade with the east. The occupation of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks in 1453 had shut the European trade routes to India. Pepper and other spices were denied to the Europeans by the Arabs. Gama’s new route opened up a wide range of possibilities. It helped the Portuguese avoid the Mediterranean, the Persian Gulf and the Arabian peninsula and ensure monopoly over the lucrative spice trade. The next three centuries, however, were noted for the struggle among the Europeans for the monopoly of spice trade with India, especially Malabar, which was known as the “land of pepper”\nGama's discovery heralded a new age of European imperialism in Asia. Starting with spices like pepper and cinnamon, the Portuguese traders gradually diversified into other products, cementing a commercial monopoly. It helped the Portuguese rulers revive their economy, which until then relied heavily on trade with coastal Africa. The new sea route was a beginning. The spice growers got good prices, cultivation was increased and hinterland navigation and trade improved.\nBy cleverly mixing politics and war, Gama kept the Portuguese flag flying in India, and, in the process, ensured his country's supremacy in maritime trade. He showed the importance of establishing secure outposts on the eastern coast of Africa along the trade routes to the east. Gama’s voyage made an indelible mark not just on Malabar. It created far-reaching changes in the commercial, agricultural, political, religious and social arena of a number of countries in the east.\nApart from laying the foundation for Portuguese imperialism, Gama's voyage also marked the beginning of global multiculturalism. Homages have been paid worldwide to celebrate his accomplishments. The Portuguese national epic, Os Lusíadas, was written in his honour by Luís Vaz de Camões. The port city of Vasco da Gama in Goa is named after him. Three football clubs in Brazil, including Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama, and Vasco Sports Club in Goa are named after him. A church in Kochi, Kerala, and a private residence on the island of Saint Helena bear Gama's name. The suburb of Vasco in Cape Town, South Africa is named after him. A few places in Lisbon's Parque das Nações, such as the Vasco da Gama Bridge, Vasco da Gama Tower and the Centro Comercial Vasco da Gama shopping centre, too, are named in his honour.\n“Portugal’s navigators, showing Europe the way across the oceans, brought back more than spices, gold, precious stones and silk,” said Mario Soares, former president of Portugal. “They interacted with ancient cultures and gave us the vision of the one world we have today.” Whether some people like it or not, Gama enjoys a prominent position in history as the man who led the expedition that connected the western world to the east.\nCharles Dias is a former MP, vice president of the Kerala History Association, and director of the Indo-Portuguese Cultural Centre\nFaxian was the first Chinese pilgrim scholar to leave an account, A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms, of his travels to India and Sri Lanka. He set out from China in 399 CE in search of the authentic Buddhist canon and travelled extensively in the “holy land” of Buddhism. He visited the important places in the Buddha’s life, including Kapilavastu, Sarnath, Bodh Gaya and Kushinagar. He was so impressed by what he saw and said India was very productive and the people were happy beyond compare. His journey inspired many Chinese scholars to travel to India in search of scholarly texts and the ultimate truth. He also spent two years in Sri Lanka and collected Buddhist texts to take back home. While returning from Sri Lanka, Faxian’s boat ran into rough weather and he spent about 200 days stranded at sea. Faxian’s accounts helped start relations between India and China and contain exclusive information on Indian Buddhism. He returned to China with many Sanskrit texts and translated them to strengthen the foundation of Buddhism in the country.""]"	['<urn:uuid:bf15deaa-ad23-4a27-8f38-a29993633fac>', '<urn:uuid:4d13e1d3-2df7-4fce-b167-fde1a13f5b97>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	9	134	1708
36	simulation medical education benefits mental health effects	Simulation in medical education provides transformational change for educators and learners, leading to improved patient outcomes through process improvements. It has been particularly valuable for COVID-19 readiness training. However, healthcare providers involved in such intensive medical work face significant mental health challenges, including PTSD, acute stress disorder, and depression, especially those with decreased social support. To address these challenges while maintaining educational effectiveness, healthcare workers are encouraged to practice self-assessment, take regular breaks, and engage in stress-reducing activities like meditation.	['One of the Center for Medical Simulation’s greatest strengths is the quality and depth of its faculty. We are fortunate to have a select number of outstanding faculty members who help teach our courses all over the world. Some are based here in the Boston area, but many hail from places as far flung as Hong Kong, Australia, England, Spain, and France to name a few. Their backgrounds vary, but each one is exceptional educator capable of helping to deliver the type of high quality, transformative educational experience that is the hallmark of CMS’ faculty development courses.\nOne of these outstanding educators, Dr. Albert Chan will be assisting Mary Fey, PhD when CMS delivers its Online Healthcare Simulation Essentials: Design and Debriefing Course (HSEDD) for the Centre for Healthcare Simulation (CHS) at the National University of Singapore (NUS) next month.\nCMS recently asked Dr. Chan to tell us a bit about himself.\nDr. Albert Chan Background\nDr. Albert Chan MBBS, FHKCA, FHKAM (Anaesthesiologist), FANZCA is a Specialist in Anaesthesiology, Sub-specializing in Cardiac Anaesthesia, an Associate Consultant, Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Prince of Wales Hospital, a Clinical Assistant Professor (Honorary), Chinese University of Hong Kong, and is currently a MHPE student at University of Maastricht.\nWhat is it about simulation that interests/excites you?\nSimulation has been an integral part of training for me ever since I entered into the Anaesthesia specialty years ago! When I became a Fellow, I became very interested in education, and particularly in simulation-based medical education. It was not until I became a Visiting Scholar/Fellow at CMS that my eyes truly opened to the world of simulation and debriefing. The most exciting thing for me is that when simulation results in transformational change in educators and learners alike, or when it actually results in process or system improvements that improve patient outcome!\nFrom the clinical end, I am focusing on Perioperative medicine, and have been actively engaging various specialties to jointly improve the patients’ Perioperative outcome. It is very exciting, because I am learning lots about other professions — e.g. physiotherapy, occupational therapy — that I never had the chance to communicate with before! I am also working on a Smart Hospital project — Perioperative medicine application — that will hope to improve the patients’ Perioperative experience.\nOn the simulation front, I have mostly in involved in translational simulation in our department. The most recent project is in simulation to enhance staff capacity for management of COVID patients during high risk procedures. The next project will be testing out the new information system prior to implementation.\nResearch/ Teaching Area Focus\nThe Focus of my MHPE is on how residents process feedback in the workplace, and to identify any barriers to feedback processing that can be resolved with educational programs. This is particularly important considering the cultural implications of implementing a feedback-based training program amongst our residents. Another area of focus is using clinical events debriefing to enhance team competence and improve clinical processes.\nChan AK, Rudolph JW, Lau VN, Wong HM, Wong RS, Lo TS, Choi GY, Joynt GM.

COVID-19 has brought personal health, mental health and wellness practices into the limelight. The increased stress of the pandemic has unfortunately cost various healthcare providers to take their lives. Now more than ever, it’s important for all healthcare providers to make both their physical health and mental health a top priority.\nMental Health Concerns Among Healthcare Professionals\nHealthcare providers have been bombarded with many mental health issues during the COVID -19 crisis. Some of these include social isolation, acute stress disorder, depression, alcohol abuse and the fear of death. These mental health concerns all add an enormous stress on the body further decreasing it’s immune response.\nThose Healthcare providers who have been coming in close contact with COVID-19 patients and are potentially exposed to the virus may exhibit symptoms of PTSD due to the potential for increased illness, death and supply shortages. PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) is a chronic psychiatric illness that develops subsequent to experiencing a significant traumatic event. Studies show that those healthcare providers who have decreased social support are more susceptible to PTSD. People living with PTSD commonly start to manifest a dysregulation in the systems that regulate the stress response. This can lead to somatic inflammatory response and autoimmune diseases.\nHealthcare providers tend to be selfless and put all others first. But, COVID-19 has sounded the alarms on personal health. It’s a huge wake up call for everyone to starry healthy.\nFocus On Self-Assessment\nAs healthcare providers, we typically assess our patients before we give them a diagnosis. It’s important to take pause and complete a mini health assessment on yourself and ask yourself these questions:\n- Are you feeling overly fatigued?\n- Has your mood taken a vast shift from the normal?\n- Are you experiencing feelings of guilt, anger or shame?\n- Have you lost interest in pleasurable activities?\n- Are you having trouble sleeping and or experiencing recurrent nightmares?\nIf your answer was yes to any of the above, then you need to stop and listen to your body and follow these 5 important tips:\n1.Improve Your Diet And Boost Your Immune System\nThe food and supplements you put in your body can make a dramatic difference in your mental health as well as your body’s immune response. Chronic stress will decrease your body’s immune system, further making you susceptible to disease. Decreasing caffeine and alcohol intake will decrease your inflammatory response helping your immune system to function better.\nIncrease vitamin C through citrus fruits or supplements (75 mg/day for women 90 mg/ day for men). Eat a diet rich with foods like broccoli, bell peppers, garlic, ginger, spinach almonds, papaya, kiwi, poultry and shell fish. Decrease complex carbohydrates as well as limiting refined sugars. Getting enough vitamin D through diet and or sunlight is also important to mental health as low levels can cause depression, problems losing weight and bone loss. Supplementing with Zinc will boost your immune system and help fight of colds.\n2. Exercise and Meditate\nAnother thing we take for granted is exercise. COVID-19 has shut down many gyms and exercise facilities around the country, but simple activities like walking, swimming, dancing and jumping rope can help boost your mood as well as keep the extra weight off. Meditating for 10-15 minutes a day is a great way to decrease stress as well as increasing mental focus.\n3. Take Breaks While At Work\nYes, healthcare providers have a tendency of sometimes working straight through their shifts without taking any breaks. Breaks are crucial and, in many states, legally mandated for all healthcare providers. Make yourself a priority during your busy day and take a power nap or go for a walk. Make a point to get off all electronics for at least 10-15 minutes and regroup with yourself and get grounded. You’ll feel more energized and empowered to finish your day.\n4. Phone A Friend\nTechnology has made communicating easy yet complex. Many of us quickly resort to texting when we want to communicate. But hearing someone’s voice and connecting with someone on the phone or through facetime, who will let you just vent while they simply listen can do volumes for your mental health.\nWhen working in high stress environments, designating a friend who understands that sometimes you just need to vent and let the emotions out is key. Perhaps have a couple of designated friends that understand that you need to do this. If they are unavailable, sometimes just going to your local coffee shop, or supermarket and engaging in idle chit chat with another human being will also help. Many apps are available for mental health support as well as in person mental healthcare providers who can help you navigate through difficult situations.\n5. Becoming Conscious Of Your World And Environment\nIt’s always best to be as conscious and aware of your present state as possible. When things get rough and or chaotic it’s a good practice to take stock of how much you have achieved in your life. Take a pause, be conscious of your surroundings, the present moment, and take a deep breath. Finding a creative outlet like painting, coloring, writing, playing music and or dancing can also help uplift your mood and disconnect from your work life.\nWe as humans have the ability to shift our moods and create our environments. Like Viktor Frankel wrote in ‘Mans Search For Meaning’ “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.” You are the master of your universe and in charge of your own health and wellbeing. It’s up to you to focus on what keeps you healthy and able to function at your highest capacity. After all, your health is in your wealth!\nIf you are someone you love is thinking about committing suicide, please call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline for help 1-800-273-8255.']	['<urn:uuid:e0af1799-1218-437b-9805-8bca8296c08f>', '<urn:uuid:3ceb4117-b549-4e13-8d87-273ad336d0a9>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	7	80	1693
37	how can phantom power waste electricity in home electronics and how to prevent it	Phantom power occurs when electronics continue to draw power even when turned off, indicated by glowing red and green LED lights on equipment. To prevent this waste of electricity, you can use a power bar to completely turn off computers and their peripherals, TVs, stereos, and DVD players when not in use. This 'ghost busting' technique helps eliminate unnecessary power consumption from devices in standby mode.	"[""Every Kilowatt Counts\nThe Ontario Power Authority (OPA) has developed a variety of incentives for consumers across the complete spectrum of energy efficient products and services – from retiring their power hungry refrigerators to tuning up central air conditioners. Incentives are available for both residential and business customers through Greater Sudbury Hydro.\nClick on the link below for more information on Every Kilowatt Counts and find out how you can do your part to save money, energy and our planet.\nA place for children to go and learn about saving electricity and our environment.\nYou'll be surprised at just how easy it is to save electricity in your home, and how much money you can save, too!\n- Change furnace filters regularly. You should do so every other month or monthly if you have pets. A dirty furnace filter reduces air flow and makes your furnace work harder; clean filters can save up to 5% of energy use.\n- Use special tape to seal leaky heating ducts—it’s easy to apply and keeps the hot or cool air going to where it’s needed.\n- Take a quick shower instead of a bath. A typical bath uses about 75 litres of hot water, while a five-minute shower with an energy efficient showerhead will use about half that amount.\n- Don’t overcool your food. Is the temperature of your refrigerator and your freezer set for only as cold as you need? Defrost your manual-defrost freezer regularly to ensure it operates at maximum efficiency.\n- Get rid of the old “energy hog” fridge in the basement. It’s is wasting both space and energy. The fridge you bought in 1975 costs about four times as much to run as a new ENERGY STAR® model.\n- Wash your clothes in cold or warm water. Did you know that 85-90% of the energy used by washing machines is used to heat the water?\n- Use energy-saving small appliances, and use the big ones less often. Electric kettles, toaster ovens, or microwaves use much less electricity than stoves and ovens.\n- Go for the full load. Run your dishwasher and washing machine only when you have a full load, and use the energy-saving cycle, if your appliance has one.\n- Dry naturally. If you have the space, use old style clothes drying racks which also add humidity to the dry winter air in your house. When the weather is right, use an outdoor clothesline to dry laundry, if permitted by your municipality.\n- Use fans as a cool alternative to air conditioners. Install ceiling fans to help keep rooms cooler, instead of using an air conditioner. Make sure they blow downward in summer, and upward in winter.\n- Use air conditioning responsibly. How low do you really need to go? During last summer’s heat wave, 20% of all the energy consumed in the province was for air conditioning. The combined benefits of everyone setting their temperature a little higher would be impressive. And remember, air conditioners cool people, not homes. Don’t run the A/C when you’re not home.\n- Turn off the lights – a unlit light does not use energy. Use compact fluorescent light bulbs whenever possible—they use 75% less electricity and last much longer than incandescent styles. Motion sensors can also help you ensure those lights go off when you’re not in the room.\n- Turn down the lights. Dimmer switches help you use only the amount of light—and electricity – you really need. And remember, keep your lights clean—a cleaner bulb is a brighter bulb.\n- Seal the deal on electricity savings. Weather stripping and caulking around windows, ducts and doors can cut your heating and cooling bill by 10%. Beef up your insulation. Larger projects such as increasing ceiling insulation to R-30 standards can cut the home heating and cooling cost of a properly sealed home by 20-25%. Purchasing an R-2000 or ENERGY STAR® home could save you 30 – 40% of the energy of a home built to the minimum Ontario Building Code standards.\n- Landscape for energy efficiency. Planting trees for wind barriers and shade, installing energy efficient windows, air conditioners and furnaces can also provide large energy savings.\n- Ghost bust your phantom power by purchasing a power bar to turn off computers and the peripherals, TVs, stereos, DVD players and the like. Spot the phantoms by looking for the telltale red and green LED lights on your equipment—if you see one glowing, the power is still flowing!\n- Put your pool pump on a timer so that it’s working 6-8 hours a day, rather than 24/7. Use a solar blanket to keep the heat from escaping from your pool at night.\n- Unplug your old patio lights and replace with solar lights.\n- Ready to go the extra mile for energy efficiency?

38	compare magdalene odundo rosemary karuga achievements international recognition relate global girls education challenges barriers	Magdalene Odundo and Rosemary Karuga represent different levels of international recognition in art education. Odundo achieved the highest position in international arts of any East African as Chancellor of the University of Creative Arts in the UK, received an OBE from the Queen, and gained global recognition for her ceramic works. Karuga, as the first woman to attend Makerere University School of Fine Arts, pioneered unique collage techniques and earned a Lifetime Achievement Award. Their achievements mirror broader challenges in girls' education globally, where about 80 countries still struggle with gender gaps in education access and quality. While some countries have successfully enrolled girls in education, many face barriers in achieving quality learning outcomes. Like these artists who broke barriers, today's efforts focus on building strong girl leaders and implementing systemic reforms to improve educational opportunities for girls worldwide.	['National Museums of Kenya and The Murumbi Trust present an exhibition of artworks by nine acclaimed women of East Africa, titled “Pioneer Women of the Arts.” The opening ceremony will take place on Sunday, September 9 at 2:00pm, at the Nairobi Gallery in Nairobi, Kenya.\nThe exhibition will highlight works from legendary East African artists Margaret Trowell, Joy Adamson, Magdalene Odundo, Rosemary Karuga, Geraldine Robarts, Robin Anderson, Yony Wai-Te, Nani Croze, and Theresa Musoke, and will be open through December 8, 2018. AMB. Amina C Mohamed, EGH, Cabinet Secretary for Education will lead the ceremony.\nThe exhibition’s entertainment will be a performance by PAPILLON, a young Kenyan musician and protégé of the world-famous Kenyan musician Ayub Ogada.\nPAPILLON creates his own instruments based on African instruments thousands of years old and writes his own music in an effort to preserve authentic Kenyan music not influenced by Western rap and hip hop. PAPILLON follows in the footsteps of Kenya’s African Heritage Festival, founded by Alan Donovan, which travels the world with its cast of models, musicians, acrobats, stilt walkers, hair dressers, chefs and others.\nEach artist showcased in “Pioneer Women of the Arts” was selected based on the various paths that have paved their existence in the art realm, and their earned acclaim through their unique struggle. These female artists have generated a significant impact on the art and culture of East Africa.\nTrowell, with her six books and art school at the prestigious Makerere University in Uganda, which was the best in the region – and perhaps all of Africa, is undoubtedly an influential pioneer artist and teacher to whom all artists in East Africa owe a debt. Her main goal in creating art, Trowell said, was to “make it plain that art is of the people and natural to the people.”\nAdamson, conceivably best known for her children’s books and later TV series “Born Free,” has also had a tremendous impact on the preservation of African culture. Throughout her travels, Adamson realized that she must paint the people of Kenya in their many tribal dresses before they were abandoned for Western wear and imports. She spent six and a half years living in all parts of Kenya during this pursuit after the Kenyan Government commissioned her to make a comprehensive record of all the traditional dress and ornaments of the people of Kenya.\nOdundo holds the highest position in international arts of any East African, as Chancellor of the University of Creative Arts in the UK. She has received an OBE by the Queen of England for her service to the arts, and has achieved international acclaim for her ceramic and glass works, which have been collected in museums globally. Odundo is known for being one of the world’s greatest contemporary potters.\nKaruga was the first woman to attend the prestigious Makerere University School of Fine Arts. She has exhibited her works with the leading artists of the continent and has been a mentor to world-renowned ceramicist Magdalene Odundo. Karuga pioneered a unique form of collage using local materials, and was eventually given a Lifetime Achievement Award for her contributions to the art world.\nRobarts has lifelong experience as a painter and University Lecturer in Fine Arts, including Makerere University and Kenyatta University. She is always pushing the boundaries of what paint, color, and new materials can achieve, and loves exploring the world to bring her inimitable style to her creations. Robarts is also a prominent worker with grassroots women’s groups in Kenya and has worked to bring art, health, and economic opportunities to communities who had previously struggled to survive.\nAnderson has made a lasting impact on the art world of East Africa, perhaps most famously as the co-founder of the leading East African contemporary art gallery, Gallery Watatu, which served as a platform for serious contemporary art in East Africa with recurrent exhibitions by leading artists. Inspired by the people and wildlife of Kenya, Anderson was a forerunner for what became a burgeoning industry of batiks in South Africa with her elegant batiks on silk.\nWai-Te is most famous for co-founding the first major contemporary art gallery in East Africa, Gallery Watatu, which has become the leading contemporary art gallery in the region. Her wildebeest and wildlife paintings populate hotels and public buildings throughout East Africa and have gained her an international following and reputation synonymous with the safari style of the region. Through her Wildebeests Workshops, Wai-Te has worked and trained many East African women’s groups and artists.\nCroze, as an artist, educator, and environmentalist, has brought another dimension to the art of East Africa. Founder of the Kitengela Glass Research and Training Trust, a center for recycling used glass into art, Croze has conducted numerous glass training workshops for young women from Kibera slums creating glass beads, pottery, and mosaics. Her monumental stained-glass and recycled glass works appear in numerous public spaces, including the courtyard and entry of the National Museums of Kenya.\nMusoke was one of the first women to obtain a degree from Makerere University at a time when very few African women were attending University. Her distinctive works romanticizing wildlife in a moody mixture of abstract batik and oil paintings have won Musoke great acclaim. She also taught art at Makerere and other leading art institutions in East Africa.', '“There is no more valuable investment than in a girls’ education.” — Ban Ki Moon, secretary-general, United Nations.\nEducating a girl is one of the best investments her family, community, and country can make. We know that a good quality education can be life-changing for girls, boys, young women, and men, helping them develop to their full potential and putting them on a path for success in their life. We also know that educating a girl in particular can kick-start a virtuous circle of development. More educated girls, for example, marry later, have healthier children, earn more money that they invest back into their families and communities, and play more active roles in leading their communities and countries.\nOver the last 25 years, there have been large gains in girls’ education, and we as a global community can congratulate ourselves for the real progress that has been made. This demonstrates that with shared goals and collective action—among governments, international organizations, civil society, media, and the private sector—we can change the educational prospects for girls around the world.\nDespite this progress, our research shows that there are hotspots in the world where girls are not getting a quality education. While there certainly are places where boys are behind, we have focused on understanding how and where across the world girls are behind. The message is that many countries have work to do to improve girls’ education, whether related to the gender gap in primary or secondary enrollment or learning.\nThere are about 80 countries where progress on girls’ education has stalled. These countries are not meeting the education Millennium Development Goals. They are stuck in an education bog—still struggling to enroll all girls and boys in primary school and close the gender gaps between boys and girls at both the primary and secondary levels.\nThere are an additional 30 countries that have successfully enrolled girls and boys in primary and secondary education but are trapped in low-quality learning. They are struggling to ensure that girls and boys master foundational skills such as basic literacy, numeracy, and science concepts. Quality learning is important for the future lives of girls and boys, but it is also an especially important ingredient in the virtuous circle of development that comes from girls’ education.\nFinally, there are another 30 countries where children are successfully enrolled and learning. However, girls are behind boys in math. In some ways, we can think of girls in these countries bumping up against an educational glass ceiling.\n• Why do we care about girls’ education?\n• What progress can we build on?\n• What do we face today in the effort to educate girls?\n• Why are girls behind?\n• What is working to address obstacles to girls’ education?\n• What should we do to accelerate progress on girls education?\nSeven main benefits of girls’ education to society\n1. More educated girls and women aspire to become leaders and thus expand a country’s leadership and entrepreneurial talent.\n2. It is the quality of schooling that really counts; economic growth is faster when girls (and boys) learn.\n3. More equal education means greater economic empowerment for women through more equal work opportunities for women and men\n4. More educated girls and young women are healthier—and as adults they have healthier children.\n5. More educated mothers have more educated children, especially daughters.\n6. More educated women are better able to protect themselves and their families from the effects of economic and environmental shocks.\n7. Education is valuable for girls in and of itself. Finally, in the words of Urvashi Sahni, an Indian girls’ education activist, “even without all of the ‘developmental and economic goodies’ that come\nfrom girls’ education, we should care about educating girls because it is inherently valuable to them and is their right” (Sahni, 2015)\nWhat should we do: Taking action on girls’ education\nTaking action on girls’ education should not be confined to the halls of government offices or multilateral institutions. Civil society networks, business leaders, media organizations, academia, social enterprises, philanthropic communities, and individual global champions all have a role to play. With this in mind, we are recommending two focused streams of action.\n• Recommendation 1:\nLean in with girls and women’s leadership. Our first recommendation proposes specific initiatives that are well positioned for engaging diverse actors, including: women’s groups, technology companies, media partners, transparency and EDUCATION NGO’S and government education.\nplanning departments. These initiatives are envisioned as catalytic “quick wins” that, if given sufficient financial and political support, could be scaled up within a short time period. They also represent an attempt to explore relatively new approaches to tackling the decades-long girls’ education problem. They are also recommended with the notion that while not directly confronting violence and early marriage, they will certainly help empower girls to push back against these forces. It is our assessment that all countries could benefit from leaning in on girls and women’s leadership, as it is fundamental to sustainable social change not only for girls’ educational opportunities but for gender equality more broadly.\nThe two initiatives we recommend are:\nº Recommendation 1.1: Build strong girl leaders. We propose a girls’ leadership initiative that simultaneously provides opportunities for girls to develop the soft skills so crucial for their success as well as provides roles models and networks that help shift social perceptions and norms around girls’ education and gender equality. We propose a mentorship model be used with either teachers or recent secondary school girl graduates and that the initiative be scaled up with diverse partners starting in countries where girls’ education is the most behind.\nº Recommendation 1.2: Girl-generated data. We propose a girl-generated big data initiative, which would combine the power of “factivists and feminists” (Drummond, 2015). Girl-generated data has the potential to radically change the power dynamics, with girls themselves generating regular information about their circumstances, needs, and achievements that is translated into digestible and timely insight for policymakers, civil society actors, community leaders, and educators. Transparency and accountability take on whole new meanings in this light and ultimately puts the girls at the center of the process.\nA girl generated big data initiative also can go a long way in helping fill the data gap on girls’ education, both on basic education data that we have seen is often missing in many countries, but also more importantly on sensitive issues such as school-related gender-based violence and child marriage. We propose a model where technology firms would partner with civil society and governments to collect, analyze, and disseminate this girl-generated data to those actors who can make the changes needed to improve girls’ lives.\n• Recommendation 2:\nFocus on systemic reform with a gender lens. Ultimately, the best approach for helping girls get educated is to ensure governments have strong education systems, ones that enable all children to access good schools and quality learning opportunities. Good schools must be in places where girls and boys alike are given the opportunity to thrive and grow. Developing an education system where good schools are a reality, including for marginalized girls, necessitates systemic reform in many of the countries where girls are behind. In support of systemic reform we propose:\nº Recommendation 2.1:\nDesign for education hotspots. We recommend that international donors and multilateral institutions focus increased attention on hotspot countries, in particular in countries stuck in an education bog where girls’ education progress has stalled. This includes both ensuring aid dollars flow to those countries and that the dollars go toward shoring up basic education and gender equality, including in humanitarian contexts. Governments must also do their part and employ strategies for including girls in education progress. This could include defraying costs, supporting great teachers, or improving teaching and learning materials. Teacher organizations also have a role to play. Global capacity can be deployed to help the professional development of teachers across countries where girls are farthest behind.\nº Recommendation 2.2:\nFocus with a gender lens. Countries themselves, and their regional and global partners, must ensure they undertake systemic reforms with a gender lens. This means all decisions around things such as policy, budgets, hiring, and monitoring must be evaluated with the understanding of their differential impacts on girls versus boys. Gender analysis tools should be systematically used in the development of education sector plans. Applying a gender lens to the process of sector plan development—including sector analysis, plan preparation, and plan appraisal—can ensure that that the key tools for national education system reform and associated policies and strategies promote effective actions that advance gender equality.\nWhile made separately and with distinct purposes in mind, these two recommendations are also mutually reinforcing. Improved girls’ and women’s leadership, and boosting the availability of relevant data generated, can provide an important feedback loop for governments either for planning or monitoring purposes. Likewise, government reforms can open up space for girls’ and women’s leadership, serving to both help such leadership flourish and reap its outcomes in terms of improved girls’ education opportunities. Ultimately, we hope that these two recommendations, and the specific initiatives made within each, are translated into action and together with the wide range of other strategies actors are pursuing can make a difference to girls, their learning opportunities, and ultimately their ability to be successful in their lives and livelihoods.\nEducation and gender indicators: Bogs, traps and ceilings EDUCATION INDICATORS\nGender parity education not reached in Africa\nCAMEROON, GHANA, KENYA, MORROCCO, MOZAMBIQUE, ZAMBIA*\nCountries below the enrollment mean in Africa: ANGOLA, BENIN REPUBLIC, BURKINA FASO, BURUNDI, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, CHAD, COTE d’IVOIRE, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO*, DJIBOUTI, ETHIOPIA, GUINEA, GUINEA-BISSAU, LIBERIA, MALAWI, MALI, NIGER,**NIGERIA**, SIERRA LEONE, SOUTH SUDAN, TOGO, UGANDA, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritania.\nGender parity in net enrollment rates in Africa\nBotswana, Namibia, Sao Tome & Principe, Senegal, Tanzania, Zimbabwe\nCountries below the enrollment mean:\nGender inequality in math achievement\nAlgeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tunisia.\nfor more reading pls click on the following links:']	['<urn:uuid:43a32c84-d4b0-414f-8c07-60828bdb127b>', '<urn:uuid:d1bcbe8f-cd93-4788-9066-1e05447dc32b>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	14	139	2544
39	I keep getting sick at my factory job and noticed I feel better on weekends. How can I tell if my breathing problems are from work or just regular pneumonia, and what should I document for my doctor?	Lung cancer and pneumonia share similar symptoms, including cough, darker mucus, shortness of breath, fatigue, loss of appetite, and chest pain during breathing. However, pneumonia typically includes additional cold-like symptoms such as fever, chills, and headaches. To help your doctor determine the cause, you should document: when symptoms first appeared, how often they occur, time of day symptoms are worse, whether you feel better on certain days, and how symptoms relate to work. Keep a written record of your shift hours, work days, and days off. Also, obtain copies of material safety data sheets (MSDSs) from your workplace listing the materials you're exposed to, as these are required by law and can help your doctor make an accurate diagnosis.	"['Discover hundreds of clinical trials for virtually all types of cancer.\nAt the Henry Ford Cancer Institute, we provide compassionate, expert care. We’ll guide you and your family through the process, including diagnosis, treatment and follow-up care as a survivor.\nOur team of doctors, surgeons, interventional pulmonologists, radiation and medical oncologists and nurses will make sure you have all the information and support you need. However, at any point during your journey of care, you may have some questions – some of which come up more frequently than others, so we’ve compiled a list of frequently asked questions and answers to get you started.\nLung Cancer Basics\nLung Cancer Symptoms and Diagnosis\nLung Cancer Treatment\nThere are two major types of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer.\nSmall cell lung cancer tends to grow quicker than non-small cell lung cancer and, as such, is often far more aggressive. Because of the rate at which small cell lung cancer metastasizes, it is usually diagnosed after it has spread outside of the lungs.\nSmoking causes the majority of lung cancers, in both smokers and those exposed to secondhand smoke, but it does not cause all cases of lung cancer. Individuals who do not smoke or have never been exposed to secondhand smoke can be diagnosed with lung cancer, although, in these cases, the exact cause is not always clear.\nAlthough smoking causes the majority of lung cancers, nearly 20% of people who die from lung cancer in the United States have never smoked or used tobacco products. Sadly, this is enough to rank this population in the top ten most fatal cancers in the U.S., if non-smokers who developed lung cancer had their own category.\nAside from tobacco use or exposure to secondhand smoke, other causes of lung cancer include:\nBe sure to limit your exposure to any of these causes of lung cancer through lifestyle changes, such as testing your home for radon and eliminating any possible hazards in your workplace.\nAside from smoking, tobacco use or secondhand smoke, other risk factors for lung cancer include:\nIf doctors suspect lung cancer, they may order one or more of the following diagnostic tests:\nUnfortunately, you may not notice any signs of lung cancer until the disease is advanced. However, some people with early lung cancer do have symptoms, which may include:\nUsually symptoms of lung cancer don’t appear until the disease is already at an advanced, non-curable stage, which makes early detection difficult. However, Henry Ford’s Lung Cancer Screening Clinic uses computed tomography (CT) scans to identify potential lung cancer as early as possible in current or former smokers.\nIn order to determine the best and most effective treatment options, your doctor must first determine which stage your lung cancer is in. To do so, your doctor may administer staging tests, such as computerized tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and bone scans, each of which allow your doctor to determine the location and extent to which your lung cancer may have spread.\nAlthough they are two separate conditions, lung cancer and pneumonia can often present with similar symptoms, causing some patients to be initially treated for pneumonia before further imaging tests reveal an underlying cancer.\nSome of the shared symptoms between lung cancer and pneumonia include a cough, darker mucus, shortness of breath, low energy or fatigue, a loss of appetite, and pains in your chest that are worsened by respiration. Pneumonia will also present with more cold-like symptoms, such as fever, chills and headaches.\nIf your primary physician has diagnosed you with pneumonia, it is important to complete all medication as prescribed. Should your symptoms persist it is important to follow up with your primary care provider to reevaluate your treatment. At this time, your physician may recommend more advanced imaging to rule out any other underlying conditions including cancer.\nAlthough there currently are not any blood tests available that can detect lung cancer with certainty, Henry Ford Health System has participated in tumor sampling research to assist in the development of future lab tests and better understand how to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors to determine overall risk factors.\nAlthough lung cancer can technically be cured, it is very rare and can only occur in very specific circumstances, such as individuals who have stage 1A lung cancer with no vascular invasion.\nHowever, lung cancer can be treated and managed in a variety of ways, especially given recent advancements in modern medicine and oncology. Although there is always a chance that lung cancer can recur, the longer someone lives without evidence of cancer the lower the likelihood that it will come back.\nOur thoracic cancer team, along with specialists from the Henry Ford Center for Lung Health, cares for more than 500 lung cancer patients every year. A team of specialists discusses each individual case then develops a treatment plan specific to their health, needs and priorities. Dependent upon which stage the lung cancer is in at diagnosis, treatment may include:\nA common side effect of lung cancer surgery is shortness of breath and, dependent upon the extent of the surgery, lung health prior to surgery and time needed for chest wall to heal, it may linger. However, certain steps can be taken to minimize any shortness of breath that follows lung cancer surgery, including:\nAn important factor when considering lung cancer surgery is the patient’s quality of life, both before and after the procedure. Although a successful surgery can be one of the most effective treatments for lung cancer, it is important to be aware of what may lie ahead. Outside of the physical side effects of lung cancer surgery such as shortness of breath, pain or pneumonia, patients have reported emotional side effects such as stress, fear, worry or anger, all of which are normal responses to a life-altering event. For those who find themselves seeking assistance or guidance following lung cancer surgery, Henry Ford offers support services to help cope with any issues or concerns you may have.\nWhile many cases of lung cancer are considered ‘inoperable,’ that does not mean that treatment or long-term survival is no longer an option. It is important to remember that inoperable simply means that lung cancer surgery is not currently the best treatment option. However, chemotherapy and radiation therapy could reduce the size or location of the tumor, which could allow lung cancer surgery to become an option.\nFactors that would qualify lung cancer as inoperable include:\nThe chances of lung cancer recurring is dependent upon several factors, including the original treatment strategy, the type of lung cancer, and the stage at which it was diagnosed. While most instances of lung cancer recurrence are in the first five years post-diagnosis, there is, unfortunately, always a risk of recurrence. Dependent upon where the recurrence occurs, there are several ways to define it:\nIf you are having an emergency, call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room.

Workers who smoke are at a much greater risk of lung disease if they are exposed to substances in the workplace that can cause lung disease. Poor ventilation, closed-in working areas and heat increase the risk of disease. Outside air pollution also can increase the risk of lung disease in people who work in jobs that expose them to substances that can cause lung disease.\nWhat substances in the workplace can cause lung disease?\nMany substances found in the workplace can cause breathing problems or lung damage. Some of them include the following:\n- Dust from such things as wood, cotton, coal, asbestos, silica and talc. Dust from cereal grains, coffee, pesticides, drug or enzyme powders, metals and fiberglass can also hurt your lungs.\n- Fumes from metals that are heated and cooled quickly. This process results in fine, solid particles being carried in the air. Examples of jobs that involve exposure to fumes from metals and other substances that are heated and cooled quickly include welding, smelting, furnace work, pottery making, plastics manufacture and rubber operations.\n- Smoke from burning organic materials. Smoke can contain a variety of particles, gases and vapors, depending on what substance is being burned. Firefighters are at an increased risk.\n- Gases such as formaldehyde, ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide, ozone and nitrogen oxides. These are associated with jobs where chemical reactions occur and in jobs with high heat operations, such as welding, brazing, smelting, oven drying and furnace work.\n- Vapors, which are a form of gas given off by all liquids. Vapors, such as those given off by solvents, usually irritate the nose and throat first, before they affect the lungs.\n- Mists or sprays from paints, lacquers (such as varnish), hair spray, pesticides, cleaning products, acids, oils and solvents (such as turpentine).\nWhat kinds of breathing problems can occur following exposure to such substances?\nSome substances can cause you to have upper respiratory irritation or irritation of your nose and/or throat with cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose and scratchy throat.\nViral infections and allergies produce similar symptoms. You should become suspicious of a work-related illness if your nose and throat are often irritated and breathing problems seem to occur when you are at work. Breathing in substances at work can also increase your risk of developing bronchitis, flu-like symptoms, asthma or emphysema.\nA person who has bronchitis has a persistent cough that produces mucus or sputum and lasts at least 3 months to a year. Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of bronchitis, but workplace toxins can also play a role.\nIf you notice that you often have what seems to be the flu, your illness may be caused by something you are exposed to at work. The following are some work-related lung diseases that can make you feel as though you have the flu:\n- Allergic alveolitis (also known as ""farmer\'s lung"") can occur after excessive exposure to moldy hay.\n- Metal fume fever occurs from inhalation of metal vapors, such as in welding and other metallic operations.\n- Polymer fume fever can occur after breathing the fumes of polymers, such as Teflon.\nA worker who has one of these conditions develops breathing problems, cough, fever, muscle aches and general malaise (a feeling of being tired and having no energy) 4 to 6 hours after exposure to the substance. If such symptoms occur again and again when you are at work, this is a clue that your illness may be related to your work.\nIf you develop asthma for the first time as an adult, the illness could be related to something you are exposed to at work. Asthma symptoms include wheezing, chest tightness, a persistent dry cough or trouble breathing.\nEmphysema usually occurs in older people who smoke. However, people who have worked with coal, asbestos or silica dust for 20 years or more can also develop emphysema. They may have a cough, fatigue, chest tightness and difficulty breathing.\nWhat should I do if I think something in the air at work is making me sick?\nVisit your doctor if you think the air at work is making you sick. Your doctor will probably ask you to provide some of the following information:\n- When your symptoms first appeared\n- How often you have symptoms\n- The time of day that the symptoms are worse\n- Whether you feel better on some days\n- How you think your symptoms relate to work\n- What types of materials you come in contact with at work\nYou may find it helpful to keep a written record of these things to share with your doctor. Be sure to make a note of your shift or work hours, the days of the week you work and the days of the week you are off work. Try to recall previous jobs, hobbies and smoking habits -- anything that might have affected your lungs. If your doctor has sent you an occupational health history form, fill it out as completely as possible.\nYour doctor may find it helpful to know all of the ingredients listed on the containers of materials you use in the workplace. Make a list of these ingredients and write down any precautions and first-aid measures that are printed on the label.\nAsk your employer for copies of the material safety data sheets (MSDSs) at your workplace. These are information sheets about the products that you use in the workplace. All employers are required by law to complete these forms, and you have a right to see them. Bring them with you to your doctor\'s appointment.\nHow can I keep from having my lungs damaged by something I\'m exposed to at work?\nIf you smoke, stop. This is the most important thing you can do for your overall health, regardless of risks at your workplace. Smokers have a greater risk of developing some work-related lung diseases than nonsmokers.\nUse a respirator. A respirator is a device you wear over your mouth and nose that cleans the air before it enters your body. You must be properly fitted and trained to use a respirator. Over time you should be refitted and retrained in how to use it. The respirator must be carefully cleaned after each use and it should be checked to ensure that it works properly. Use a respirator as a temporary measure until you are no longer exposed to the damaging substance.\nIf you are exposed to damaging substances at work, talk to your supervisor about the need for adequate ventilation and new procedures to reduce or eliminate your exposure. A change in ingredients, work practices or machinery can reduce hazards in the air. Ventilation systems can remove pollutants and toxins from the air to reduce exposure and prevent buildup. Local exhaust ventilation can be used to remove polluted air at the point where it is generated by a hazardous process or machine. At some jobs, people can be separated from the hazardous materials.\nWritten by familydoctor.org editorial staff']"	['<urn:uuid:906770b1-527f-464e-9fec-86957910d45e>', '<urn:uuid:e2b1daf7-dea9-4f15-b153-2a00db2732a7>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	38	119	2476
40	26s proteasome structure and components	The 26S proteasome has a molecular mass of about 2,000 kDa and contains one 20S protein subunit and two 19S regulatory cap subunits. The 20S core is a hollow barrel-shaped cylinder composed of four stacked rings providing catalytic degradation activity. The 19S component is divided into a 'base' subunit with six ATPases and two non-ATPases, and a 'lid' subunit composed of eight stoichiometric proteins.	['The ubiquitin/26S proteasome system plays an essential role in regulating host defenses against pathogens. analysis determined a subunit from the 26S proteasome called RPN3 could connect to RSV NS3. Transient overexpression of RPN3 got no influence on the RNA RGS12 silencing suppressor activity of RSV NS3. Nevertheless NS3 could inhibit the power of SBPH (RSV) one of the most damaging pathogens of grain production continues to be responsible for many epidemics because it was first referred to in Japan in 1897 (1 -3).

RNAs 2 3 and 4 are ambisense and each includes two open up reading structures (ORFs) with one in the viral RNA strand (vRNA) and the next in the viral cRNA strand (vcRNA) (6). RSV vRNA 2 encodes a membrane-associated proteins that reportedly can be an RNA silencing suppressor and interacts with suppressor of gene silencing 3 (SGS3) (7). vcRNA 2 encodes a glycoprotein (NSvc2) which when portrayed in insect cells is certainly displayed in the membrane surface area (8). NSvc2 may also focus on the Golgi equipment in plant life via the COP I- and COP II-dependent secretion pathways (9). RSV vRNA 3 encodes a gene-silencing suppressor and features through size-independent and non-cooperative reputation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (10 11 The proteins encoded by vcRNA 3 may be the RSV nucleocapsid (NC) proteins (4). vRNA 4 encodes a disease-specific proteins (SP) that interacts with PsbP an extrinsic proteins connected with photosystem II in Risedronate sodium plant life to enhance pathogen symptoms (12). SP in addition has been shown to try out a critical function in viral pass on in the physiques of insect vectors (13). RSV vcRNA 4 encodes a pathogen movement proteins (MP) involved with cell-to-cell motion and symptom advancement (14 -17). RSV is certainly transovarially sent by the tiny dark brown planthopper (SBPH) within a circulative-propagative way (5).

41	statistical discrimination law enforcement and automated decisions handling bias practice	Statistical discrimination occurs in law enforcement when average group statistics are used to judge individuals, such as racial profiling where minority drivers are pulled over more frequently. In automated decision systems, bias can be handled by analyzing the data basis through outlier analyses, examining dependency changes over time, and plotting variables separated by groups. Simply omitting sensitive information is not sufficient since other variables can be stochastically dependent on sensitive information. Additionally, monitoring models and using Explainable-AI methods like SHAP-values helps uncover hidden biases.	['Our current public policy posts, focused on ethics and bias in current and emerging areas of AI, build on the work “A Survey on Bias and Fairness in Machine Learning” by Ninareh Mehrabi, et al. and resources provided by Barocas, et al. The guest co-author of this series of blog posts on AI and bias is Farhana Faruqe, doctoral student in the George Washington University Human-Technology Collaboration program. We look forward to your comments and suggestions.\nDiscrimination, unfairness, and bias are terms used frequently these days in the context of AI and data science applications that make decisions in the everyday lives of individuals and groups. Machine learning applications depend on datasets that are usually a reflection of our real world in which individuals have intentional and unintentional biases that may cause discrimination and unfair actions. Broadly, fairness is the absence of any prejudice or favoritism towards an individual or a group based on their intrinsic or acquired traits in the context of decision-making.\nToday’s blog post focuses on discrimination, which Ninareh Mehrabi, et al. describe as follows:\nDirect Discrimination: “Direct discrimination happens when protected attributes of individuals explicitly result in non-favorable outcomes toward them.” Some traits like race, color, national origin, religion, sex, family status, disability, marital status, recipient of public assistance, and age are identified as sensitive attributes or protected attributes in the machine learning world. It is not legal to discriminate against these sensitive attributes, which are listed by the FHA and Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA).\nIndirect Discrimination: Even if sensitive or protected attributes are not used against an individual, still indirect discrimination can happen. For example, residential zip code is not categorized as a protected attribute, but from the zip code one may find out about race which is a protected attribute. So, “protected groups or individuals still can get treated unjustly as a result of implicit effects from their protected attributes.”\nDiscrimination. In the nursing profession, the custom is\nto expect a nurse to be a woman. So, excluding qualified male nurses for\nnursing position is an example of systematic discrimination. Systematic\ndiscrimination is defined as “policies, customs, or behaviors that are a part\nof the culture or structure of an organization that may perpetuate\ndiscrimination against certain subgroups of the population”.\nStatistical Discrimination: In law enforcement, racial profiling is an example of statistical discrimination. In this case, minority drivers are pulled over more often than white drivers. The authors define “statistical discrimination is a phenomenon where decision-makers use average group statistics to judge an individual belonging to that group.”\nExplainable Discrimination: In some cases, “discrimination can be explained using attributes” like working hours and education, which is legal and acceptable as well. In a widely used dataset in the fairness domain, males on average have a higher annual income than females because on average females work fewer hours per week than males do. Decisions made without considering working hours could lead to discrimination.\nUnexplainable Discrimination: This type of discrimination is not legal as explainable discrimination because “the discrimination toward a group is unjustified”. Some researchers have introduced techniques during data preprocessing and training to remove unexplainable discrimination.\nTo understand bias in techniques such as machine learning, we will discuss in our next blog post another important aspect: fairness.', 'AI is used to automate more and more decisions. With applications like credit scoring, application screening, fraud detection that impact many lives, avoiding any type of discrimination is key from both ethical and legal perspectives.\nIn its AI strategy, the German government has paid explicit attention to the issue of bias in the context of the use of AI processes. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) also states that in automated decisions, discriminatory effects based on racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religion or belief, trade union membership, genetic or health status, or sexual orientation (sensitive information) must be prevented.\nDecisions can be biased regardless of their source. However, decisions from algorithms are more traceable than human-made decisions. This allows developers to make biases more visible and ensure fairness. Bias can be defined as systematic and repeatable errors in any decision system. It can either lead to a degradation of decision quality or to unfair or discriminating results like favoring an arbitrary user group. While the avoidance of bias to improve model quality is well established, the ethical use of AI is an active research topic.\nBias can have several sources: the data selection, the target variable (label), the developers, and the model itself.\nAI systems do not have a natural understanding of the objectivity of the data being processed. If a bias is present in the data, it will be adopted by the model. Algorithms are written by humans who are naturally biased. Additionally, the method used may have a bias, for example, if it is inappropriate for application to the specific problem.\nFor example, in the allocation of public housing, bias could have these causes:\nData selection: There used to be fewer single fathers, so they are underrepresented in the data. Their requests are not handled correctly.\nLabels: The allocation process has changed in the past. Therefore, historical data does not represent the current allocation process. The model quality decreases.\nDeveloper(s): The developer does not have children and therefore does not sufficiently consider information on family size.\nAlgorithm: The relationship between target and input variables is too complex for the model used (underfitting). This can be circumvented by using more complex models.\nHandling Bias in Practice\nOptimizing fairness in models often contradicts optimizing model quality. Therefore, awareness of bias and a definition of fairness is an essential task in each project since a model can be fair by one definition and unfair by another. Only then can the decision process be analyzed for bias and fairness.\nBias in data can be detected and corrected by analyzing the data basis. This includes outlier analyses, changes in dependencies in the data over time, or simply plotting variables separated into suitable groups, e.g., the target variable distribution for all genders.\nTo build a fair model, it is not enough to omit sensitive information as input variables because other influence variables can be stochastically dependent on sensitive information.\nA reference dataset allows further analysis of fairness. The ideal reference data\nThere are specialized libraries (e.g., AIF360, fairlearn) designed to compute fairness measures and thereby detect biases in models. These assume that the dataset used contains sensitive information. They also provide methods to reduce bias.\nError analysis of the model outputs allows one to find data samples where the model has difficulty. This often helps to find underrepresented groups and can be done by looking at samples where the model has chosen the wrong class with a high degree of confidence.\nDuring the model life cycle, it is important to monitor the model and allow users to retrace the reasons for model decisions. This works approximately for more complex models through Explainable-AI methods such as SHAP-values and helps to uncover convoluted biases (real example: discrimination against candidates from minority communities by using the length of commute in hiring decisions).\nIf the training data is not sufficiently close to data seen in production, additional data can be collected and incorporated into the model. If this is impossible, upsampling, data augmentation, or downsampling can be used to create a better representation.\nNot every bias is bad: By deliberately introducing a counter-bias, a known bias can be counteracted. For example, in automatic applicant screening, an underrepresented minority could receive bonus points in the scoring if a minimum representation quota is to be met in the future.\nAnalyzing for bias, especially discrimination, is not only ethically and legally required when automated decisions affect people. In practice, doing so often generates many additional insights that improve performance, transparency, and monitoring quality and thus the overall decision process, even if performance and fairness are contradicting objectives in theory. Lastly, in case things get serious, it also helps in court.\nLudwig Brummer is a Senior Data Scientist and team lead at Alexander Thamm GmbH since 2015. He implemented a variety of use cases in energy, insurance, mechanical engineering, and banking such as credit scoring, automated claim settlement, or maintenance automation. For him, decision automation is an opportunity to make decisions not only faster and cheaper but also fairer for all users.\nPlease note: The opinions expressed in Industry Insights published by dotmagazine are the author’s own and do not reflect the view of the publisher, eco – Association of the Internet Industry.']	['<urn:uuid:bf98f023-44f6-44bc-9038-1e55cdd22961>', '<urn:uuid:baabd164-1e10-46ff-8c87-2453a5d973c2>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	10	84	1417
42	What unique challenges do all-vertical-piled wharves face in deep water?	All-vertical-piled wharves in deep water have longer vibration periods than traditional inshore high-piled wharves, and these periods are much closer to the period of the loading wave. They show evident dynamic amplification when wave dynamic load effects are considered. Due to these characteristics, dynamic calculation and analysis must be conducted when designing and calculating their characteristics.	['Display Mode： |\nMarine structures are mostly made of metals and always experience complex random loading during their service periods. The fatigue crack growth behaviors of metal materials have been proved from laboratory tests to be sensitive to the loading sequence encountered. In order to take account of the loading sequence effect, fatigue life prediction should be based on fatigue crack propagation (FCP) theory rather than the currently used cumulative fatigue damage (CFD) theory. A unified fatigue life prediction (UFLP) method for marine structures has been proposed by the authors’ group. In order to apply the UFLP method for newly designed structures, authorities such as the classification societies should provide a standardized load-time history (SLH) such as the TWIST and FALSTAFF sequences for transport and fighter aircraft. This paper mainly aims at proposing a procedure to generate the SLHs for marine structures based on a short-term loading sample and to provide an illustration on how to use the presented SLH to a typical tubular T-joint in an offshore platform based on the UFLP method.\nJacket cutting operation is one of the most complicated and highest risk operations in the process of decommissioning offshore piled platform, the security and stability of which must be assured. In this paper, the current research on offshore structure removal and jacket cutting is introduced, on the basis of which the types of load along with the load calculation method are determined. The main influences on the stability of a jacket in cutting are analyzed. The experiment test plan is drawn by using orthogonal testing method, and the formula of critical load during the cutting procedure is deduced by differential evolution algorithm. To verify the method and results of this paper, an offshore piled platform to be decommissioned in the South China Sea is taken for an example, and the detailed schedule for jacket cutting is made with the three-dimensional finite element model of the jacket established. The natural frequency, stress, strain and stability of the jacket during cutting process are calculated, which indicates that the results of finite element analysis agree well with that of the deduced formula. The result provides the scientific reference for guaranteeing the safety of jacket in cutting operation.\nImpulse turbine, working as a typical self-rectifying turbine, is recently utilized for the oscillating water column (OWC) wave energy converters, which can rotate in the same direction under the bi-directional air flows. A numerical model established in Fluent is validated by the corresponding experimental results. The flow fields, pressure distribution and dimensionless evaluating coefficients can be calculated and analyzed. Effects of the rotor solidity varying with the change of blade number are investigated and the suitable solidity value is recommended for different flow coefficients.\nLaboratory tests were conducted on a flexible riser with and without helical strakes. The aim of the present work is to further understand the response performance of the vortex induced vibration (VIV) for a riser with helical strakes. The experiment was accomplished in the towing tank and the relative current was simulated by towing a flexible riser in one direction. Based on the modal analysis method, the displacement responses can be obtained by the measured strain. The strakes with different heights are analyzed here, and the response parameters like strain response and displacement response are studied. The experimental results show that the in-line (IL) response is as important as the cross-flow (CF) response, however, many industrial analysis methods usually ignore the IL response due to VIV. The results also indicate that the response characteristics of a bare riser can be quite distinct from that of a riser with helical strakes, and the response performance depends on the geometry on the helical strakes closely. The fatigue damage is further discussed and the results show that the fatigue damage in the CF direction is of the same order as that in the IL direction for the bare riser. However, for the riser with helical strakes, the fatigue damage in the CF direction is much smaller than that in the IL direction.\nSteel catenary riser (SCR) is the transmission device between the seabed and the floating production facilities. As developments move into deeper water, the fatigue life of the riser can become critical to the whole production system, especially due to the vortex-induced vibration (VIV), which is the key factor to operational longevity. As a result, experimental investigation about VIV of the riser was performed in a large plane pool which is 60 m long, 36 m wide and 6.5 m deep. Experiments were developed to study the influence of current speed and seabed on VIV of SCR. The results show that amplitudes of strain and response frequencies increase with the current speed both in cross-flow (CF) and in-line (IL). When the current speed is high, multi-mode response is observed in the VIV motion. The amplitudes of strain in IL direction are not much smaller than those in CF direction. The seabed has influence on the response frequencies of riser and the positions of damage for riser.\nThere has been a growing trend in the development of offshore deep-water ports in China. For such deep sea projects, all-vertical-piled wharves are suitable structures and generally located in open waters, greatly affected by wave action. Currently, no systematic studies or simplified numerical methods are available for deriving the dynamic characteristics and dynamic responses of all-vertical-piled wharves under wave cyclic loads. In this article, we compare the dynamic characteristics of an all-vertical-piled wharf with those of a traditional inshore high-piled wharf through numerical analysis; our research reveals that the vibration period of an all-vertical-piled wharf under cyclic loading is longer than that of an inshore high-piled wharf and is much closer to the period of the loading wave. Therefore, dynamic calculation and analysis should be conducted when designing and calculating the characteristics of an all-vertical-piled wharf. We establish a dynamic finite element model to examine the dynamic response of an all-vertical-piled wharf under wave cyclic loads and compare the results with those under wave equivalent static load; the comparison indicates that dynamic amplification of the structure is evident when the wave dynamic load effect is taken into account. Furthermore, a simplified dynamic numerical method for calculating the dynamic response of an all-vertical-piled wharf is established based on the P-Y curve. Compared with finite element analysis, the simplified method is more convenient to use and applicable to large structural deformation while considering the soil non-linearity. We confirmed that the simplified method has acceptable accuracy and can be used in engineering applications.\nThe stability of the horizontal multidrain wells is a crucial issue and several factors are involved in this matter, including in-situ stresses, magnitude and distribution as well as the mainbore trajectories. In this paper, this issue is evaluated by assuming different circumstances for the above mentioned factors, based on finite difference three-dimensional modeling by using the finite difference numerical software, FLAC3D. The stability of the mainbore and lateral branches is analyzed based on the Normalized Yielded Zone Area (NYZA) criterion, i.e. the ratio of the surrounding yielded cross-sectional area to the initial area of the well. Optimum mud pressures are obtained in the mainbore and lateral branches in different mainbore trajectories under three in-situ stress regimes. In addition, the stability of the junction where the lateral branches are bifurcated from the mainbore is assessed in those situations. The optimum trajectory of the mainbore, in which the junction has obtained the most stable condition, is selected in each stress regime. It was concluded that in the Normal Faulting (NF) stress regime, the mainbore and junction stability varies in relation to the mainbore trajectories, inversely. However, in the other two stress regimes, i.e. Strike Slip (SS) and Reverse Faulting (RF), the variations of the mainbore and junction stability are in the same trend with respect to the mainbore trajectory deviations.\nA fully automated optimization process is provided for the design of ducted propellers under open water conditions, including 3D geometry modeling, meshing, optimization algorithm and CFD analysis techniques. The developed process allows the direct integration of a RANSE solver in the design stage. A practical ducted propeller design case study is carried out for validation. Numerical simulations and open water tests are fulfilled and proved that the optimum ducted propeller improves hydrodynamic performance as predicted.\nThe observations on compressibility of reconstituted clays show that the compression line with a higher initial water content lies above the compression line with a lower initial water content for a given clay. Hence there exists additional void ratio due to initial water contents among virgin compression lines (VCLs) of reconstituted clays. In this paper, the difference in void ratio caused by different initial water contents is investigated based on the empirical equation proposed by Liu and Carter (2000) for describing the differential void ratio at the same stress between natural and reconstituted clays. The mechanism of compressibility of reconstituted clays, when the stress level is larger than the remolded yield stress, is also discussed.\nIt is difficult to compute far-field waves in a relative large area by using one wave generation model when a large calculation domain is needed because of large dimensions of the waterway and long distance of the required computing points. Variation of waterway bathymetry and nonlinearity in the far field cannot be included in a ship fixed process either. A coupled method combining a wave generation model and wave propagation model is then used in this paper to simulate the wash waves generated by the passing ship. A NURBS-based higher order panel method is adopted as the stationary wave generation model; a wave spectrum method and Boussinesq-type equation wave model are used as the wave propagation model for the constant water depth condition and variable water depth condition, respectively. The waves calculated by the NURBS-based higher order panel method in the near field are used as the input for the wave spectrum method and the Boussinesq-type equation wave model to obtain the far-field waves. With this approach it is possible to simulate the ship wash waves including the effects of water depth and waterway bathymetry. Parts of the calculated results are validated experimentally, and the agreement is demonstrated. The effects of ship wash waves on the moored ship are discussed by using a diffraction theory method. The results indicate that the prediction of the ship induced waves by coupling models is feasible.\nThis paper describes the design, construction and preliminary test results for a gas-tight serial sampler intended to be deployed at seafloor for long-term operation to take time-series fluid samples from deep-sea environments such as cold seeps, water column and hydrothermal vents. The serial sampler is a modular system that is based on independent and identical sampling modules, which are designed to collect six 160 ml gas-tight fluid samples maintained at high pressure to a depth of 4000 meters. With two working modes, the sampler can be deployed either with seafloor cabled observatory for remote control or as a stand-alone device for autonomous operation. A prototype of the instrument has been constructed and tested on the MARS cabled observatory for two months. The laboratory and field tests proved the success of the design and construction of the serial sampler, and indicated the potential for future ocean sciences.\nScholarOne Manuscripts Log In\n- Volume 34\n- Issue 1\n- February 2020\n- Superintended by:\nCHINA ASSOCIATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\n- Sponsored by:\nChinese Ocean Engineering Society （COES）\n- Edited by:\nNanjing Hydraulic Research Institute\nAdaptive Predictive Inverse Control of Offshore Jacket Platform Based on Rough Neural Network\nNumerical Simulation of Water Exchange Characteristics of the Jiaozhou Bay Based on A Three-Dimensional Lagrangian Model\nA Global Reliability Assessment Method on Aging Offshore Platforms with Corrosion and Cracks']	['<urn:uuid:30ae66c8-0def-48ba-98cd-6c33ad517284>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	10	56	1951
43	temperature humidity effects preservation wood storage	Temperature and humidity affect both preservation and wood storage in critical ways. For preservation of collections, cool and dry conditions with less than 65% relative humidity are essential to reduce mold growth and slow aging. For wood storage, these environmental factors influence the wood's Equilibrium Moisture Content (EMC) - when humidity rises, wood absorbs moisture and expands; when it falls, wood releases moisture and shrinks, potentially causing problems like cupping, crowning, and splitting.	['Preservation is the systematic application of principles that prolong the life of all collections materials—analog and digital. The Smithsonian Institution Archives has diverse material types, from paper documents, photographs, audio and video recordings, and films, to contemporary holdings such as websites and social media sites. Every staff member at the Archives takes responsibility for preservation of collections, but the Collections Care and Electronic Records programs create and implement policies and standards for the preservation of non-digital and digital collections alike. These standards, as well as helpful outside preservation resources, are outlined below.\nSeven basic preservation principles can be applied to home collections, as well as museum, archives, and library collections:\n- Preservation Management: Includes policies, assessments, prioritization systems, allocation of resources, and emergency and disaster planning.\n- Environmental Control: Includes external temperature and humidity controls, integrated pest management, housing of collections at the shelf, box, and folder level.\n- Collections Maintenance: Includes routine preservation actions such as rehousing, and handling, loan, and access policies.\n- Reformatting and Duplication: Includes digitization, preservation photocopying, and microfilm.\n- Conservation Treatment: Includes documentation, and hands-on treatment of selected artifacts.\n- Conservation Research: Includes materials characterization and treatment development.\n- Preservation Training: Includes outreach programs, development of bibliographies, and workshops.\nThe Archives follows closely the recommendations set forth in Smithsonian Directive 600 Collection Management Implementation Manual. The Archives is responsible for the Smithsonian’s policy on the storage and handling of cellulose nitrate film.\nIn order to reasonably allocate funds and resources to collections, the Archives has a comprehensive assessment program for paper-based collections and descriptor for the preservation module. The assessment allows the Archives to prioritize which collections should be examined more closely for improved storage, reformatting, or conservation treatment. The methodology has similarities to the survey tool described in the American Institute for Conservation’s “An ‘Angel Project’ of Dinosaur Proportions,” but has been modified to be more efficient.\nElectronic records are also assessed according to criteria. The Electronic Records program at the Archives follows best practices and standards that include evaluating risks to digital formats within the records.\nEmergency Planning, Response, and Recovery\nThe Archives has a comprehensive emergency plan that covers staff safety and the safety of collections. It is reviewed and revised every two years. It covers major activities before, during, and after an emergency, and lists detailed information in the following categories:\n- Prevention and Detection\n- Emergency Alerts and Evacuations from the Archives\n- Emergency Personnel\n- Post-emergency Assessments\nIn addition, the Archives distributes “Emergency Alert” to staff every six months—a shorter document that outlines the specific actions to take during an emergency, ranging from fire alarms to “shelter-in-place,” and lists telephone numbers in a staff phone tree.\nTemperature and Humidity\nThe first and most important step in preserving any collection is to ensure that the temperature and humidity meets or exceeds standards. Cool and dry (less than 65 percent relative humidity to reduce possibility of mold or accelerated aging) is the best rule of thumb.\nPreservation Enclosures and Formats\nGood quality boxes and enclosures are important to preserve documents and photographs. The Archives follows standards developed by the Library of Congress for boxes and folders. The Archives also maintains a list of selected vendors for preservation supplies.\nGood quality materials are related to electronic records through the use of accepted preservation formats. The Archives relies on preservation file formats that are not dependent on a specific software application or operating system, meaning that formats are open and widely accepted whenever possible. Quality assurance steps include virus scans and file verification. All files are stored on secure servers that are regularly backed up and multiple copies are created on tapes that are housed onsite and offsite. Collections are migrated to new formats and storage as necessary.\nThe guidelines and procedures outlined in the Archives’ “Handling Guidelines” provide general best practices, and are helpful in maintaining Archives collections.\nPreservation problems, such as acidic papers, are helped by into new boxes, removing damaging attachments (like staples), and making sure that the collections don’t slump. The National Archives and Records Administration has an illustrated guide to holdings maintenance.\nReformatting and Duplication\nReformatting is a preservation strategy to create duplicate copies of records. A record may be duplicated to minimize handling of the original, to increase access or both. This can be done through techniques such as microfilming, photocopying, or digitization. Reformatting efforts should be cost effective and provide excellent copies so that an original is rarely if ever re-imaged.\n- Smithsonian Institution Archives, Digitization Standards for Images\n- Library of Congress, Photocopying Guidelines\n- American Institute for Conservation\n- Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts\n- Library of Congress Preservation Directorate\n- National Archives and Records Administration, Preservation and Archives Professionals\n- Northeast Document Conservation Center', 'EMC: Time, Temperature, Relative Humidity\nWhat Does EMC Stand for and What is EMC?\nEquilibrium Moisture Content, or EMC, is the point at which wood is at the same moisture level as its environment so that it no longer releases or absorbs moisture. EMC is a balancing act between the wood and its ambient conditions–raise the relative humidity (RH) and the wood will absorb moisture from the air; lower it and the wood will release moisture into the air.\nWhy does it matter? Since wood has a hygroscopic (moisture-interactive) relationship with its environment, changes in the wood’s moisture content (MC) will also cause corresponding changes to the wood’s physical dimensions. When wood absorbs moisture, the wood cells expand to accommodate the extra moisture. When it releases moisture, it will decrease in dimension.\nIf these changes occur after a wood floor has been installed, these dimensional changes may only cause some seasonal gaps, but they may also lead to a host of more problematic symptoms like cupping, crowning, splitting, gaps and more.\nPut simply (very simply), the two environmental factors that influence EMC are temperature and the RH of the surrounding air in the space where the wood flooring will be installed. (The exact EMC formula includes a number of variables developed by researching the absorption rate of non-living wood and EMC tables or EMC calculators, like the free Wagner Meters Wood App. Take these variables into account when calculating EMC.)\nThere are a number of recommendations for each job site, but always follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for proper acclimation procedures:\n– The place where the flooring will be installed should have adequate ventilation, and HVAC systems and any humidifiers that are part of the design should be operational for 5-7 days prior to delivering the wood flooring. All other materials, like concrete or plaster, should also be dry before bringing the wood flooring on site.\n– Your flooring must be exposed to these conditions in order to acclimate. Open the packaging and if possible stack the flooring boards with thin strips between them to allow air circulation to all the floorboards.\n– As you stack, measure the wood flooring with a wood moisture meter (we recommend pinless moisture meters for damage-free accuracy) and determine the EMC for your area and season using an EMC table or calculator.\nIt is also often a good idea to have a thermo-hygrometer on site to establish that the site conditions are also stable.\nAmbient RH, or the water vapor in the air surrounding the flooring, actually has the greatest impact on wood MC. As was mentioned, wood is a hygroscopic material that readily absorbs and releases moisture. Higher RH means more water vapor to be absorbed by the wood until it reaches a stable level with the surrounding air.\nHowever, if the air has a lower RH than the wood’s MC, the wood will release moisture into the air. It’s helpful to know which way your wood’s MC will be moving in order to establish EMC.\nTemperature is significant to wood MC mostly because of how it impacts the RH of air. If lowering or raising the temperature significantly impacts the RH on the job site, reaching EMC will take much longer to achieve.\nFree Download – 6 Reasons Your Wood Project Failed\nPut Time on Your Side\nFrom this point on, the key to successfully adapting wood flooring to each job site is actually time. Why?\nIf any of these moisture changes happen too quickly, wood may warp, split, twist or buckle as the different faces of the wood absorb moisture at varying rates. For example, end grains will absorb moisture more quickly because the wood has been cut across the wood cells, creating a structure that looks like bundled drinking straws.\nWhile some manufacturers will recommend a number of days to reach EMC, the only way to be completely confident the flooring has reached EMC is with an accurate wood moisture meter. Our damage-free wood moisture meters offer a simple, easy-to-use accuracy that does not mar the flooring.\nWith specific gravity settings for both domestic and exotic kinds of wood, our pinless wood moisture meters have the ability to “scan” many board feet quickly for instant verification of the wood’s progress towards EMC. Once the wood’s MC has stabilized, you can install with complete confidence that the wood flooring will remain durable and beautiful for years to come.\nAs wood moves towards EMC on any new site, temperature and RH will determine the amount of moisture that must be absorbed or released, but time becomes the critical component between finding the right moisture balance and having moisture-related flooring problems.\nTony Morgan is a senior technician for Wagner Meters, where he serves on a team for product testing, development, and also customer service and training for moisture measurement products. Along with 19 years field experience for a number of electronics companies, Tony holds a B.A. in Management and his AAS in Electronics Technology.\nLast updated on May 4th, 2021']	['<urn:uuid:763f65a0-dda5-4e90-a5cd-1ba7efabcef1>', '<urn:uuid:37b1d7ec-a51b-4903-af67-5de8278a008f>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	6	73	1630

Forex transactions always involve two currencies e.g. Euro and US dollar or EUR/USD, called currency pairs. The quotation EUR/USD = 1.1500 means that one euro is exchanged for 1.1500 U.S. dollars. In this case, EUR is the base currency and USD is the quote currency (counter currency). This means that 1 euro can be exchanged for 1.15 U.S. dollars. Another way of looking at this is that it will cost you $115 to buy EUR 100.\nMajor Currency Pairs:\n- EUR/USD (Euro-zone/ United States)\n- USD/JPY (United States/ Japan)\n- GBP/USD (United Kingdom/ United States)\n- USD/CHF (United States/ Switzerland)\n- USD/CAD (United States/ Canada)\n- AUD/USD (Australia/ United States)\n- NZD/USD (New Zealand/ United States)\nSpot Forex was only traded in specific amounts called lots, or basically the number of currency units you will buy or sell. In most currency pairs, 1 lot represents 100,000 units of one of the currencies, usually the second currency. For example, 1 lot of EUR/USD equals $100,000. Luckily, almost all Forex brokers allow clients to trade in quantities as small as 0.01 lots (1 micro lot, equaling $1,000), as well as offering leverage, which means you don’t need to deposit $100,000 or even $1,000 to make a trade.\nThe two different prices that you see quoted on your trading platform for each currency pair are the respective Bid and Ask (or Sell and Buy) prices available for that pair, the difference between these two prices is known as the spread. The Bid is the price on the left, this is the price at which you can sell a given currency pair and is the lower of the two prices listed. The Ask is the price on the right, it’s the price at which you can buy a given currency pair and is the higher of the two prices listed.\nA pip stands for percentage in point is known to be the smallest numerical price move in the exchange market. It is usually the last decimal place of a quotation. As most currency pairs are priced to 4 decimals places ($0.0001) the smallest change would be to the last number after the decimal point.\nSpread is the difference between the Bid and Ask prices. In the case of the USD/CAD forex quote mentioned 1.0180/83, the spread is .0003, often expressed as ""3 pips"".\nLeverage is defined as the ratio of the amount of capital used in a transaction to the required margin. In other words, leverage gives you the ability to control much larger dollar amounts in a trade with only a relatively small deposit (your margin). For example, to control a $100,000 position, broker will set aside $1,000 from the account. The leverage, which is expressed in ratios, is now 100:1.\nMargin can be thought of as a good faith deposit required to maintain open positions. This is not a fee or a transaction cost, it is simply a portion of your account equity set aside and allocated as a margin deposit.\nA stop loss is an order which give the Forex broker to exit the trade when it has reached a certain maximum loss.

45	type 1 diabetes early warning indicators	Early symptoms of type 1 diabetes develop over a short period after most beta cells are destroyed, though the immune process begins years earlier. Initial signs include increased thirst and urination, constant hunger, weight loss, and blurred vision. Children may experience severe fatigue. Type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells, triggered by genetic factors and environmental factors like viruses.	"['What are the symptoms of diabetes in women? Diabetes can have different effects on men and women. Learn all about the symptoms of diabetes experienced by women with this article, including how the disease may affect pregnancy and the menopause. This MNT Knowledge Center article will also look at gestational diabetes and the risk factors involved. Read now\nThey may need to take medications in order to keep glucose levels within a healthy range. Medications for type 2 diabetes are usually taken by mouth in the form of tablets and should always be taken around meal times and as prescribed by the doctor. However, if blood glucose is not controlled by oral medications, a doctor may recommend insulin injections.\nThough it may be transient, untreated GDM can damage the health of the fetus or mother. Risks to the baby include macrosomia (high birth weight), congenital heart and central nervous system abnormalities, and skeletal muscle malformations. Increased levels of insulin in a fetus\'s blood may inhibit fetal surfactant production and cause infant respiratory distress syndrome. A high blood bilirubin level may result from red blood cell destruction. In severe cases, perinatal death may occur, most commonly as a result of poor placental perfusion due to vascular impairment. Labor induction may be indicated with decreased placental function. A caesarean section may be performed if there is marked fetal distress or an increased risk of injury associated with macrosomia, such as shoulder dystocia.\nGlycated hemoglobin (A1C) test. This blood test indicates your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months. It measures the percentage of blood sugar attached to hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. The higher your blood sugar levels, the more hemoglobin you\'ll have with sugar attached. An A1C level of 6.5 percent or higher on two separate tests indicates you have diabetes. A result between 5.7 and 6.4 percent is considered prediabetes, which indicates a high risk of developing diabetes. Normal levels are below 5.7 percent.\nReduce Your Carbohydrate Intake: One of the most important components involved in a diabetes diet is knowing how to eat a modified carbohydrate diet. Carbohydrates are the nutrient that impacts blood sugars the most. Carbohydrates are found in starches, fruit, some vegetables like potatoes, sweets, and grains. Eating the right kinds of carbohydrate in the right quantities can help you manage your weight and your blood sugars. Knowing how to identify and count carbohydrates is very important in managing diabetes. Eating a consistent carbohydrate diet is ideal because it can help you body regulate blood sugars.\nType 1 diabetes occurs when your immune system, the body’s system for fighting infection, attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. Scientists think type 1 diabetes is caused by genes and environmental factors, such as viruses, that might trigger the disease. Studies such as TrialNet are working to pinpoint causes of type 1 diabetes and possible ways to prevent or slow the disease.\nType 2 diabetes, the most common type of diabetes, is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes mainly from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose get into your cells to be used for energy. In type 2 diabetes, your body doesn’t make enough insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Too much glucose then stays in your blood, and not enough reaches your cells.\nJump up ^ Palmer, Suetonia C.; Mavridis, Dimitris; Nicolucci, Antonio; Johnson, David W.; Tonelli, Marcello; Craig, Jonathan C.; Maggo, Jasjot; Gray, Vanessa; De Berardis, Giorgia; Ruospo, Marinella; Natale, Patrizia; Saglimbene, Valeria; Badve, Sunil V.; Cho, Yeoungjee; Nadeau-Fredette, Annie-Claire; Burke, Michael; Faruque, Labib; Lloyd, Anita; Ahmad, Nasreen; Liu, Yuanchen; Tiv, Sophanny; Wiebe, Natasha; Strippoli, Giovanni F.M.

Yes, science has begun to uncover the roots of this disease, unearthing a complex interplay of genes and environment—and a lot more unanswered questions. Meanwhile, there\'s plenty of misinformation to go around. (How often have you had to explain that diabetes doesn\'t happen because someone ""ate too much""?)\nThe term ""diabetes"" or ""to pass through"" was first used in 230 BCE by the Greek Apollonius of Memphis. The disease was considered rare during the time of the Roman empire, with Galen commenting he had only seen two cases during his career. This is possibly due to the diet and lifestyle of the ancients, or because the clinical symptoms were observed during the advanced stage of the disease. Galen named the disease ""diarrhea of the urine"" (diarrhea urinosa).\nThe genes identified so far in people with type 2 include many that affect the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas, says Craig Hanis, PhD, a professor at the Human Genetics Center at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston. And yet he emphasizes that why people get type 2 isn\'t at all clear yet: ""What it tells us is that diabetes is a complicated disease.""\nSince diabetes can be life-threatening if not properly managed, patients should not attempt to treat this condition without medicial supervision. A variety of alternative therapies can be helpful in managing the symptoms of diabetes and supporting patients with the disease. Acupuncture can help relieve the pain associated with diabetic neuropathy by stimulation of cetain points. A qualified practitioner should be consulted. Herbal remedies also may be helpful in managing diabetes. Although there is no herbal substitute for insulin, some herbs may help adjust blood sugar levels or manage other diabetic symptoms. Some options include:\nA 2018 study suggested that three types should be abandoned as too simplistic. It classified diabetes into five subgroups, with what is typically described as type 1 and autoimmune late-onset diabetes categorized as one group, whereas type 2 encompasses four categories. This is hoped to improve diabetes treatment by tailoring it more specifically to the subgroups.\nType 1 diabetes mellitus is predominantly a disease of the young, usually developing before 20 years of age. Overall, type I DM makes up approximately 15% of all cases of diabetes. It develops in approximately 1 in 600 children and is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. The incidence is relatively low for children under the age of 5, increases between 5 and 15, and then tapers off.\nIf you’re getting a good night’s rest but still find yourself so tired you can barely function, it’s definitely worth mentioning to your doctor. Diabetes often wreaks havoc on a person’s normal blood sugar levels, causing fatigue in the process. In later stages, the tissue death associated with untreated diabetes can also limit circulation, meaning oxygenated blood isn’t being effectively transported to your vital organs, making your body work harder and tiring you out along the way.\nThe term brittle diabetes has been used to refer to people who have dramatic recurrent swings in blood glucose levels, often for no apparent reason. However, this term is no longer used. People with type 1 diabetes may have more frequent swings in blood glucose levels because insulin production is completely absent. Infection, delayed movement of food through the stomach, and other hormonal disorders may also contribute to blood glucose swings. In all people who have difficulty controlling blood glucose, doctors look for other disorders that might be causing the problem and also give people additional education on how to monitor diabetes and take their drugs.\nWeight loss surgery in those with obesity and type two diabetes is often an effective measure. Many are able to maintain normal blood sugar levels with little or no medications following surgery and long-term mortality is decreased. There is, however, a short-term mortality risk of less than 1% from the surgery. The body mass index cutoffs for when surgery is appropriate are not yet clear. It is recommended that this option be considered in those who are unable to get both their weight and blood sugar under control.\nOlder people may have a difficult time adding exercise to their daily life, particularly if they have not been active or if they have a disorder that limits their movement, such as arthritis. However, they may be able to add exercise to their usual routine. For example, they can walk instead of drive or climb the stairs instead of take the elevator. Also, many community organizations offer exercise programs designed for older people.\n""We know that there is a very large genetic component,"" Rettinger says. ""A person with a first-degree relative with Type 2 diabetes has a five to 10 time higher risk of developing diabetes than a person the same age and weight without a family history of Type 2 diabetes."" Heredity actually plays a larger role in Type 2 diabetes than Type 1, Rettinger says.\nExposure to certain viral infections (mumps and Coxsackie viruses) or other environmental toxins may serve to trigger abnormal antibody responses that cause damage to the pancreas cells where insulin is made. Some of the antibodies seen in type 1 diabetes include anti-islet cell antibodies, anti-insulin antibodies and anti-glutamic decarboxylase antibodies. These antibodies can be detected in the majority of patients, and may help determine which individuals are at risk for developing type 1 diabetes.\nNerve damage (neuropathy). Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish your nerves, especially in the legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Poorly controlled blood sugar can eventually cause you to lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves that control digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, erectile dysfunction may be an issue.\nType 1 diabetes is considered an autoimmune disease. With an autoimmune disease, your immune system – which helps protect your body from getting sick – is engaged in too little or too much activity. In Type 1 diabetes, beta cells, which are a kind of cell in the pancreas that produces insulin, are destroyed. Our bodies use insulin to take the sugar from carbohydrates we eat and create fuel. With Type 1 diabetes, your body does not produce insulin, and that\'s why you need to use insulin as part of your treatment.\nHypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia or “insulin shock” is a common concern in DM management. It typically develops when a diabetic patient takes his or her normal dose of insulin without eating normally. As a result, the administered insulin can push the blood sugar to potentially dangerously low levels. Initially the patient may experience, sweating, nervousness, hunger and weakness. If the hypoglycemic patient is not promptly given sugar (sugar, cola, cake icing), he or she may lose consciousness and even lapse into coma. Questions and Answers about Diabetes and Your Mouth Q: If I have diabetes, will I develop the oral complications that were mentioned? A: It depends. There is a two-way relationship between your oral health and how well your blood sugar is controlled (glycemic control). Poor control of your blood sugar increases your risk of developing the multitude of complications associated with diabetes, including oral complications. Conversely, poor oral health interferes with proper glucose stabilization. Indeed, recent research has shown that diabetic patients who improve their oral health experience a modest improvement in their blood sugar levels. In essence, “Healthy mouths mean healthy bodies.” Q: What are the complications of diabetes therapy that can impact my oral health? A: One of the most worrisome urgent complications associated with diabetes management is the previously described hypoglycemia or insulin shock. In addition, many of the medications prescribed to treat diabetes and its complications, such as hypertension and heart disease, may induce adverse side effects affecting the mouth. Common side effects include dry mouth, taste aberrations, and mouth sores. Q: I have type-2 diabetes. Are my dental problems different than those experienced by people with type-1 diabetes? A: No. All patients with diabetes are at increased risk for the development of dental disease. What is different is that type-2 disease tends to progress more slowly than type-1 disease. Thus, most type-2 diabetes patients are diagnosed later in life, a time in which they are likely to already have existing dental problems. Remember, there is no dental disease unique to diabetes. Uncontrolled or poorly controlled diabetes simply compromises your body’s ability to control the existing disease.\nThe levels of glucose in the blood vary normally throughout the day. They rise after a meal and return to pre-meal levels within about 2 hours after eating. Once the levels of glucose in the blood return to premeal levels, insulin production decreases. The variation in blood glucose levels is usually within a narrow range, about 70 to 110 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) of blood in healthy people. If people eat a large amount of carbohydrates, the levels may increase more. People older than 65 years tend to have slightly higher levels, especially after eating.\nCardiovascular Medicine Book Dentistry Book Dermatology Book Emergency Medicine Book Endocrinology Book Gastroenterology Book Geriatric Medicine Book Gynecology Book Hematology and Oncology Book Human Immunodeficiency Virus Book Infectious Disease Book Jokes Book Mental Health Book Neonatology Book Nephrology Book Neurology Book Obstetrics Book Ophthalmology Book Orthopedics Book Otolaryngology Book Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Book Pediatrics Book Pharmacology Book Practice Management Book Prevention Book Pulmonology Book Radiology Book Rheumatology Book Sports Medicine Book Surgery Book Urology Book\nDiabetes is a condition in which the body cannot properly store and use fuel for energy. The body\'s main fuel is a form of sugar called glucose, which comes from food (after it has been broken down). Glucose enters the blood and is used by cells for energy. To use glucose, the body needs a hormone called insulin that\'s made by the pancreas. Insulin is important because it allows glucose to leave the blood and enter the body\'s cells.\nHow does high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) feel? To maintain the right amount of blood sugar, the body needs insulin, a hormone that delivers this sugar to the cells. When insulin is lacking, blood sugar builds up. We describe symptoms of high blood sugar, including fatigue, weight loss, and frequent urination. Learn who is at risk and when to see a doctor here. Read now\nThe major eye complication of diabetes is called diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy occurs in patients who have had diabetes for at least five years. Diseased small blood vessels in the back of the eye cause the leakage of protein and blood in the retina. Disease in these blood vessels also causes the formation of small aneurysms (microaneurysms), and new but brittle blood vessels (neovascularization). Spontaneous bleeding from the new and brittle blood vessels can lead to retinal scarring and retinal detachment, thus impairing vision.\nThe most common test used to diagnose diabetes is the fasting blood glucose. This test measures the glucose levels at a specific moment in time (normal is 80-110 mg/dl). In managing diabetes, the goal is to normalize blood glucose levels. It is generally accepted that by maintaining normalized blood glucose levels, one may delay or even prevent some of the complications associated with diabetes. Measures to manage diabetes include behavioral modification (proper diet, exercise) and drug therapies (oral hypoglycemics, insulin replacement). The choice of therapy prescribed takes into consideration the type and severity of the disease present and patient compliance. The physician may request the patient keep a log of their daily blood glucose measurements, in an effort to better assess therapeutic success. Another commonly obtained test is the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), which is a surrogate marker used to assess blood glucose levels over an extended period (2-3 months). This test provides the physician with a good picture of the patient’s glucose levels over time.\nGiven the diverse peculiarities involving the issue, studies have shown that Diabetes mellitus has been extensively investigated in its pathophysiological aspects, highlighting the search for strong evidence that can be used in the clinical practice of the Primary Care nurse, with attributions focused on health promotion, prevention of complications, treatment and rehabilitation of the health of individuals and community, carried out in an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary manner (Matumoto, Fortuna, Kawata, Mishima, & Pereira, 2011; Florianopolis, 2015).\nIs it your fault for getting type 2 diabetes? No – type 2 diabetes is not a personal failing. It develops through a combination of factors that are still being uncovered and better understood. Lifestyle (food, exercise, stress, sleep) certainly plays a major role, but genetics play a significant role as well. Type 2 diabetes is often described in the media as a result of being overweight, but the relationship is not that simple. Many overweight individuals never get type 2, and some people with type 2 were never overweight, (although obesity is probably an underlying cause of insulin resistance). To make matters worse, when someone gains weight (for whatever reason), the body makes it extremely difficult to lose the new weight and keep it off. If it were just a matter of choice or a bit of willpower, we would probably all be skinny. At its core, type 2 involves two physiological issues: resistance to the insulin made by the person’s beta cells and too little insulin production relative to the amount one needs.\nYour doctor will check your blood glucose levels, and if you are diagnosed with diabetes, your doctor will guide you on a plan to keep your blood sugar levels normal. If your diabetes is mild, your doctor will likely recommend a diet plan, exercise, and weight loss. Your doctor may prescribe medications that help reduce blood sugar levels. In some women, insulin may be necessary.', 'Wednesday, October 17, 2012\nSymptoms. The immunologic process that leads to type 1 diabetes can begin years before the symptoms of type 1 diabetes develop. Symptoms become apparent when most of the beta-cell population is destroyed and usually develop over a short period of time. Early symptoms, which are mainly due to hyperglycemia, include increased thirst and urination, constant hunger, weight loss, and blurred vision. Children also may feel very tired.

Early symptoms, which are mainly due to hyperglycemia, include increased thirst and urination, constant hunger, weight loss, and blurred vision. Children also may feel very tired.\nRisk Factors. A combination of genetic and environmental factors put people at increased risk for type 1 diabetes. Researchers are working to identify these factors so that targeted treatments can be designed to stop the autoimmune process that destroys the pancreatic beta-cells.\nCo-morbidities. Children with type 1 diabetes are at risk for the long-term complications of diabetes. Autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease and autoimmune thyroiditis are also associated with type 1 diabetes.\nManagement. The basic elements of type 1 diabetes management are insulin administration (either by injection or insulin pump), nutrition management, physical activity, blood glucose testing, the avoidance of severe hypoglycemia, and the avoidance of prolonged hyperglycemia or DKA. Algorithms are used for insulin dosing based on blood glucose level and food intake.\nOverview of Diabetes in Children and AdolescentsDiabetes mellitus is a group of diseases characterized by high levels of glucose in the blood resulting from defects in insulin production, insulin action, or both. Diabetes is associated with serious complications and premature death, but timely diagnosis and treatment of diabetes can prevent or delay the onset of long-term complications (damage to the cardiovascular system, kidneys, eyes, nerves, blood vessels, skin, gums, and teeth). New management strategies are helping children with diabetes live long and healthy lives. Type 1 diabetes in U.S. children and adolescents is increasing (1) and more new cases of type 2 diabetes are being reported in young people. The American Diabetes Association provides helpful guidance in consensus statements for managing children with type 1 diabetes (2) and type 2 diabetes (3). To update primary care providers and their staff about this evolving area of diabetes care, the NDEP has developed this overview of current statistics and care recommendations.\nStatisticsDiabetes is one of the most common diseases in school-aged children. According to the 2011 National Diabetes Fact Sheet, about 215,000 young people in the US under age 20 had diabetes in 2010. This represents 0.26 percent of all people in this age group. (4) Based on data from 2002 to 2005, the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study reported that approximately 15,600 US youth less than 20 years of age were diagnosed annually with type 1 diabetes, while 3,600 were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. (5) Type 2 diabetes was rare in children younger than 10 years of age, regardless of race or ethnicity. In youth aged 10 to 19 years, type 2 diabetes became increasingly common, especially in minority populations such as American Indians, African Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, Asians and Pacific Islanders. Among non-Hispanic white youth aged 10 to19 years, the rate of new cases was higher for type 1 than for type 2 diabetes. For Asian/Pacific Islander and American Indian youth aged 10–19 years, the opposite was true—the rate of new cases was greater for type 2 than for type 1 diabetes. Among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic youth aged 10 to19 years, the rates of new cases of type 1 and type 2 diabetes were similar.

46	As a technology consultant, I'm curious about cloud computing in surveying - what are the benefits it brings to modern surveying work, and what security challenges does it pose?	Cloud computing allows surveyors to share high volumes of spatial data online securely with multiple parties and work from anywhere at any time. The technology enables scalable solutions that replace expensive equipment and slow processing speeds, allowing surveyors to work remotely while maintaining data safety. However, these same benefits come with security risks. The virtualization technology that enables rapid deployment could lead to data breaches since physical servers are split into virtual machines. Additionally, while cloud providers typically encrypt data in transit, stored data may not be secure, and if the third-party service is compromised, the data could be vulnerable. To protect against these risks, businesses need robust security measures including end-to-end encryption, secure data transfers using SSL, and local data backups.	['Surveyors play a hugely important role in shaping Wollongong’s future. Whether in the field or in the office, they use cutting-edge technology to create accurate measurements.\nAdvancements in GPS, robotics and drone technology have made surveying much easier than it used to be. This means that field crews are smaller and work more efficiently than ever.\nPlanning and Design\nSurveyors are responsible for planning and designing the physical infrastructure that shapes our world. They work with GPS, electronic theodolites, levels, aerial photographs and satellite imagery to gather and process data about land and natural resources.\nModern technology has made it possible for surveyors to work from anywhere at any time. With the rise of cloud computing, surveyors can easily share high volumes of spatial data online securely with multiple parties.\nRather than relying on expensive, clunky equipment and slow data processing speeds, surveyors can now use cloud solutions that scale up quickly to meet their needs. These solutions allow them to work from home and ensure the safety of their information.\nDuring the planning and design phase of a project, it’s important to consider whether engineering works should be mitigated to avoid changes to natural processes or should be exploited to improve the ecological potential of the site. During this phase it is also vital to incorporate market consultation and create possibilities for adaptive management, incremental development and nature inclusive designs.\nSurveyors in Wollongong play a vital role in the development of property and land. They work as part of a multidisciplinary team that includes architects, builders, and civil engineers to ensure new buildings are built in accordance with zoning guidelines and other regulations.\nLand developers purchase empty plots of land and turn them into new residential or commercial properties. These professionals work closely with local government agencies to ensure they build according to strict zoning rules and guidelines, as well as other building codes.\nBefore purchasing a piece of land, investors should determine if it already has existing water and electricity lines, as these can be a crucial factor in the overall development process. Also, they should consult with their local utility companies to learn more about the requirements and processes for installing these lines. In addition, it’s important to research impact fees before purchasing a piece of land. These can vary based on the type of project and are often paid as part of the site permit.\nSurveyors are involved in a wide range of projects around the world. From constructing new buildings to protecting coral reefs, they work hard to ensure the world we live in is safe and livable.\nWollongong has a distinct geography, lying on a narrow coastal plain flanked by the Tasman Sea to the east and a steep sandstone precipice known as the Illawarra Escarpment to the west. The city centre is located about midway between these features and south of it is Lake Illawarra, a large lagoon.\nToday, Wollongong is a centre of heavy industry, including steel production at Port Kembla. In the past it was a base for coal mining.\nA large number of people were drawn to the area by the employment opportunities available at Port Kembla. The city now has a multicultural population, with a significant proportion of the locals born overseas.\nSurveying is a specialised profession that involves using various tools and techniques to measure, plot and record the position of objects and land. It’s an essential element of most construction projects and is used in a wide range of fields from transport and communications to mapping, engineering and the law.\nToday’s surveyors use a variety of technologies including laser scanning, UAV photogrammetry, point clouds, LIDAR and 3D models. These methods allow them to capture existing conditions and deliver digital representations of a site that architects can then build upon.\nBIM, or Building Information Modeling, has also become an increasingly important tool for surveyors to use. It enables them to create data-rich 3D simulations of a project, which can be a powerful tool for design teams and construction trades alike.\nAs an important partner in the design and development process, surveyors should be able to play a greater role in embracing advanced technologies like BIM. This can help them to collaborate with other stakeholders and improve their established practices.', 'There are two sides to every coin, and nowhere is that more evident than on your cloud server. The exact same attributes that make cloud storage servers so cost-effective and convenient also make them much more difficult to secure.\nIn the cloud, maintenance and upgrade management falls entirely to your cloud hosting provider. On one hand, this frees up internal resources, meaning less time (and money) is spent on routine maintenance. On the other hand, you don’t have control over server configurations and upgrades, which could spell trouble where your business security is concerned.\nSimilarly, the same virtualization technology that allows you to rapidly deploy new cloud servers also puts you at risk for data breaches and other cybercriminal events. In cloud computing, physical servers are split into virtual machines, which means other organizations could theoretically access the data stored on them—especially if your provider is lax with security controls.\nThese issues highlight just how diligently business IT support teams must work to secure cloud storage servers and databases. Beating hackers at their own game requires robust, thorough security strategies like those described below.\nEnd-to-end data encryption\nImplementing encryption solutions is one of the most crucial moves you can make to protect your data from leaks and ransomware attacks. Most cloud storage services automatically encrypt data while in transit; however, once that data is saved to your cloud server, there’s no guarantee that it’s secure. And even if a third-party cloud storage service does encrypt the data stored on its servers, the company ultimately holds the key to that information, not you. In other words, if that third party is compromised, your data could go down with it.\nThese facts make a good case for implementing some kind of encryption method before you store data in the cloud, but regardless of whether you use a cloud storage service or have a separate cloud environment, protecting your data with encryption software offers security against brute-force attacks, data leaks and ransomware. Your business IT support provider should be able to help you design an encryption technique for your cloud storage solutions—for instance, at MyITpros, we offer whole-disk encryption for our cloud services.\nSecure data transfers\nKeep in mind that data is not only at risk when it’s sitting on cloud storage servers, it’s also vulnerable when in transit (i.e. while being uploaded, downloaded or moved on your server). Although most cloud service providers encrypt data transfers as a rule, this is not always a given.\nTo ensure data is protected while on the move, make certain that transfers go through secure HTTP access and are encrypted using SSL. Your business IT support provider should be able to help you obtain an SSL certificate and configure your cloud service to use it. You may also want to install HTTPS Everywhere on all devices that connect to your cloud.\nLocal data backups\nThe cloud often lulls business owners into a false sense of security where data integrity is concerned. After all, if one of the main cloud benefits is that your data is backed up automatically, there’s no need to save it locally, right?\nNot necessarily. Hackers know that many businesses don’t save data locally, and they exploit this to their advantage when they launch ransomware attacks. Without local backups, you might feel pressure to surrender large sums of money to get your data back.\nHowever, the FBI recommends that you don’t pay ransoms. Not only is there no guarantee that hackers will play fair and return your data (these are criminals, after all), paying up could brand you as an easy target and make you more likely to be hacked in the future. Backing up your data locally will give you the confidence you need to refute a ransomer’s fee.\nDistributed denial-of-service protections\nYou may already be familiar with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in which a hacker drowns your server, website or application with multiple requests for data, essentially rendering it useless. Cybercriminals have been launching denial-of-service attacks for at least 20 years, but today’s access to bots and IoT devices makes it even easier for hackers to coordinate the attacks through multiple systems, hence the term “distributed.”\nYou can fight back by building multi-layered protections into your networks and systems. Using web application firewalls, intrusion protection systems (IPS), load balancers and other tools, you’ll be able to better detect and prevent DDoS attacks and handle high-volume requests that might otherwise paralyze your network. A good managed service provider will be intimately familiar with these controls and able to add them to your infrastructure and servers.\nHackers are constantly at work, which means your IT support provider must be, too. To keep your company’s data, applications, websites and networks secure, you’ll need to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals.\nEssentially, this boils down to identifying system weaknesses before they cost you. You may want to engage your business IT support team in performing a vulnerability assessment, which will involve your provider testing your cloud storage networks to locate weaknesses that may allow hackers in and then developing a plan to address these. Performing these assessments regularly keeps your networks like a shark: always swimming.\nAn unfortunate truth about security threats is that they don’t necessarily come from outside a business. Internal team members with access to sensitive data on the cloud can wreak havoc in their own right, whether they take the form of disgruntled employees stealing confidential data for malicious purposes or negligent personnel accidentally exposing information housed in the cloud.\nRole-based access controls (RBACs) help you regulate the access given to various employees, allowing you to designate which servers and files individual users can open, edit or copy. Administrators can assign roles and privileges to users based on need, authority and the employee’s position within the company. Implementing these controls may also be required to stay compliant with statutory and regulatory requirements for your industry.\nSo what if there are two sides to the cloud computing coin? With the right cloud security controls, the odds will be in your favor every time!']	['<urn:uuid:f3f4c750-eb49-4ea0-b9e6-7e64b7b0cc81>', '<urn:uuid:7485cb1f-5a98-4332-a04e-ffa03d3c8686>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	29	122	1722
47	wfr wilderness first responder wemt emergency medical technician compare	Wilderness First Responder (WFR) and Wilderness Emergency Medical Technician (WEMT) are different levels of wilderness medical training. WFR is an 80-hour course that has become the standard certification for outdoor education and guiding professions, focusing on hands-on scenarios, patient stabilization, and evacuation planning. WEMT is the highest level of wilderness medical training, requiring 170+ hours of training over 4 weeks, combining standard Department of Transportation Emergency Medical Technician curriculum with wilderness-specific medical training. WEMT allows you to practice as both an urban medical professional and in emergency outdoors medicine, making it more comprehensive than WFR.	['A few years ago, I was leading a hiking trip in a national park when one client and a team leader sled down from the park’s tallest sand dune (a common, typically enjoyable activity in the park). But they had way too much speed and landed on a fire ring left by backpackers. We were out of earshot, and watched as the client failed to get up after 10 seconds… 30 seconds… and we knew something was wrong. My co-leader shot down after her, smashing his elbow on the same rocks. From our vantage point high atop the dune, we could barely hear them calling for help. The other three leaders on the ridge quickly made a plan to get down into the basin without injuring anyone else in the group. We were 2.5 miles away from the parking lot (almost 3 hours walking through deep, loose mountains of sand) and out of cell range.\nIt was clear the client had a potential spinal injury and had to be immobilized and transported by six group members rotating carrying her out of the basin via a makeshift litter until a stretcher with sand tires could reach us. My co-leader was in emergency surgery that night for a shattered elbow. In hindsight, we did everything right with the rescue, which was led by two leaders with Wilderness First Responder certifications).\nI, without any advanced medical training, looked at the rest of the clients in our group and thought: “If one of you gets hurt, I don’t know how to keep you safe.” My job became preventing the panicking clients from getting hurt as we made our way to the park entrance.\nI’d never felt so helpless in the wilderness. But I also knew it was in my control to never feel that way again. I took a 10-day course and earned my NOLS Wilderness First Responder certification and recertify it every few years.\nI learned that there are a variety of courses that will teach you how to treat everything from a surface-level abrasion, to a broken femur, to a punctured lung. So, here’s a roundup of the best wilderness medicine courses for hunters, anglers, and outdoor adventurers. Figure out which course is best for your time, budget, and activity level—and then enroll. Remember that wilderness medicine is always evolving, so even if you’ve taken one of these courses in the past, it’s always good to update your skills and knowledge.\nDisclaimer: This guide is not intended to provide medical advice. It’s an overview of standard wilderness medicine curriculum across various certification levels.\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, “Studies show that excitement of sighting a deer can send a hunter’s heart rate soaring. This excitement, combined with strenuous hunting activity, can put a physically unfit hunter at risk of a heart attack.” From the anxiety and excitement of preparing your shot to strenuously dragging a deer from the woods, older, less fit outdoors people can be at risk of cardiovascular problems in the field, even if they’re not venturing far.\nEven if you consider your outdoor activities to be low risk or in the frontcountry, it’s a short class to feel prepared to protect your loved ones. And even if you never have to use your CPR/AED certifications (which hopefully you don’t), having basic first aid knowledge will always come in handy.\n|Adult, child, and infant CPR training with rescue breaths or compression only||Stabilize a patient until emergency medical services arrives|\n|How to use an AED||Determining lack of pulse and/or breathing and the next steps to take|\n|Heimlich maneuver||First aid basics|\nCommitment Level: Under two hours every two years (in-person, online, or hybrid)\nFind a Course\nThrough organizations like the American Heart Association and American Red Cross, you should be able to find a course that fits your location and schedule. It’s also likely that your employer offers some variation of CPR/AED/First Aid. If this course is a requirement for your job, be sure to check if online certifications are valid for your employer.\nWilderness First Aid (WFA)\nThis course could be for you if you’re a frequent frontcountry recreator (car camping, day hikes) looking to gain more confidence and knowledge in wilderness medicine and decision making. Wilderness First Aid builds off your basic first aid skills but applies them to a wilderness setting. The key distinction between urban and wilderness medicine is that in the wilderness, contact time with a patient is greater, the time between onset/injury and definitive care is greater, the environment is less predictable and may exacerbate illness/injury, and rescuers may have to make decisions without outside communication. So, prevention is always the first priority.\n|Wound management||Head injury, spine injury|\n|Patient assessment system and emergency evacuation plans||Epinephrine auto-injector, anaphylaxis|\n|Altered mental status, shock, heat illness, and cold injury||Chest pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath|\nFind a Course\nWilderness First Responder (WFR)\nWilderness First Responder has become the standard of medical certification across many outdoor education and guiding professions. It is far more hands-on and in depth than a WFA certification, and focuses on hands-on scenarios to prepare you for situations you may encounter in the field. You work with complicated situations to identify issues and hazards, stabilize and treat patients to your ability, and make a thorough evacuation plan. This is the course I recommend for anyone taking high-risk or extended trips away from cell signal or easy evacuation.\nSome Key Skills Beyond WFA and CPR/AED\n|Decision making, communicating with Search and Rescue, documentation, and SOAP notes (Summary Objective Assessment Plan)||Soft tissue injury, fracture management and splinting, and dislocations|\n|Chest injuries, cardiac, respiratory, and neurological emergencies||Mental health emergencies and psychological first aid|\n|Lifting and moving patients||In-depth head and spinal cord assessment/stabilization|\nCommitment Level: An initial, approx. 80-hour (fully in-person or hybrid) course with 2-3-year recertification. If you have the time and resources, this is the course I recommend. While a hybrid option can be more realistic for your schedule, the more hands-on practice the better when it comes to skills that could save a life in a critical situation.\nFind a Course\nBecause WFR is a longer commitment with more advanced skills than the courses listed above, enrolling requires little more foresight and potentially some travel.\nWilderness Emergency Medical Technician (WEMT)\nThe WEMT is the highest level of wilderness medical training, and is an intensive, month-long certification program that is also offered on a semester schedule. Through WEMT, you are prepared to both practice as an urban medical professional, as well as in emergency outdoors medicine. It is an approximately 200 hour course. Getting your WEMT certification allows you to advance professionally in wilderness medicine, and if you hold a WFR looking to progress in medicine, such as search and rescue, consider advancing your skills.\nLearn More About WEMT\nOn top of your medical certifications, first aid kit (you’ll learn to build in your wilderness medicine course), and ample food and layers, there are other things you can do to make hiking, hunting, fishing, skiing, biking, and climbing in the backcountry safer so you can have the best experience.\nAmerican Alpine Club Membership\nStarting at a “Partner Membership” of $65-100 a year (student, military, and family discounts available), you receive $7,500 in rescue services, $5,000 in medical expense coverage, and access to their rescue expense reimbursement process. For a membership fee of $250+, you’re covered for a $300,000 rescue benefit.\nCarrying a satellite communication device—like the InReach—is crucial to any backcountry sports or expeditions, specifically when you need to call for a rapid evacuation. With three levels of subscription plans, the InReach comes with two-way text messaging, GPS navigation, whereabouts tracking, weather updates, and can pair with your mobile device. Garmin also makes the InReach Mini if you’re looking for a more compact design.\nKnow before you go. AllTrails, Gaia GPS, and other relevant apps and websites to where you recreate (like 14ers.com for Colorado residents) are crucial for checking trail conditions and making sure you’re on course. Knowing your route and terrain will prepare you for identifying when you’ve gone off course before you encounter something you aren’t prepared for or risk getting lost.\nI keep up my medical certifications so when I go on trips, I can come home with great stories to tell, a sense of accomplishment, and be ready to do it all again. If you know what backcountry safety looks like, you know what situations to avoid, and how to prevent blisters, safety hazards at camp, and dehydration and heat-related illness (to name a few).\nThink about the last close call you had in the woods or on the mountain. If that worst-case scenario had actually transpired, would you have been able to save your friend’s or your client’s life—or save your own? If you’re unsure about that, enroll in one of these courses so that you can approach the next situation with more knowledge, confidence, and training to handle the inherent risks of the outdoors.

48	butterfly habitats ecosystem roles temperature effects	Butterflies play important roles in ecosystems as pollinators, and their presence is determined by food availability, climate conditions, and shelter. Recent climate change has significantly impacted butterfly behavior and characteristics. As UK temperatures increased by 0.6°C between 1870-1970 and 1.5°C in the last 40 years, butterflies are emerging earlier from their chrysalises, changing in size, and expanding into new habitats. For example, in warm summers, some butterflies like the silver-spotted skipper develop larger wings and emerge earlier from their chrysalises, while species previously restricted to southern England are expanding northward as temperatures rise.	"['Biodiversity / Animal\nThe invertebrates have been recognized as providers of “ecosystem services.” They play an important role in maintaining various life processes and are a vital component of GHNP food chains. Other than flying insects, most of the invertebrates have limited powers of dispersal, and are very sensitive to disturbances in their habitats. They can be used as indicators of a healthy ecosystem.\nAmong invertebrates, earthworms, leeches and mollusks have been studied in the Park. During a recent study, 11 species of earthworm were recorded out of which two are restricted to the park. The leech diversity of the Park is confined to three species only (two aquatic and one terrestrial). Researchers have identified 14 species of mollusks, the majority of them being terrestrial. Three species of slugs have also been reported from the Park.\nBy virtue of their vast numbers of both species and individuals, the insects are vital determinants of terrestrial ecological processes in the Park. Their presence is determined by availability of food, suitable climatic conditions, and shelter from disturbance and natural enemies. Insects in GHNP can be broadly classified in three categories:\n1. Vegetation feeders: mainly beetles and plant bugs (many families of these orders feed and depend on plant life).\n2. Pollinators: flies, butterflies, moths and bees: (majority of pollinators belongs to these orders).\n3. Biodiversity indicators: Tiger beetle, ground beetle and dragonflies (also for land use change).\nOnly six insect orders (e.g., beetles, wasps, flies, plant bugs, dragonflies, and butterflies) have been studied in the Park. The selected six orders represented 37 families, 108 genera, and 125 species among the specimens identified so far. Insect research has established ecological relationships between flowering plants of sub-alpine and alpine areas, with their corresponding insect visitors.\nSome Important Insects\nUsually large with very long antennae. The adults are sluggish and live on woody plants. The eggs are laid inside the plant by cutting slits with the help of sharp mandibles. In GHNP, four species have been collected between the elevation from 1,500 to 3,500m\nOccur in many shape and colors. Some are minute or medium-sized, hard, elongate, slightly flat, black, gray, brown, sometimes brilliant metallic. The larvae known as wireworm, are long, cylindrical and slightly flattened. The larvae of many species live in dead wood or under bark of the tree. Five kinds of click-beetles have been recorded between 1,500 to 2,500 m elevation.\nUsually black or brown. Mandibles of males are enormously enlarged and antler like, hence the name Stag-beetle. The larvae breed in wet, decaying wood. Three kinds of stag beetles recorded between the elevation from 1,500 to 2,500m.\nMostly feed on dung of various large herbivore which rolled into convenient-sized ball, then buried in underground chambers and fed at leisure. Maximum representation of species was recorded in this family. Eleven types of dung beetles were seen up to 2,500m elevation in GHNP.\nMinute or small, circular or oval, hemispherical with black, yellow, brown, red, and often spotted. This is a large family with 3,000 species recorded all over the world, it is widely distributed and occurring nearly all year round. During GHNP study, six types of Ladybird-beetles were identified. One species was collected during May over the snow surface at 4,000m altitude.\nMedium-sized, and soft-bodied; mostly black, brown or some times bright metallic-blue or green. The adults feed on flowers. Found between 1,500 to 2,500m elevations, mainly on the flowers of Impatiens.\nFound in open sandy river banks, chiefly in tropical and sub-tropical forests. Recorded between 1,500 to 2,000m\nBlack, brown, yellowish, reddish or metallic-blue color, largely ground living forms, found under stones, bark, in moss, rotten wood.\nIndicators of water bodies because the eggs are dropped into water or on attached to submerged objects in long gelatinous string. Recorded up to 2,500m.\nLoudest singers of the forest; they lay eggs into crevices of bark and incubate for about six weeks. Only one Cicada sp. was recorded from 2,000m elevation in GHNP.\nBees and Wasps\nIn GHNP 44 kinds of butterflies have been recorded. Common blue Apollo resident of alpine areas at about 4,000m elevation in the Tirthan and Sainj valleys of GHNP. Some of the translucent white endangered butterfly of the same genera were also observed above Saketi at 14,000 feet elevation in the Tirthan valley. Yellow swallowtail, a rare butterfly in this area was recorded at about 4,000m in Tirath area of the Tirthan valley.\nCabbage butterfly was common in lower altitude up to 2000m. Dark clouded yellow butterfly, with orange-red and black border found throughout the alpine pasture just after melting of snow, and feed various species of low growing flowers of genus Primula. The Common brimstone, a sulfur colored or greenish yellow butterfly found between the elevation of 1,500 to 2,500 m on the edges of forest openings.\nIndian Moon Moth: beautiful white with pale or bluish green color. Hind wings have long yellow color tail. Sexes are similar but males have more strong feathered antennae and heavy furry body than female. Eyespots and pink crescent shaped marking on hind wing tail are the main characteristics.\nGround color moth, with variations from brown to olive green or orange brown. A brown pale band traverses both the wings. A narrow crescent shaped patch is there in the center of both wings. Antennae of male are strongly feathered.\nRed, black, and brown ringed eyespots on all wings. The wings are brown with light and dark bands, and the edge of the fore wings are suffused with silvery white.\nTriangular forewings with large, pale brown patches towards the base. Female much larger than male. Recorded between 1,500 to 2,000 m.\nSmall with hairy appearance, caused by its long, coarse wing fringes. The fore wings are blackish brown, sprinkled with white scales, while the hind wings are orange colored. Found between 1,500 and 2,000m elevations.\nPale yellow, often mistaken for a butterfly. A small tail-like extension on the hind wing with reddish brown spot at base of hind wing tail are quite distinct. Abundantly recorded between 1,500 to 2,000m.\nVery distinctive streamlined wing shapes and robust bodies. Extremely powerful fliers, some even reaching speed of up to 50 km per hour.\nA total 14 species of Annelida (11 earthworms and 3 leeches) have been recorded. Earthworms are known to be sensitive to change in native vegetation and land use practices and are very reliable bio-indicators for long term monitoring of disturbance and fragmentation of native ecosystems. The local communities have started vermicomposting as a major alternative income generation activity. This may enhance their crop production and reduce their dependencies upon the Park resources.\nAs many as 14 species of both freshwater and terrestrial Mollusca found in GHNP and adjoining ecozone. Their favorite habitats are under large stones, logs, decaying leaves, on wet rocks, tree trunks. They are characterized by low mobility, small populations, patchy and isolated distributions. They get threatened by habitat alterations. Absence of land mollusks may be a good indicator of large scale disturbance of natural vegetation in the area.', ""Butterflies unlocking our climate's secrets\nClimate change is having a dramatic effect on the lives of British butterflies - they are emerging earlier, changing in size and living in new habitats.\nMuseum researchers Steve Brooks and Dr Angela Self used digitised collections to track the changes native butterfly species have experienced over the last 140 years of unprecedented temperature fluctuations in Britain.\nBritish summers are getting warmer and our springs are blooming earlier, often bringing mild temperatures and blue skies as early as February.\nThe complex lifecycles of butterflies rely on delicate balances within the ecosystem, including heat and availability of food.\nTracking their habits can reveal important lessons about the state of the environment.\nAccording to Met Office data, average UK temperatures increased by 0.6°C between 1870 and 1970, and since then have increased even more rapidly, going up by 1.5°C in the last 40 years. This change is in part down to rising levels of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere, which has created a greenhouse effect.\nThe Museum's collections contain data on British butterflies stretching back beyond the nineteenth century - a valuable tool for researchers hoping to uncover long-term trends in our changing ecosystems.\nData at the click of a button\nThis data is now online for the first time thanks to the Museum's iCollections project, meaning Steve Brooks had access to 180,000 butterfly specimens on his desktop.\nWith Dr Phil Fenberg, a colleague at Southampton University, Brooks and Dr Self have been examining the lifecycle, size and distribution of the silver-spotted skipper, a butterfly that is most at home in short chalk grassland in the south of England.\nIt is well-suited to the study of climate change due to its annual reproductive cycle and habitat.\nThe researchers found that in warm summers the butterfly is larger and flies earlier in the year.\nBrooks said: 'Looking at how species respond to temperature is essential for understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of climate change.\n'Our study would not be possible without data from digitized collections paired with monthly temperature records.'\nWhy does temperature matter?\nIt was found that in the years when Britain experienced warm June temperatures, the adult male skippers had larger wings, and in warm Julys both sexes emerged from their chrysalises earlier.\nBrooks said: 'Caterpillars are in their final growing stage in June, so warmer environments could mean they can grow faster and may be getting better quality food.\n'In July the adult butterflies develop in the chrysalis and emerge earlier when it is warmer.\n'And the butterflies are on the wing in August, so warm Augusts mean they could venture further north than before.\n'Our study has shown these three responses to climate change together for the first time in a single species.'\nMore studies are still being done on the other British butterfly species, to find out which are emerging earlier, getting larger and expanding their homes in the north of the country.\nButterflies that were previously restricted to the south of England are expected to expand their range as the climate changes.\nBreaking the rules\nBergmann's rule, named after nineteenth-century German biologist Carl Bergmann, states that as temperatures increase, organisms get smaller.\nThis is because warm temperatures allow the metabolic rate of living things to speed up, meaning they need more food to achieve and maintain large body sizes.\nThe work has demonstrated the silver-spotted skipper goes against this rule, probably because the species produces one generation each year. This means it has longer to grow than species that produce several generations each summer.\nUnderstanding climate change\nBrooks' investigations into the changing lives of butterflies are helping scientists to understand how warmer global temperatures are affecting species in Britain.\nHe said: 'This work would have been impossible without access to the digital collections of British species, allowing us to examine large amounts of data.\n'Changes in butterfly size and habit will help us to understand the wider effects of global climate change on British organisms and ecosystems.'""]"	['<urn:uuid:0bfcf844-381c-4e6c-9283-97aa8cfaea76>', '<urn:uuid:d866495a-0a67-44a7-9e9b-69c3a8dcf5a3>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	6	93	1838
49	How frequently should recrystallization maintenance be performed on different types of stone flooring to keep them in good condition?	For granite floors, maintenance is sufficient once every two years. For marble floors, due to differences in texture, such maintenance is generally needed about every 6 months, though the specific timing depends on the degree of wear on the marble surface.	['The most important and critical step in the construction of the marble floor is the polishing and waxing of the floor. When polishing and waxing the marble cement floor, first use a multifunctional brushing machine with a neutral cleaner or waxing agent to clean the floor. Clean, remove the old wax on the ground, make the stone floor free of debris, dust, and stains. Let’s take a look at the marble floor polishing and waxing construction process.\nWhen waxing the stone floor, the floor must be kept dry. First, use a wax mop to evenly coat the back cover and bottom wax on the floor. The bottom wax should be applied in 3 layers, which can be dried by a blow dryer. After the base wax is dried, use wax to drag two layers of high-speed surface wax on the stone floor, and then air-dry the floor. After the wax surface is dried, use a high-speed polishing machine with a marble polishing pad to perform uniform and uniform polishing.\nPlaning and maintenance of marble floors: waxing and recrystallization\n1. Let me talk about waxing first. Waxing and polishing marble is indeed an effective maintenance method, but there are many disadvantages in this kind of marble maintenance.\n(1) The wax noodles absorb dust, the ground after treatment is prone to a gray feeling, and pedestrians will leave clear footprints afterwards;\n(2) The wax layer closes the pores of the marble, and the moisture inside the marble cannot leak out, causing the marble to appear lesions;\n(3) The wax layer has a soft texture and is susceptible to abrasion, which cannot truly meet the requirements of protecting marble.\n2. Recrystallization treatment. Recrystallization treatment of marble is a popular marble maintenance method. Marble recrystallization is divided into two parts, one part refers to the machine tool part, the other part is the special chemical material part; the chemical material is also There are two types: one is granite recrystallization, the other is marble recrystallization.\nThe basic principle of stone crystallization is to combine some special chemical materials with the structure of the marble surface with the help of the heat generated by mechanical friction to produce a new hard crystal layer. Using these stone recrystallization systems to maintain granite and marble can be Make the marble floor get a bright, fresh and natural effect. It can also improve the abrasion resistance of the marble surface and make it more durable.\nIn general, this kind of maintenance is sufficient for the granite floor once every two years. However, due to the difference in texture of the marble floor, it generally takes about 6 months to do such maintenance, but the specifics also depend on the degree of wear on the marble surface.\nBefore crystallization, the marble needs to be professionally cleaned in order to ensure the construction effect. Practitioners must establish a scientific and rigorous working attitude.\nCleaning tools and materials:\nTools: floor scrubber, nylon brush plate, water suction machine, mop, bucket.\nMaterial used: weak alkali or neutral detergent.\n1. Pour the diluted stone cleaning liquid into the washing machine, move forward from back to front, and walk in a straight line to avoid omissions.\n2. Start the water suction machine at the same time of scrubbing, and absorb the sewage while scrubbing. For areas that cannot be washed by the scrubber, you can use mop foam cleaner to wring out and scrub.\n3. After cleaning with detergent and soaking up the ground sewage, wash it again with clean water in the same way, and then it can be completed by soaking up the water.\n4. Matters needing attention: It is forbidden to use acidic cleaners and powdered cleaners to clean the floor, otherwise it will damage and corrode the marble surface.\n5. Standard: clean and translucent, no stains, no marks.\nDaily marble maintenance method\nWipe the marble regularly with a slightly damp cloth with a mild detergent, and then dry and polish it with a clean soft cloth. If it is difficult to handle the severely worn marble, it can be polished with steel wool or an electric sander, or wiped carefully with a liquid scrubbing agent. You can choose to use lemon juice or vinegar to clean the stains on the marble surface, but it should be paid special attention that the lemon should not stay for more than 2 minutes. Otherwise, the lemon will be absorbed by the marble and cause new stone pollution. Repeat the operation if necessary.\nThen wash and dry. Slight scratches can be protected with a special marble care agent. If it is old or valuable marble, it should be handled by a professional stone maintenance company.\nMethod of polishing cement floor:\nThere are generally three ways to polish the cement floor. The cement floor is waxed and the cement floor is transformed into a permeable floor and cement floor crystallization. The construction methods of these three methods are similar, and they can all have a polishing effect and obtain a good cement floor surface treatment effect.\nCement floor polishing and floor waxing\nFor the new ground with better light collection, you can directly apply the cement floor polishing wax to the ground evenly, and then use a floor polishing machine and a floor polishing pad for polishing. The polishing area should not be too large each time to achieve gloss and no scratches. Only when there are traces can the next area be polished until the waxing and polishing treatment of all the ground is completed. For the old cement floor with wear, dust, pits and cracks, it needs to be ground by a ground grinder. After filling the pits and cracks, waxing and polishing can be carried out. The method is the same as before.\nThe advantages and disadvantages of waxing and polishing cement floors\nAdvantages: convenient and quick construction, obvious effect, waterproof and anti-fouling.\nDisadvantages: the retention time is not long, the anti-slip effect is not good, and it is easy to get dirty after long-term use.\nTransformation of cement floor polishing into permeable floor\nThe method of transforming cement floor polishing into penetration floor:\nFor new cement floors with better light collection, you can directly spray the concrete sealing curing agent on the ground, and then use brushes, hairs, etc. to keep the ground moist for about 1 hour, then clean the ground with water, and then polish it. can. For defective old ground, it is necessary to fill in potholes, cracks, control oil pollution, etc., and then do grinding and polishing treatment before spraying concrete sealing curing agent for the next step of construction.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of cement floor polishing:\nAdvantages: fast and convenient construction, high hardness, good wear resistance, anti-fouling, and long use time.\nDisadvantages: In order to achieve high brightness, it needs to be polished without polishing.\nCrystallization treatment of cement floor polishing\nThe method of crystallization treatment of cement floor polishing: first rough and fine polish the floor with a floor grinder, and then polish the floor. After the floor has a certain luster, dry the floor. Spray the ground crystallizer on the ground of 1 square meter, and use a crystallizer with steel wool and scouring pad to do left and right grinding treatments, until a uniform high-gloss ground appears before moving to the next area. Cycle in this way until the construction area used. Corresponding repairs are required for defective old cement floors.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of crystallization treatment of cement floor polishing:\nAdvantages: high surface hardness, good gloss, anti-fouling, waterproof and abrasion resistance.\nDisadvantages: long construction time and need to be polished.\nThe above is the relevant introduction about the marble floor polishing and waxing construction technology. I believe you will have a simple understanding of this after reading it. If you need it, you can continue to pay attention to us.']	['<urn:uuid:75cf3360-40b4-4f9b-9c65-6e305ded9267>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	19	41	1307
50	I'm planning a vegetable garden and wondering about raised beds. What are the benefits for plant growth and soil management, and how can they help manage salt-related challenges in problematic soils?	Raised beds offer several benefits for plant growth and soil management. They warm quickly and can extend the growing season, especially when covered with hoops or tunnels to protect from frost. They allow customized soil blending - you can create compost-rich humus for squash and melons in one bed, while using sandy humus for root vegetables in another. Watering is more efficient and less wasteful than in conventional gardens, and some kits even come with built-in irrigation systems. Regarding salt management, raised beds can help address problematic soils through proper construction. If there's concern about salt migration through capillary action, you can create a barrier using layers of large rocks, porous weed barrier (filter fabric), pea gravel, and another layer of filter fabric before adding the garden soil. This barrier prevents upward movement of salty water. While salts from irrigation water and fertilizer will eventually accumulate in the beds requiring soil replacement, the barrier will delay salt accumulation from underlying problematic soils.	"['Q. Last year I tried to start a garden on our property for the first time. I hauled some mulch from the landfill and tilled that into the soil. Our garden did not do well. This year I hauled in some horse manure. It took me quite a few years when I lived in Pecos to get the soil nutrient rich enough for a garden and I expect that it will take a few years in this soil. A friend warned me that horse manure can cause some problems. She recommended that I get a soil test and told me that raised beds are a good way to garden in my area. Do you have any recommendations? The soil on our property is caliche and has gypsum. It is similar to what all properties have in that area. Would adding sand from the mountain side to the soil help?\nA. Your plan to try to build your soil is good if there is enough soil above the caliche, and you are probably correct that it will be a multi-year process. The horse manure usually does not have as much salt as cattle manure, but does add additional mineral salts to an already salty soil. Because horses are not ruminants, there will be weed seeds that make it through their systems and into the manure. This will create weeding challenges, but the weeds can be used to build the organic matter level of their soil by tilling them into the soil or composting them. Just do not let the weeds form seeds or develop strong perennial roots. These weeds and legume ""green manure"" crops can help with the development of his garden soil by adding organic matter the soil.\nHowever, while you build the soil for your garden spot, it will be good to build the raised beds that were recommended. This will increase the probability of immediate gardening success. A secondary benefit is that the soil under the raised beds will begin improving with water and acids from the organic matter leaching through the beds into the soil underneath. So, in time, if the caliche is not too severe, those sites may become good garden sites even without raised beds.\nIf the caliche is right on the surface, and there is little soil, then raised beds may be the best short- and long-term solution. Raised beds provide numerous of advantages for gardening in New Mexico.\nIf the soils are extremely salty, there is a possibility that salts may migrate upward by capillary action into raised beds. As water evaporates from the surface of the beds water will be drawn upward from soil below the raised beds. The soil test will tell you if this is a potential problem. If there is a problem, you can create a barrier to upward movement of water and minerals from the salty soil below. This is especially important in salty river valley soils where salts often accumulate. The barrier consists of a bottom layer of large rocks, a layer of porous weed barrier (filter fabric), then a layer of smaller rocks (pea gravel), a layer of filter fabric, and finally the engineered ""good"" soil for the raised bed garden. Air space between the large rocks prevents upward capillary movement of water into the bed from below. Since the capillary water would be carrying salts, this barrier protects the bed from rapid salt accumulation. The soil depth in the bed must be appropriate for the plants being grown, and there may be a ""perched"" water table that forms at the bottom of this soil, so a little extra depth of soil in the raised bed would be good. There will be drainage, but that perched water table will still form where finer textured soils with small pore spaces exist just above the rock layers with larger pore spaces. Water moves less readily from small pore spaces into larger pore spaces, so some water will accumulate in the zone just above the change in soil texture.\nOver time, salts from the irrigation water and fertilizer will accumulate in the raised beds and the soil will need replacing, but the barrier at the bottom will delay the accumulation of salt from capillary water if there is a salt problem in the underlying soil.', 'Would you like to have more garden space with less stooping? How about spending less time doing soil preparation? Or maybe you would just like to have a little hardscaping for visual interest but you don’t want to invest a lot of time and money into construction. Raised bed gardening may be just the thing for you.\nRaised bed gardening involves building frames that can range in height from six inches to 18 inches and filling the frame with good garden soil. Frames can be any length, but most people prefer beds that are four to six feet long, or the length of a standard piece of lumber available at the hardware store.\nBenefits Of Raised Garden Beds\nRaised beds provide a number of benefits. Building a raised bed “pyramid” creates visual interest and increases the square footage available for planting. Second, raised beds can extend the growing season. Soil in raised beds warms quickly, and the bed can be covered with a hoop or tunnel to protect plants when frost threatens in early spring or late fall. Third, raising the level of the soil minimizes the need for bending or kneeling.\nThis makes planting, weeding and harvesting more convenient for individuals with mobility challenges. Fourth, watering and irrigating raised beds is easier and less wasteful than attempting to water the average garden area. Some raised bed kits come with a drip irrigation system or a sprinkler head fitted to the bed.\nFinally, the soil in raised beds can be blended to a gardener’s specifications. One raised bed can be filled with compost-rich humus for squash, melons or salad greens, while another can be filled with sandy humus that is ideal for carrots and other root vegetables. Raised beds increase possibilities for gardeners.\nBuilding Raised Garden Beds\nThe big question, of course, is how difficult is it to build one – or several – raised beds? The answer is that raised beds are very easy to construct, even for someone for whom DIY is a four-letter word.\nDie-hard do it yourselfers can build their raised beds with paver bricks, flat stones or standard 2 x 4s in whatever lengths are desired. The easiest to assemble is a basic “box” made of lumber that would be appropriate for decking; don’t use treated wood, however, because the chemicals used to treat the wood can leach into soil and contaminate edible crops.\nThe depth of the box should be a minimum of 6 inches. Lumber can be stained and sealed or left unfinished. Staining and sealing will extend the life of the fixtures and help keep them weatherproof.\nThese structures will be permanent fixtures in the landscape, so take care that the construction be aesthetically pleasing as well as functional.\nA much easier – and temporary – solution is to purchase a raised bed kit. These kits generally contain artificial lumber boards, corner brackets and anchors for the larger sizes. The brackets are on a stake with a pointed end that slides into the ground and openings that hold the lumber.\nMany of these kits are stackable, creating a significant amount of growing space but using a minimal amount of square footage. These beds assemble and disassemble quickly. Most people break these beds down at the end of every season and store the pieces in a shed or garage.\nHowever the beds are constructed, they need to be filled with soil. This is where the fun begins, because a gardener can create growing conditions in raised beds that would not normally be found in their location. For example, a bed in which herbs are to grow would require a sandy loam that drains easily.\nMidwesterners can grow hardy cacti in a soil mix that is primarily sharp sand. A standard kitchen garden or vegetable bed would need a rich loam; squash, cucumbers and pumpkins need extra manure or mushroom compost added to the soil mix for optimum fertility.\nOnce the soil has been installed, the beds can either be direct seeded or starter plants can be placed into them. Once the plants are placed or the seedlings have emerged, then it’s time to mulch. Raised beds drain more quickly than flat beds, so mulch helps to keep the soil evenly moist during the growing season and it also helps keep weeds to a minimum.\nThe kind of mulch you use depends on the plants in the bed. Tomatoes, for example, benefit from either black or red plastic mulch. Leafy greens or herbs benefit from wood chips or shredded bark, which keep soil cool during hot summers and also keep soil from splashing up onto leaves that will be going into the evening’s salad.\nBed maintenance consists of ensuring the bed is adequately watered, and applying time released fertilizer around plants at the beginning of the growing season, or applying a water-soluble fertilizer once a week. The water-soluble fertilizer can be applied with a watering can, sprayer, with a sprinkler that is focused strictly on the bed or through drip irrigation. \\\nBecause the garden area is contained, less fertilizer can be used throughout the season, as there will be less runoff and waste. Near the end of the season, the beds can be covered with clear plastic tunnels in order to stave off frost damage and extend the growing season. Gardens built in areas of extreme heat (Texas and Arizona come to mind) can be covered with shade cloth during the warmest time of the day to prevent sun scald.\nRaised bed gardening affords greater accessibility for motion-challenged individuals, creates opportunities for more plant diversity, and helps extend the growing season. Raise the standard on your garden this year and try a few raised beds.']"	['<urn:uuid:f704a14c-a48c-4833-a933-1634f4927f6a>', '<urn:uuid:911c5ac9-d268-4fd3-a607-7edc0f5cf5c1>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	31	162	1668
51	How do centrosomes and the cytoskeleton work together in maintaining cell structure, and what happens when these systems malfunction?	Centrosomes serve as major microtubule-organizing centers, comprising a pair of centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar material. The cytoskeleton provides structural support and framework for transport mechanisms. When these systems malfunction, various diseases can occur. Abnormal centrosome structures, such as centrosome amplification, are often observed in cancer cells, while centrosome dysfunction can cause primary microcephaly and ciliopathies. For the cytoskeleton, genetic mutations can result in a weak framework unable to provide adequate cellular support, leading to conditions like progeria where cells have weak nuclei. Additionally, defects in the mitotic spindle are linked to chromosomal instability and tumors.	['Dr Takashi Ochi\nThe centrosome is a major microtubule-organising centre and probably the largest protein assembly having a few hundred-nanometre dimensions and found in animal cells. A centrosome is comprised of a pair of centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar material and centriolar satellites. The centriole has a characteristic 9-fold rotational symmetry, which is created by nine copies of parallelly aligned-microtubule triplets. Centrioles are also essential for generating cilia. Cilia have further extended-microtubule blades from centrioles, which are called basal bodies at cilia. Cilia can be largely classified into motile and non-motile: Motile cilia, which can be found more than one per cell, generated fluid flow in our airway, reproduction system & brain and locomotion for sperm cells. Many unicellular organisms such as green algae also use cilia to swim in fresh water. Non-motile cilia (primary cilia) are present one per cell and mediate intra-cellular signal transductions. Dysfunction of these organelles causes a wide range of diseases including primary microcephaly and ciliopathies. Also, abnormal structures of centrosomes such as centrosome amplification are often observed in cancer cells. The goal of my research is to understand how centrosomes and cilia maintain cellular homeostasis by determining the structures of the organelles using cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography.\nCurrent major projects\n- Biogenesis of accessory structures of the centriole\n- Molecular mechanism of stabilising the structure of the centriole\n- Understanding functions of centrosomal proteins at the atomic level\n- Evolution of XRCC4/SAS6 superfamily in DNA repair and centrosomes\nDetailed research programme\nStructural studies of the centrosome to understand its protein organisation\nCentrosomes are considered to be stable and can be isolated from cells. A number of studies showed structural details of centrosomes using electron and light microscopies. However, we are still far from completely understanding how proteins are assembled to build centrosomes. To resolve this problem, we purify centrosomes and basal bodies from mammalian cells and observe structures of the organelles using cryo-electron tomography. Tomographic reconstruction of centrosomes and basal bodies show that common as well as unique structure features found among different cell types. It is our future challenge to reveal how cell / tissue specific structures are built on the common basis structure of centrosomes and basal bodies, and what functions of unique structures are.\nStructural studies of centrosomal proteins to identify their functional residues\nWe also study the structure of each centrosomal protein to understand how the protein contributes to the structure of centrosomes. The main objective is to identify functional residues of proteins by determining structures of proteins. Since a protein tends to have more than one function, the knockout of a gene that removes multiple functions of a protein sometimes results in complex phenotypes. Protein structures are useful to separate these functions and study them individually in cells. We express recombinant proteins in bacterial or insect cells and use purified proteins to determine their structures using X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. Identified functional residues are verified by making mutant constructs by site-directed mutagenesis and by testing their functions in vitro and in vivo.', 'The cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic network of filamentous proteins that exists in the 3D space to link all regions and components of the cell. All cells, including bacteria, have a cytoskeleton in one form or another. This network is multifunctional, providing structural support to the cell, a framework for active transport mechanisms and a system for the generation and transduction of mechanical force.\nThe cytoskeleton is analogous to both railroad tracks that connect various parts of a city, and also the steel framework of a high-rise building. One enables the directed delivery of passengers or cargo around a city while the other ensures the building will not collapse under its own weight, and can support a dynamic internal environment.\nIn the same way, a cell that does not possess a cytoskeleton would be nothing more than a very soft and fluid collection of organelles. Cells would be unable to support their own weight, let alone that of a tissue or organ, and, would lose essential signaling pathways, motility, cytokinesis, organelle movement, delivery of components; i.e. they would be incapable of carrying out the essential processes that give rise to life\nThe cytoskeleton maintains cellular organization by linking together many cellular components. It mediates communication across the entire cell and therefore has a tremendous impact on cellular functions.\nThere are three main components to the cytoskeleton. These can be considered as unique networks with distinct compositions that possess slightly different yet interdependent functions. They are microfilaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments.\nMicrofilaments are actin polymers of ~7nm width. They form an extensive network throughout the cell and are primarily composed of actin, which is the most abundant protein in cells. Microfilaments are believed to provide protrusive and contractile forces to the cell and assist in cell motility. They have very high compressive strength however actin binding proteins decrease this and allow bending. Microfilaments act as a major signal transducer from the outside environment to the interior of the cell.\nMicrotubules are the largest cytoskeletal element, being 20-25nm in width, and substantially longer than microfilaments. These filaments play important roles in cell communication and cytokinesis. Microtubules are formed through the lateral association of between 12 and 17 tubulin protofilaments, which arrange to form a very stiff and hollow filament structure. Microtubules are also highly dynamic, undergoing rapid cycles of polymerization and depolymerization in a process known as dynamic instability. Microtubules emanate from a microtubule organizing centre (MTOC) where their minus end is embedded and the plus end grows towards the cell periphery. Amongst their most important functions is to ensure that chromosomes are equally distributed amongst the daughter cells. The movement of cilia and flagella is also microtubule dependent.\nIntermediate filaments are the third type of cytoskeletal filament and represent a larger group of filaments that share structural and functional similarities. Five types of intermediate filaments have been described, and although each type is composed of different monomer proteins, their mechanism of assembly is consistent and produces filaments of around 10nm in width. Up to 50 different proteins may be incorporated into intermediate filaments. Intermediate filaments form an elaborate network not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus in the form of lamina. They are highly flexible, yet much more stable than both microfilaments and microtubules. Intermediate filaments have no known role in cell motility however they do provide mechanical stability to cells at regions of cell-cell contacts.\nThe steel framework of many of modern buildings is designed and constructed to survive a multitude of forces. External forces such as wind, or earthquakes, must be withstood, while internal forces such as weight must be distributed evenly throughout the structure. In a similar way the cytoskeleton must withstand the vast range of external and internal forces acting on the cell. Aside from a certain degree of flexibility, the framework within buildings is not a dynamic structure, and this is where the cytoskeleton, being extremely dynamic, differs.\nWith the exception of intermediate filaments, cytoskeletal filaments are constantly undergoing cycles of polymerization and depolymerization. When describing actin filament or microfilament assembly this process is referred as ‘treadmilling’. Microtubules on the other hand undergo a process known as “dynamic instability?.\nUnlike buildings, cells are living entities that are highly dynamic themselves. They are constantly interacting with their environment and responding accordingly. They may change their shape, or the shape of their nucleus, they may commence cell migration, enter a state of rest or undergo the process of programmed cell death. In order to meet with the requirements of the cell, the cytoskeleton needs to be equally dynamic.\nFor example, during cell migration, the cytoskeleton rapidly changes to produce a polarized cell with a “front” or “leading” edge, and a back or “trailing” edge. The rapid development of a microfilament network at the leading edge, in a region known as the lamellipodia, generates protrusive force, and helps the cell to move forward whilst simultaneously retracting the cell from the rear. In another example, during cell division chromosomes must separate and cellular organelles must be redistributed amongst daughter cells. This is followed by a pinching of the cell membrane into two. These processes require a very dynamic cytoskeleton that can rapidly depolymerize to allow old structures to be dissolved and new structures to be formed.\nAdditionally, when mechanical stress is applied to cells, microtubules rapidly reorient themselves and actin stress fibers increase in density in order to reinforce their mechanical strength. Cell processes such as cilia, flagella also move because of the dynamics of the cytoskeleton within.\nCells, like cities, are reliant on the efficient delivery of ‘goods’ or components to specific regions or sites. While cities utilize roads and railway lines for cargo delivery, cells utilize the cytoskeleton for this purpose. Interestingly, the cellular machinery that carries cargo along cytoskeletal filaments is still prone to becoming stuck in traffic, and as such, specific properties of proteins, and even mechanisms, have evolved to ensure cellular components can be transported as efficiently as possible.\nIn some cells where cargo must travel long distances, such as neurons, the passive diffusion of components is not efficient. Not only is it slow, but the gradients of soluble proteins may not be concentrated enough to maintain the supply of components to the process site. The cellular cytoskeleton enables an active delivery of components by providing the ‘tracks’ on which molecular motors can walk. Both the microtubules and microfilaments have specific motor proteins that walk along them. Myosins, for example, walk on microfilaments while dynein and kinesin walk on microtubules. These motors walk in a unidirectional manner and harness the energy released from ATP hydrolysis to undergo conformational changes that propel them forward, essentially in the form of taking a step forward. While one end of the protein holds onto the cytoskeleton, the other end binds to the cargo. This cargo may be contained within endocytic vesicles or synaptic vesicles, or exist as ribosomes or proteins. The cargo is delivered at the end of the filament or whenever the motor detaches from the cytoskeleton. Since this method utilizes energy from ATP, it occurs rapidly, making it more efficient than diffusion alone. However, free or facilitated diffusion along a concentration gradient is important for many cellular processes. Depending on the properties of the diffusing component (e.g. free ions, proteins, lipids), and the lack of an energy requirement, diffusion can be a highly efficient method of intracellular transport.\nThe cytoskeleton acts as the load-bearing network in cells and hence it has a major role in transducing mechanical signals throughout cells. Not only does it act as a bridge between the extracellular environment and the cell interior, but it can transduce signals in a fast and efficient manner. Signal transduction via the diffusion of chemical entities is a much slower process. Signal transduction via the cytoskeleton is made possible, in part, by the multitude of signaling molecules that bind to the cytoskeleton and are activated by mechanical stimuli.\nFurthermore, due to the ability of the cytoskeleton to link the various cellular components, it can easily transmit signals amongst various compartments such as the Golgi or the nucleus and the membrane. Not only does the cytoskeleton enable the cell to respond quickly to external mechanical signals but it may also generate signals internally. Such signals commonly result from the pull of myosin motor proteins on actin filaments.\nThe effect of external stimuli is apparent in the increase of actin stress fibers and their realignment when cells are exposed to shear stress or plated on certain geometric patterns . In the case of localized stresses there is usually an increase in the cytoskeletal network at that point .\nGiven the widespread role of the cytoskeleton in cellular functions, it is hardly surprising that it is also associated with a large variety of diseases. Certain genetic mutations may result in a weak cytoskeleton that is unable to provide adequate support to the cell. A mutation in the nuclear protein lamin A causes the truncated protein progerin to be formed which is associated with a disease known as progeria. In this disease cells have a weak nucleus due to defects in the nucleoskeleton . Defects in the mitotic spindle are linked to chromosomal instability and subsequently associated with tumors . Remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is also closely linked to cancers as cells grow in crowded environments with limited nutrient supply .\nA disruption in the cellular cytoskeleton would result in an overall disruption in cell organization as well as in cellular transport mechanisms. Axonal processes in neurons are a prime example of this. Since axonal processes can be extremely long, their function is highly dependent on microtubule-based transport . Disruption of microtubule function has thus been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and myopathies. These are due to the poor delivery of components to synaptic junctions . A dysfunctional actin cytoskeleton, on the other hand, is often linked to muscular defects. In this case cardiac muscles are particularly susceptible as their activity is largely based on actomyosin driven contractility .\nMicroorganisms such as bacteria can also exploit a host cell’s cytoskeleton and improve the chance of infection. Enteropathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli induces the polymerization of actin and the formation of pedestals which they then use to attach to the cell . Others such as Listeria monocytogenes and vaccinia virus use actin tails to propel themselves inside host cells . In another example, the bacteria Clostridium difficile secretes toxins that induce actin reorganization, thus assisting the bacteria in cell invasion .\nLikewise, microtubule formation and function can also be manipulated by microorganisms. The entry of Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli to the cell are microtubule dependent. This is because depolymerization of microtubules would otherwise inhibit their entry. The HIV virus is also known to disrupt the microtubule network in cells and the microtubule motor protein, dynein, is essential for adenoviral entry into cells . These examples illustrate that the cytoskeleton is not only used by cells for their function, but extensively utilized by pathogenic organisms to facilitate their own functions, leading to the and onset of disease.']	['<urn:uuid:07ffaa4d-6470-425d-ab3c-be0274a3e3af>', '<urn:uuid:20b741fe-7fb8-41ad-976f-9394b4806695>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	19	95	2350
52	bird laws canada vs us when started	Canada and the US established their first migratory bird protection through the 1916 Migratory Birds Convention between the United Kingdom (acting for Canada) and the United States of America. However, the US had earlier bird protection laws, starting with the 1913 Federal Migratory Bird Law (Weeks-McLean Law), which first established migratory bird hunting regulations.	"['Migratory Birds Convention Act (1994)\nThe Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, a federal law, implements for Canada what was originally the 1916 Migratory Birds Convention between the United Kingdom and the United States of America for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada and the United States. The 1916 Convention was amended by a Protocol agreement signed by Canada and the United States in 1995, which took into account aboriginal and treaty rights of aboriginal peoples on both sides of the border.\nThe purposes of the Convention were underlined by the 1995 Protocol, the recitals of which read in part that Canada and the United States remained,\n….COMMITTED to the long-term conservation of shared species of migratory birds for their nutritional, social, cultural, spiritual, ecological, economic, and aesthetic values through a more comprehensive international framework that involves working together to cooperatively manage their populations, regulate their take, protect the lands and waters on which they depend, and share research and survey information…\nJurisdiction for migratory birds is federal, due to the fact that migratory birds cross both provincial and international boundaries. The Act is administered by the Canadian Wildlife Service under the authority of the federal Minister of the Environment. The Act applies to migratory birds across Canada, whether located on federal or provincial lands.\nSection 5 of the Act prohibits the possession, buying, selling, exchange or transfer or a migratory bird or nest, or commercial trade in a migratory bird or nest, except in accordance with the Migratory Bird Regulations. At section 6, the Act establishes offences, and appoints game officers with inspection and other powers, as a means of enforcing the Act’s provisions.\nThe Migratory Bird Regulations address a variety of issues, including but not limited to:\n- Requirements for permits, and other restrictions, on hunting of migratory birds;\n- A prohibition on disturbing the nests or eggs of migratory birds without a permit from the Minister;\n- a general prohibition against introducing non-indigenous migratory bird species; and\n- a prohibition against pollution (defined as the deposit of oil, oil wastes or any other substance harmful to migratory birds) in any waters or any area frequented by migratory birds.\nAlso passed under the Act is the Migratory Bird Sanctuary Regulations, which prescribe certain areas as sanctuaries for migratory birds, and establish the rules governing the sanctuaries. Seven migratory bird sanctuaries are prescribed for British Columbia, having the following designations: Christie Isle, Esquimalt Lagoon, George C. Reifel, Nechako River, Shoal Harbour, Vaseux Lake and Victoria Harbour.\nSignificance of the Act for Watershed Protection\nThe Migratory Birds Convention Act is a significant statute for watershed protection, due to the fact that many migratory birds rely on aquatic habitats for their survival. In B.C., much of our coastal area is used by migratory birds; and many inland waters as well are frequented by migratory birds. The Act can therefore be raised in support of a concern that a development is going to alter or harm a waterway to the detriment of the ecosystem and life that is supported by the waterway.\nAn important point to note is that the Act does not explicitly or directly protect bird habitat; however, if it can be shown that a development will have a significant, negative impact upon migratory bird populations because of pollution of the waters or land frequented by them, the Act can be raised as an argument for protecting the significant habitat.\nCitizens in Action\nIn the case of Alberta Wilderness Association et al. v. Cardinal River Coals Ltd., (1999) 3 F.C. 425, various conservation groups went to court and successfully challenged the construction of an open pit coal mine to be located near Jasper, Alberta. They argued that s. 35 of the Migratory Birds Regulations prohibited the deposit of oil, oil wastes, or any other substance harmful to migratory birds in any area frequented by them. On the facts, the plan for the mine included a plan to deposit millions of tons of rock waste into the nearby creek beds, in an area used for nesting by migratory birds. It was determined that the deposits would pose a threat to the migratory birds that nested there, and therefore would be considered a “harmful substance” within the meaning of the Regulation, and contrary to its terms.\nFor more information on the Migratory Birds Convention Act or bird protection:\n- Electronic version of Migratory Birds Convention Act, S.C. 1994, c. 22 and Regulations\n- Canadian Wildlife Service – Migratory Birds Conservation website\n- Canadian Wildlife Service – Birds and Mammals website\n- Environment Canada: Questions and Answers on the Migratory Birds Convention Act and Regulations\nOther International Agreements Affecting Migratory Birds or Wetlands Habitats:', 'Origins of Federal Wildlife Laws and Enforcement\n|1900||The Lacey Act took effect as the first Federal law protecting game, prohibiting the interstate shipment of illegally taken wildlife, as well as the importation of injurious species.

53	ways to use sales reports business	Sales reports can help businesses make important decisions about their products and customers. They show which items are selling well or poorly, helping decide what products to market differently, modify, reduce, or discontinue. Sales reports also identify top customers, allowing businesses to focus on maintaining those essential relationships.	['Your business’s financial reports help you with making important business decisions. While there are many smart decisions you’ll be able to make with efficient reports by your side, we’ll just be looking at three of them:\n#1 What should I sell more or less of?\nA key principle to help you stay in business and flourish is to listen to the market and provide for their current and future needs and wants. Using sales reports that show your top selling and least selling items over a period, you can easily identify which products you need to:\n- a) Market differently\n- b) Tweak so that they are more customer-friendly\n- c) Cut down on producing or sourcing, or\n- d) Discontinue altogether.\nSales reports can also reveal who your top customers are. This enables you to spend more time focusing on those essential relationships and ensuring that these customers are well taken care of. You can then redirect that cash into something more in demand.\n#2 Do I need additional funding?\nWhile there are a few internal courses of action you could look to first, for example; reducing costs or driving more sales to increase revenue, it may not be enough. Many start-up and small businesses are self-funded, which is ideal. However, for many businesses there comes a time when cash flow is not sufficient to maintain operations and additional funding may be required.\nWhether it’s acquired through a business loan or an investor, financial reports will be required to prove to the bank or investor that you can manage your finances. So, you need to ensure that you keep track of your finances regularly and that your data is always up to date. Financial reports such as the income statement and cash flow statement can help you gauge whether you need additional funding to curb seasonal fluctuations, or whether you need to purchase additional stock to cater for a growth in demand.\n#3 How and when can I expand my business?\nWhen your business has been profitable for some time, when you don’t stress about cash flow, and when the demand for your product far exceeds your expectations, it’s a clear sign that things are going well, and it may be time to expand your business. As exciting as expansion is, it needs to be considered very carefully, and insight from financial and other business reports will be crucial.\nThere is also a heap of other options you could consider before expanding, like; replacing old equipment, settling any debts, giving something back to shareholders, or putting money aside for a rainy day. However, if your mind is made up on expansion, here’s the way to go:\nWhen you’re considering expanding your business, a big decision is making up your mind on what type of expansion to go with. For example, will you:\n- Sell more of the same product/s.\n- Open shop in another area.\n- Diversify – offer complimentary products to what you currently offer.\n- Franchise your business.\n- Merge with or acquire another business.\nNot all types of expansions are suitable for all types and sizes of businesses, or for every industry. It’s important to do thorough research into what will work for you and your business, and what resources you have at your disposal. Part of this research will be determining the long-term profitability of your business considering the expansion opportunity. What does the future look like? Without having access to up-to-date financials that you can easily analyze, you could end up making rash decisions that could cost you your business. Being able to decide quickly, based on accurate data, allows you to know whether you need to hold off and wait for the right moment to expand your business, or if you’re ready to do it immediately.\nWhatever the case, realizing and understanding the importance of your business’s financial reports goes a long way to growing and maintaining a successful business. We hope you’ve gained some important knowledge in how you can become the champion of your financials and finally get them to work for you and your business.']	['<urn:uuid:bf32a8ad-412f-4e20-a5c8-e9d1e9251312>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	6	48	685
54	best safety practices taping interviews	When recording interviews, best practices include getting a recorded statement from the interviewee confirming they approve of being taped. Any special arrangements regarding copyright ownership or other matters should be documented beforehand, either on tape or in writing (even through email exchanges). If specific promises are made to interviewees, such as letting them review quotations before publication or keeping certain information off the record, these commitments must be honored.	"['Writers and reporters conduct countless thousands of interviews every day. You might therefore think that it would be well-settled who owns the copyright in the transcriptions or recordings of those interviews, but there is a surprising disparity of opinion on the issue.\nIt is clear that most interviews are copyright-protected. As described in this earlier post, an expressive work is subject to copyright protection the moment that it is ""fixed in any tangible medium of expression."" An interview is ""fixed"" the instant it is, for example, tape recorded, videotaped, or set down by the interviewer in nearly verbatim notes. (There is the additional requirement that the fixation must be with the ""authority"" of the author, so a conversation surreptitiously recorded by one participant may not give rise to a copyrighted fixation.)\nBut who is the copyright owner of the resulting give and take of questions and answers? The interviewer who formulates the questions? (That\'s basically where the Taggart v. WMAQ case came out, as summarized by the Henderson & Sturm law firm here.) The interviewee who provides the answers, which typically form the core of what readers are really looking to read in interviews? (That seems to be what Suid v. Newsweek implies.) Or do the interviewee and interviewer create a kind of compilation in which each has an ownership interest in his or her separate contribution? (That appears to be the position taken in Quinto v. Legal Times and in Section 317 of the Compendium II of the Copyright Office Practices.) Or is the interview a ""joint work"" where the interviewer and interviewee both have a copyright interest in both the questions and the answers. (That\'s the default assumption of leading copyright scholars William Patry and Paul Goldstein.) And, when a work is recorded, does some third party, such as a videographer own the recording? (Very often, yes; see Taggart again.) Finally, when the interview is conducted as part of the interviewer\'s or interviewee\'s employment, the employer(S) may own some or all of the interview as a work for hire.\nAll of this is seldom of any great practical consequence to writers. In the absence of some agreement to the contrary, if the interviewee knew he was being interviewed, a court would virtually always conclude that, at the very least, the interviewee had implicitly granted the interviewer a non-exclusive license to publish the resulting interview. If someone were to copy the interview, without permission, beyond the amount permitted by fair use, the interviewer and/or the interviewee would have a claim against the copier for infringement. (But see Suid.) And, if you are looking to obtain permission to quote from an interview (again, if you need to use more than fair use allows), then it usually makes sense to contact the interviewer, his or her publisher, or the media entity that employed the interviewer. I do not know of any instances where a interviewee has filed suit contending that the interviewer did not have authority to grant permission to quote from a published interview. (If any reader knows of such a case, please let me know.)\nWhen a problem arises, it is generally not because of a dispute between interviewer and interviewee over copyright ownership, but because the interviewee purports to have placed some express restrictions on how the interview may be used. For example, in Taggart, the defendant television station videotaped a prison interview with a convicted sex offender on the subject of lax regulation at summer camps. The interviewee/plaintiff then claimed that he had requested that the tape not be used in any way in a broadcast. Fortunately for WMAQ, the court held that the interviewee had no copyright interest in his words, so there was no need to determine whether such a promise was made.\nBut interviewers should be aware that, if they make explicit promises to interviewees (e.g., with respect to how they will be portrayed or how the interviews will be used), the interviewers -- and/or their employers -- may be held liable for breach of contract (or on a related legal theory, known as promissory estoppel) if those promises are not kept. That is one of the lessons of Cohen v. Cowles Media, in which a newspaper was ultimately held liable for failure to live up to a promise not to disclose the identity of a confidential news source.\nSo, writers, you almost certainly own some kind of copyright interest in the interviews you conduct -- unless it is a work for hire for an employer or contracting party. But ownership of the copyright is not the end of the story in terms of your control over how the interview is used.\nIn terms of best practices: it\'s wise, when taping your interviews, to get a statement from your interviewee on the tape that the interviewee is okay with your taping his or her words. If you and the interviewee have some special understanding with regard to copyright ownership (or other matters relating to the interview), it\'s best to memorialize that understanding beforehand on tape or in writing (if only in an exchange of emails). If you have promised something to your interviewee (e.g., the opportunity to review quotations before publication, or that something the interviewee said will be ""off the record""), make sure you abide by the promise.\nIn later posts, I will return to three special problems related to interviews: the risks of inaccurate quotation; best practices for going on and off the record; and the risks of interviewing someone who has signed a confidentiality agreement, aka the Jeffrey Wigand problem.\nPostscript: Bob Tarantino of the Heenan Blaikie firm in Toronto has written a good piece on this issue under Canadian law and reaches a somewhat different (or, at least, more definite) conclusion than the U.S. cases provide.']"	['<urn:uuid:096dc8da-90e7-44a4-adf3-73424afe8f94>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	5	69	966
55	What's the difference between how John Macarthur and the Canadian Pacific Railway documented their workers - did they use different methods to record their personnel?	Yes, they used very different documentation methods. Macarthur's workers and activities were primarily documented through written correspondence, particularly his wife's letters which recorded details like their livestock numbers. In contrast, the Canadian Pacific Railway commissioned artist Kathleen Shackleton to create detailed portrait sketches of 48 different types of employees in their work attire, representing the first attempt to present railway personnel in pictorial form through a postcard series.	"['3 corrections, most recently by anonymous - Show corrections\nFOUNDER OF WOOL\nCentenary of John MacArthur.;\n, The wool industry in Australia has grown to such, enormous proportions, arid .become of such vital importance, that it is not meet that April 10th, the- centenary of the death of its founder, V- Macarthur, of Camden, should go unremarked, and the Royal Society of Australia will hold a sym- posium at Canberra to commemorate\nthe occasion. ;\n- John .Macarthur was born near\nPlymouth, in Devonshire, in. 1767, and joined the British"" Army as an ensign in 1782, but being placed on half pay the following: year went to live on a farm near Holsworth on the borders of Cornwall and Devonshire, where it is said he took a great interest in rural occupations, and also spent much time in .reading: books on legal subjects.

I did not find any information on the hotels but did discover some images of sketches depicting employees of the CPR that were produced on postcards. I was immediately attracted to them because the detail of the subjects depicted looked so real that they appeared to jump right off the card. I can think of no better way of introducing you to these cards than quoting the text that appears on the face of the cover card included in the series.\n“One’s first thought of a railway brings to mind parallel lines of steel tracks over which run trains of passenger or freight cars drawn by a locomotive. Beside the tracks are telegraph poles, and at intervals there are stations with platforms. In some larger centres are roundhouses and railway shops.To run and operate this equipment there is an army of employees with some of whom the traveller comes in contact, though far more remain unseen by him except in casual glimpses.”\n“Within the sixty years of its Charter, the personnel of the Canadian Pacific Railway has grown and changed greatly. The number of its employees over the past few years, not including those who serve on its Trans-Atlantic and Trans-Pacific steamships, has averaged between fifty and sixty thousand. The problem of making a representative selection of portraits from these employees for a set of pictures was quite a knotty one.”\n“Miss Kathleen Shackleton, the distinguished artist who undertook the job, limited her subjects mainly to those who wore some kind of distinctive costume, even if it might only be overalls, in the exercise of their craft, and was guided further in her selection by representatives of the Railway Labour Organizations and by Officers of the operating department of the Company. Forty-eight types have in this way been chosen, divided, for convenience in handling, into two packages. So far as known this is the first attempt to present in handy pictorial form the personnel of a great railway – which in this case is the Canadian Pacific Railway, the greatest transportation system in the world.”\nThese postcards were issued in two sets of twenty-four cards each. A short explanation of the subject’s duties appears at the foot of each portrait. The cards were issued in standard size and the portrait of each employee was drawn top-to-bottom along the long edge. (See some images of representative cards appear at the end of this article.) All sketches appear to be signed by the artist and many are also dated, either ‘1940’ or ‘1941’. The publication date for this series was scheduled for October 20, 1941 but production delayed their introduction. They were eventually made available before Christmas 1941 in time for employees to purchase them as gifts. For the convenience of those who wished to see the whole series a number of the sets were mounted on large cards and displayed through the offices of the general superintendents of the CPR at places where railway men were most likely to see them. They were also made available through CPR restaurants and newsstands and through the General Publicity Agent. The set of cards was first sold at 50 cents for the complete series. Miss Kathleen Shackleton spent eight months, which included much traveling, to get all these representative types.\nThe contents of each set are as note following. The TPC has images of 34 of these postcards. If you have any of the missing ones highlighted, we would be pleased to receive a scan to include in this archive.\nCapt. Francis S. Middleton, S.S.

She was the sister of the famous Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton. She immigrated to Canada in 1912 where she settled in Montreal and produced and exhibited numerous paintings. She returned to England in 1916 and stayed until the late 1920’s before eventually returning to Canada. She became known for her skillfully drawn pastel portraits. Her sitters were people from all walks of life and her clients came mainly from Montreal and the surrounding area.\nBetween 1930 and 1938 Shackleton executed a series of cultural portraits which were used by the Canadian Pacific to promote folkdance, folksong, and handicraft festivals. Her portraits also appeared as illustrations in “Canadian Mosaic” – a book written by J.M. Gibbon, general publicity agent of the Canadian Pacific. In 1937-38, on a commission from the Hudson Bay Company (HBC), she produced 55 pastel portraits of people indigenous to northern Canada that are now part of the HBC Archives. Some of these images can be viewed on the Archives of Manitoba website.\nIn the early 1940s Shackleton created a series of portraits of Canadian Pacific employees. The portraits were exhibited in Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton, Vancouver, and other Canadian cities.\nShackleton was an accomplished artist, exhibiting on several occasions with Art Association of Montreal and with the Royal Canadian Academy. She also wrote articles, lectured and gave talks on the radio. After a successful career in Canada, she returned to England, where she spent the remaining years of her interesting life.\nIt was very difficult to find anyone who knew of this postcard series. But I continued to look and eventually my hunting paid off. I have 38 of the 48 cards in the set and also lack the cover card. They are extremely difficult to find postally used because the employees, who presumably purchased the majority of sets, kept them as souvenirs. A few months ago I again browsed the CPR website, only to find that the images have been removed. On a recent correspondence I learned that the some (and quite possibly all) of the original sketches were given to the employee pictured upon their retirement from the company. The biographical information on Kathleen Shackleton came through correspondence with people found on the Internet. Without the Internet I probably wouldn’t have discovered these cards nor been able to share the facts about them with you. There are still a lot of unanswered questions I have. Who was contracted to print the cards? How many sets were sold? When did the CPR discontinue sales of the series? Maybe the answers lie out on the Internet or perhaps with a reader of this article.\n1. Canadian Pacific Railway Archives\n2.

By using scalable platforms from initial research through development to full-scale production, the scale-up risks between the different phases can be minimized and time-to-market can be reduced.\nPartnering with both scientists as well as production staff to help them achieve a better understanding of their upstream bioprocess is a key factor in achieving the desired goals. With state-of-the-art equipment, communication tools, verification tests and full documentation, we ease all processes. Our ISO 9001 and ISO 140001 certificates underline the high quality level of our work.\nThe diversity of applications calls for a diversity of solutions. Discover how our bioreactor systems can support both the pharmaceutical industry and industrial biotechnology.\nVaccination is the most effective method to prevent infectious diseases. The demand for vaccines has been increasing as a result of epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The growing demand for vaccines requires specialized tools that allow flexibility and scalability. This is important for reducing the time-to-market and thus achieving global vaccination goals as soon as possible. Getinge has several solutions to optimize vaccine development throughout the entire development process, from strain screening to production. Over the years, we have designed and built vaccine production systems that are used all over the world today.\nBiopharmaceuticals, such as hormones and monoclonal antibodies, differ from traditional therapeutics in the sense that they are produced using bacteria, fungi, or other cells. However, the cost for R&D of biopharmaceuticals has been increasing for several years, which slows down the development process. In order to speed up the development of biopharmaceuticals, single-use screening platforms and flexible bioreactor designs are required. In addition, improved techniques, such as perfusion, allow you to maximize your production yields and lower your operating costs. Getinge has the right tools to support the development and production of biopharmaceuticals that enable you to work under GMP conditions.\nRegenerative medicine can repair or replace cells, tissues, or organs that have been damaged by any type of cause, such as injury, disease, or age. These therapies can fulfill clinical needs that are unmet by traditional medicine. Different types of regenerative medicine, such as cell and gene therapy, CAR-T therapy, and stem cell therapy, have been evolving recently. The demands in this market are continuously changing, making flexibility extremely important. Moreover, efficient scale-up is critical for the commercialization of these therapies. Getinge offers flexible solutions that enable the rapid development of processes in the regenerative medicine industry.\nFood & Beverages\nMicroorganisms are commonly used in many food processes, such as alcohol fermentation, as well as production of vitamins and food additives. Companies in this industry often aim to improve their production yields by optimizing the producer strains. Getinge provides several products that can easily be used for screening and development of these fermentation processes. In addition, Getinge supports new markets, such as alternative meats, which have emerged recently and are rapidly developing towards a commercial target. We offer flexible and scalable solutions that support the rapid process optimization and commercialization of these emerging products.\nChemical synthesis has several disadvantages, such as being unsustainable and requiring large amounts of energy. Instead, numerous bio-chemicals can be produced using microbial fermentation. These bio-chemicals can be used in a wide variety of applications, such as cosmetics, nutrition, and plastics. Development of these new bio-chemicals requires specialized tools in order to make these processes economically viable. The Getinge Applikon bioreactor systems can be adapted to a variety of biochemical product processes with scalable outcomes, in order to support the rapid development of new molecules and increase their marketability.\nSustainability considerations as well as the depletion of fossil fuels has sparked global interest in renewable fuels. Biofuels, produced from biomass, are one of the largest sources of renewable energy. Since the market is dominated by large fossil fuel companies, it is challenging to make these processes economically feasible. The Getinge Applikon bioreactor systems enable the optimization of your bioprocess and achieve lower operating costs in bench scale experiments that can be used to mimic production scale dynamics.\nExplore our products\nFind the right products and solutions for you']	['<urn:uuid:cd21452d-dbc0-4d10-8e78-a1668aa46504>', '<urn:uuid:ce0632cb-603a-4fb4-b395-e7c54013e1eb>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	9	47	1454
57	what climate changes happening arctic region recent decades explain	In the Arctic, snow has been melting 2.5 days sooner per decade between 1961 and 2004. The region has experienced heat increases of about 3 Watts per square meter per decade during this period, matching climate change models' predictions for greenhouse gas warming. The Arctic is now warmer than at any time in the past 400 years, and this warming trend is expected to continue, potentially allowing shrubs and trees to move farther north, which would absorb even more energy than the current tundra.	['For the Northern Hemisphere, the Winter Solstice is the shortest day of the year. In the steady march of the year in the Arctic, the days gradually grow shorter between June and December until the far North plunges into the complete darkness of winter. The trend reverses at Winter Solstice, the point during the year when the Northern Hemisphere is the most inclined away from the Sun. After the solstice, which falls on December 21 or 22 every year, the days begin to lengthen. Probably because the day marks the beginning of the return of the Sun, many cultures celebrate a holiday near Winter Solstice, including Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa.\nOn Winter Solstice, the polar North receives no energy from the Sun. In contrast, the amount of incoming solar energy the Earth receives on June 21, Summer Solstice, is 30 percent higher at the North Pole than at the Equator. The contrast between Winter and Summer Solstice is illustrated in these images. The images show the amount of sunlight that is reflected from the Earth as measured by the CERES instrument on NASA’s Terra satellite. In the top image, taken on Winter Solstice 2004, the far North is dark blue, indicating that no sunlight is being reflected back into space. The most sunlight is being reflected out of the Southern Hemisphere, where December 22 marked the longest day of the year. The lower image shows Summer Solstice 2005. Darkness dominates the South, while the North is now the location receiving and reflecting the most light. In both images, bright white clouds stand out because they are reflecting so much light back into space.\nNotice how the polar North reflects less light during its summer (June) than the polar South reflects during its summer (December). The reason behind this is land cover. Antarctica in the south is nearly entirely covered with bright white snow, which reflects light well. The northern oceans are also capped with sea ice, but the area covered with sea ice during the summer has declined in recent years. Snow cover has also decreased on land. According to a study published in Science on October 28, 2005, snow in the Arctic melted on average two and a half days sooner per decade between 1961 and 2004. Open water and snow-free land both absorb more sunlight than reflective ice, and they warm the atmosphere as they release the absorbed heat. Heat in the Arctic increased by about 3 Watts per square meter per decade between 1961 and 2004, the same amount of heating that climate change models predict after several decades of greenhouse gas warming. The Arctic is now warmer than at any time in the past 400 years, and the warming trend is likely to continue. Warmer temperatures and thawing soil will allow shrubs and trees to move farther north, and they absorb even more energy than the tundra that currently covers the North.\nNASA images courtesy Takmeng Wong and the CERES Science Team at NASA Langley Research Center.\n- Terra - CERES']	['<urn:uuid:7e64a4b3-2a43-4daf-857e-1ac4afe6efa4>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	9	84	505
58	small business suppliers vs plumbing apprentices skill requirements compare	While both small diverse suppliers and plumbing apprentices need to demonstrate competence, their requirements differ. Small diverse suppliers must consistently produce high-quality goods/services, demonstrate financial stability, have proper certifications, and show ability to meet customer demands. In contrast, plumbing apprentices must work under licensed plumbers' supervision while completing formal training programs and classes to gain technical skills before advancing to journeyman status.	['A business is only as good as its supply chain, and a supplier diversity program is only as good as the diverse suppliers it identifies and brings into that supply chain.\nBut what makes a good diverse supplier?\nThe criteria are much the same as they are for a good non-diverse supplier: fulfilling your requirements in an acceptable manner.\nObviously, as a supplier diversity professional, your goal is to find opportunities for diverse suppliers within your company’s supply chain, but that does not mean sacrificing value or quality.\nA supplier diversity program is meant to increase access and remove obstacles for diverse businesses. It’s up to the suppliers to turn that opportunity into a contract by providing a product or service that meets your needs.\nSuccessful partnerships are mutually beneficial. The bonus of partnering with a diverse supplier is that there are added benefits such as economic impact within the community, access to new consumer markets, and access to new ideas.\nKeep in mind that what makes a good supplier for your company may vary depending on the circumstances. Let’s look at some further criteria you should have in mind when evaluating diverse suppliers, and how to make it easier to vet them.\nWhat to Look for in a Diverse Supplier\nCosts change, but quality is forever. You have standards of quality to uphold in your own products and services. Those standards require a certain level of quality from your suppliers. Test diverse suppliers at the same level you would any other to ensure your company’s competitive edge. A good supplier produces consistently high-quality goods and services. A good supplier also takes responsibility if quality is lacking, proactively communicates with the customer, and works to address the issue quickly.\nHere’s where being a large customer of a small business can really pay off—small, diverse suppliers often offer bigger discounts than if you were a small customer of a large supplier. Cost savings coupled with innovative products and ideas can add up to higher revenues and increased market share. If your other criteria are met, this is definitely a win-win partnership!\nGood suppliers know their limits and make promises accordingly. Can they meet your needs logistically? Are they able to scale to produce the quantities you need? Here is where diverse suppliers sometimes fall short. Because these suppliers are usually small businesses, they may not be capable of producing goods or services at the level your company needs. If this is the case, look for Tier 2 opportunities that are a better match for their capabilities.\nYou need your supply chain to run smoothly, so investigate how potential partners manage their business. What is their track record with other customers? What contingency plans do they have for natural disasters or disruptions in their own supply chain? Good suppliers want to do more than the minimum—they want to exceed their customers’ expectations. What kind of language and action do you see in this regard?\nLocation impacts cost and availability. Depending on your needs and the capabilities of diverse suppliers in your geographic region, partnering with a more local company can keep shipping costs down and speed up delivery. Additionally, doing business with a nearby diverse supplier has a positive economic impact on the communities where your own employees live and work.\nAn advantage you might find with small, diverse suppliers is their ability to shift quickly to meet changing demand or market trends. Because they are usually smaller operations, diverse suppliers are often more agile than their larger counterparts.\nAgility can also translate to leadership within their field of expertise. Are they early adopters? Are they leading the way toward new technologies or best practices? Are they proactive and continually improving? These are characteristics of a good supplier and partnering with them could mean a distinct competitive advantage.\nForming new partnerships always involves risk and should be considered carefully. In the case of diverse suppliers, be sure you have up-to-date financials as well as current references, certifications (as a diverse supplier and any industry accreditation), insurance and liability coverage, and capability statements. Search news archives and social media to see what the media and customers are saying about them. Check that they are in compliance with industry rules and regulations.\nA good supplier has established customer service protocols, effective communication, and a willingness to maintain a healthy relationship with its customers. As you’re vetting diverse suppliers, ask questions about their hours of operation, their policies on damaged or late goods, and how they handle emergencies. Good suppliers want their customers to look good!\nCulture and Values Fit\nGood suppliers have integrity and are compliant with regulations and rules for their industry. Their values and ethics should align with yours not only to make working together pleasant, but also to make it easier for you to trust each other. Of course, diverse suppliers may not have formal programs aligned with their core values, but they should have a values statement and demonstrate progress toward creating a culture that reflects those values. For example, a diverse supplier may not have a robust supplier diversity program of its own—it may not have one at all, yet—but it sees the value of a diverse supply chain and is working toward inclusive sourcing in its own company.\nUnlike the other items on our list, this criterion is specific to diverse suppliers. As a company, you need to decide if you will only accept third-party certification or if you will also accept self-certification.\nMany companies accept self-certification—44 percent of respondents to our 2019 survey do—but more and more are choosing to accept certification through third-party entities only. This decision is driven by a couple of factors: risk management and easier access.\nWhen a diverse supplier is certified by organizations like the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) or Disability:IN, you have the assurance that they were properly vetted and that the business is owned and operated by someone who qualifies as a minority or member of an underprivileged community. Not only does this mean your supplier diversity program is doing what it was built to do—work with diverse suppliers —but it also protects your program in case of an audit.\nAdditionally, these third-party organizations offer multiple opportunities to meet and interact with diverse suppliers throughout the year. Matchmakers, networking events, and conferences help you find diverse suppliers for potential partnerships while expending fewer resources. And as a CVM customer, you have access to our Supplier Explorer tool, which draws from CVM’s Master Database of millions of small and diverse suppliers, aggregating data from hundreds of third-party certification sources.\nHow to Vet a Diverse Supplier\nThe criteria for evaluating diverse suppliers is similar to how we evaluate non-diverse suppliers, with just a few exceptions. Those exceptions are crucial, however, particularly when it comes to certifications and capabilities.\nVetting potential suppliers manually is a time-consuming process; anything we can automate saves valuable time and resources for what is generally a small supplier diversity team.\nWhen you know what you’re looking for in a diverse supplier, how can you quickly and efficiently find a potential match? CVM’s Supplier Registration Portal is a fully customizable tool that allows you to ask suppliers for the information that matters to you.\nUsing an RFI-styled questionnaire that you design, potential suppliers complete a prequalification sourcing survey within the registration tool. You receive the information that’s important to your company, then that information is verified against CVM’s Master Database.\nThe surveys can be scored and then routed to an appropriate buyer automatically if desired, eliminating another step in the process.\nFinding good diverse suppliers doesn’t mean reinventing the wheel. Your goal is to remove obstacles to access and opportunity, then evaluate diverse suppliers using the criteria that are important to your company and your circumstances.\nWhen you have identified those criteria and implemented tools to streamline the process, adding good diverse suppliers to your supply chain becomes much easier.', 'How to Choose the Right Plumber Training near Bisbee Arizona\nThe initial step to learning to be a plumbing contractor or tradesman is finding a plumbing school near Bisbee AZ. But with so many technical schools to pick from, just how do you undertake making certain that you enroll in the ideal one? Especially because there are a number of variables to examine. For example, many prospective students will begin by searching for schools that are nearby their residence. When they have located several that are within driving range, they will pick the one with the least expensive tuition. Although location and cost are significant, they are not the only qualifications that must be examined. Also important are the reputations of the schools, their accreditation, along with their graduation and job placement rates. These and additional qualifications should help mold your ultimate judgment when choosing a plumbing training school. We will discuss that checklist in more detail later in this post. But to begin with, let’s talk a little bit about becoming a plumber and the training choices that are available.\nBecoming a Plumber\nAlmost everyone at one time or another has needed the services of a professional plumber. It may have been due to a leaky faucet or perhaps a hot water heater needed to be replaced. Plumbers provide a valuable service for the maintenance of both commercial and residential buildings. They are skilled tradesmen who are trained in the installation, repair and replacement of plumbing systems. These systems include pipes, plumbing fixtures, water based heating and cooling, sewage removal and sprinklers. A local Bisbee AZ plumber will typically advance through three phases during their professional career.\n- Apprentice. The majority of Bisbee AZ plumbers begin their careers as an Apprentice. Apprenticeships are often completed in tandem with a formalized plumbing training program. Apprentices are typically paid but unlicensed and work under the guidance of a licensed plumber during working hours and attend plumber training classes at night. The second phase of their career begins once the apprenticeship and the training program have been completed.\n- Journeyman Plumber. Once the apprenticeship has been completed as well as any required training program, application for Journeyman Plumber licensing can be made. Most often licensing is controlled by the state but can be managed more locally at the county or city level. A Journeyman license will only be issued after all requirements have been met, including a passing score on the licensing exam. Even though a Journeyman is more knowledgeable and experienced than an Apprentice, they generally must continue to be supervised, in this case by a Master Plumber.\n- Master Plumber. After attaining the necessary work experience and completing any additional educational requirements, the Journeyman can apply to become a Master Plumber. Once again a passing score must be achieved on the licensing exam before a license will be issued. There are several benefits to advancing to the Master Plumber level, including earnings at the highest pay level, unsupervised working conditions, and the ability to start and own a business. Master Plumbers may also hire and supervise both Journeymen and Apprentices.\nAs a technical field requiring a high level of skill and competence, plumbing can take years of both training and experience to master. As a consequence, the best opportunity for success for a new Apprentice in Bisbee AZ is to enroll in a plumbing technology program that will provide the comprehensive quality training needed to embark on this challenging career.\nPlumbing Certificate and Degree Programs\nThere are several educational options available near Bisbee AZ to receive the necessary training to begin your career as a plumber. As far as the schools offering programs, you can enroll in a trade, technical or vocational school as well as a local community college. The programs offered will vary, but in general the shortest is the certificate program which will focus on the fundamentals and generally take about a year to complete. An Associate Degree will take 2 years to complete and will provide a more comprehensive education. There are some colleges that do offer a Bachelor Degree in plumbing technology, which are 4 year programs and much broader in nature. When choosing a school and program, naturally the completion time and the cost will be important factors. Tuition can vary significantly among the various schools and colleges and for some private schools can be quite expensive. State schools and community colleges typically offer their programs at the lower end of the tuition scale. However, when making your comparisons, keep in mind that many schools offer financial aid and even scholarships to help offset some of the financial burden. So be sure to find out what is available for each school and program before making your final decision.\nWhat to Ask Plumbing Vocational Schools\nNow that you have made a decision to obtain a certificate, diploma or degree, you can start to refine your school options. Considering that there are numerous plumbing trade and vocational schools in the Bisbee AZ region, it’s essential to have a checklist of criteria that each program must meet. The first two that we talked about were location and tuition expense. And while both qualifiers may be crucial when making your decision, there are other variables that need to be considered as well. Following is a checklist of those additional qualifications that you will need to analyze before enrolling in a plumber tech school.\nIs the Plumbing School Accredited? Many plumbing trade schools have acquired either a regional or a national accreditation. They can acquire Institutional Accreditation, which focuses on the school’s programs as a whole, or Programmatic Accreditation, which pertains to a specific program, such as electrical technology. Confirm that the Bisbee AZ school and program are accredited by a U.S. Department of Education acknowledged accrediting agency, such as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. Along with helping make certain that you obtain an excellent education, it may help in acquiring financial aid or student loans, which are frequently not available for non-accredited programs. Also, many states require that the plumbing training course be accredited for it to qualify for licensing or certification.\nIs the Plumbing School Licensed? In addition to accreditation, another way of determining if a vocational school you’re reiewing is reputable is by checking that it’s properly licensed. Licensing is typically controlled and regulated by state agencies, such as the Arizona Department of Education. If you don’t know, ask the school which state agency is responsible for its licensing and then verify that it’s up to date.\nHow Long has the School been in Business? Another means of determining the quality of a technical school is to find out how long it’s been in business. The longer a school has been in operation, the more likely that its programs are highly rated and regarded. Conversely, schools that are not well regarded or that provide low quality training generally don’t stand the test of time. However, keep in mind that even the best of Bisbee AZ schools had to start from their first day of operation, so only use it as one of several qualifications for each school you are considering.\nWhat are the School’s Completion and Placement Rates? Ask the plumbing training programs you are looking at what their completion rates are. The completion rate is the percentage of students who enroll in and complete the course. A low completion rate may indicate that students were disappointed with the program and dropped out. It might also signify that the teachers were not qualified to instruct the students. It’s also imperative that the schools have higher job placement rates. Older and/or more reputable schools may have a broader list of alumni, which can mean more contacts for the school to employ for their apprenticeship and job placement programs. A high job placement rate will not only validate that the school has an excellent reputation within the trade, but also that it has the network of contacts to help students acquire apprenticeships or jobs in the Bisbee AZ area.\nAre Apprenticeship Programs Sponsored? Numerous plumber technical programs are taught in conjunction with an internship or an apprenticeship program. Those participating trade and technical programs will help place you in an apprenticeship program within their network of plumbing businesses or labor unions. Check if the schools you are reviewing have referring partnerships with local Bisbee AZ plumbers or plumbing companies. An apprenticeship not only provides a valuable experience by providing hands-on training, but it also supplies employment opportunities and helps to build relationships in the area plumbing professional community.\nAre there Modern Facilities? Make sure that the school facilities and the equipment that you will be instructed on are up-to-date and what you will be working with on the job. If you are presently in an internship or an apprenticeship, check with the master plumber you are working under concerning what you should be expecting. Otherwise, ask a local Bisbee AZ plumbing contracting company if they can provide some suggestions.\nWhere is the School Located? Unless you can relocate, the school needs to be within driving distance of your Bisbee AZ home. Remember that if you decide to attend an out-of-state school, besides the added relocation costs there can be increased tuition charges compared to in-state residents.\nAre there Smaller Classes? It’s desirable that you get as much one-on-one training as possible, which can be challenging in bigger classes. Ask if you can monitor some of the classes so that you can see how large they are and experience the interaction between students and instructors. Talk to several of the students and get their comments relating to class sizes and instruction. Last, talk to some of the teachers and learn what their level of experience is in Bisbee AZ and what degrees or certifications they hold.\nIs the Class Schedule Convenient? Confirm that the class schedules for the programs you are evaluating are flexible enough to meet your needs. If you are only able to go to classes in the evening or on weekends near Bisbee AZ, check that the schools you are looking at provide those options. If you can only attend part-time, make certain that the school you select permits part-time enrollment. Also, check out what the policy is to make-up classes should you miss any due to work, sickness or family issues.\nFree Info on Accredited Plumber Classes Near Me Bisbee Arizona\nChoosing the best plumber training program will probably be the most critical decision you will make to begin your new career. You originally came to this website because of your interest in Free Info on Accredited Plumber Classes Near Me and wanting more information on the topic Free Info on Accelerated Plumber Training. But as we have covered in this article, there are a number of factors that you will need to evaluate and compare among the schools you are considering. It’s a necessity that any plumbing tech school that you are examining includes a considerable amount of hands-on training. Classes should be small in size and each student must have their own equipment to train with. Classroom instruction should provide a real-world perspective, and the course of study should be current and in-line with industry standards. Courses vary in length and the kind of credential provided, so you will need to decide what length of program and certificate or degree will best serve your needs. Each training program offers different options for certification as well. Probably The ideal means to research your final list of schools is to visit each campus and talk with the students and faculty. Invest some time to sit in on a few classes. Tour the campus and facilities. Make sure that you are confident that the program you pick is the ideal one for you. With the proper training, hard work and commitment, you can become a professional plumber in Bisbee AZ.\nMore Arizona Plumbing School Locations\nBisbee is a city and the county seat of Cochise County in southeastern Arizona, United States. It is 92 miles (148 km) southeast of Tucson and 11 miles (18 km) north of the Mexican border. According to the 2010 census, the population of the town was 5,575.\nMining in the Mule Mountains proved quite successful: in the early 20th century the population of Bisbee soared. Incorporated in 1902, by 1910 its population had swelled to 9,019, and it sported a constellation of suburbs, including Warren, Lowell, and San Jose, some of which had been founded on their own (ultimately less successful) mines. In 1917, open-pit mining was successfully introduced to meet the copper demand during World War I.\nA high quality turquoise promoted as Bisbee Blue was a by-product of the copper mining. Many high-quality mineral specimens have come from Bisbee area mines and are to be found in museum collections worldwide. Some of these minerals include cuprite, aragonite, wulfenite, malachite, azurite, and galena.\nBusiness Results 1 - 10 of 10']	['<urn:uuid:878c2385-7423-4d29-b78c-5043d57a1768>', '<urn:uuid:96739ac7-e455-4e8b-b552-2b6f7e8e2e53>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	9	62	3485

60	As an architecture enthusiast, I wonder if the Cascade commercial center in Zagreb and the Artfarm in Salt Point share any similarities in their spatial arrangement regarding vertical levels and movement between them?	Both buildings incorporate vertical level changes connected by pathways, but in different ways. The Cascade commercial center features four streets/terraces at different elevations connected visually as you walk along Tkalciceva street, while the Artfarm connects its different levels through a continuous cascading ramp in the middle axis that serves both as access to all spaces and as a picture gallery.	['Cascade commercial center, Croatian Building, Project, Photo, News, Design, Property, Image\nRetail Development in Zagreb, Croatia, Eastern Europe\nZagreb Shopping Centre – design by radionica arhitekture\n6 Feb 2010\nCascade commercial center, Zagreb\nDesign: radionica arhitekture\nCascade commercial center is situated in the center of Zagreb, about 500m to the north of the main city square where the flat lowland part of Zagreb meets the elite housing covered city hills. The architectural concept of the building is in our opinion contextual as it appreciates the topography which suggests building terraces between two parallel streets each on a different elevation.\nIt’s easy to conclude that the center got its name from its cross section. As you walk along The Tkalciceva street, one of the important streets of Zagreb, the section of the building ensures visual contact with four streets/terraces of the center. They are filled with people sitting in cafes, people shopping or just window shopping.\nIf you approach the center from the south, from the MiklouĹˇiceva Street, streets/terraces also let you just walk through the Cascade and continue to the north, to another Shopping center. The private streets/terraces become a part of the public city space. To the south of the center, near the MiklouĹˇiceva Street, a small chapel is going to be restored and presented to the public.\nThe facades of the terraces are defined by the shop windows. The shops are entered either directly from the terrace on one side or over a small bridge crossing on the other. The terraces are spacious enough for both communication and use as an extension of the shops/cafes. The last two terraces are covered with a translucent roof.\nThe east part of the center is reserved for four apartments looking to the gardens of the residential street to the east of the center. The apartments and their entrance are completely separated from the commercial part of the building. On top of having a big garden in front of them, each of the apartments has a small garden of its own.\nThe rest of the building is occupied by shops of different sizes separated by shopping corridors. The garage with the capacity of 180 cars and the technical part of the building are under the ground level. The gross area of the building is around 18 000 m2.\nThe shape of the building was derived from its future use and it became its attraction. We assumed that other architectonic elements weren’t necessary. The architectonic frame is filled with ambitiously designed shops and cafes. The building was opened in the end of the 2009. in the middle of the economic crisis but the situation is improving. The center is becoming a kind of meeting point of the younger urban population.\nCascade commercial center – Building Information\nCascade commercial center, Zagreb, Croatia (realization)\nAuthor: radionica arhitekture\nProject team: Blanka Gutschy, Vedrana Ivanda, Kristina Jeren, Goran Rako, Nenad Ravnic, Josip Sabolic, Marusja Tus\nStructural engineering: Branko Galic\nCascade commercial center images / information from radionica arhitekture\nTo see all listed projects on a single map please follow this link.\nCroatian Architecture – Selection\nSpaladium Centar, Split\nphoto : Domagoj Blazevic\nAula Ivana Pavla II, Rijeka\nphotograph from architect\nZamet Centre, Rijeka\npicture from 3LHD\nComments / photos for the Cascade commercial center Croatian Architecture page welcome:\nCascade commercial center Building', 'Artfarm, New York Architecture, Building, Architect, Images, Design, United States\nArtfarm Salt Point : New York State Architecture\nSalt Point Building, NY, USA – design by HHF architects with Ai Weiwei\nFeb 5, 2009\nSalt Point, New York, USA\nDesign: HHF architects + Ai Weiwei\nThe Artfarm is located near Salt Point in upstate New York (1.5h drive from the City), on the site of an existing private residence, built in the 80ies. The client is an art collector and owner of Chambers Fine Art, a well known gallery located in New York City and Beijing and which is specialized in contemporary chinese art.\nThe building is designed as a gallery for a professional art collection. On the interior it’s subdivided into different sized showrooms, an office space and spaces designated to store art.\nThe outer shape is a consequence of the used pre-engineered and easy to assemble type of steel building, which often gets used for agricultural purposes in that area. With ist abstract metallic appearance the structure becomes an equal member of a whole groupe of sculptures which are spread out in the landscape. The three volumes are put on a solid concrete slabs, which follow the existing grade on the site. The different levels are connected through a continues cascading ramp in the middle axis. This middle hallway with its ramp works as access for all spaces, allows an easy way of exchanging big pieces of art between storage and showrooms and works at the same time as a picture gallery.\nApproaching the Artfarm building from outside you don’t know what’s expecting you on the inside. Even though there are only three windows existing to the north (and the end of each hall, above the middle ramp, this is the only visual connection to the outside and allows a view into the wood), the building with its pure white interiors is astonishing bright on the inside. The massive concrete floor and the white shiny PVC batt insulation are creating a quiet and cool space. For delicate goods such as paintings etc. consistent indoor temperatures are needed, which is a challenge in an area with such enourmous change in temperatures.\nWith the concept of an hermetic closed and insulated envelope, the existing heating and cooling needs only to conserve the climate and support it when needed. This seems to work well, during the first summer the cooling had never to be turned on, even on really hot days it was comfortable and cool on the inside.\nARTFARM – Building Information\nArchitect: HHF architects + Ai Weiwei\nDesign team: HERLACH HARTMANN FROMMENWILER & AI WEIWEI with Tom Strub, Fumiko Takahama\nStructural engineering: Crawford & Associates, Hudson, NY\nConstruction management: Crawford & Associates, Hudson, NY\nPhotos: Iwan Baan (www.iwan.com)\nClient: Christophe W.

"[""In The Big Burn, Timothy Egan describes the “Great Fire” of 1910 that ripped through the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana: “Before the hour passed, big evergreens groaned at the waist and twigs snapped off … This was a peek beyond the gates of Hell.” Throughout the intervening century, fire activity has only intensified. When drought-stricken trees can’t access moisture through their roots, when pine beetles eat away at a tree’s hydration system, and when increasing temperatures cook their limbs dry, trees are prone to burn. In 2006, 100,000 fires were reported in the U.S., scalding nearly 10 million acres (4 million hectacres) – both record amounts. If trees burn, their carbon-absorbing powers reverse, and their stores of CO2 are released into the air, thereby intensifying the effects of climate change.\nOne of the places I traveled was southern Texas, in 2011, after the worst wildfire in the state’s history. Over 30,000 acres (12,000 hectacres) were destroyed during the three-week burn, which claimed two lives and over 1,500 homes. As I walked among the remains, there were no sounds – no birds calling, no insects buzzing, no squirrels scampering among the charred-out car parts melted into lawns. It was deathly quiet.\nHelicopter returning from fighting Diego Fire, Jemez Springs, New Mexico, USA, 2014\nStarted by a lightning strike, the Diego Fire burned over 3,600 acres (1,500 hectares) in the Santa Fe National Forest. Portions of the forest, like that shown in this image, had already been burned by the state’s second worst fire, the 2011 Las Conchas Fire, and not yet had a chance to recover.\nExtreme fire danger sign clouded by yellow haze from nearby Diego Fire, Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA, 2014\nA 2015 report by the United States Department of Agriculture notes that climate change has led to fire seasons that are 78 days longer than they were in 1960. Twice as many acres are burned in the U.S. as compared to the 1980’s and scientists from the U.S. Forest Service believe that number may again double by 2050. According to the National Fire Interagency, more than 9,100,000 acres (3.7 million hectares) burned in the U.S. in 2015 making it the fifth year (since 2006) to have topped over 9 million acres.\nSmoke haze from Diego Fire, Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA, 2014\nThe Los Alamos vicinity has been affected by several serious wildfires in recent decades – including the Cerro Grande Fire that took homes from over 400 families and burned buildings at Los Alamos National Laboratory. After the 2011 Las Conchas wildfire, the Laboratory’s scientists studied the impact of carbonaceous “tar balls” in the wildfire’s smoke – determining that these particles contribute to the warming effects of climate change more than previously thought.\nStump hole and ash from a burned tree, East Bastrop, Texas, USA, 2011\nIn September 2011, The Bastrop County Complex wildfire spread over 34,000 acres (13,800 hectares) in this small community east of Austin. Two lives were claimed by the state’s most destructive wildfire that occurred during the worst drought in Texas since the 1950’s. Stump holes are produced when tree stump has burned down all the way into the ground.\nCar burned by wildfire, East Bastrop, Texas, USA, 2011\nAs I wandered around what used to be wooded neighborhoods there was a noticeable eeriness. It was not just the missing homes and charred trees and cars, but the stark quiet that unsettled me. So many of the places I have photographed for this project have inspired me with their lingering beauty. But here, I was just saddened by the sense of loss.\nSmiling water tower amidst burned trees, East Bastrop, Texas, USA, 2011\nChild's toy car melted by wildfire, East Bastrop, Texas, USA, 2011\nRemnants of home destroyed by wildfire, East Bastrop, Texas, USA, 2011\nOver 1,600 homes were destroyed in the wildfires that burned for over a month in East Bastrop. Record low rainfall, record high temperatures, and high winds from tropical storms exacerbated the already existing drought conditions that helped to fuel the fire that was sparked by trees being knocked onto power lines.\nMark of burned tree surrounded by new grass, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona, USA, 2011\nAccidentally started by campers, the Wallow Fire in this forest burned for over six weeks before it could be contained. Grass-seed pods, dropped from helicopters soon after the fire ended, helped to quickly bring some new growth to the area, but it will take decades for areas with severe burn to recover.\nScorched trees with stormy sky, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona, USA, 2011\nPine saplings damaged by wildfire, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona, USA, 2011\nThe Wallow Fire destroyed over 500,000 acres (200,000 hectares), making it the largest wildfire in recorded Arizona history. The tops of these saplings were amazingly not scorched, but since their cambium (a formative cellular layer) was likely damaged, they will not survive despite their hopeful-looking green tops.\nBones of small animal killed by wildfire, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona, USA, 2011\nBurned trees from 2003 wildfire, Glacier National Park, Montana, USA\nComing after a five-year drought, the 2003 fire season was the worst in the park’s history. Over 136,000 acres of wilderness were burned, more than 13 percent of the preserve’s one million acres. Thankfully there were no human deaths from this fire that cost more than $68 million.\nTrees burned in wildfire, Kosciuszko National Park, New South Wales, Australia, 2012\nMore frequent heat waves, droughts, decreased relative humidity, and a longer fire season in Australia have been linked to changes in the climate. For the period from 1973-2010, annual extreme fire weather has greatly increased at all seven weather stations in New South Wales and the same study showed that at 24 of 38 stations across the country reported significant increases in such weather patterns.\nTrees burned by wildfire, Cabramurra, New South Wales, Australia, 2012 Australia, 2012\nThese trees in the Australian Alps National Park were damaged in a 2003 fire; nearly ten years later, much of the vegetation has yet to recover. In 2013, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology added a new color to its heat index map, an incandescent purple, to indicate temperatures over 125 degrees Fahrenheit (52 Celsius) as it prepares for continued warming temperatures in the coming years.\nLandscape damaged by wildfires, Cabramurra, New South Wales, Australia, 2012\nIn addition to increasing temperatures, another concern in the Australian Alps is the diminishing amount of winter precipitation. A 2011 federal report predicts that if temperatures continue to warm between 1.08 and 5.22 degrees Fahrenheit (.6 and 2.9 degrees Celsius) by 2050, there may be little to no snowfall in the “The Snowies”, as the Alps are affectionately known. This change will impact water resources, vegetation, wildlife, and winter tourism.\nSite of recent brush fire, Kailua-Kona, Hawai'i, USA, 2012\nThis fire happened only four days before I visited “The Big Island” of Hawai’i and when I arrived, I smelled the still-lingering smoke before I saw the damage to the parched landscape. In a cruel twist of fate, the eastern side of the island had recently received more than twice its usual rainfall over the past few months.\nTrees at Dixon’s Apple Orchard killed by fire and flood, Cochiti Canyon, New Mexico, 2014\nFueled by high temperatures, dry conditions, and strong winds, the Las Conchas fire spread incredibly fast – averaging an acre of forest every 1.17 seconds during the first 14 hours. After burning for more than a month, the fire was eventually contained having consumed 156,000 acres (63,000 hectares) and 63 homes. The Dixon family orchard, a favorite apple-picking spot for seven decades was hit first by this fire and then a month later by flash flooding after heavy rains which wiped out most of the rest of the buildings and trees on the property.\nThis is one of several Witness Tree images that fits into more than one chapter portfolio of this project. Many environments are being damaged by a one-two punch: fire and flooding, heat wave then fire, drought and flooding etc. –underscoring the extreme and unpredictable nature of our changing climate.""]"	['<urn:uuid:2eda38e1-0e49-4f3a-9b28-0df10d8388a7>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	6	25	1348
62	fsc certified printer requirements cost breakdown how much certification maintenance annual audit fees	The cost of achieving and maintaining FSC certification for printers varies depending on complexity, size, and preparedness. It typically ranges from $1500 to $5000, plus an annual audit fee. To obtain and retain certification, printers must implement a system-based approach that includes assigning responsible personnel, documenting procedures, conducting training, ensuring continuous compliance, creating records to demonstrate certified stock usage, and undergoing regular audits by organizations like SmartWord.	['At our January meeting, the Digital Imaging Association featured FSC—Forest Stewardship Council—Certification. The presentation was lead by Vivian Peachey from SmartWood, a company that acts on behalf of the Rainforest Alliance’s forest division to certify companies as FSC compliant, and to police and approve the use of each and every FSC and AFF (Ancient Forest Friendly) logo. Attendees learned what is involved in the certification process, what are the costs and implications to a supplier of printing and related services, and what leads the charge to certification.\nRainforest Alliance’s mission is to protect ecosystems and the people and wildlife that live within them by transforming land-use practices, business practices, and consumer behavior. In Canada, a champion of the cause is Market Initiatives, a Vancouver-based Greenpeace-associated firm, that has endeavours to increase consumer awareness of the reduction in the critical Boreal Forest in North America. Their high impact is evident in their coup of getting JK Rowling to “green-up” the Harry Potter series and put pressure on the big five Canadian banks to lower their impact on the Boreal Forest and Ancient Forests by printing only on FSC certified stock—to name only two examples. The day following the DIA presentation, JK Rowling’s blog on Whattheythink.com stated that when it was found that FSC-certified stock was not available to the selected printer of the Finnish version, Rowling pulled the printing\nIt is consumer pressure that is driving corporations to make the statement that they are environmentally responsible. And you can make the statement of your environmental responsibility by choosing FSC-certified papers and emblazoning the FSC symbol on your printed materials. Print providers can be a part of the group that champions our environmental future by doing what it takes to achieve and retain FSC Certification.\nWhat it is and how it works\nFSC Certification’s Chain of Custody begins with forest management—a systematic and measurable process that is traceable and auditable. Chain of Custody further tracks the product from FSC-certified forests until the final finished product to keep intact the integrity of the FSC seal. Printers, said Peachy, can be assured that the paper supply chain is fairly contained and that most in the chain are certified. The FSC Canada web site—fsccanada.org—has an up-to-date list of FSC-certified papers and printers.\nThe print based chain of custody looks like this:\nForest—Pulp Mill—Paper Mill—Merchant—Printer\nAs you can see, FSC isn’t just about the paper. In order to be able to put an FSC symbol on printed materials, the printer must also hold FSC Certification. FSC requires each link to obtain certification to retain the credibility of the claim of FSC-certified forests as the source. No claim or label is allowed unless the chain is unbroken.\nTo obtain and retain certification requires a system-based approach which includes:\nAssigning people to take responsibility\nDocumenting your procedures\nTraining on procedures\nConfirming that procedures are continually followed\nCreating forms and records to demonstrate that only certified stock has been used throughout a press run. Procedurally, it is absolutely essential to develop a foolproof process so that certified and uncertified stocks are not mixed.\nBe audited regularly by organizations like SmartWord\nFSC actually has three different logos to be used for very specific printed product applications. The symbol that addresses intent fully is the one that shows the product has been printed on paper that can be traced to content from 100% well-managed forests. Another symbol states that the paper used is from mixed sources—a combination of well-managed forests, controlled sources, and recycled wood or post-consumer fiber. The third designates recycled content that supports the responsible use of forest resources. Each logo used has a number unique to the Auditing company and the Printer to enable tracking validity of its use (i.e. Smartwood, Chain of Custody, and the Printer’s own number).\nCost and ROI\nCost to printers of achieving and maintaining certification, advised Peachey, depends on complexity, size, and preparedness. It can range from $1500 to $5000, plus the annual Audit fee. Actively marketing your company as one that is an intrinsic part of the Chain of Custody can lead to the potential of more work from customers who recognize their own responsibility to our environmental future. On a broader scale, this also represents a catalyst for change. Operations are required to make changes to social, economic, and systems issues just as often as environmental issues. Certification also creates a discipline of process control, which assists with efficient production—the ultimate outcome translates to increased corporate pride and increased profits.']	['<urn:uuid:abf19d87-1bf6-4841-ab3e-02558ffffbbc>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	13	67	749
63	study locations air pollution measurements netherlands research sites	The study included eight sites in the Netherlands: an underground train station, three different road traffic sites, an animal farm, a sea harbor, a site located near steelworks, and an urban background site.	['Variation in characteristics of ambient particulate matter at eight locations in the Netherlands - The RAPTES project\nResearch output: Contribution to journal › Article\nNumerous epidemiological studies have shown health effects related to short- and long-term exposure to elevated levels of ambient particulate matter (PM). It is not clear however which specific characteristics (e.g., size, components) or sources of PM are responsible for the observed effects. The aim of RAPTES (Risk of Airborne Particles: a Toxicological-Epidemiological hybrid Study) was to investigate which specific physical, chemical or oxidative characteristics of ambient PM are associated with adverse effects of PM on health. This was done by performing experimental exposure of human volunteers to air pollution at several real-world settings that had high contrast and low correlation between several PM characteristics. For this goal, eight sites in the Netherlands that differed in local PM emission sources were chosen for extensive air pollution characterization. Measurement sites included an underground train station, three different road traffic sites, an animal farm, a sea harbor, a site located in the vicinity of steelworks, and an urban background site. Five- to six-hours average concentration measurements at each site were made between June 2007 and October 2009. We measured PM10, PM2.5, particle number concentration (PNC), oxidative potential of PM, absorbance, endotoxin content, as well as elemental and chemical composition of PM, and gaseous pollutants concentrations. This paper presents a detailed characterization of particulate air pollution at the sampling sites. We found significant differences in all PM characteristics between the sites. The underground train station, compared to each outdoor location, had substantially higher concentrations of nearly all PM characteristics. The average PM10 and PM2.5 mass concentrations at the underground train station were 394 mu g m(-3) and 137 mu g m(-3), respectively, which was 14.1 and 7.6 times higher than the urban background. The sum of the concentrations of trace metals in fine and coarse PM was nearly 20 times above the outdoor levels. Elemental carbon (EC) was elevated at the underground site in the fine but also in the coarse mode, in contrast to the traffic sites where EC was predominantly found in fine PM. The highest concentrations and contrasts in PNC were at the traffic sites (between 45,000 and 80,000 particles cm(-3)), which was several times higher than measured at any other site. Correlations of PNC with metals, PM10, PM2.5 and absorbance were low to moderate, while correlations between PM10, PM2.5 and the metals Cu and Fe were high. After excluding the underground train station data, correlations between PM10, EC and metals decreased whereas the correlation between PNC and EC increased. We conclude that we were able to successfully identify and characterize real-world situations with very different particle characteristics. High contrast and low correlations between PM characteristics, as well as consistency of these differences across sampling campaigns, provide a good basis for identifying health relevant PM characteristics in the upcoming analysis.

64	What's the cooldown time between arrow hits?	There is a 0.5 second cooldown period after an arrow hit during which no further damage can be inflicted even if the target is hit with another arrow.	['Weapons form an integral part of Minecraft and are useful for protecting you from the various hostile mobs present in the game. While melee weapons such as swords and axes are great to use, a bow and arrow allows for ranged combat and makes the game much more interesting. Luckily, bows and arrows are easy to craft in the game. Read this guide to learn how to make Arrows in Minecraft.\nWhat You Need to Make Arrows in Minecraft\nIn addition to a Crafting Table, you will require the following item to make Arrows.\n- 1 Stick\n- 1 Flint\n- 1 Feather\nHow to Make Arrows in Minecraft\nStep 1 – Gather Ingredients for Arrows\nSticks can be crated from Wood. Approach any tree and chop it down using just your hands or an ax to obtain Wood. Wood can be converted to Wood Planks with the help of a Crafting Table. Wood Planks can then be converted to a Stick, again with the aid of a Crafting Table. You can obtain Flint while mining Gravel. Gravel appears as blocks of grey and is fairly easy to find. Although you can use any tool to mine Gravel, a shovel is the fastest and allows you to find Flint much more quickly. You can find Feathers by killing chickens in Minecraft.\nStep 2 – Crafting Arrows\nSelect a Crafting Table to open the Crafting Menu with the 3×3 grid. You must place the items in a particular pattern to craft Arrows in Minecraft. In the second slot of the top row, place Flint. In the second slot of the middle row, place one Stick. Finally, in the second slot of the last row, place a Feather. You have now successfully crafted Arrows!\nStep 3 – Move to Inventory\nMove the 4 Arrows from the right side of the Crafting Menu into your inventory,\nStep 4 – Making a Bow\nTo use the crafted Arrows, you will require a Crossbow or Bow. To craft a bow, you will require 3 Sticks and 3 Strings. Sticks, just like you did for the Arrows, can be made using Wooden Planks. Strings can be obtained by killing spiders, or by mining webs in mineshafts. By arranging these materials in a specific order on the Crafting Grid, you will obtain a Bow!\nHow to Make Arrows in Minecraft Video Guide\nHow to Use Arrows in Minecraft\nThe speed of an arrow determines the amount of damage dealt by it. An unenchanted bow that is fully charged will do 9 damage, with a small chance to do 10 points of damage. A medium charged bow will deal 6 points of damage, while a bow with no charge will inflict 1 point of damage. As soon as the target is hit, there is a 0.5 second period during which no further damage is inflicted even if the target is hit with another arrow. When mobs are hit by arrows during this cooldown period, they fall to the ground and lose all their speed.\nArrow can be used to activate tripwires, targets, wooden pressure plates, and wooden buttons. This is particularly useful when creating complicated circuits using Redstone that require activation at several points. As long as the arrows are stuck in the switch, they remain activated until they despawn after a minute. Switches made of other materials, however, are not affected by arrows.\nExplosions in Minecraft also affect Arrows that are in flight. They can be particularly useful for increasing the speed of an arrow and thereby causing increased damage.\n- In order to increase the chances of finding Flint, you can enchant your shovel with Fortune. At level 1 of the enchantment, you will have a 14% chance of finding Flint while mining Gravel. At level 2, it goes up to 25%. At level 3 you have a 100% chance of finding Flint whenever you mine Gravel.\n- Bows and arrows are particularly useful for killing Creepers. Creepers set off deadly explosions when killed, often causing a great deal of damage to the player. Using a bow to kill Creepers from a distance can help you avoid any damage from the explosions.\n- If you use any Lingering Potion with 8 Arrows on Minecraft PC, you will craft 8 Tipped Arrows having that Potion effect. This can be useful to set things on fire, deal more damage, and so on.\n- Arrows are the only objects that are capable of going through non-solid blocks in Minecraft such as cobwebs, strings, dead bushes, and open fence gates.\n- More about arrows in Minecraft here.']	['<urn:uuid:b0d256dd-170e-451d-a1c7-20e5d6765ec7>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	7	28	767
65	What challenges exist between IT and OT teams, and how to improve collaboration?	IT teams lack understanding of OT environments, where any disruption can have dangerous physical and economic impacts. OT engineers follow strict safety management controls and are cautious about changes, including security patches, as even brief disruptions can cost hundreds of thousands in lost product. To improve collaboration, security teams should avoid aggressive approaches like active system interrogation or agent installation, and instead focus on passive monitoring that won't impact processes. They must respect OT protocols and change management processes, while helping implement coordinated security measures that link all teams through well-defined workflows.	"['How do we fix industrial control systems cybersecurity?\nExperts say better visibility is essential to improving ICS/SCADA security. But infosec teams will never gain that visibility until they stop trying to observe ICS environments through the eyes of IT professionals.\nThere are fundamental differences in IT and OT (operational technology) gear, processes, and people, say experts.\n""Overall, IT has no idea what goes into operating an OT environment,"" says Paul Brager, senior staff product security leader, cybersecurity and risk, for GE Oil and Gas.\n""The success of the Internet has made computer people kind of smug,"" says Chris Blask, chair of the ICS-ISAC and global director of industrial control systems for Unisys. Industrial workers, however, he says, ""know how society works,"" like what keeps raw sewage out of your drinking water supply.\nSo while cybersecurity professionals worry about nation-states knocking out the power grid with ICS malware attacks, OT engineers know that their generating stations and production lines can be disrupted by much more than hackers. They\'re so aware of this that they adhere to extensive process safety management controls, hazard analysis, change management, emergency response, incident investigation rules, and more, to deal with such threats early and swiftly.\nThe introduction of anything new to the operational environment - a new pump, a software patch, an upgrade, a new security tool - is approached with caution, because any disruption in availability or integrity could have irreversible, expensive, even dangerous physical impacts.\nIt isn\'t just the worst-case scenarios of sustained blackouts, broken dams, nuclear meltdowns, and poisoned public water systems, either: it\'s economic impacts as well. If part of a chemical plant\'s system malfunctions or goes offline during a production run even very briefly because an insufficiently tested software patch misbehaves once it\'s released into the live environment, the chemicals could be corrupted. ""That might be $100,000 of product that they dump,"" Brager says.\n""No CEO is going to sign something that says \'Okay we\'re going to stop extracting oil from the ground for a week,\'"" to fix something that doesn\'t appear to be broken, like an unsupported operating system, explains Galina Antova, co-founder of OT security firm Claroty and former global head of industrial security services for Siemens. Convincing them that cybersecurity is a threat at all, much less one worth spending money on, is a challenge, she says.\nEnterprise IT environments will withstand more iteration and downtime than OT environments. If the OT environment appears to be stable, operational and efficient, then why make a change that might make it unstable?\nMany of the physical and cyber-physical systems in use today have been in use ""literally for generations,"" explains Eddie Habibi, CEO of PAS.\nAs these experts say, the attitude is generally If it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it. So infosec professional\'s challenge therefore is: to convince the OT side of the house that something is broken and then to fix it without breaking it further. And that takes a lighter touch than infosec pros and their tools are used to.\nSeeing What No One Else can See\nAs Blask says, ICS is ""the system put in place to provide visibility into physical processes. The one thing that they don\'t have visibility into is the [ICS] system itself.""\n""Visibility is a big deal. And we typically don\'t have a lot of visibility down there,"" on the cyberphysical systems says Brager. When something goes wrong, ""You don\'t necessarily know if it\'s a cyber thing or a human thing.""\nUnfortunately, says Habibi, ""These systems are not easily discoverable."" As he explains, industrial environments are often a heterogenous conglomerate of highly complex, proprietary systems, communicating on different protocols, requiring specialized expertise to run.\nBrager adds, many of these systems are no longer supported and the vendors may no longer exist. Many of them only communicate on one protocol, if they communicate at all.\n""It continues to get worse,"" says Habibi, ""because people continue to add automation.""\nThis IT-OT ""convergence"" adds more sensors, more I/O cards, more endpoints, more protocols, more interconnections, and more complexity to an environment, making the picture even murkier.\n""Unless you can visually see [an asset],"" says Brager, ""it\'s really hard to interrogate it ... But if you don\'t know which ones you have, you don\'t know how vulnerable you are.""\nPlus, he notes, a significant amount of industrial environments are generally managed by third parties with privileged access. Documentation - who runs what, where - is the last thing done, if it\'s done at all, says Brager.\nHowever, calling these third-party contractors and managed service providers and asking them for a manual count would be ""worse than doing nothing,"" says Habibi, because of the scale of the challenge.\nHow to Do it\nAccording to Brager, whenever terms like ""sniffing"" or ""actively interrogating"" are suggested by security teams or companies, ""the people in those plants get real nervous.""\nWhat may seem like a very gentle gesture to an enterprise IT manager, he explains, may be seen as a dangerous intrusion to an operational engineer. The industrial processes cannot tolerate new latency that might be introduced and if some mechanical system is damaged and cannot be recovered, it will need to be replaced.\n""If you say, \'we\'re going to install an agent,\' they\'ll say \'No you won\'t install an agent,\'"" says Brager.\nThat doesn\'t change the fact that improved visibility is necessary. Without it, attackers hiding in plain sight may be a greater threat than some OT teams realize -- because attackers may be better at achieving visibility than operators are.\nTake the CrashOverride/Industroyer malware, which researchers discovered was responsible for the December 2016 attacks on the Ukrainian power grid. It\'s designed to map, target, and attack grid operations by exploiting ICS communication protocols. The malware actually employs those protocols just the way they were designed so that it flies under the radar.\nICS security team\'s goal, therefore, says Antova, is ""improving visibility in a passive way. ... This is something I can do that the engineers will allow me to do without impacting their processes."" It also provides the most benefit for minimum investment, she says.\nHabibi urges the same practice. Passively take stock of all the components in an environment, then check them all for vulnerabilities, present that information to the operator, and allow them to act (or not). ""You want to fix those broken windows and broken locks,"" he says, ""Then implement a very tight change management process.""\nBut, Brager cautions, test products carefully, because some vendors that promise ""passive monitoring"" are less passive than they claim.\nAs ICS relates to safety processes and change management, it\'s is an opportunity for OT and IT groups to come together.\n""A lot of this comes down to having manners,"" says Blask. ""What you don\'t do is what security teams often do, is say \'your baby is ugly.\' ... And then they complain to their friends why they don\'t get invited to the meetings anymore.""', 'How do you protect digital industrial processes?\nCyber attacks on industrial companies have become an everyday occurrence, and the damage they cause can be immense and long-lasting. ANDRITZ’s strategic partner OTORIO, based in Tel Aviv, offers a unique and state-of-the-art, comprehensive cyber security concept that can be used by ANDRITZ customers as well as other companies, regardless of the branch of industry concerned. Daniel Bren, CEO of OTORIO, describes the special features and benefits of this approach:\nI. PREVENTION PRECEDES DETECTION\nIn our customer projects around the world, we see that forming a digital link between information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) is one of the biggest challenges that production companies face. While the IT environment is generally homogeneous, being constantly updated and patched, the OT environment is much more diverse, with different generations of machinery and rather vulnerable automation technologies. A strong and intelligent cyber security system must take this into account in order to systematically prevent risks before they become problems. Ideally, the system will constantly monitor potential points of attack in production, identify security gaps, and prioritize the best countermeasures.\nII. ORCHESTRATION AND AUTOMATION\nOur advice is that the security processes should run automatically as far as possible – this is the only way to react effectively and efficiently to changes in the OT environment and to the risks these changes involve. All security tools and teams must be linked to and coordinated with one another by well-defined and practiced processes. We call this approach “Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response” (SOAR). Its benefits include a uniform overview of the cyber risk, faster workflows to minimize any damage, and improved operational reliability. OTORIO’s industry-tailored SOAR solution features easy operation and can be integrated seamlessly into existing vendor-neutral production processes.\nIII. SECURE SUPPLY CHAIN\nSub-suppliers are involved in operations or maintenance work in the production area in many branches of industry. Increasingly, they are also given access via the Internet, creating a direct link to production operations. At the same time, we see that most companies subject new or repaired OT assets to only a superficial risk assessment if any. That is dangerous. Companies must take account of the daily connectivity risks created by their sub-suppliers, including, for example, the risks of introducing a new line or machine on the production floor.\nIV. PRACTICAL ANALYSIS USING THE “FOUR EYES PRINCIPLE”\nWe recommend examining the security measures regularly from the viewpoint of a hacker as part of so-called Red-Team penetration tests. It is important to introduce test routines like the “four eyes principle” so that the security technologies and processes implemented respond to the actual security requirements and cyber risks.\nV. PRODUCTION CONTINUITY PLAN\nNo system offers 100% protection, regardless of how flawlessly security measures are planned and implemented. As soon as there is an incident, speed is of the essence in order to contain the negative impact and restore error-free operation as quickly as possible. Firstly, this requires a team that is responsible immediately for neutralizing the threat. Secondly, the team must localize the cause of the problem and restore the latest and error-free “good” status in production operations. Thirdly, it must draw up a plan to close the security gaps that made the attack possible.']"	['<urn:uuid:8f1f3132-c43b-4219-824f-4fbda297719f>', '<urn:uuid:7c2e14c9-293f-47d9-8034-ac6e6b18500d>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	13	92	1693

Twenty-three more minutes of Lee\'s original footage were considered lost for 28 years, until they were discovered by Bey Logan in 1999. John Little assembled these parts according to Lee\'s script notes, reflecting more accurately Lee\'s intentions.\nThe documentary was released on VHS and DVD by Warner Home Video.

Release date(s) December 10, 1999 Running time 188 minutes Country United States Language English Budget $60 million Box office $286,801,388\nThe Green Mile is a 1999 American drama film directed by Frank Darabont and adapted by him from the 1996 Stephen King novel of the same name. The film is told in a flashback format and stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb and Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, and tells the story of Paul and his life as a death row corrections officer during the Great Depression in the United States, and the supernatural events he witnessed.\nIn a Louisiana nursing home in 1999, Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer) begins to cry while watching the film Top Hat. His elderly friend, Elaine, shows concern for him and Paul tells her that the film reminded him of when he was a corrections officer in charge of Death Row inmates at Cold Mountain Penitentiary during the summer of 1935. The cell block Paul (Tom Hanks) works in is called the ""Green Mile"" by the guards because the condemned prisoners walking to their execution are said to be walking ""the last mile"" to the electric chair; here, it is a stretch of faded lime-green linoleum.\nOne day, John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a giant black man convicted of raping and killing two young white girls arrives on death row. Coffey shows all the characteristics of being a ""gentle giant"": keeping to himself, soft-spoken, fearing darkness, and crying often. Soon enough, John reveals extraordinary powers by healing Paul\'s urinary tract infection and resurrecting a mouse. Later, he would heal the terminally ill wife of Warden Hal Moores (James Cromwell), who suffered from a large brain tumor. When John is asked to explain his power, he merely says that he ""took it back.""\nAt the same time, Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), a sadistic and unpopular guard, starts work. He ""knows people, big people"" (he is the nephew of the governor\'s wife), in effect preventing Paul or anybody else from doing anything significant to curb his behavior. Percy recognizes that the other officers greatly dislike him and uses that to demand managing the next execution. After that, he promises, he will have himself transferred to an administrative post at Briar Ridge Mental Hospital and Paul will never hear from him again. An agreement is made, but Percy then deliberately sabotages the execution. Instead of wetting the sponge, used to conduct electricity and make executions quick and effective, he leaves it dry, causing inmate Eduard ""Del"" Delacroix\'s (Michael Jeter) execution to be botched and for him to die slowly in great pain.\nShortly before Del\'s execution, a violent prisoner named William ""Wild Bill"" Wharton (Sam Rockwell) arrives, due to be executed for multiple murders committed during a robbery. At one point he seizes John\'s arm and John psychically senses that Wharton is the true killer of the two girls, the crime for which John was convicted and sentenced to death. John ""takes back"" the sickness in Hal\'s wife and regurgitates it into Percy, who then shoots Wharton to death and falls into a permanent catatonic state. Percy is then housed in the Briar Ridge Mental Hospital. In the wake of these events, Paul interrogates John, who says he ""punished them bad men"" and offers to show Paul what he saw. John takes Paul\'s hand stating that he has to give Paul ""a part of himself"" in order to see and imparts the visions of what he saw, of what really happened to the girls.\nPaul asks John what he should do, if he should open the door and let John walk away. John tells him that he is ready to die because there is too much pain in the world, which he is aware of and sensitive to, stating that he is ""rightly tired of the pain"" and is ready to rest. For his last request on the night before his execution, John got to see Top Hat. When John is put in the electric chair, he asks Paul not to put the traditional black hood over his head because he is afraid of the dark. Paul agrees and after Paul shakes his hand, John is executed.\nAs Paul finishes his story, he notes that he requested a transfer to a youth detention center, where he spent the remainder of his career. Elaine questions his statement that he had a fully grown son at the time and Paul explains that he was 44 years old at the time of John\'s execution and that he is now 108 and still in excellent health. This is apparently a side effect of John giving a ""part of himself"" to Paul. Mr. Jingles, Del\'s mouse resurrected by John, is also still alive—but Paul believes his outliving all of his relatives and friends to be a punishment from God for having John executed. Paul explains he has deep thoughts about how ""we each owe a death; there are no exceptions; but, Oh God, sometimes the Green Mile seems so long."" Paul is left wondering, if Mr. Jingles has remained alive for all of this time being but a mouse, how long will it be before his own death?\n- Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb. Hanks and Darabont meet at an Academy Award luncheon in 1994. Stephen King stated he envisioned Hanks in the role and was happy when Darabont mentioned his name.\n- Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey\n- Bonnie Hunt as Jan Edgecomb\n- David Morse as Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell. Morse had not heard about the script until he was offered the role. He stated he was in tears by the end of it.\n- Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore\n- Sam Rockwell as ""Wild Bill"" Wharton\n- Michael Jeter as Eduard ""Del"" Delacroix\n- James Cromwell as Warden Hal Moores. Darabont wanted Cromwell from the start, and after he read the script, Cromwell was moved and agreed.\n- Patricia Clarkson as Melinda Moores\n- Barry Pepper as Dean Stanton\n- Jeffrey DeMunn as Harry Terwilliger\n- Harry Dean Stanton as Toot-Toot\n- Dabbs Greer as Old Paul Edgecomb\n- Gary Sinise as Burt Hammersmith\n- Graham Greene as Arlen Bitterbuck\n- William Sadler as Klaus Detterick\n- Bill McKinney as Jack Van Hay\nDarabont adapted the novels into a screenplay in under eight weeks.\nThe official film soundtrack, Music from the Motion Picture The Green Mile, was released on December 19, 1999 by Warner Bros. It contains 35 tracks, primarily instrumental tracks from the film score by Thomas Newman. It also contains four vocal tracks: ""Cheek to Cheek"" by Fred Astaire, ""I Can\'t Give You Anything but Love, Baby"" by Billie Holiday, ""Did You Ever See a Dream Walking?"" by Gene Austin, and ""Charmaine"" by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians.\nThe film received positive reviews from critics with a 80% ""Certified Fresh"" approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert gave the film 3 and a half stars out of four, writing ""The film is a shade over three hours long. I appreciated the extra time, which allows us to feel the passage of prison months and years.""\nForbes commentator Dawn Mendez referred to the character of John Coffey as a ""\'magic Negro\' figure""—a term coined by Spike Lee to describe a stereotypical fictional black person depicted in a fictional work as a ""saintly, nonthreatening"" person whose purpose in life is to solve a problem for or otherwise further the happiness of a white person. Lee himself berated the character as one of several ""super-duper, magical Negro[es]"" depicting a skewed version of the black male, claiming it was due to the prominence of white decision makers in the media companies.\nAwards and nominations\n- Nominated – Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role – Michael Clarke Duncan\n- Nominated – Best Picture – David Valdes, Frank Darabont\n- Nominated – Best Sound Mixing – Robert J.

These characteristics contribute significantly to the energy saving performance of the building . Fire resistance : Fire resistance AAC is non-combustible. It has one of the highest hourly fire resistance ratings per millimetre of any building material. This makes it an ideal choice for fire protection around steel columns and steel beams, and in the construction of shaft walls, stairwells, corridors and firewalls. A 100mm and a 200 mm non-load bearing wall shall have fir resistance of 2 hours and 6 hours respectively . Earthquake resistance : Earthquake resistance AAC has been used for many years in areas subject to seismic action. Building which consist fully or partly of AAC have in general terms shown good resistance to earthquake forces in practice. The light weight of AAC reduces the seismic forces in common with some other materials. The non combustible and fire resistance nature of the AAC material is an advantage against fires commonly associated with earthquakes.\nThe low weight of AAC in relation to its strength is an intrinsic advantage for earthquake design. AAC permits the designer to reduce the mass of the structure, limiting the impact of accelerations introduced in seismic situation. AAC IS 100% RECYCLABLE : AAC IS 100% RECYCLABLE The waste factor in its construction can be reduced to less than 1% with good construction management.\nNearly every piece of the material can be used in the construction of an AAC building.\nAll waste, however, is easily recycled.

68	difference cabinetmaker carpenter dust protection	While cabinetmakers focus on detailed furniture work compared to carpenters who handle larger projects, both must be careful with wood dust. When working with woods like cedar, redwood, mahogany and teak, dust can cause allergic skin and respiratory reactions. Proper ventilation and appropriate respiratory protection, such as approved particulate dust masks, are necessary safety measures.	"[""What is a Cabinetmaker?\nCabinetmakers are artisans.\nThere is something very special about a handmade piece of furniture for your den or living room, or custom made cabinetry for your kitchen or bathroom. Unlike prefabricated pieces, fine wood furniture is built to last for generations.\nA cabinetmaker will build to a customer's specifications, providing the customer with original drawings of what the finished product will look like. Various woods, materials and styles can be used.\nWhat does a Cabinetmaker do?\nBefore the art of industrial design came to be, cabinetmakers were responsible for the entire creation process of a piece of furniture, from its initial conception to its shape and colour all the way to final production.\nSome of the more famous cabinetmakers like George Hepplewhite, Thomas Chippendale and Thomas Sheraton even authored books about the art of furniture making, featuring their designs and compositions.\nWhat is the difference between a carpenter and a cabinetmaker? While both professions master the art of working with wood, it is the cabinet maker who goes one step further by focusing on the finer details of the wood and what one can do with it. It is this attention to detail that distinguishes them from carpenters.\nCarpenters concentrate on much larger projects, such as framing a house, building a deck etc., while cabinetmakers focus on detail work, more complex building materials and the construction of furniture pieces and cabinets used within a house.\nCabinetmakers work with a vast array of tools like a saw table, drum sander, and dust extraction system. They also carry with them a selection of hand tools like laminate trimmers, cordless drills, finish staplers and jigsaws. They work with wood glue, nails, screws, dowels and other fasteners to create finished furniture and cabinets.\nMeasuring the client's interior space accurately is imperative, whether it's for making kitchen cabinets that fit perfectly within the space available, or making a piece of furniture with exact proportions. Creating drawings for the client of what the finished piece will look like is necessary in order for the client to visualize and proceed with the project.\nBefore starting any project, it is necessary for the cabinetmaker to prepare a list of what project materials, tools and type of wood that he/she will need. This is something that will not only save a cabinetmaker's time, but will help to keep the project within budget for the client.\nAside from the technical prerequisites, a cabinetmaker also requires other skills, such as precision, patience, perseverance, dedication, and pride of workmanship. A project, depending on the skill of the carpenter and the difficulty in making a particular piece, may take a couple of days or stretch up to weeks or months at a time.\nWhat is the workplace of a Cabinetmaker like?\nCabinetmakers can work in either a commercial or a residential setting. They can be self-employed or employed by furniture manufacturing and repair companies, construction firms or cabinetmaking contractors. There are other venues as well, such as crafting wood interiors for boats, planes, or hotels.\nNearly all of the work is done indoors in large, well-lit and well-ventilated areas.\nCabinetmakers are also known as:\nCabinet Maker Cabinet Builder Furniture Maker Furniture Builder"", 'Many solvents pose serious health and safety hazards, and the government is increasingly regulating worker exposure and overall usage. Epoxy users commonly use solvents to dissolve epoxy from tools and to degrease surfaces before bonding. Solvents’ ability to dissolve and degrease is part of why they are hazardous to your health. They leach oils from the skin and break down protective fatty layers. This makes skin more susceptible to dermatitis. While dermatitis is the most common skin problem solvents cause, it doesn’t stop there.\nOnce solvents have penetrated the protective skin layers, they may quickly find their way into the blood stream. You can absorb toxic amounts in this way. If you use solvent to clean epoxy from your skin, your skin can absorb both the solvent and the dissolved epoxy. This will intensify epoxy exposure.\nAlmost all solvents are toxic if you swallow, absorb or inhale enough. Solvents can irritate your respiratory system, eyes, and skin. Some solvents may damage your heart, liver, and other vital organs. Several solvents have been linked to cancer.\nRepeatedly inhaling low to moderate levels of solvents can irritate the respiratory tract. Because of their drying effect, solvents can also interfere with the lung’s natural ability to clean themselves of impurities. When inhaled in high concentrations, solvents may depress the central nervous system. This is called narcosis. Symptoms of overexposure range from nausea and irritability to something that resembles alcohol intoxication. Continued overexposure to particularly toxic solvents can lead to loss of consciousness, permanent brain damage and death.\nSome solvents give off a strong odor when highly concentrated, while others do not. Even for those that do, you may not notice the odor after you are exposed to it for a few hours, or if you have a cold. If you notice a strong odor while using a solvent, vapors may already be too highly concentrated and you will need to ventilate more or use a supplied-air respirator. Many milder solvents are being developed to replace the more hazardous solvents. If the manufacturer of solvent claims its product can be used on the skin, you should follow instructions carefully, and wash afterward with warm, soapy water.\nOSHA sets Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) for chemicals, based on the amount or vapor level a worker can safely be exposed to in a given time period. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists also sets exposure levels based on an 8-hour time-weighted average, called Threshold Limit Values or TLVs. These values are expressed in parts of contaminant per million parts of air.\nAlways select the least toxic and least flammable solvent that will get the job done. Avoid solvents completely if at all possible.\nDo not smoke or use equipment that may generate sparks near solvent vapors or solvent storage areas. Store solvents in tightly closed, approved containers. Store them a safe distance from any ignition source and out of children’s reach.\nUse solvents only in well-ventilated areas. Bring fresh air into your shop and exhaust solvent laden air. In confined areas, wear the appropriate respiratory protection. If you can, set up a basic mechanical ventilation scheme for all projects calling for solvents.\nTake special care in hot weather, when solvents evaporate quickly and are more likely to ignite.\nDo not operate power machinery or climb ladders if you have been working with solvents in a confined area. If you feel drowsy, nauseated, *high* or irritable while using solvents, immediately move to an area of fresh air. First aid for unconsciousness resulting from overexposure to solvent vapors is fresh air.\nMost solvents are extremely flammable. By themselves, in paints, or other products, solvents cause many shop fires. The fire hazards that solvents pose may be their greatest threat, to both human health and property. You must follow basic shop safety rules whenever you use them. Research the flash points and evaporation rates, and use adequate ventilation. Remove all ignition sources. The table below lists some important comparative health and flammability information for solvents commonly used in the shop.\nAn explosion can happen when solvent vapors mix with high concentrations of fine dust particles suspended in the air. Even by itself, wood dust is explosive. The finer the dust particle, the greater the chance of explosion. Also, as temperatures increase, an explosion can happen at lower solvent vapor concentrations. One worker, hand sanding, could not raise enough dust to cause an explosion, but several people operating power sanding equipment could.\nAn open flame can set off an explosion, as can an accidental charge of static electricity or a spark from a combustion engine, light switch or power tool. Some fine powders and fillers can generate enough static electricity to ignite a flammable atmosphere. When handling large quantities of powdered material, keep airborne concentrations to a minimum and use grounding devices on transfer equipment.\nDust from partially cured epoxy can cause respiratory problems if inhaled, and dermatitis if allowed to settle on skin. Dust from fully cured epoxy is chemically inert and considered a nuisance dust from a health hazard standpoint. However, enough cured epoxy dust suspended in the air could creat a combustible dust atmosphere.\nDust from woods commonly used with epoxy, such as cedar, redwood, mahogany and teak, can cause allergic skin and respiratory reactions. Wood saps and oils contain irritants. These allergens are reduced as lumber dries, so it is always better to work with seasoned wood.\nDust from minerals, such as asbestos and crystalline (not amorphous) silica are dangerous because of their shape, which makes them difficult to expel from the lungs. This is also true of airborne glass, carbon and similar fibers, coming from cutting and handling glass tape or cloth, or from sanding or grinding a fiberglass composite. Use these materials only with adequate ventilation and appropriate respiratory protection, such as an approved particulate dust mask. For comfort and safety, avoid inhaling these dust!\nThe following sensible shop suggestions may help to reduce exposure to epoxy dust, wood dust and fillers.']"	['<urn:uuid:29c7337a-0c0d-45e6-8e0d-b36b4c711579>', '<urn:uuid:db55812f-8784-41f2-931f-46abce06943d>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	5	55	1531
69	How do the safety profiles of sublingual immunotherapy compare to traditional allergy treatments, and what are the specific medical circumstances that affect their administration?	Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has been used internationally for over 40 years with a favorable safety profile, even in children as young as 3 years old. The treatment must be postponed in specific circumstances including oropharyngeal infection, major dental surgery, acute gastroenteritis, asthma exacerbation, when PEFR is below 80% of personal best value, and during viral vaccine administration. For traditional allergy treatments, such as oral steroids like prednisone, there are significant short-term and long-term side effects. Short-term effects include insomnia, mood changes, blood sugar changes, and increased appetite, while long-term effects can include osteoporosis, changes in fat deposition, pituitary gland suppression, and acne. For this reason, oral steroids are generally used only for severe allergy symptoms and in short burst doses to limit these effects.	['Allergy Testing and Treatment\nAllergy Testing and Treatment\nApproximately 50 million American suffer from allergic diseases, the most common of which is allergic rhinitis. Symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis include itching of the nose and eyes, sneezing, nasal congestion, sinus pain and pressure, increased nasal secretions, and post nasal drip. Associated symptoms frequently include fluid behind the eardrum, cough, frequent throat clearing. Other commonly encountered allergic diseases include asthma and atopic dermatitis, or eczema.\nAllergy is defined as an exaggerated physical response to substances called antigens. Typically, these responses are due to binding of antibodies to the antigen, causing a cascade of effects. Cells called mast cells present within the nose and lungs contain these antibodies, called IgE, each of which recognizes a specific antigen. If the allergic patient is exposed to the specific antigen, the mast cell releases histamine and other substances which are responsible for the development of allergic symptoms.\nEvaluation of allergy involves detection of the IgE-mediated repsonse, either directly or by measuring levels of IgE in the bloodstream. Skin testing has been used for a century to detect abnormally sensitive responses of patients to very small amounts of antigens. Antigen is applied intradermally--within the deep layers of the skin--and the skin is observed for signs of histamine release. These include the “wheal” or swelling of the skin and “flare” or increase in redness of the skin. By observing these responses to various dilutions of antigen, clinicians can quantitatively measure the degree of allergic response observed. The other primary means of testing involves measurement of the specific antibody levels in the bloodstream. The degree of sensitivity can be determined based on the amount of specific antibody present in the bloodstream. Each of these testing methods is considered standard allergy testing and each have advantages and disadvantages. The type of testing performed is often an individual decision.\nThe simplest treatment strategy for the allergic patient is avoidance of the particular allergen. For some allergies such as peanut or egg, this is the only accepted means of treatment. Strict avoidance of these allergens prevents the development of symptoms. Other allergens such as molds or pollens are much more difficult to completely avoid and require treatment in the form of drugs or desensitization.\nPharmacotherapy--or the use of drugs--comes in many forms for allergy. Antihistamines have been used for decades to control the effects caused by histamine release upon exposure to allergens. First generation anithistamines such as Benadryl or Atarax are still effective, but often have unwanted side effects such as drowsiness. Second generation antihistamines have more specific binding to histamine receptors and thus prevent many of the unwanted side effects. Examples of these drugs include Claritin, Zyrtec, Allegra, and Xyzal. These drugs are commonly used for allergy patients. For patients with allergic rhinitis, nasal steroid sprays are workhorse agents. These drugs limit the inflammation caused in the nose by allergen exposure. They are generally used daily and several of the preparations can be used in children as young as two years of age. Examples include Flonase, Nasonex, Nasacort, Omnaris, Rhinocort, Veramyst. Topical antihistamine sprays such as Astelin, Astepro and Patanase have antihistamine effects confined to the nose, generally with few if any systemic side effects. The last major group of medicines are oral steroids such as prednisone, which are the most potent drugs used but also have the greatest number of side effects. Short term effects can include insomnia and mood changes, changes in blood sugar, and increased appetite and weight gain; effects of long term use include osteoporosis, changes in fat deposition, suppression of the pituitary gland, and acne. These drugs are generally used for severe allergy symptoms and in short burst doses in order to limit these effects.\nDesensitization, or immunotherapy, is the process of exposing allergic patients to low, increasing doses of allergen in order to build a tolerance to the allergen. This is believed to be accomplished by inducing the body to create antibodies which block the release of histamine when the allergic patient is exposed to an allergen. This is accomplished by administering small doses of the allergen on a weekly basis, either with subcutaneous skin injections or drops placed beneath the tongue. The dose is escalated to a maximal dose and then this maintenance dose is then continued to be administered. Typical duration of therapy is 3-5 years. By the completion of therapy, this treatment protocol is often highly effective in preventing allergic symptoms.\nSouthwest Idaho, Ear, Nose and Throat has been providing allergy evaluation and treatment options to patients for many years. The otolaryngologists in the practice are trained in the medical and surgical management of ear, nose, and throat disorders and are thus uniquely qualified to care for the manifestations of allergic disease. The doctors work closely with two full-time allergy nurses in both the evaluation and treatment of patients with allergic disease. Using diagnostic tools such as allergy testing, nasal endoscopy, and sinus CT scans, the treatment plan for each patient is customized in order to maximally improve symptoms as quickly and effectively as possible.\nAmerican Academy of Otolaryngology', 'What is immunotherapy?\nImmunotherapy is a method for treating an individual’s allergic response to a single or a multitude of antigens (pet dander, dust mites, plant pollens, fungal spores, insect venoms and certain foods). Immunity to these antigens is accomplished by subjecting the patient to small doses of the specific antigen(s) for which they exhibit an allergic reaction. This treatment is administered over an extended period of time ranging from 1 to 2 years. Currently there are two different applications of Immunotherapy: Subcutaneous Immunotherapy (allergy shots) and Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT).\nWhat are the differences between Subcutaneous Immunotherapy (allergy shots) and Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT)?\nAllergy shots are ONLY administered by a physician in his/her office by injecting the patient with a vaccine up to three times per week. Allergy shots represent a time consuming, painful and expensive treatment method. SLIT on the other hand is a painless, home-based treatment option that is accomplished by placing a diluted allergen extract solution under the tongue twice a day.\nIs Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT) safe and effective?\nSLIT has been utilized as a treatment for allergies for more than 40 years internationally. There are more than 150 peer reviewed articles and a number of books written regarding the safety and efficacy of SLIT.\nIs Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT) safe and effective for children?\nThe favorable safety profile of SLIT is reported in children as young as 3 years of age.\nFiocchi A, Pajno G, La Grutta S, et al. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunology 2005; 95:254-258.\nIs sublingual immunotherapy an FDA approved therapy?\nSublingual immunotherapy is not an FDA approved therapy. The use of sublingual immunotherapy in United States is considered to be an off-label use of an FDA-approved antigen product.\nIs it permissible to use the US licensed extracts for subcutaneous immunotherapy for SLIT, i.e. ‘off-label’ use?\nThe off-label use of products is not illegal. You are responsible for knowing the indications (on or off label) as well as the risks and benefits of any product you use in treatment of a patient. While pharmaceutical companies are prohibited by law from advertising off-label use of any of their products, physicians may use any FDA approved products for any indication she/he thinks appropriate. There should be published literature substantiating the off-label use indication. Use of approved medications off-label should also include a thorough risk/benefit/alternative discussion with the patient and documentation of the discussion and mutual decision to pursue treatment.\nDo I need Informed Consent from a patient and/or their family, if I am providing off-label use of a medication? If so, what sort of information should be discussed during the informed consent process?\nYes — the patient must be informed of the off-label use of the medication and the reason for using this product off-label. As in any informed consent, all components of the informed consent must be provided to the patient including diagnosis, reason for use, risks, benefits, alternative therapies, risks if no treatment is provided, and probability of success. There should be a recording of the informed consent discussion. In a case such as SLIT, it is recommended that a patient sign the consent form as this is the best indication that the consent was obtained.\nWhat type of information should be provided to patients receiving SLIT treatment?\nOne important factor to consider is that SLIT treatment is administered at home with no direct medical supervision. Physicians will need to provide specific instructions to the patients on how to administer the allergy extract, manage adverse reactions, prevent treatment interruptions, recognize situations in which the dose should be withheld, and manage dosing adjustments for any or all of these variables. Other considerations include whether injectable epinephrine should be routinely prescribed, the patient’s ability to comply with the regimen and the patient’s response to a potential adverse reaction. The EAACI Immunotherapy Task Force recommended the following in their “Standards for Allergen-specific Immunotherapy”:\n“The scientific documentation for treatment schedules and dose modifications is limited. For routine treatment, following the guidelines from the manufacturers is sensible.\nThe administration of sublingual immunotherapy must be postponed in the following circumstances:\n- In the presence of oropharyngeal infection.\n- In the case of major dental surgery.\n- Acute gastroenteritis.\n- Exacerbation of the asthma.\n- PEFR <80% of personal best value.\n- Simultaneous administration of viral vaccines”\nCan I get reimbursed for SLIT?\nThere is no FDA approved formulation and no CPT (billing code) for this therapy in the United States. An FDA approved SLIT formulation would be needed to apply for a new reimbursable CPT code. Medicare specifically states that it does not cover sublingual immunotherapy (see excerpt below). Most insurers would not reimburse for SLIT services, if there is no CPT code or FDA approved formulation. Therefore, the patient would need to personally pay for the costs associated with SLIT.\nSource: Page 14 of Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual Chapter 1, Part 2 (Sections 90 – 160.25) Coverage Determinations (Rev. 45, 12-06-05)110.9 – Antigens Prepared for Sublingual Administration (Rev. 1, 10-03-03) CIM 45-28\nFor antigens provided to patients on or after November 17, 1996, Medicare does not cover such antigens if they are to be administered sublingually, i.e., by placing drops under the patient’s tongue. This kind of allergy therapy has not been proven to be safe and effective. Antigens are covered only if they are administered by injection.']	['<urn:uuid:bd30c69f-4200-48e0-a828-0c587bd46f78>', '<urn:uuid:8728c2bd-99bc-4d91-a0d0-cce525116249>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	24	124	1737
70	I'm planning my first automatic garden irrigation setup and I'm concerned about water pressure issues. What components should I include in the connection system to ensure proper water flow from my house to the garden?	You need to install several components in sequence: First, attach a Y connector to the water line outlet at the house (where the garden hose normally connects). Then attach a backflow preventer to the system timer, followed by a pressure regulator connected to the backflow preventer. Finally, install a swivel adapter to the pressure regulator, which connects to the main line of the watering system.	['Watering a vegetable garden can be a hassle for gardeners. To avoid the problem of knowing when, and how much, to water, the gardener can install a homemade watering system. One method is a drip irrigation system. Setting up drip irrigation can save time, money, water and labor in a single season. This system can be installed in one day.\nLay out the design of the watering system on paper before placing the pipes. Draw the boundaries of the property. Sketch in the outline of where the vegetable garden will be on the property. Draw in the house location. This will give you a good estimate of dimensions, distance and length for the watering system.\nLay out the actual watering system to get an idea of what the setup looks like. This gives you an idea of potential problems before connecting and using the system. Use the elbows or corners to fit the main line to the shape of the vegetable garden. Avoid using 45-degree angles as this can cause a backflow problem within the system. Use a center line system for small or narrow areas and a perimeter system for large or spread-out areas. Put the main line as close to where the plants will be as possible; this ensures the feeder lines to individual sections of the garden are as short as possible.\nInstall the Y connector to the water line outlet at the house. This is where the garden hose normally attaches to the house. Use the connector to have access to both the watering system and garden hose for dual applications. Attach the backflow preventer to the system timer. Attach the pressure regulator to the backflow preventer. Attach the swivel adapter to the pressure regulator. Attach the main line of the watering system to the adapter.\nSet up the 1/4-inch lines from the main line to run near the plants so water goes directly to the roots. Put the feeder lines between rows if you are using a row system for the vegetable garden; place the feeders running between hills or in a starburst pattern with the ends in the middle of the garden for hill layouts or spot gardens.\nPunch sets of emitter holes on three sides of the lines, using the hammer and hole punch. Put the holes next to the plants. Attach the end caps at the end of the line.\nSet up wood blocks under the lines before or after each set of emitter holes. This will help create the drip for the irrigation and avoids drowning plants and clogged lines. Put the main line over weed fabric to protect it; put garden mulch over the main line if you wish to hide it from view or prevent tripping or damage.\nAttach the garden hose to the faucet at the house. Attach the other end of the garden hose to the backflow preventer; this will attach the entire system to the water line. Test the system by turning on the water. Adjust the lines as needed to ensure proper placement of the lines and proper water flow. Set the timer once the watering system is functioning properly.\nPlace the clamps over the lines. Set hair pins at the ends of the clamps to hold them in the ground. Start at the faucet and set the clamps every 3 feet. Continue setting the clamps until the main line and all feeder lines have been clamped into position. Make sure not to cover emitter holes.']	['<urn:uuid:23351d45-73d4-4fad-a70a-9cad1e33d1f8>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	35	65	581
71	working in agtech business benefits green farming methods challenges implementing satellite ai solutions	Satellite and AI solutions in agriculture offer several benefits for green farming. Through platforms like Hummingbird's Project Hawking, farmers can optimize crop production by using satellite data and AI algorithms to identify crop health issues, forecast diseases, and create targeted agrochemical applications. This reduces blanket chemical input and negative environmental effects. However, implementing these solutions faces challenges - historically, processing satellite imagery took months, though now systems can deliver analysis within 24 hours. The technology requires building complex system architectures to process satellite data, adapting front-end interfaces, and training AI algorithms with thousands of satellite images matched to existing datasets.	['Original Article on ESA Space Solutions\nWhen SME Hummingbird was created in 2016, it had a clear mission: “Measure sustainability, optimise food production and push the boundaries of science and technology through sophisticated modelling and predictive analytics”. Through ‘Project Hawking’ with its remote sensing platform, Hummingbird is now solving challenges in yield losses, inefficient inputs, unsustainable practices and poor decision making.\nBefore Project Hawking, Hummingbird Technologies Ltd., an artificial intelligence (AI) business based in London, were identifying crop health issues and forecasting the occurrence of possible diseases and weed pressures in the field by using UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) imagery processed by its AI algorithms. This imagery was also used to produce variable rate fertiliser and other chemical application maps.\nIngenuity struck with Project Hawking, a collaboration funded and supported by ESA Space Solutions, where Hummingbird started adding satellite observation points throughout the growing season to the process. Hummingbird was now able to build an extensive time series of data to apply its proprietary machine learning techniques..\nThe added dimension of satellite data\nThis deep, new layer of intelligence complemented the existing UAV platform, enabling increased accurately geo-referenced UAV and ground truthed (information gained via direct observation rather than inference) captured imagery during the image acquisition.\n“The first step was for Hummingbird to build the system architecture necessary to process satellite data from ESA as well as other higher resolution commercial imagery,” says Olivier Becu, Technical Officer at ESA. “Next they needed to adapt their existing front-end to display the generated high-value information to customers”.\nHummingbird started to train AI algorithms with the thousands of satellite images they collected and matched with existing datasets. The aim was to develop a processing chain delivering satellite-derived vegetation index maps. Data and imagery were collected from the various satellite providers and processed using the platform, with analysis of crop health, yield and rate of change provided. This included vital data such as the identification of disease and disease prevalence as well as soil type mapping by reflectance data.\nWith Hummingbird’s Crop Identification tool, you can determine the planted area of Canola, Cereals, Pulses and Maize / Soybean in-season. (Image credit: Hummingbird Technologies Ltd.)“Project Hawking cuts farm costs and improves yields by using satellite data to provide predictions in macro analytics and targeted agro-chemical applications, with the aim of reducing blanket agrochemical input. This reduces the negative environmental effects of agrochemical overuse, promotes responsible stewardship, and reduces the natural resistance build-up in crop diseases,” Alexander Jevons, Hummingbird Technologies Ltd.\nIn a matter of months, Hummingbird was set up with multiple satellite data sources delivering timely optical measurements and radar data at various geographical resolutions. Over the course of 2019, Hummingbird made its AI/satellite derived maps available to a set of trial users as part of a pilot project. This project involved large farm management company Velcourt and Cranfield University for scientific support.\nThe fruit of this pilot was a freemium satellite offering that gives users access to basic satellite analysis with the ability to upsell higher resolution analysis where needed. By the end of 2019, more than 5000 farmers across the world had requested access to the data. Many of these farmers have now subscribed to the commercially available Hawking service.\nFor almost all of the stages of crop development, Hummingbird can support the farmers to achieve more with less: seeding, fertilising, treating and forecasting yield for all major crops. Hummingbird has now launched commercial operations in Ukraine and Russia, Australia, Brazil and North America.\n“As a result of Project Hawking and ESA funding Hummingbird has conducted a successful raise of £8.2m and grown the company to over 60 people globally with three international subsidiaries,” Alexander Jevons, Hummingbird Technologies Ltd.\nESA Space Solutions\nESA Space Solutions aims at reaching commercial exploitation of space assets, data and capabilities addressing incubation, proving technical feasibility and business development. This includes the development of operational services for a wide range of users through the combination of different systems, and support in creating viable companies as well as to existing companies.', 'Green Technology Can Foster a New Era in the Agricultural SectorJune 3, 2022\nDue to climate change and growing food demand, modern agriculture inevitably moves towards sustainability via green technologies implementation. Sustainable development implies, among other things, the efficient use of natural resources and energy. The conditions of food production are increasingly attracting the attention of consumers. And we are talking not only about the introduction of new technologies in the production process, improving the quality of raw materials and products, but also about reducing the negative impact on nature. In particular, selection in crop production, improvement of mineral fertilizers, development of new green technologies to improve soil fertility, biologization of intensive agriculture, switching to alternative energy sources, the use of geospatial data, and more can become key tools for the sustainable development of the agricultural sector and help producers compete in the international arena. In this article, we will focus specifically on two of the biggest pillars of green tech implementation in agriculture — satellite imagery analytics and alternative energy use.\nSatellites Improving Agricultural Sustainability\nThe use of geospatial technology, satellite imagery analytics in particular, for monitoring agricultural land was considered a promising direction decades ago. Back then, to get one image of the Landsat satellite, it was necessary to analyze the data contained on four magnetic tapes. Three months could have gone only for pre-processing, after which one could finally see a satellite photograph.\nToday, thanks to geospatial solutions development, you can get an image ready for analysis within 24 hours after shooting. More so, the market is overflowing with digital solutions for fast, effective and all-in-one farm management tools like one by https://eos.com/. With the help of such instruments, farmers can benefit from the following environmental and operational advantages:\n- Smart, data-driven decision-making to detect problem areas timely and prevent yield losses\n- Timely reaction to weather related threats thanks to forecast, historical and current weather data\n- Smart crop rotation planning based on reliable field productivity data\n- Selection of the most productive seed varieties\n- Resources preservation and costs saving thanks to the ability of implementing VRA approach based on each field zone’s needs\nGeospatial data is imperative to the enhancement of farm management. Accurate crop mapping, crop health tracking, moisture level change detection, and smart field activities planning are only some of the opportunities satellite imagery analysis provides to agriculture. Combined with weather information and field equipment data, growers get to manage their farm in the most efficient way while increasing yields, preserving resources, and being sustainable.\nFarm Equipment Running on Alternative Energy\nInnovative alternative energy sources are no longer projects for the long term, they are already actively entering the life of various sectors of the economy and compete with diesel and gasoline. This is especially true for agriculture, where diesel fuel is the base for almost all self-propelled models of tractors, combines, sprayers and trucks. Farmers and agrarians understand the value of saving resources and optimizing costs. That is why more and more world-famous brands have recently announced their new products based on new types of fuel that can significantly reduce the costs of agricultural producers, while reducing the environmental impact.\nCompressed or liquefied natural gas, methane, has become the most popular alternative fuel, which has received the greatest distribution and practical application in agriculture. The main advantage of this type of fuel is a high level of efficiency, since the price of gas is almost three times lower than that of oil fuel. The technology also minimizes environmental damage and atmospheric pollution with harmful toxic elements.\nThe second most popular, not even a type of fuel, but an innovative source of energy in the market of agricultural machinery and machinery is electricity. For example, technologies for the use of solar energy for the agro-industrial complex solve a wide range of tasks in the field of farm activity. Can be implemented in any of its branches. The presence of free territories and a significant area of roofs and walls of houses and outbuildings makes it possible to receive and accumulate large amounts of free electricity.\nInstallation of photovoltaic systems is carried out for the production of electricity, which can be used to operate pumps, electric knives and other equipment, as well as to provide electricity to residential buildings. Air collectors are used for heating and ventilation of premises, creating a comfortable living environment for people, farm animals and maintaining temperature and humidity at a necessary level. Hotbeds and greenhouses equipped with solar panels not only retain heat and accumulate it, but also provide the necessary microclimate for plants.\nThe use of green technology enables making any process faster, more convenient and of higher quality. Thanks to the use of various innovative platforms in agriculture, there is not only an increase in the quantity of products, but also an improvement in its quality.']	['<urn:uuid:bdde2593-6bc6-4c98-ab56-160a13f8122e>', '<urn:uuid:73ddaa37-33c0-4b7f-80e3-1172c3f4aa8a>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	13	100	1482
72	I oversee conservation partnerships and I'd like to understand how different conservation programs handle landowner agreements - what are the key differences between CRP's contract system and Safe Harbor's approach to landowner participation and their respective impact on conservation outcomes?	The CRP operates through long-term contracts with specific acreage caps and funding limitations, currently working under a statutory limit of 25.5 million acres for FY 2022, with four million acres up for retirement in 2022. The Safe Harbor Program, on the other hand, offers more flexible agreements that can extend up to 99 years from 2006, with landowners able to cancel with a 60-day notice. Safe Harbor participants receive a 'Certificate of Inclusion' and are only responsible for maintaining their baseline number of protected species groups, while CRP participants must adhere to specific rental rates and program requirements. Both programs are voluntary but differ in their approach - CRP focuses on retiring land from production, while Safe Harbor encourages active management for species conservation.	"['Launched in the depths of the 1980s Farm Financial Crisis, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a long-running cornerstone of farm bill programs. Initially implemented to primarily curtail burdensome ending stocks – and after years of ad hoc programs that idled more than 70 million acres annually – the goal of CRP was to create a long-term program with environmental benefits. Today, the program is a potential contender for environmental attributes. This week’s post reviews CRP’s declining acreage.\nIf you only skimmed press releases and media headlines, you might conclude that CRP acreage has been on the rise. But despite the recent attention, program acres have actually been declining, with seemingly no end in sight.\nIn 2020, acreage hit a low of 21.9 million acres, and preliminary data for 2021 suggests a total of nearly 20.6 million. This is significant because the acreage – aside from the start-up years – has never been this low. Prior to 2008, when the program hit a high of 37 million acres, it was common for acreage to range between 30 million and 35 million. In 2012, acreage slipped below 30 million and hasn’t looked back.\nThe Two Levers: Caps and Funding\nThe USDA essentially has two levers for managing the CRP program. First is the acreage cap set by the Farm Bill. The 2014 Farm Bill set an upper limit on acreage at 24 million. The 2018 Farm Bill increased the limit to eventually reach 27 million in FY 2023. For the fiscal year 2022, the statutory limit is 25.5 million acres.\nThe other consideration is funding. Figure 2 shows how total program expenses have trended over time. Since the mid-2000s, expenses – which include rental payments, cost-sharing, and incentive payments – have ranged from $1.7 to $2.0 billion. These are also nominal dollars, which means funding for the program has been eroded by general inflation over more than three decades.\nBehind the combination of fewer acres and flat funding, expenses are higher due to rental rates. While not shown, the average program rental rates were around $50 per acre throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Around 2007, however, rental rates turned higher and are now more than an average of $80 per acre.\nWrapping it Up\nThe CRP program has continued to lose acreage in recent years. CRP is recording acreage lows despite the 2018 Farm Bill increasing the acreage cap because USDA has to balance funding issues and higher rental rates. The trends are perhaps contrary to what many might expect, given the interest in and conversations about the program.\nLooking ahead, it will be critical to monitor three trends:\n- How popular and important will CRP be for meeting any environmental or carbon reduction goals set by the White House or Congress?\n- How will future farm bills navigate the acreage cap and funding issues? Both act as a minimum, and, as observed in the current farm bill, increasing the cap alone likely won’t increase acreage.\n- How will retirement affect the acreage totals? Four million acres of CRP will be up for retirement in 2022. Beyond 2022, retirements will be less significant given some of the cyclical nature of long-term contracts. From 2020 to 2022, more than 12 million acres were at the end of their contract.\nWithout additional funding, the trends of flat funding and higher rental rates will likely spell out a continued decline in CRP acreage. Since 2007, program acreage has declined by nearly 17 million acres. The rate of any future declines would be affected by the change in rental rates and contract expirations. Given that the Farm Bill is written in five-year increments, the next Farm Bill will have consequential implications for the fate of the program.', 'What is the Safe Harbor Program?\nFlorida\'s Safe Harbor Program for red-cockaded woodpeckers is a\nvoluntary program that is designed to involve private landowners in\nthe recovery of the federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker.\nThe agreement is authorized between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife\nService (FWS) and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation\nCommission (FWC) under the federal Endangered Species Act.\nSecretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt introduced the concept of\nthe Safe Harbor program in 1995.

Over half of all endangered species reside on\nprivate lands. In Florida, private lands provide habitat for as\nmuch as 10 percent of the red-cockaded woodpecker population. By\nengaging private landowners in activities that will benefit the\nRCW, more habitat is created to help existing populations.

73	difference between mcnaughton penley political art style comparison	While both McNaughton and Steve Penley are artists on the political right who depict iconic political figures, their styles differ significantly. McNaughton's work is distinctly allegorical, with icons representing deeper meanings and containing barely veiled allegories that send clear messages. Each figure in his paintings is charged with moral significance. In contrast, Penley portrays political icons in a straightforward, non-allegorical way. McNaughton's paintings are also characterized by numerous small references and details that viewers can discover upon closer inspection.	['In recent years, Jon McNaughton has emerged as one of the most well-known artists on the political right.\nHis 2011 painting The Forgotten Man, a not-so-subtle criticism of Barack Obama, became famous when Fox News host Sean Hannity bought it after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election.\nA longtime champion of McNaughton’s work, Hannity promoted a more recent painting, Respect the Flag, when McNaughton unveiled it in February of this year.\nThe painting, which depicts Donald Trump standing on a football field clutching a tattered and dirtied American flag, elicited giddy ridicule from Trump detractors and strong praise from Trump supporters.\nMcNaughton himself has recently admitted that he’s “a little perplexed” at how well his paintings are selling. Yet there’s clearly something about them that resonates; people love to talk about his art, whether out of hatred or love.\nWhat’s so special about McNaughton’s work? As a philosopher of art, I wanted to explore what makes McNaughton’s work distinctive from other political art on the left and the right.\nMcNaughton’s allegorical style\nAs political artworks, McNaughton’s paintings are firmly realist: The political message here makes explicit reference to its subjects. Each has an well-known icon, whether it’s a president, historical figure, the American flag or the Constitution.\nThere are many works of political art that don’t make explicit reference to their subjects: Consider Nam June Paik or Ai Weiwei, whose works are meant to explore political issues without using realistic depictions.\nOther artists on the right, such as Steve Penley, also depict iconic political figures. But Penley’s work is not allegorical the way that McNaughton’s is. Instead, Penley portrays icons in a straightforward way.\nWith McNaughton, the icon often represents something, and each of the paintings contains a barely veiled allegory that sends a crystal clear message. We know exactly how McNaughton feels about his subjects; each figure is instantly charged with moral significance.\nBarack Obama stepping on the Constitution represents his supposed abuse of the Constitution. Meanwhile, Trump’s attempt to clean the flag apparently represents his supposed respect for the national anthem.\nMcNaughton’s works are also packed with many little references.\nJournalist Marian Wang wrote of McNaughton’s One Nation Under God that “the details and symbolism here are impressive and painstaking.” Look for a long time, and you’ll be surprised to find new details charged with meaning – just like, say, Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights.\nIs directness a bad thing?\nNonetheless, to many art critics, McNaughton’s work seems derivative and cheesy. The New Yorker’s Peter Schjeldahl writes of The Forgotten Man that “the bathos of the scene practically cruises for ridicule.” Art critic Jerry Saltz says that McNaughton’s work is “typical propaganda art, drop-dead obvious in message,” and “visually dead as a doornail.”\nThere might be a lot of details, like Bosch, but the analogies are clearer in McNaughton’s paintings – and more clearly charged with moral sentiment. Saltz’s complaint is that the messaging here is too obvious.\nDoes the clarity make it bad?\nPolitical art is often praised for being direct. Look no further than Keith Haring’s activist work. Or consider Leo Tanguma’s The Children of the World Dream of Peace. These pieces seems to share a clarity and obviousness with McNaughton’s work.\nSo McNaughton’s themes might be obvious, but that’s not enough to make it bad. Perhaps, as Susan Sontag once suggested, critics like Saltz suffer from a partisan impulse when they complain about its directness. Or perhaps the critics are not complaining about the clarity exactly, but the tawdry imagery and too-easy literalism that is peculiar to McNaughton. Though it seems this criticism should then also apply to Tanguma’s “The Children of the World Dream of Peace.”\nIn any case, the directness of McNaughton’s work can’t be the only reason that it’s intriguing, and his critics might be missing a central aspect of its appeal.\nTapping the well of grievance\nBut there’s an apocalyptic element to McNaughton’s work that doesn’t occur in either white evangelical art or patriotic art. Both evangelical and patriotic artworks have an optimistic bent to them – indeed, patriotic art is almost always fiercely optimistic. With some exceptions, like Teach a Man to Fish, McNaughton’s work tends to be characterised by a deep pessimism.\nIn his analysis of conservatism, The Reactionary Mind, political scientist Corey Robin presents a novel view about conservatism. To Robin, it’s not primarily a view about capitalism, a view about freedom or a view about rights. Robin argues that at its heart, conservatism is the view that traditional power relations should be maintained.\nRobin claims that conservative arguments are often motivated by feelings of aggrievement and complaints about what has been lost. This happens when progressive causes are advanced – when same-sex marriage is legalized, for example, or when abortion is legalized. According to Robin, whenever equality is gained by some groups, other groups lose privilege. Conservatism frequently involves complaints about this lost privilege.\nLoss is central theme in many of McNaughton’s works – loss of the Constitution, loss of respect for the flag, or loss of whiteness in politics. The crestfallen figures in The Forgotten Man and Respect the Flag seem to embody this loss, and it reflects the increasingly lost privilege certain Americans, whether it’s white evangelicals or the elderly, might feel.\nRobin also argues that – despite its apparent frustration with the language of the left – conservatism often adopts progressive language for its own purposes. For example, conservatives often complain about “intellectual diversity,” claiming that the supposedly tolerant left does not tolerate conservative ideas. Notice, however, that conservatives, in making this argument, are using the progressive language of diversity.\nSimilarly, McNaughton’s work co-opts certain themes of progressive art to suit his own conservative purposes. A prominent theme in political art on the left is a kind of bleakness, or darkness. Consider Nancy Spero’s Search and Destroy, Diego Rivera’s The Uprising or Goya’s Third of May, 1808, each of which depict grim moments, from rape to execution. Likewise, McNaughton’s work depicts Obama’s presidency with a darkness that is usually absent in politically conservative art.\nWhether we’re motivated by love or by mockery, part of our interest in McNaughton is the paint-by-numbers interpretation, and the fact that there are many small tidbits to search out and interpret. But the darkness and the sense of loss help to make McNaughton’s work especially unique. Perhaps unwittingly, McNaughton deploys classic tenets of conservative rhetoric in an original artistic context.\nJohn Dyck, PhD Student in Philosophy, CUNY Graduate Center.\nThis article first appeared on The Conversation.']	['<urn:uuid:71088f64-e508-45f2-91f0-cf95d1c7a89d>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	8	79	1092

These videos show slow motion footage of tackles, send off offenses, and player management scenarios. There's also an 'Ask, Tell, Dismiss' video that demonstrates how to handle misbehaving fans.	"[""What's in your tool box?\nBesides the tangible tools we need for each game, knowing the how to’s of refereeing is our #1 tool.\nEach of us attended an entry level clinic that gave us a basic understanding of the Laws of the Game. It’s on the field where we apply what we have learned and it’s on the field where we will make mistakes. It’s what we do after the game when we’ve made mistakes that determines our success in the referee program. Do we solicit advice? Ask questions from a higher level referee or do we shrug our shoulders, collect our pay and go home?\nEvery aspect of refereeing is taught over the course of your referee career. From mechanics to positioning and everything in between, whistle tone variation, what your body language is saying, effective use of cards, player management. It’s a true on-the-job learning experience.\nNo matter how long you stay in the referee program, will you ever see every possible scenario that a game can present? No. Because of this fact and the fact that the game evolves all the time, add to it the element of managing attitudes, you must invest in gaining more knowledge in all areas of refereeing.\nThe number one characteristic that assignors, instructors and mentors look for in all referees is teachability. Can he/she improve? If the answer is yes, this is a very fun, challenging, and rewarding way to spend your weekends.\nHow do you better prepare for the next game? Look around you. Find the seasoned, respected higher level refs and ask….can you help me? In the 19 years that I’ve been doing this, I have never met anyone who said, “no”. Anyone that I’ve asked for help whether it was for my personal benefit or for a group of referees, said, “sure”.\nAsk your assignor to team you up with a more experienced referee. Ask a higher level referee to observe you on a game for a while. Watch others on the level of games you are working. See how they manage players, get 10 yards on free kicks, and watch their running pattern or where they position themselves on set plays.\nBesides on the job training, where do you go for more knowledge? One website that is invaluable to your success that you should be referencing during the season is: www.ntxreferees.org. You will find info on EVERY law of the game, from injury management, to why you would add time, to how to determine handling. You can refresh your memory with mechanics, offside and restarts. Click on Laws & Memos and start learning. If you have been officiating for at least 3 years or doing games at the U14 level and up, you need to be referencing – “Advice to Referees.” If you plan on entering the upgrade program, this is a MUST read. I recommend you read it from cover to cover and then go over Laws 12 & 14 prior to the start of the season as a refresher.\nAnother site is, www.ussoccer.com; click on referees, resource center – downloads/online training. Maybe you are a visual learner. This site has dozens of helpful videos. You can view in slow motion and over and over what an ugly tackle looks like, what a send off offense for serious foul play looks like. Every class I teach for NTX, I’m always asked, “what do I do with the fan that makes my game miserable?” This site has the “Ask, Tell, Dismiss” video which is very helpful. It reminds you to go to the coach for help w/misbehaving fans since we have NO authority over fans and spectators.\nAnother great way to add to your toolbox is local training opportunities. When your local area invites you to training, make plans to attend. Typically the training is geared around a few target areas. This is always a safe environment to practice, ask questions, and maybe do some role playing. Every association that I visit has a solid referee program led by people whose goal is to better equip you for the game. Remember, the players are investing many hours into perfecting their skills; as referees we should be doing the same.\nKnowledge is our #1 tool in our toolbox. Expand it, build on it. The referee program is an ongoing continual education with every game we do. Learn from each game and remain teachable until the very end of your career. No matter how good you are, there will always be someone around to help make you better.\nHave a great season.\nArea 13 Referee Administrator""]"	['<urn:uuid:63610dee-00cb-4c15-a1ac-53d64a7373f0>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	14	43	768
75	treatment requirements filtered stormwater injection perth vs berkeley rainwater collection	In Perth, stormwater must be filtered through an AMIAD multi-stage filter to 2 micron before injection into the aquifer, while in Berkeley, rainwater collected in rain barrels does not require any treatment, though a first flush diverter is recommended for watering edible plants.	"[""Demonstration that MAR can be successfully used at a local scale\n- Capped groundwater allocations: Perth’s drying climate means that groundwater levels are in decline, and water allocation limits have been imposed. The fundamental objective of this project is to provide the shire with an alternative and sustainable water source for irrigation purposes into the future. The Hartfield Park Reserve is the largest sport and recreation reserve within the City of Kalamunda, and as such is a high priority site for irrigation.\n- Dry climate: Annual rainfall is less than evaporation and has resulted in a substantial reduction in streamflow and groundwater levels.\nHarvesting stormwater from an urban drain to replenish local groundwater using MAR for parkland irrigation\n- Hydrological investigations: Stormwater is harvested from Woodlupine main drain which conveys water from the Kalamunda Hills into Perth’s urban drainage system. This drain is located alongside Hartfield Park. A detailed MAR feasibly investigation was undertaken for Woodlupine Brook to ensure the volume of water harvested could meet the irrigation needs of the park without impacting the downstream waterway environments.\n- Aquifer investigations: Aquifer investigations were undertaken on the capacity and permeability of the shallow superficial aquifer and deeper Leederville aquifer to ensure stormwater could be stored and recovered without impacting other irrigators and nearby wetlands. While there is still some uncertainty on the properties of the shallow superficial aquifer, it is likely recovery should be close to 1:1 because water will be recovered after 6 months of injection.\n- MAR solution: The water is harvested and injected into the Leederville aquifer in the winter months via injection bores, and extracted in the summer months when irrigation is required. The use of infiltration ponds was initially proposed as the injection method, however investigations showed an impermeable layer of clay extending over most of the site, making this unfeasible. Prior to injection, stormwater is filtered to prevent bore and aquifer clogging. A low maintenance, self-backwashing AMIAD multi-stage filter package is used which can filter water to 2 micron.\n- 2015 trial project: A trial project was undertaken to test the feasibility of the MAR scheme using the superficial aquifer. Water was extracted intermittently from the drain from late July to August 2015. An existing production bore at the park was retrofitted to inject filtered water into the aquifer. The water level response and water quality was monitored in the aquifer through the trial. The initial results showed less than expected flows (only 4,400kL of filtered stormwater was recharged during the initial trial period), which led to an extension of the trial. Despite the small volume of water recharged, the trial showed the stormwater quality was of a high standard and that the aquifer storage was greater than previously estimated.\n- 2017 trial project: The trial continued into 2017 due to the high risk of biological fouling that was observed in the 2015 trial. An activated carbon filtration unit was installed in 2016 to control biological fouling and the bore was pressurised to allow higher recharge rates to be achieved. Over the 2017 winter, 10,670kL of stormwater was recharged to the Leederville aquifer at a flow rate of 5.75L/s. There was limited biological fouling observed in this trial.\n- Successful trial project likely to lead to further applications: The positive results show the solution is technically viable and is likely to lead to the scheme becoming fully operational with a dedicated injection bore designed to receive up to 230,000kL. The project has also provided a template and acts as a demonstration site for other future proponents of MAR projects.\n- Multiple asset owners: Early engagement was required for all of the different asset owners and stakeholders to define the ownership of the MAR infrastructure because the elements were all managed under separate entities.\n- Uncertainty: There was uncertainty about the feasibility of the application of MAR at this scale. A trial was developed to ensure the system will work as designed and to understand the maintenance requirements of the project, which showed great success after two years.\n- Time required for assessments and approvals: Time needs to be set aside for feasibility assessments and the approvals process. Approvals were required from multiple agencies including the Water Corporation, Department of Water and Environmental Regulation. A Water Resource Management Operating Strategy was developed for the Stormwater Harvesting and Managed Aquifer Recharge Trial, which includes operating rules and contingency plans and was used to obtain the necessary water licences to commence the trial project. Several engineering challenges in the design, construction and commissioning of the infrastructure were required to meet the requirements outlined in this document and water licence conditions.\n- Climatic variability needs to be considered: Low levels of winter rainfall during the trial period resulted in low flow volumes in the drain and significantly lower recharge volumes than expected, highlighting the requirement for extreme climate conditions to be included in risk modelling.\n- Additional time required when using specialised equipment: Technical difficulties associated with commissioning the specialised equipment for the trial resulted in intermittent injection. This outcomes reduced recharge volume and highlighted that additional time is required during the scheduling and planning phase when commissioning specialised equipment.\nKalamunda, WA, Australia\n2018 – Winner IPEWA Awards of Excellence for Excellence in a Water Project\n2017 – Winner AWA WA, Innovating for Sustainability Award\n2015 – Finalist AWA WA Grahame Heal Water Sensitive Urban Design Award\n2015 – Finalist AWA WA Resource Management Award\nFinalist: Government Stewardship, Healthy Land and Water Awards\nFinalist: River Basin Management Society - Involving Community in Waterway Management\nCommendation: Minister's Urban Design Awards\nCities providing ecosystem services\nCities as water supply catchments\nCities comprising water sensitive communities\n|Payback period: The payback period for using MAR as a water supply scheme will be approximately 7 years, if compared with the cost of drinking water.||\nUse of existing assets: Using an aquifer as storage and filter does not require construction of stormwater harvesting storage or treatment infrastructure.\nCheaper than alternatives: Sewer mining and treatment was first considered as an alternative source, but this would have cost $18/kL.\nInterested in this solution?\nWe partner with small and large companies, government and industry in Australia and around the world."", 'Rainwater Harvesting: Rain Barrels\nThe California Plumbing Code has no approved standards for rainwater harvesting systems.

In 2014, ISIS conducted a violent campaign through Iraq's Nineveh province where they persecuted the region's 2000-year-old Christian community through crucifixion, beheading, rape, torture, and forced conversion to Islam. They sold Christian girls, some as young as three, at sex slave markets in Mosul, burned ancient churches, and attacked dozens of Christian towns in Syria. In 2015, they also beheaded 21 Egyptian Copts, which was videotaped and became a symbolic representation of this wave of persecution threatening Christianity in the Middle East.

The contributors attempt to move beyond a positivist mentality in order to evaluate the first principles of the natural law in which all human law is grounded.\nThe various chapters evaluate developments and application of theories of equality and non-discrimination in the history of Western thought; in modern European practice; in contemporary inter-American practice; in the Asian setting; in the Middle East and North Africa; and in the Catholic canon law tradition.\nThe authors strive to restore a universally valid conception of equality and non-discrimination as understood within the Catholic tradition.\nIn summer 2014, ISIS waged a bloody blitz through Iraq’s Nineveh province, crucifying, beheading, raping, torturing, forcibly converting to Islam, and driving out every member of the region’s 2000-year-old Christian community. Christian girls, as young as three, were sold at ISIS sex slave markets in Mosul. Ancient churches were burned and ISIS attacked dozens of Christian towns in Syria.\nThe beheading in 2015 of 21 Egyptian Copts was videotaped by ISIS and became a searing, iconic symbol of this wave of persecution that threatens to eradicate Christianity in the Middle East. Many in the West, even Christians, remain unaware of the scale of this persecution, and even fewer know what can be done about it.\nInspired by Pope Francis’s denunciation of these acts as “genocide,” a group of Catholic legal scholars, writers, and theologians began work on The Persecution and Genocide of Christians in the Middle East. Its case studies focus on persecuted Christians, but its analysis equally applies to the other victims. In the United States, military and diplomatic responses are contemplated and sometimes undertaken.\nBut what about the legal system? Are there things we can or should be trying? That question animates this book as it explores various facets of religious persecution, examining ISIS’s ideology and their relationship to Islam as practiced by most Muslims, as well as exploring the nature of religious freedom.\nPractical, relevant, and rich in ideas, this book addresses the most crucial religious freedom issue of our day. It is a primer for Christians, students of international human rights, and all concerned about religious persecution.']	['<urn:uuid:3aa5acaf-1c2d-4b05-9969-e082bc8fb53d>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	10	82	984
77	What are the different types of risks that need to be monitored in an investment portfolio, and how are they typically evaluated by professionals?	Investment portfolio risks are evaluated through both quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative risks can be measured through statistical analysis using metrics such as Standard Deviation, Value-at-Risk, Beta, Sharpe Ratio, and M-Squared. These analyses can typically be performed using investment managers' software tools. Qualitative risks require more subjective analysis and include factors such as lack of liquidity (percentage of portfolio that cannot be liquidated within 5 business days), concentration (percentage held in the largest security), leverage (debt-to-equity ratio), and lack of valuation (percentage of assets without daily valuation). Additionally, performance evaluation involves examining both long-term and short-term risks through various benchmarking approaches and expert panel assessments to understand the return drivers and systematic exposures.	"[""A Business Manager's Duty to Monitor the Risk and Return of their Clients' Investment Portfolios\nThe Problem: You are a business manager and it is either explicitly or implicitly the case that you are responsible for monitoring the activities of the investment managers that have been entrusted with your clients’ capital. (If you are not a business manager or disagree with this statement, stop reading. This paper does not apply to you.) The problem is that most business managers do not have the internal systems, licensure, training, staff support, or time to conduct the independent monitoring functions that their clients expect of them and the law requires.\nThe Bogert treatise states that a fiduciary “…cannot assume that if investments are legal and proper for retention at the beginning of the [relationship], or when purchased, they will remain so indefinitely. Rather, the [fiduciary] must systematically consider all the investments of the [portfolio] at regular intervals to ensure that they are appropriate” (A. Hess, G. Bogert, & G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees §684, pp.145–146 (3d ed. 2009)). If a business manager is a fiduciary acting on behalf of their client, part of that responsibility includes an ongoing investment review process that monitors the risk and return that was produced by the client’s investment manager. A prudent business manager will not “set it and forget it.”\nThe Target Return\nThe investment manager’s actual performance will initially be compared to a targeted rate of return that the manager was hired to produce. This begs the question whether the business manager and their client have taken steps to define a targeted rate of return for the portfolio. If they have not, they are encouraged to do so. The Target Return can be expressed as an an absolute number (e.g., 6.0%) or as a real, inflation-adjusted number (e.g., Inflation + 3.0%).\nNo single benchmark can precisely measure the acumen or shortcomings of the investment manager. The most prudent approach is to compare the risk and return of the actual portfolio against several key performance indicators to judge whether the client’s investment objectives are being accomplished. It is rare that a benchmarking study would ever conclusively prove that the manager was either exceptional or incompetent. More often, such a study would conclude that the manager’s performance was or was not within a reasonable range of return and risk outcomes. Common benchmarks that are used in a benchmarking study are: 1) the benchmark suggested by the investment manager; 2) a Strategic benchmark which only includes the major asset classes; 3) a Tactical benchmark that is designed to exactly match the sub-asset class allocation of the actual portfolio; and 4) a Peer Group benchmark.\nThe Quantitative Risks\nIn addition to measuring the manager’s performance against several benchmarks, there must be an evaluation of the risk that has been accepted by each manager. Some forms of risk can be discovered through statistical analysis. Often used statistical risk measures include Standard Deviation, Value-at-Risk, Beta, Sharpe Ratio, M-Squared, et cetera. This type of analysis for a marketable portfolio can be easily done by the software the current investment manager has access to. (If they cannot do this analysis it should put doubt in their ability to balance risk and return since they are not able to monitor the risk of the portfolio.)\nThe Qualitative Risks\nOther types of risk that cannot be deduced from statistical inquiry and require a more subjective analysis.\n- Lack of Liquidity: The % of the portfolio that cannot be liquidated within 5 business days.\n- Concentration: The % of the portfolio held in the single largest security.\n- Leverage: The % of leverage used within the portfolio as reflected in a debt-to-equity ratio.\n- Lack of Valuation: The % of the portfolio assets that do not have daily valuation.\nGet help. Most investment managers, if provided with this overview, can help the business manager create a record that these factors have been considered and documented. If the investment manager is unable to help develop such a record, a prudent business manager will take steps to independently evaluate these factors or find an investment manager that is willing and able to do so."", 'Portfolio Evaluation: Benchmarking for Success\nAlthough portfolio evaluation is the last step in the portfolio management process, it is by no means the least important. On the contrary, proper performance measurement, attribution, and appraisal can enhance the probability of success for the entire investment process. Improper evaluation, on the other hand, can directly create some of the often-criticized issues in the investment industry. (For example, Nobel laureate Myron Scholes believes benchmark and tracking error can derail an investment process. I discussed what this meant with him in detail last week in Tokyo. Stay tuned for my write-up.)\nIn this fourth installment in the multi-asset strategies series, we discuss three important issues in portfolio evaluation and some institutional investors’ best practices.\n1. How should we deal with the conflict between long-term investment goals and short-term evaluation cycles?\nMany investment managers follow investment processes that are inherently long term. For example, value strategies often take a full market cycle to bear fruit. If investors hold such managers to a quarterly evaluation cycle, conflicts often arise. Understandably such managers’ returns may end up in the bottom quartile in a quarter. Investors expecting otherwise will be disappointed. Worse, if the managers are forced to modify their process and deliver more consistent returns, they might be become disoriented.\nSmart investors have come up with different approaches to deal with this potential conflict.\nAccording to Chiew Kit Tham, managing director at GIC, his firm measures its own performance over a 20-year horizon. He does not think the 65% equities and 35% bond reference portfolio is appropriate for use as a short-term return yard stick but more as a risk measure. He admits that external active managers have a much tighter leash, although private market managers are allowed more time to demonstrate their competence.\nThe success of the Thai GPF fund is judged by its performance relative to consumer price index (CPI) over 10 years, says Nachcha Protpakorn, deputy secretary general of the Thai Government Pension Fund (GPF). Each year they also measure the portfolio’s performance against a global benchmark reset each year opportunistically.\nMy Take: Measuring a multi-asset strategy’s long-term performance over inflation and short-term volatility relative to a simple equity plus fixed income reference portfolio seems to help motivate managers to resolve the conflict between long-term goals and short-term evaluation cycles.\n2. Should performance evaluation be quantitative or qualitative?\nVarious formulas come to mind when people talk about performance evaluation. The standard attribution formula is an integral part of the CFA® curriculum. GIC also uses regression analysis over various periods to measure return drivers in their portfolio, such as equity, emerging markets, and credit. The team will then adjust portfolio exposures accordingly where necessary.\nRichard Brandweiner, CFA, CIO of First State Super, prefers using the expert panel approach. His team focuses on the economic rationale and systematic exposures (i.e., factors) in their analysis. They look at each manager and debate what the key contributing factors are to the portfolio’s performance. Brandweiner limits the discussion to three exposures in each case so as not to over-engineer the outcome.\nFor the overall portfolio, Richard crosschecks the return/risk exposure and the probability of achieving these.\nMy Take: The key to performance evaluation is understanding the return drivers. There is no inherent conflict between the qualitative and quantitative approach. In fact, I believe they are complementary. The quantitative approach can make the assessment more objective, while the qualitative approach might help illuminate the big picture and deliver a sanity check. A good quantitative model requires good intuition while good qualitative analysis can always benefit from the validation that a quantitative assessment of the same portfolio provides.\n3. Should performance for active and passive portfolios be measured differently?\nTomas Franzén, chief investment strategist at Second Swedish National Pension Fund – AP2, thinks so. AP2 has developed tilted indices for portfolios they manage in-house using an active quantitative process. They reserve the market-weighted indices for use in evaluating the passive funds.\nMy Take: Using a tilted index is the natural evolution as our understanding of return drivers improves over time. A value manager will increasingly be asked to outperform the value index and not just the broad market as investors are educated on the impact of value and other factors on portfolio performance.\nAn important caveat is that we need not lose sight of the long-term goal (total return) of investing when drilling down to drivers of active returns. Total returns are apparently more relevant for asset owners and average investors while understanding active return drivers is of critical importance in manager selection. Only a holistic review provides the full picture.\nIn summary, portfolio evaluation can be much more than just producing a score card. There are various approaches investors can take in the process to enhance portfolio performance.\nThis is the fourth article in the multi-asset strategies series. The first three posts were: “Multi-Asset Strategies: A Primer,” “Three Key Decisions in Formulating an Asset Allocation Strategy,” and “An Advance in Portfolio Construction.”\nFor more in-depth coverage of these topics, Multi-Asset Strategies: The Future of Investment Management is available to CFA Institute members.\nIf you liked this post, don’t forget to subscribe to the Enterprising Investor.\nAll posts are the opinion of the author.

78	Do bars and weed shops have similar age restrictions?	While there are some differences, both types of establishments have strict age restrictions. For bars/pubs in Germany, entry is prohibited under age 16 without parental supervision, and 16-17 year olds can stay until midnight without parents. For cannabis dispensaries in New York, entry and purchases are strictly limited to those 21 and older, with mandatory ID checks for every transaction. Both types of businesses must verify customer ages and cannot serve visibly intoxicated individuals.

Other parts of the law are expected to be implemented over the next twelve to twenty four months, including: allowing individuals over the age of 21 to purchase and consume cannabis and cannabis-products at retail dispensaries, and the implementation of a business licensing scheme which will allow for growing, processing, distributing, and selling cannabis products throughout New York State.\nIn terms of cannabis sales, the legislation divides the cannabis market into three distinct segments in New York. First is adult-use cannabis, otherwise known as recreational marijuana. Next, is medicinal cannabis, which was legal prior to the passage of this legislation and will now be expanded. Third, cannabinoid (“CBD”) and hemp products.\nLicensing of Recreational Cannabis in New York\nThe MRTA establishes a series of licenses that will allow for the growth, processing, distribution, and sale of adult-use cannabis in New York State. The MRTA prohibits vertical integration for licensees (except micro-businesses, and the Registered Organizations currently operating in the Medical program), in order to prevent the retail sector from being controlled by larger cannabis producers. The goal here is apparently to follow the tiered structure seen in New York’s alcohol market, which separates manufacturing, from wholesaling, and from retailing.\nTo apply, an Applicant must have a “significant presence” in the state; be incorporated or organized under the laws of the state; or have a corporate structure where a majority of the owners are residents of the state. Further requirements for the license applications will be developed by a five-member New York Cannabis Control Board (the “Board”) once the board is established under the Office of Cannabis Management (the “OCM”).\nHowever, at a minimum applications for licenses may include questions regarding the “applicant’s identity, including racial and ethnic diversity; ownership and investment information, including the corporate structure; evidence of good moral character, including the submission of fingerprints by the applicant to the division of criminal justice services; information about the premises to be licensed; and financial statements.” One of the main purposes of the legislation is to assist communities and individuals that were harmed as a result cannabis prohibition in the state. As such, the Board will utilize the demographic information from applicants to ensure that Social and Economic Equity Applicants have access to approximately 50% of all licenses offered by the state.\nThe Board has the authority to charge licensees’ a biennial fee based on the amount of cannabis that is “cultivated, process, distributed and/or dispensed” or based on the gross annual receipts. The Board has to waive or reduce these fees for Social and Economic Equity Applicants.\nThe Board will develop regulations to determine whether or not an applicant should be granted a license. Some factors the Board has to consider include:\n- Whether the applicant entered into a labor peace agreement with a labor organization to represent the applicant’s employee;\n- Whether the applicant proposes a plan to benefit communities and people disproportionally impacted by enforcement of cannabis laws; and\n- The number of licenses already issued in a certain area.\nSocial and Economic Equity Applicants\nSocial and Economic Equity Applicants fit within a set of specific racial, ethnic, and gender criteria. To be considered a social and economic equity applicant, the applicant must be from a community disproportionally impacted by enforcement of cannabis prohibition, a minority-owned business, a woman-owned business, a disadvantaged farmer, or a service-disabled veteran.\nA minority-owned business is a business that is owned by at least 51% minority members, is authorized to do business in this state, independently owned and operated, and a small business. A minority group member “shall mean a United States citizen or permanent resident alien who is and can demonstrate membership in the following groups… black…Hispanic…Native Americans… Asian and Pacific Islander.” Similarly, a woman-owned business follows the same criteria as a minority-owned business, except that it must be owned 51% by a woman. A business can also be a minority-women-owned business, but it is up to the applicant to determine whether she would like to categorize it as such. Both minority and woman owned businesses can include a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation.\nA disadvantaged farmer under the social and economic equity plan includes include a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation that farms in a county with a rate of poverty is greater than 10% or has been disproportionately impacted by low prices or loss of farmland (with the Board having discretion to further define this category). In assessing whether an applicant shall be issued a license under the social and economic equity plan, extra priority will be given to applicants that are members of communities that were disproportionately impacted by the enforcement of cannabis prohibition, who have income lower than 80% of the county where the applicant resides, and were convicted of marijuana related offenses, or had a parent, guardian, dependent, or spouse convicted of a marijuana related offense.\nFor social and economic equity plan participants, licenses cannot be transferred or sold within the first three years of issue except to another social or economic equity applicant with prior written approval of the board. After the three-year period, if social and economic equity applicant wants to transfer or sell its license, the Board, as a condition of the sale or transfer may require the license holder to pay the Board any outstanding amount owed on loans rendered to the licensee by the Board.\nAs a member of the social and economic equity program, applicants and ultimately licensees will obtain counseling, education, small business coaching, and compliance assistance from the state to assist in the growth and development of an adult-use cannabis business.\nThe Board is further authorized to give extra priority to an applicant who is member of a “community disproportionately impacted by the enforcement of cannabis prohibition”, has an income lower than eighty percent of the median income in the county where the applicant resides, and was convicted or is related to someone convicted of marijuana related offenses.\nAdult-Use Retail Dispensary License\nAdult-use retail dispensaries allow licensees to sell cannabis and cannabis products to retail consumers over the age of 21. A retail dispensary licensee may not hold more than three licenses and cannot hold or have an interest in another of cultivation, processing, microbusiness of cooperative license while maintaining a retail dispensary license. Prior to approval, the licensee must demonstrate to the Board that the licensee has possession of the premises that will operate as a dispensary or that the licensee will have possession within 30 days of approval of the license. The only statutory limitation to the location of a retail dispensary is that it cannot be within 500 feet of a school or within 200 feet of a house of worship. Furthermore, the premises must be located in a store, that is accessible from the street level and is located in an area occupied by other business, trade, or industry.\nDispensaries cannot sell alcohol, nor can the licensee have a license or permit to serve alcohol on the premise. Gambling and use or sale of other illicit drugs is prohibited. Employees of dispensaries must check customer IDs for each transaction and can scan the ID when applicable. Sales to those under 21 or visibility intoxicated or impaired are prohibited. Further, if an employee or licensee knows or reasonably should know that a customer is re-selling cannabis or cannabis products that customer must be refused sale. Both within and outside the retail store, branding and or advertising of cannabis or cannabis products is prohibited. But, within the store, the licensee is required to display prices of products either attached to or immediately adjacent to the item displayed. The Board will establish guidelines for the regulation of hours, the size and location of dispensaries (outside of the regulations set out in the MRTA), and the margin for markup that can be charged by the dispensary.\nBetween 30 and 270 days before applying for an adult-use retail dispensary or on-site consumption license, the applicant is required to notify the municipality in which the dispensary will be located of the applicant’s intent to file. Notification is required to the lowest level of government. For example, if the applicant seeks a license in the Village of Valley Stream, the applicant is only required notify to the clerk of the village, despite the fact that the Village of Valley Stream is located in the Town of Hempstead, in the County of Nassau. However, if an applicant seeks a license within New York City, the applicant must notify its New York City Community Board.\nThe municipality’s recommendation for or against the license will be part of the record the Board uses to make its final determination, but the recommendation may not be determinative. The Board is required to explain to the applicant how the opinion was considered in rendering its decision.\nAdult-Use On-Site Consumption License\nA unique provision of the MRTA allows for the establishment of an area licensed for the on-site consumption of cannabis. In essence, holders of an on-site consumption license can run marijuana “bars” (but cannot sell alcohol, nor permit gambling). A license is granted for a term of 2 years, after which the licensee can renew their application. Each licensee is limited to a maximum of three licenses of this kind and the licensee cannot hold a direct, or indirect financial or controlling interest in any other type of license. Prior to seeking a license, the proposed licensee must be in control of, or imminently be in control of the premises where the on-site consumption will be held. In determining whether to grant an on-site consumption license, the Board will assess the following factors:\n- The privilege of holding such a license;\n- The number, classes, and character of other licenses in the same municipality as the proposed on-site consumption license;\n- Evidence that all other necessary licenses and permits have been obtained;\n- Whether there is a need for a space to consume cannabis;\n- Effect of license on pedestrian or vehicular traffic and parking near the location;\n- Existing noise level and any alleged increase in noise levels; and\n- Other factors the Board may establish to promote the public.\nThe premises containing the on-site consumption area cannot have an opening or passageway allowing patrons to freely pass from the consumption site, to another area. The only adult-use cannabis that can be purchased and consumed at an on-site consumption site must be purchased from a distributor, cooperative or microbusiness in a container authorized by the board. Further, on-site consumption sites will be limited in the quantity of cannabis that can be sold per consumer. Licensees must keep detailed records of all transactions including what licensees the cannabis and/or cannabis products were purchased from and the sale of cannabis and/or cannabis products to customers.\nLicenses, Renewal, Changes\nLicenses under the MRTA expire two years after the date they are issued, but the licensee can renew their license. in the process of renewal, the applicant must submit to the Board (i) the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of applicant’s employees and owners; (ii) agree to adhere to the social responsibility framework agreement to be rendered by the board; (iii) have a labor peace agreement with a bona fide labor organization; and (iv) show evidence of plan benefitting communities.\nChanges to Medical Cannabis Laws in New York\nExisting medical Registered Organizations (“RO”) will be allowed to enter the recreational cannabis market in two ways, including potentially vertical integration. The RO’s may have up to 3 (adult-use and medical) retail locations of their own and can also distribute their products to other retail dispensaries. The RO’s can also obtain a license that will enable distribution, cultivation and processing of their own products. In exchange for vertical distribution, RO’s are required to maintain efforts in the medicinal marketplace.\nThe scope of the Medical eligibility for patients will also be expanded, by expanding the list of eligible medical conditions. Additionally, the MRTA allows medical cannabis to be grown outdoors, expands possession limits to a 60-day supply, creates the ability for facilities to administer medicinal cannabis to patients or residents, and removes a restriction on “smoking” medical cannabis and increases product selection. Lastly, the MRTA allows medical patients to “home grow” within 5 months of the enactment of the bill.\nChanges to CBD and Hemp Regulations in New York\nNew York’s Cannabinoid hemp program, created in 2019, will now be managed by OCM. The MRTA allows for the sale of cannabis hemp flower products, and contemplates that products meant to be smoked could be sold at adult-use cannabis dispensaries.\nNew York has successfully passed cannabis legislation, which in some respects takes immediate effect. However, in several significant areas, the MRTA is just the beginning, and further enabling regulations must be issued before applicants will be able to obtain licenses and begin a recreational cannabis business. As always, those interested in entering the recreational cannabis market should keep close track of these laws as they continue to develop and begin assembling a team and devising a strategy that will allow them to succeed in New York’s new potential legal cannabis market.\nMore Questions?

79	Which diabetes type has more severe initial symptoms?	Type 1 diabetes typically has more severe initial symptoms. It can quickly lead to life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis, coma, and shock if untreated. Type 2 diabetes develops more slowly with less noticeable symptoms, though it can still lead to serious complications if untreated.	"[""Looking for more information about type 2 diabetes? We’ve got all you need to know.\nWhat is type 2 diabetes?\nWhat causes type 2 diabetes?\nWe all need insulin to live. It does an essential job. It allows the glucose in our blood to enter our cells and fuel our bodies.\nWhen you have type 2 diabetes, your body still breaks down carbohydrate from your food and drink and turns it into glucose. The pancreas then responds to this by releasing insulin. But because this insulin can’t work properly, your blood sugar levels keep rising. This means more insulin is released.\nFor some people with type 2 diabetes this can eventually tire the pancreas out, meaning their body makes less and less insulin. This can lead to even higher blood sugar levels and mean you are at risk of hyperglycaemia.\nIs type 2 diabetes serious?\nAround 90% of people with diabetes in the UK have type 2. It is serious condition and can be lifelong.\nHaving type 2 diabetes without treatment means that high sugar levels in your blood can seriously damage parts of your body, including your eyes, heart and feet. These are called the complications of diabetes. But with the right treatment and care, you can live well with type 2 diabetes and reduce your risk of developing them.\nLearn more about diabetes complications.\nManaging type 2 diabetes\nLearning how to live with type 2 diabetes can be challenging, but we’ll help you to discover what works for you. Some people can manage it through healthier eating, being more active or losing weight. But eventually most people will need medication to bring their blood sugar down to their target level.\nLearn more about managing your diabetes.\nCan type 2 diabetes be cured?\nThere isn't a permanent cure for type 2 diabetes yet. But strong evidence shows that some people can put their type 2 diabetes into remission by losing weight. Remission in type 2 diabetes means your blood sugar levels are below the diabetes range, and you don't need to take diabetes medication.\nIt can be life-changing, but it's not possible for everyone.\nLearn more about diabetes remission.\nType 2 diabetes treatment\nThe treatments for type 2 diabetes help to manage blood sugar levels and also reduce your risk of diabetes complications.\n- eating healthy food, being as active as you can and keeping to a healthy weight\n- medications such as tablets and injections, that may include insulin\n- weight loss surgery\n- or other ways to put type 2 diabetes into remission. This means that type 2 diabetes goes away for some people, and they don't need to take diabetes medication anymore.\nMany people with type 2 diabetes will need to be on a combination of these treatments. Because everyone's different, it can take time to figure out what works best for you. Your diabetes healthcare team will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.\nLearn more about diabetes treatments.\nType 2 and insulin\nYou may not need to use insulin straight away but many people with type 2 diabetes need to use insulin as treatment at some point. If you need to start insulin treatment, remember that this isn’t your fault.\nSome people have very high blood sugar levels when they are first diagnosed. Insulin can be used as a short-term treatment to help quickly bring down your blood sugar levels.\nSome people may need to take insulin for a particular reason, like during pregnancy, a severe illness, or after surgery. But you may also need to start insulin as a treatment if other medications haven’t helped managed your blood sugar levels or aren’t appropriate for you.\nWhen you start taking insulin, you may notice that you start to put on weight. There are lots of reasons for this, like how much insulin you take, your diet and the type of insulin you’re taking. If you’re worried about putting on weight, or you’d like some help losing weight, then we’re here to help.\nIt’s still important to keep going to your appointments and manage your condition with healthy lifestyle choices. Staying active and eating a healthy diet will reduce the risk of complications from your diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes symptoms\nType 2 diabetes develops more slowly than type 1 diabetes. A lot of people don’t get any symptoms, or don’t notice them. But you may notice:\n- going to the toilet more often, especially at night\n- feeling more tired, because your body can't get enough glucose in to your cells for energy\n- losing weight without trying\n- genital itching or thrush\n- cuts and wounds taking longer to heal\n- blurred vision\n- feeling extremely thirsty.\nLearn more about the symptoms of diabetes.\nRisk factors of type 2 diabetes\nSome things can increase your chance of getting type 2 diabetes. Because the symptoms of type 2 diabetes are not always obvious, it’s really important to be aware of these risk factors. They can include:\n- Age. You’re more at risk if you’re white and over 40, or over 25 if you’re African Caribbean, Black African, or South Asian (Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi).\n- If you are living with obesity or overweight.\n- If your waist size is too large.\n- Ethnicity. You're more at risk if you're of African Caribbean, Black African, or South Asian (Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi) or Chinese descent.\n- Family history. For example, if you have a parent, brother or sister with diabetes.\n- Medical history. For example if you have a history of high blood pressure, heart attack or strokes, gestational diabetes or severe mental illness.\nWe’ve got more information about all of the risk factors, as well as a Know Your Risk tool that can help you discover your risk of type 2 diabetes within minutes.\nLearn more about the risk factors of type 2 diabetes.\nNewly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes\nKnowing where to get started following a type 2 diagnosis can be a challenge. You may feel overwhelmed, but it’s important to know there isn’t a one-size fits all approach to managing the condition.\nAs well as using the information on this page to understand your condition, you can meet other people with type 2 diabetes in our Learning Zone. You’ll hear advice from others in your position, and get practical tools to help you feel more confident managing your condition.\nWant to know more?\nWhether you are newly diagnosed, looking to improve your diabetes management, or in need of information to support others, we are here to help. We’ve got lots more information about:\nPreventing type 2 diabetes\nDid you know that with the right support, up to halve of type 2 diabetes cases can be delayed of prevented? Our information about preventing type 2 will show you some of the steps that can help you can take to reduce your risk of developing the condition.\nChecking your blood sugar levels\nChecking your blood sugar levels is an important part of managing your diabetes, so we’ll take you through how to check them and what your readings mean.\nLiving with type 2 diabetes\nHaving type 2 diabetes can bring up lots of questions about your lifestyle, but we’re here with the answers. From nutritional advice and recipes to help you know what to eat when you have type 2 diabetes, tips about diabetes and alcohol and keeping active and staying fit – we’re here to support you.\nType 2 diabetes is also associated with other health conditions, such as thyroid disease and dental problems. It’s important to be aware of these, so make sure to read our information about diabetes related conditions.\nType 2 diabetes is a complicated condition, and it may seem like there’s a lot of information to take in. If you’re feeling worried or stressed, we’ve got emotional support and advice that you may find helpful.\nFor some people, managing their diabetes with technology can be life-changing. But we also know it can be overwhelming if you’re not sure where to begin. Our information and guidance about diabetes technology will help you understand what the different types of tech do and how to access them, so you can find what works for you.\nResearch into type 2 diabetes\nWe have been funding leading research projects into type 2 diabetes for over 80 years.

Symptoms of type 1 diabetes generally develop quickly and can include tingling or loss of sensation in hands and feet, excessive thirst, excessive urination, extreme hunger, fatigue, weakness, blurred vision, vomiting, dehydration, and significant weight loss even with the consumption of large amounts of food.\nIf type 1 diabetes is not diagnosed and treated promptly, the body's cells do not receive the glucose they need for energy and the body is forced to burn fat stores for energy. As large amount of fats stores are burned, they substances called ketones are produced. When a large amount of ketones build up in the body, it can lead to a life-threatening condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. High amounts of glucose in the blood can lead to hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome, coma, and shock.

80	How does water from underground sources differ from other water supplies in terms of treatment needs?	Bore water, which comes from underground aquifers, can sometimes be found in perfect quality requiring minimal or no treatment before drinking. For example, in the Northern Territory, most rural communities source water directly from bores, and the only treatment required is adding chlorine to disinfect against possible contaminants in the pipe work that delivers the water. This is different from other water sources that typically require more extensive treatment processes.	['When are we really ready to consume the water that comes out of our taps?\nThe general population would be forgiven for giving little thought to the water they use. Living in Australia, having access to clean drinking water is something that we expect and often take for granted; however, the source, clarification, filtration, and disinfection processes of our water are complex and necessary to ensure that people are comfortable with drinking the water that comes from their taps.\n“People often think that we only take care of making water safe to drink, but there is also the issue of perception,” says Matt Wagland, Technical Sales Manager. “Would you be happy to drink water that is safe for consumption but appears murky? Safe drinking water often contains organics and debris that impacts the clarity of the product so we need to complete a filtration step to ensure the water is clear and therefore perceived as safe.”\nThis issue of perception is one that adds another stage to the water treatment process, a stage that gives us the clear liquid we are used to seeing. “The filtration process, while focused on producing liquid of a high clarity, does also make the disinfection process slightly easier too,” says Wagland.\nThe necessity of each stage of the process is initially determined by the water’s original source, be it rain water, bore water, or via a river catchment. Bore water is the most common source of water where an aquifer is found underground and testing is completed as different depths to determine the best quality of water. Water via this method can be found in perfect quality and no treatment at all is required prior to drinking. “In the Northern Territory, most rural communities are sourced with water direct from a bore; we simply add chlorine to disinfect possibly contaminants found in the pipe work that delivers the water,” says Wagland.\nOnce we have the water, the next stage is filtration which, as discussed earlier, is the cleaning of water so we are left with a clear product free of organics, sand, and other murky debris. Wagland describes that this three-step process including pre-dosing, clarification, and filtration:\nFlocculants are added to the water. These cause all the small particles in the water to stick together so they are heavy and will settle to the bottom in the clarifier. It also helps during filtration as all the particles are now larger, making them easier to take out with media (sand).\nThe water is then passed into a large tank and is left in there to settle all the solids to the bottom of the tank. The clear water is left to flow on over the top of a wall and into a settled water well.\nThis can either be a media (sand) filter or a membrane filter. Sand filters are the most common and are a very simple process which replicates how nature cleans water. Water is passed through a number of layers of sand starting from big to small sand particles. All the organics in the water such as algae, irons, or small metals get stuck in the sand and can’t pass through leaving only the fresh water. Membrane filtration includes a purpose built system with very small membranes made of either paper or cloth. The water is passed through these membranes at a high pressure and again all the organics are unable pass through. Membrane filtration is used as a disinfection process as well as a filtration process because the membranes are so small that not even small organisms can pass through them.\nFollowing the filtration of water, the disinfection process is set to begin. “While the filtration process produces water that looks clear and even safe to drink, the actual disinfection of the water hasn’t been completed yet. The most important step is ensuring that the water will not make you sick.” As well as membrane filtration, as detailed above, chlorine dosing and UV water treatment are common methods of disinfecting our water.\nThis is the most effective way of disinfecting water. It is added into the water and will kill any organisms present. After it has killed everything, it will remain in the water as a high reactive version of itself called free chlorine. Free chlorine levels are kept in all water supply to ensure that it is ready to kill any bugs that are introduced from the piping systems out to people’s homes.\nThis does the same as chlorine however it is done with a strong light at a set wave length. UV also kills a lot of bugs that are hard for chlorine to kill, so rather than dosing a lot of chlorine into the water supply, a UV is installed and does the majority of the work. Following the UV treatment, only a small amount of free chlorine is required to be added to the water.\nSo, while many people simply assume that their water goes through a ‘cleaning’ process before it is delivered to their homes, the stages of disinfection and filtration are more complex and unique than imagined. Like any commodity, consumer perception plays a huge part in the delivery of the end product.']	['<urn:uuid:19262cc5-ea7b-4d26-9e2c-12b18fb815b8>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	16	70	868
81	investigating tissue healing solutions how placenta based materials affect wound repair mechanisms	Placental-derived biomaterials promote wound healing through multiple mechanisms. They provide an extracellular matrix scaffold that mimics native tissue, encourage ECM remodeling, and facilitate cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. These materials exhibit important properties including biocompatibility, biodegradability, angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antifibrotic, immunomodulatory, and immune privileged features. They help address the problematic inflammation phase in chronic wounds by exerting anti-inflammatory effects and supporting tissue regeneration.	['Received: 31-May-2023, Manuscript No. jbtc-23-17006 ; Editor assigned: 02-Jun-2023, Pre QC No. jbtc-23-17006 (PQ); Reviewed: 16-Jun-2023, QC No. jbtc-23-17006 ; Revised: 21-Jun-2023, Manuscript No. jbtc-23-17006 (R); Published: 28-Jun-2023, DOI: 10.35841/jbtc.23.5.14\nChronic wounds pose a substantial burden on patients and healthcare systems, often exhibiting persistent inflammation and hindering the progression of wound healing. Placental-derived biomaterials have long been recognized for their remarkable properties, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antifibrotic, immunomodulatory, and immune privileged features. For over a century, these biomaterials have been utilized in wound management, offering an extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold that mimics native tissue, encouraging ECM remodeling, cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. The safety and efficacy of placental-derived biomaterials in wound healing are well-established in the literature, though more research is required to assess various aspects such as source, preservation techniques, decellularization status, design, and clinical applications.\nComplex wounds that are difficult to heal present a significant clinical challenge and are accompanied by considerable patient morbidity. Chronic wounds often remain stuck in the inflammatory phase of wound healing, leading to an imbalance of pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteolytic enzymes, and protease inhibitors. This results in elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that damage the ECM. Placental-derived biomaterials offer a promising strategy for treating nonhealing wounds due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low immunogenicity making them ideal for medical applications. Research has shown that these biomaterials promote wound healing by providing an ECM scaffold for tissue repair exerting anti-inflammatory effects facilitating cell migration and promoting regeneration. Despite these promising findings, more evidence is required to evaluate the use of placental-derived injectable scaffolds for wound healing. Wound healing is a complex and dynamic process involving several cellular and molecular events, including homeostasis, inflammation, cell migration, proliferation, and tissue remodeling. It can be divided into three distinct phases: Inflammatory, proliferative, and remodelling it is beyond the scope of this review. Wound healing is a remarkable process through which the body restores and regenerates damaged tissue following an injury. This intricate and dynamic phenomenon encompasses a diverse array of cellular and molecular events, orchestrating a harmonious sequence of homeostasis, inflammation, cell migration, proliferation, and tissue remodeling. Wound healing is divided into three distinct phases: Inflammatory, proliferative, and remodelling. The existing research establishes placental-derived biomaterials as a safe and effective treatment for the management of complex ulcers. The clinical application of placental-derived scaffolds in wound healing has shown positive outcomes, particularly for managing complex ulcers. However, further research is essential to understand how various factors, such as the source, preservation techniques, decellularization methods, design, forms, frequency of application, and administration methods of placental-derived biomaterials, influence clinical outcomes.\nStudies comparing the efficacy of decellularized and non-decellularized placental-derived biomaterials in wound management are warranted. Placental-derived biomaterials hold tremendous promise in wound healing, offering a safe and effective treatment option for complex wounds. As the field continues to evolve, understanding the impact of different variables on clinical outcomes will be crucial in optimizing their use. While this review primarily focuses on placental-derived scaffolds, it is essential to acknowledge the potential of placental-derived cellbased therapy as well, which may further enhance wound healing outcomes. Future research efforts should aim to bridge the existing gaps and unlock the full potential of placental-derived biomaterials in wound management.\nCitation: Kowalski G (2023) Harnessing Placental Derived Biomaterials for Enhanced Wound Healing.

82	What kind of music do performers from southeastern Nigeria usually make when it comes to rhythm and general style?	Igbo music, which originates from southeastern Nigeria, is generally lively, upbeat, and spontaneous, creating a variety of sounds that enables the Igbo people to incorporate music into almost all facets of their daily lives.	"['Igbo music (Igbo: Egwu nkwa ndi Igbo) is the music of the Igbo people, who are indigenous to the southeastern part of Nigeria. The Igbo traditionally rely heavily on percussion instruments such as the drum and the gong, which are popular because of their innate ability to provide a diverse array of tempo, sound, and pitch. Igbo music is generally lively, upbeat, and spontaneous which creates a variety of sounds that enables the Igbo people to incorporate music into almost all the facets of their daily lives. Some very popular Igbo music styles are Igbo highlife, Igbo rap, Odumodu.\nWhen examining the impact that music has on the culture of the Igbo people, one would have to look no further than the earliest accounts of the vast history of Igbo in Nigeria. Igbo people are speculated to be descendants of the people of the Nok culture that inhabited much of Nigeria from 500 BC to 200 AD. The Nok civilization is very popular because of the vast amount of colorful artifacts that they left behind, which include an array of musical instruments some of which on surface examination are somewhat similar to those found in Igbo Ukwu. It is not known when the beginnings or first vestiges of Igbo music sprung up. However, from the range of traditional lullabies, rhythmic proverbs and poems, work songs and general use of music in day-to-day life, music has influenced and shaped the culture in many ways.\nTraditionally music has been used to:\nThe drum is the most important musical instrument for Nigerians, and especially the Igbo people. The instrument is extensively used during celebrations, rites of passage, funerals, war, town meetings and an array of other events. Since this instrument is so diverse, many types of drums have been crafted and perfected over the years.\nThe pot drum instrument is called the Kim-Kim or Udu. It is typically dumb-bell shaped, and is around 27 cm-29 cm in height with an opening at the top that is about three to five centimeters. The base of the drum is about 13 cm-15 cm wide, and the head is around eight to nine centimeters wide. This instrument is typically used to produce bass. To achieve a low and deep sound, a minimal amount of water is added. To maintain a higher sound, a considerable amount of water is added to the pot. To play this instrument, the musician will brace it between her legs and grip the neck with her left hand. In order to produce a sound, the musician will cup her hand and beat the opening very rapidly. Usually, this instrument has been played by women and is used for traditional rites of passage, weddings, and community club meetings.\nThe Udu is the most common and popular drum. This instrument is also known as Nkwa, Egwe, or Egede, depending on the part of the country. These drums are not talking drums. Although they produce a sound which is tonal, syncopated, and generally melodious - they have never been known as talking drums and are not spiritual in nature or usage. Igbo people speak. The body of the drum is usually constructed from a hollowed out pear or cotton tree which is very durable yet malleable. The drum is then covered with antelope or cow skin. The hide is fastened tightly to the top and bottom of the instrument with seven to eight studs, and with rope in a decorative manner. The studs are able to be adjusted for tuning purposes and sound accommodation. If the studs are tightened a high pitch is emitted. The opposite effect is heard if the studs are loosened. Typically, more than one Igba is played by several drummers at a time. The drum can be played by using four fingers from each hand. The right hand is used to beat the head of the drum, and the left hand is used to stop the vibration. If the musician stops the vibration closer to the edge of the drum head,a low pitch will be emitted. If the musician stops the vibration closer to the center, then a higher pitch will be emitted. The Igba can also be played using a curved drum stick, which can be found wrapped in fiber to produce a soft sound, or ""naked"" to produce hard sound. This drum is very versatile and is usually played during celebrations, festivals, weddings, male and female rites of passage, and sometimes funerals.\nThe slit drum called the Ekwe is also very popular amongst the Igbo. This drum is constructed from a hollowed out palm, bamboo, or pear tree trunk. Once the trunk has been cleaned, two horizontal slits are carved into the base as well as a narrow slit connecting the two. This drum is played using a ""naked"" wooden drum stick to strike the head. The Ekwe produces a distinct sound and for this reason is usually used for signaling an emergency, community meetings, or warning of intruders\' presence.\nThese instruments are another important part of Igbo music. While not as important as the drum, these instruments do provide much needed rhythm and accompaniment.\nThe most prominent Gongs are the Olu and the Ogene. The Olu is a large Gong, about four feet long. The Ogene is smaller Gong and is about eight inches long. The Olu and Ogene are played by rhythmically beating the base of these instruments in cadence with the rest of the ensemble. The Ogene is used mostly for complimenting drums and other percussion instruments. It is also very useful in helping dancers time their movements and gestures. The Olu produces a very distinct sound and is mostly used to warn the community of any danger or as a call for attention in case of an important announcement.\nOther instruments include a woodblock known as okpola, a wind instrument similar to the flute, called an oja and the ichaka. The Igbo also have a style of music called Ikorodo, which is when all the musical instruments are played together with vocal accompaniment.\nThe instrument is played by hand and produces a special and unique bass sound  by quickly hitting the big hole. Furthermore, the whole corpus can be played by fingers (some experienced players also use toes). Today it is widely used by percussionists in different music styles.\nThough Igbo music remains very traditional, it has undergone some changes in old times. In the 60\'s and 70\'s a new genre of music was born called Igbo highlife. This was a fusion of traditional Igbo music and Western African highlife. It combined fast tempo Latino beats and colorful reggae, with rhythmic West African sounds. Recently, Nigerian rappers have also brought changes to the palates of the Igbo people with the infusion of hip hop, a crossover style of music that incorporates Afro-American elements and Igbo lyrics.\nSome popular Igbo musicians include: Sir Warrior (Head of Highlife), Oliver de Coque (King of Highlife), Celestine Ukwu, Onyeka Onwenu, Chief Stephen Osita Osadebe, Bright Chimezie (Duke of Highlife), Nico Mbarga, Oriental Brothers (Stars of Music), Faze, Dr Alban, Lemar and Nnenna Freelon.

83	how many known copies exist prototype 1587 de jode map	Only two known copies exist of the 1587 prototype of the de Jode map, with one copy being discovered in 2009	"[""Barry Lawrence Ruderman Antique Maps presents a wonderful collection of printed and manuscript maps in their Catalog 4. It is filled with rare, historic, and important maps. While the greatest concentration is from America, as in today's United States of, it extends to Latin America, a few from Asia, Australia, Europe, and the world. Here are a few samples of what you will find.\nWe start with a trip back in time to when the world was much younger, and much less well known. Item 1 is Hemispherium ab Aequinoctiali Linea... a map of the world produced by Cornelis de Jode in 1573. This is one of the earliest maps depicting the world from twin polar hemispheric projections. These maps display a combination of knowledge and lack thereof. Only a century after Columbus, large areas of the world remained only vaguely understood. As the Spanish and Portuguese, two major exploring nations of the 16th century, attempted to hide their knowledge for competitive advantage and security, mapmakers had limited resources from which to draw. Asia and North America are shown as separated by only a narrow strait, the “Strait of Anian,” rather than a wide ocean. Japan is situated just off the American coast. The Arctic is composed of four segments, one of which connects to Asia, making a northeast passage impossible. The mouth of the St. Lawrence River is as wide as the distance between Asia and America.

Pringle, upon Lake Champlain, the 11th of October 1776. This map was published by William Faden of London on Dec. 3, 1776. That title is filled with irony. Of course, the most obvious is that Benedict Arnold, later a turncoat to the British, was commanding the American fleet. He was a hero before he was a traitor. The use of the word “defeat,” while technically true, did not really describe the results of the Battle of Valcour Island. The British overwhelmed Arnold's smaller force, but the latter managed to delay their advance. The weather had already turned colder, with snow in the air by this time. British General Carleton concluded it was too late in the season to maintain his supply lines to Quebec, so the plan to push on to the Hudson River and divide America between New England and the South would have to wait another year. Had the British been able to complete the plan in 1776, the war might well have ended barely after it began. Faden may have understood this when he printed this version of his battle map as the original version credited General Carleton as the commander, while this one credited Captain Pringle. It may be that by this time, Carleton no longer wanted to be associated with his “victory.” $22,500.""]"	['<urn:uuid:79cc14d0-51be-4a8a-8e32-5f8021e5cf58>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	10	21	607
84	What are the main drawbacks of direct grounding vs HVDC systems?	Direct (solid) grounding has drawbacks including high fault currents causing system instability, interference with neighboring systems, and difficulty handling with circuit breakers. Meanwhile, HVDC systems face issues with expensive converter stations, complex multi-terminal control requiring continuous communication, and power faults during AC system short-circuits.	['Methods Of Neutral Grounding (Neutral Earthing)\nNeutral grounding also called as neutral earthing is a technique used to protect the power system from abnormal fault current and hence the stability of the power system won’t get affected. The different methods of Neutral Grounding (Neutral Earthing) techniques are discussed below.\nIn Solid Grounding, the neutral point is directly grounded to earth by a metallic connection or a wire which is having negligible resistance or reactance. During abnormal condition, the fault current flows through the neutral which is linked to the ground. The healthy phases won’t get affected by fault current.\nThe following figure shows the Solid Earthing.\nLet R, Y, and B be the three phases. Consider a fault has occurred on the phase B. In Solid Grounding Technique the fault current flows through the neutral which is linked to the ground. The Healthy phases won’t get affected by the fault current.\nDisadvantages of Solid Grounding:\n1. The high fault current can make the system unstable.\n2. The fault current can interfere with the neighboring systems.\n3. The circuit breakers are difficult to high fault currents.\nThe highspeed circuit breakers can be used to overcome the drawbacks.\nThis method is only suitable for voltages below 33KV.\nIn Resistance Earthing, the neutral point is not directly grounded, instead, it was done by using a current limiting resistor. During abnormal condition, the fault current flows through the neutral through the current limiting resistor. The healthy phases remain healthy and don’t get affected by fault current.\nThe following figure shows the Resistance Earthing.\nLet R, Y, and B be the three phases. Consider a fault has occurred on the phase B. In Resistance Grounding, the fault current flows the neutral via a current limiting resistor. The healthy phases won’t get affected by the fault current.\nAdvantages of Resistance Earthing:\n1. The neighboring system interference can be minimized.\n2. The arcing ground hazards are minimized.\n3. The system stability can be improved.\nThis method is suitable for the systems with voltages in the range between 2.2KV and 33KV.\nIn Reactance Earthing, the neutral point is grounded through a reactance. During abnormal condition, the fault current flows through the reactance which is connected between neutral and earth.\nThe Circuit representation of Reactance Earthing is shown in the figure.\nLet R, Y, and B be the three phases. Consider a fault has occurred on the Phase B. The Fault current will flow through the neutral Via Reactance. The healthy phases won’t get affected by the fault current.\nDrawbacks of Reactance Earthing:\nThe increase in reactance will increase the transient. This method is only used in case of satisfactory purpose and Less budget.\nArc Suppression Coil Grounding:\nThis system is also referred to as Resonant Grounding. This system consists of a Peterson coil or arc suppression coil or ground fault neutralizer whose function is to self-extinguish the arcing earth fault and in the situation of sustained faults, it should reduce the earth current to a low value so that the system can supply power with one line earthed.\nThe system works on the principle that when inductance and capacitance are connected in a parallel configuration, resonance takes place between them and because of resonance characteristics, the fault current can be reduced or it can be neutralized.\nLet R, Y, and B be the three phases. The figure shows that the fault has occurred on the phase B. The coil is tapped to select reactance according to the length of the transmission line.\nThe following expression is used to evaluate the reactance of the coil L = 1/ (3*ꙍ* ꙍ *C)\nThe circuit breaker will close and open automatically during fault current using the trip circuit.\nThis method of grounding technique is used in the high-end transmission line. The main aim of this grounding technique is to protect the power system from fault current which occurs due to lightning.\nVoltage Transformer Earthing:\nIn this method of earthing technique, a single-phase voltage transformer is connected to the neutral point. The system now acts as an insulated neutral system. The Voltage transformer provides a very high reactance earthing. A surge diverter is used between earth and neutral to prevent the voltage rise.\nConsider a fault has occurred on the phase B. The fault current passes through the Single-Phase Transformer. A surge divider is also provided to prevent the rise of voltage.\nThe overvoltage which arises due to the arcing ground is eliminated.\nIn case if transformers or generators is delta connected or if there is no possibility for a neutral point, the neutral point can be created with the star connected earthing transformer. Those transformers don’t have secondary and each phase of primary has two equal parts. There are three limbs with each limb has two windings.\nThis method is suitable for the operating voltages between 2.2KV to 3.3KV. In case there is no availability of Earthing Transformer, a Star-Delta Transformer can be used.', 'High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC)\nFew weeks back I posted an article about advantages of HVDC over HVAC transmission systems. Advantages of HVDC are numerous and very well recognized, but like everything on this earth this system has other side too.\nThe eight main disadvantages of HVDC transmission systems, including DC links connecting HVAC systems area, are summarized and briefly explained below:\nDisadvantage #1 (expensive)\nConverter stations needed to connect to AC power grids are very expensive.\nConverter substations are more complex than HVAC substations, not only in additional converting equipment, but also in more complicated control and regulating systems.\nDisadvantage #2 (complex)\nIn contrast to AC systems, designing and operating multi-terminal HVDC systems is complex.\nControlling power flow in such systems requires continuous communication between all terminals, as power flow must be actively regulated by the control system instead of by the inherent properties of the transmission line.\nDisadvantage #3 (expensive again)\nConverter substations generate current and voltage harmonics, while the conversion process is accompanied by reactive power consumption. As a result, it is necessary to install expensive filter-compensation units and reactive power compensation units.\nDisadvantage #4 (power faults)\nDuring short-circuits in the AC power systems close to connected HVDC substations, power faults also occur in the HVDC transmission system for the duration of the short-circuit.\nDuring short-circuits on the inverter output side, a full HVDC transmission system power fault can be caused. Power faults due to short-circuits on the rectifier input side are usually proportional to the voltage decrease.\nDisadvantage #5 (capacities)\nThe number of substations within a modern multi-terminal HVDC transmission system can be no larger than six to eight, and large differences in their capacities are not allowed. The larger the number of substations, the smaller may be the differences in their capacities.\nThus, it is practically impossible to construct an HVDC transmission system with more than five substations.\nDisadvantage #6 (radio noise)\nThe high-frequency constituents found in direct current transmission systems can cause radio noise in communications lines that are situated near the HVDC transmission line.\nDisadvantage #7 (dificult grounding)\nGrounding HVDC transmission involves a complex and difficult installation, as it is necessary to construct a reliable and permanent contact to the Earth for proper operation and to eliminate the possible creation of a dangerous “step voltage.”\nThe flow of current through the Earth in monopole systems can cause the electro-corrosion of underground metal installations, mainly pipelines.\nSome of the above-listed disadvantages can be eliminated with the use of new technologies. In particular, disadvantages such as a complete power fault of the HVDC transmission system during short-circuits inthe AC power system and reactive power consumption can be eliminated completely, or mostly, with the use of turn-off thyristors.\nSeveral research centers are working on improving high-capacity turn-off thyristors and also on new types of converter devices for high-capacity HVDC transmission.\nFinally, there are several new techniques for the perfection of grounding devices, providing for decreased electro-corrosion impacts and the formation of so-called “metal return”, which precludes the working current from flowing through the ground. Other techniques aimed\nat perfecting HVDC technology are also being developed (Koshcheev 2001).\nReference: Argonne National Laboratory – The design, construction and operation of long-distance high voltage electricity transmission technologies']	['<urn:uuid:d84f7e30-2d05-4620-aeca-309222c2e1f8>', '<urn:uuid:10b66309-a400-446d-a160-ca387f303366>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	11	44	1361
85	why was basketball game moved from carrier dome to melo center	The basketball game was moved from the Carrier Dome to the Carmelo K. Anthony Basketball Center because minutes before tip-off, a game official spotted water droplets on the court. The moisture was later determined to be condensation from the roof. To ensure safety, officials made the decision to move the contest to the practice facility, and the game successfully tipped off around 6:50 p.m., less than an hour after the venue change.	"[""On a normal game day at the Carrier Dome, issues can arise that will cause players, coaches, and game day staff to adjust. Players may get hurt during warmups, the game clock may not function correctly, live stats may be down. All of these issues have been seen before by Cedric Solice, Morey Mossovitz, and Olivia Coiro. However, the events that occurred last Wednesday prior to the Syracuse Orange’s contest against Lincoln was one they had never experienced.\nThe Orange were scheduled to play Division II Lincoln at 6 p.m. ET in the Carrier Dome for the team’s 2020-21 home opener. Minutes away from tip-off, a game official spotted a few droplets of water on the court. The following day, it was found that the moisture was a result of condensation from the roof.\nStatement from Syracuse University Senior Associate Vice President for Communications: “Over the last several hours, our team, as well as outside engineers have conducted a full review of what caused a game official to spot a few droplets of water on the court at the stadium last night. We have determined that the moisture was the result of condensation, not a leak from the roof. This is the first winter with our new roof, as well as a new heating and cooling system, and we are still fine-tuning the management of this system. We have resolved this issue and are ready to host the men’s basketball game this evening against Niagara.”\nTo ensure the safety of the game, officials made the decision to move the contest down the road to the Carmelo K. Anthony Basketball Center, the Syracuse Basketball practice facility. In less than an hour, around 6:50 p.m., Syracuse and Lincoln tipped off at Melo.\nSo, what happened in those 50 minutes? A story of passion, commitment, and teamwork from the Syracuse Athletics staff. Here is their account of that momentous night.\nCedric Solice, Assistant Coach & Director of Program Management and Development\nSolice handles a wide variety of tasks for the women’s basketball program, including serving as a liaison between the coaching staff and the different departments in athletics and campus units. He also oversees student-athlete welfare and development, team travel, and non-conference game scheduling.\nSolice, who has been a part of the program since 2006, describes last Wednesday as “one of the most amazing things that I’ve seen at Syracuse University in 15 years.”\n“It was a multi-pronged approach because there were a lot of things that had to happen,” Solice said. In addition to getting the teams to the Melo Center, the staff needed to find Lincoln a designated ‘locker room’ where they could change, get dressed, have a half time, etc. This also included smaller details like getting their postgame meal moved from the Dome to Melo.\n“Everything that you could imagine that was supposed to happen in the Carrier Dome, somebody had to conceive a plan in a very short fashion to get that shifted over to the Melo Center.”\nSolice gives credit to Dan Shworles, the assistant equipment manager of the Syracuse Basketball programs since 2001, for Wednesday night’s success. Shworles directs the equipment room at the Melo Center and strategized the moving of both team’s equipment from the Dome to Melo.\n“Kudos goes out to Dan Shworles because he just went to work to make sure that the athletes had absolutely everything they needed to be able to compete at the highest level and to make sure that both teams were taken care of.”\nAn important piece of every college athletics team is the student managers. Handling a variety of practice and game day tasks on a daily basis, the managers were even more integral on Wednesday night.\nTonight’s move to the Melo Center would not have been possible without our @SUWBBManagers. We’re so lucky to have them as part of our program pic.twitter.com/Qa0QKuP5AQ— 'Cuse Hoops (@CuseWBB) December 3, 2020\n“We called them all in and they were asking OK where can I best help, where do you want me? They were eager to help. They were eager to work. They were eager to get it done and they really just put their noses to the grindstone and did everything that was asked of them and more.”\nThe managers’ tasks included helping set the gym up for social distancing and moving player equipment from the Dome to Melo. After tip-off, the managers switched to their normal in-game responsibilities.\n“They were an integral piece in the process of being able to move the game and get ready to go immediately.”\nOne major part of sports that the public does not get a chance to see often is the behind-the-scenes work of the game day staff. This team includes the stat crew, the shot clock, the game clock, the announcer, the instant replay for the referees, the TV/Radio live stream, and the social media/digital media crew. These roles are crucial to hosting a live basketball game at any level. Without the game day staff, there is no game. Solice needed to find space for the staff as well as any equipment they would need at the Melo Center to perform their duties.\nAnd in case you may have forgotten, we are currently in a pandemic. Another key component of any sporting event in 2020 is ensuring the environment follows COVID-19 protocols. These protocols can take time to strategize and implement. Luckily, Syracuse Athletics was already prepared at the Melo Center to provide a sterile and clean environment.\n“Our staff over here does a great job of keeping this facility safe and healthy, so kudos to them first and foremost for having a facility that was ready to go from a protocol standpoint.”\n“The unique thing about dealing with the COVID environment is you have to be flexible. Every game, whether it’s home or away, is a new experience for everybody, so the constant is the game. Once the ball goes up in the air, we have a responsibility as a program to compete, play hard, and represent our institution at the highest level.”\nFrom a player’s perspective, having to switch venues right before game time can knock you out of competition mode, especially for the home opener. But, Solice says the team was able to keep themselves ready to play despite the changes and delay.\n“I think one of the big contributing factors to being able to get right into it was really being able to launch that game in about 50 minutes. Once we made the decision to move the game, it was just a matter of getting the teams into their transportation and immediately getting them on the court, back into the mindset of warming up, ready to compete. It was a really smooth transition.”\nIn times of uncertainty, people look to their leaders to guide them. Solice gives a lot of credit to Head Coach Quentin Hillsman for keeping his players calm through the venue transition.\n“All attitudes reflect leadership and his attitude in the whole process was very calm. He was just very focused on making sure that the team is OK and making sure Lincoln was OK. I think that the athletes and the staff really embodied that as well.”\nOnce the game finally tipped off, it was business as usual. The team dominated Lincoln with a 90-39 win. The freshmen, who were playing in their first game in Syracuse, were all over the stat sheet. Newbies Kamilla Cardoso and Priscilla Williams earned their first career starts and combined for 49 of Syracuse’s 90 points with 25 and 24, respectively.\nIn her first game in Syracuse since March 2019, Tiana Mangakahia tallied eight points, eight assists, and two steals. The Australian native missed last season while undergoing treatment for breast cancer.\n“Obviously everybody wanted to play in a Dome, but especially for our new players, this is their first game in Syracuse and they were just super excited to be able to play. There was a lot of energy when we were warming up in the Carrier Dome and there was a lot of energy when got to Melo. I don’t honestly think that there was a whole lot that the coaching staff had to do to keep them locked in because they were just really excited to play.”\nIn a year where games aren’t guaranteed, it was especially important to the Syracuse Athletics staff that they showed their student athletes they want to give them the best opportunity to compete as often as schedule allows with the best facilities that they can do it in.\n“If the Melo Center wasn’t built the way it’s built, we wouldn’t have been able to do it. Because we have both courts sitting side by side, we could set up the bench fully social distance and the game staff table on one court and use the other court with all the markings to play official games. Syracuse University investing in the building of this facility was everything because without it there’s no game. A special thank you to Lincoln as well for being so flexible because without them OKing the whole thing it doesn’t happen.”\nThroughout the rest of the season, there will be challenges where teams will be missing players due to positive tests and contact tracing, venue changes, and/or game date changes. After Wednesday night, Syracuse Athletics will be ready for anything.\n“The teams that can rapidly adjust are the teams that are going to have the greatest success this season. I think that our team adjusted very well and we had a lot of success as a result.”\nMorey Mossovitz, Associate Athletics Director/Facilities and Event Operations\nA member of the athletics department since his undergraduate studies starting in 2008, Mossovitz supervises the Carmelo K. Anthony Basketball Center, as well as other athletics facilities on campus. He also provides administrative support to University Vice President and Chief Facilities Officer Pete Sala.\nWhen the droplets of water were discovered and it was decided the game could not be played at the Dome, Mossovitz was looking for other ways the game could be salvaged. It was originally the Atlantic Coast Conference’s idea to move the facility.\n“The ACC was actually the first to bring up an alternative location. When it was decided we could not continue with the Dome, this other opportunity came up that was something everyone felt like we had the right group to make sure the student athletes had the opportunity to play,” Mossovitz explained.\nAfter the decision was made to move the game, it was time to get the ball rolling and make this change happen quickly and efficiently, while following COVID-19 protocols.\n“COVID-wise, we have a credential system that we’ve been utilizing at the Dome to separate the access to the floor and the locker room. Kevin VanDerzee, who’s my secondary game manager, went over to the Melo Center before the teams did to enforce the credential system there. Basically, we recreated the same environment we’ve implemented at the Dome over at the Melo Center.”\nTo provide an opportunity to both teams to count the contest as an official game, Mossovitz was in conversations with the ACC to ensure that the set-up would be acceptable for operations to accomplish an official game.\n“We needed to make sure that we were doing everything safely and then also trying to make sure that we covered everything we needed to have a game be operational and be counted as an official NCAA event.”\nAn important part of making the game an official event was providing the right equipment at the Melo Center. This included bringing game balls over instead of Melo’s practice balls, transferring the precision timing systems, and setting up the statistics systems.\n“Everything that we were able to basically take from the Dome and bring over to make an event happen at the Melo Center we did. This included some of our staff actually physically picking up those items and just putting it in a car and driving over to the Melo Center.”\nAs the team’s official headquarters, the Orange were already familiar with the space in Melo. They have their locker room, coaching space, catering space, etc. Lincoln, the visiting team, did not. Mossovitz converted the extra locker rooms in the Melo Center to accommodate the officials and the visiting team to make them as comfortable as possible.\n“We actually have four locker rooms at the Melo Center; each of our teams has a locker room, but we also have two locker rooms for our female and male coaches upstairs. So, we put Lincoln in one of those staff locker rooms and then used the other one for the officials. For safety reasons, we kept people out of our men’s locker room so that we did not cross mix their space.”\nLincoln, a Division II team located in Pennsylvania, was very open to the changes according to Mossovitz.\n“Lincoln knew where to go because they practiced in the Melo Center the day before so it was as easy as saying ‘Hey, just meet us over there where you were before’. Both teams were super professional about the situation.”\nIn all sports at every level, games are being moved, postponed, and canceled due to COVID. It was extremely important to the Syracuse Athletics staff that the game was not canceled or moved, but played that night.\n“Everyone was working tremendously hard to try and make the Dome available. Once the game was moved, everybody from Athletics wanted to make sure everything was working. Even the Dome staff came over and helped us at the Melo Center. We did everything in our power to give the opportunity to compete to these student athletes.”\nOlivia Coiro, Assistant Director of Athletic Communications\nCoiro, who joined the Syracuse staff in 2018, is responsible for the communication efforts for the women’s basketball, field hockey, men’s rowing, and softball programs. Her duties include print, web, media requests, and social media efforts, as well as game day management.\nOn a typical game day, Coiro manages the stats crew, media relations, photography and videography, and social media content.\n“From the athletic communications perspective, as discussions were underway regarding the game and the possible move to the Melo Center, we knew that we had to make arrangements to have official statistics kept during the game and social media coverage to stay connected with our fans,” Coiro said.\nDespite the quick turnaround, Coiro and her team were able to provide both live stats and live tweets for fans on Wednesday night. Attendance at sporting events is not allowed in New York State due to COVID, therefore, digital media has become an even larger aspect of college and professional sports.\n“We mobilized quickly to have our statistics crew, photographer and videographer get to the Melo Center and set up to cover the game. During the game, we shared in-game updates, photos and video on our social media channels as we do for all games.”\nTeamwork is equally important off as it is on the court. Without the collaboration of the athletics staff and the university as a whole, Wednesday night’s story would be a very different one.\n“When the final horn sounded at the end of the game, it was awesome to look around at everyone’s faces and realize what we pulled off -- all in an effort to provide a great experience for our student-athletes. The administration, especially Morey, were exceptional behind the scenes,” Coiro said.\n“Kudos goes out to so many people. Olivia, Morey, Kim Keenan-Kirkpatrick, Kevin VanDerzee, Pete Sala, Dr. Andrew Goodrich, and so many other people contributed to this and really showed the true spirit of Syracuse University and Syracuse Athletics,” Solice said.\n“The Dome, Athletic Department, and university staff really wanted to give our student athletes and Lincoln’s student athletes an opportunity to compete, especially during this difficult time of COVID,” Mossovitz said.\n“Wednesday was a perfect example of what makes our Syracuse Athletics staff so special — our student-athlete experience is always the priority. In this line of work we are programmed to adapt on the fly for a multitude of situations, but until last Wednesday I had never seen something so incredible as moving an entire basketball game to a different facility in less than an hour,” Coiro added.\nThe Syracuse athletics staff on December 2 showed passion for the women’s basketball program, a commitment to putting on the game in uncertain times, and teamwork amongst all departments. The result? A live game in a new location in under 50 minutes. What the Syracuse Athletics staff pulled off last week is nothing short of incredible, thanks to the work of countless unsung individuals.""]"	['<urn:uuid:e88300e5-58fd-4ff0-bf4e-8d6823a12364>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	11	72	2785
86	hotel environment friendly practices designs compared modern sustainable construction methods	Hotels need to balance environmental responsibility with hospitality by implementing eco-friendly practices and modern sustainable construction. On the operational side, properties can reduce their impact by reusing towels and linens, turning off lights and air conditioning when not needed, and minimizing waste through water bottle reuse. For construction and design, successful sustainable hotels employ passive design principles like cross ventilation and proper shading, use locally sourced and recycled materials, maintain minimal site intervention to preserve natural landscapes, and aim to reduce carbon emissions by 66% by 2030. Some properties also integrate with local communities through open public spaces and employ local craftspeople for construction elements.	"['Do you want to be a Responsible Tourist?\nMaking responsible choices about your holiday can help protect communities and the environment. By following some simple guidelines you can reduce the negative impact of travelling abroad, help to protect the heritages and preserve local cultures, and ensure the destination as a whole benefit.\n• Your holiday, their home! Often we give little thought to the impact we will have on our holiday destination, its people, culture, economy and environment. Remember that while you are on holiday, you are actually entering into someones home and everyday life.\n• Do your homework. Read up on the places you want to visit. Some things may be accepted in your home country, but in others places it may be a criminal offence! Try to dress respectfully, and follow the local costumes. Learn a few phrases in the local language. Chat with the local people and try to speak their language. You are sure to get an instant smile and a laugh to seal those memories. You can get information from sites like Caring for your destination, Sustainable Travel International, Mekong Responsible Tourism, Local Travel Movement, ConCERT or Stay Another Day on eco-friendly products and services in your target area.\n• It’s not an exam. If you read up on the places you intend to visit, your experience will be enhanced, but your guidebook is just a guide. To truly experience a place, go off the beaten path. You will be glad you did!\n• Help preserve the heritage. Angkor Wat is visited by millions of people a year, so care needs to be taken to allow others to be able to enjoy it in the future. Be mindful of other visitors. Take your litter with you. And do you really want your name emblazoned on the walls of it? Some of these monuments and artifacts are so old and fragile that they are sensitive to the touch of hands or bags and shoes. For more information on this, go to Heritage Watch.\n• Are you too big for your boots? How heavily do you ‘tread’ on your holiday? Natural resources are precious and the size of your ecological footprint will have an impact.\n– Go green. This could start in your hotel with towels and bed sheets. If you are staying longer, ask them not to change your sheets and towels every day. Turn of lights and air conditioners when not needed and think about your waste disposal. Reuse the water bottles. Don’t buy wildlife products!\n• Go local. Support the local economy. Buy from local markets and roadside vendors. Eat in local restaurants. Stay in locally owned hotels. This keeps money in the economy and helps local people keep their jobs.\n• Use local guides and drivers. Not only is it a great opportunity to interact with the locals and build friendship, but it encourages locals to learn about their history and culture and take pride in it.\n• Book directly with your hotel. Third party booking agents take large commissions, and less money will benefit the host country, and the local community. You are more likely to get a better price when booking directly. It’s a win : win deal.\n• Don’t stress. Our hurried concept of time is not the same in other cultures and local people s thought patterns differ from your own. Challenge yourself and do like the local people do, just for a day.\n• A win : win deal? Bargaining is expected in many cultures and we all enjoy the haggling with a smile and a laugh, but its easy to get carried away trying to find the best deal. The money you saved could be enough to pay for an entire family’s meal that night.\n• Giving back – Giving gifts unfortunately encourages begging. Try to refrain from giving to begging children. Find a project, health centre or school to donate to instead. This will have a more positive and long-lasting impact. before you give, do your research to ensure the organisation you support is a legitimate one. For more information visit ChildSafe International & Think before giving.\n• Volunteering. If you are thinking about volunteering your time, think about the impacts it will have on the local organisation. A skilled volunteer can be of great help for a local organisation, especially with staff education & training, organisational development, marketing or other specific skills that are needed. If you are able to stay minimum 3-6 months or more, many organisations will welcome you with open arms. Short term volunteering is unfortunately often doing more harm than good. If you only have a few days to spare and would like to contribute your time, it’s probably more beneficial to think about other alternatives than volunteering. You can for example give a blood donation at one of the children hospitals, or visit initiatives such as the Friends Center at Angkor Hospital for Children or the see the Beatochello Concert at Khanta Bopha. The organisation ConCERT is a great source of information, and can provide you with useful information about what is needed and how you can contribute.\n• Be aware of orphanage tourism. Some orphanages welcome tourists to come and play with the children for a few hours. It can be an eye-opening and a feel-good experience for the tourist, but the effect may be the exact opposite for the children. Remember that these children are vulnerable and need stability in their lives, not a constant flow of strangers visiting. Recent studies shows that three out of four orphans in Cambodia have at least one living parent. United Nations Children’s Fund and most other child protecting organisations agree that children are better off living in families or community settings if possible. Unfortunately many orphanages has been set up in tourist areas to raise funds from well-intended travelers, and some are intentionally kept in bad condition to bring in more donations. That means that good intentioned tourists and volunteers are often funding a system that is encouraging separating children from their families. That does not mean that all orphanages are bad and should not be funded. A well run orphanages will only allow tourists to enter into a designated information area accompanied by staff, and have proper child protection policies in place. Tourists visiting orphanages without a proper child protection policy are potentially putting children at risk, and it is not recommended. Click here for an informative article about the negative impacts of Orphanage Tourism from Good Intentions are not enough, or here to view a documentary on Cambodia’s Orphanage Tourism sent on Al Jazeera.\n• Don’t be a critic. Things does not always work out according to the plan. Have an understanding that peace only returned to Cambodia 12 years ago, and it is still one of the poorest and least developed countries in Asia. The local people do not yet have the same level of education as people from more developed countries do, many have never attended school, but they strive to do their best and are eager to learn and improve.

Leading the way, some architects and designers are doing just that.\nNovember 24th, 2020\nSustainability is now part and parcel of good design and a priority consideration among the region’s architects and designers working on residential, commercial and public portfolios. But what about hospitality projects? Sustainability and hospitality do seem at odds with each other, making it inherently challenging to design a genuinely sustainable hotel, bar or restaurant. Rather than be a deterrent, this should necessitate a greater sense of urgency, particularly in light of the climate crisis.\nToday, the harsh reality of climate change and global warming is underscored by a younger generation of consumers driving the demand for experiences, products and services that are as ethical as they are luxurious. So the expectation for hospitality operators to more seriously address issues of sustainability is also growing, especially in hotel design. Indeed, the International Tourism Partnership (ITP) launched the Hotel Global Decarbonisation report in 2017 that shows hotels need to reduce their absolute carbon emissions by 66% by 2030 and by 90% by 2050 (against a 2010 baseline) to fully play their part in mitigating global warming. While larger hotel chains still have a way to go, smaller and more operationally agile hotels are taking the lead, as are individuals such as Bill Bensley, who is setting a furious pace for the planet’s sake.\nThe California-born Bangkok-based architect has designed over 200 hotels globally and recently released the open-source whitepaper titled Sensible Sustainable Solutions. He’s unashamedly passionate about the environment, conservation and sustainability, and this paper consolidates his expertise with a view to informing and inspiring the hotel industry so that it can do better. “In the next five years, 15,000 new hotels will be built [worldwide] and for each of them, a hotel operations company will have a set of standards that they issue to architects. Surprisingly few of these standards specify statements or changes regarding sustainability,” he says. “I’m sharing something that I believe is low hanging fruit for hoteliers and operators and it’s my dream that we can all positively impact our planet’s future by harvesting that fruit.”\nSensible Sustainable Solutions posits three touchstones in order to make this happen – build with a purpose, operate locally and create respectfully. Bensley’s proposal is holistic in that it encompasses environmental, social and economic sustainability – and the architect himself doesn’t just talk the talk, he walks the walk too.\nAlong with his business partner Sokoun Chanpreda, Bensley co-owns Shinta Mani Hotels (SMH) in Cambodia and is involved in the independent not-for-profit Shinta Mani Foundation, which Chanpreda established in 2011. Amongst other initiatives, the Foundation educates youth from disadvantaged backgrounds in hotel operations, and SMH supports it by offering them internships and positions at any one of its four hotels, essentially giving back to the community. Bensley’s social conscience is strong and with the recent opening of Shinta Mani Wild in South Cardamom National Park, he proves his commitment to environmental sustainability is just as compelling.\nThe site itself was purchased by Bensley and Chanpreda at a logging auction, which saved this lush pocket of land from deforestation. And the architect’s resulting design concept highlights the importance of addressing sustainability from the very beginning of the process, rather than incorporating token gestures at the end.\nComprising 15 private tents, Shinta Mani Wild advocates touching the earth lightly in order to conserve as much of the site’s untamed landscape as possible. As Bensley explains, “Minimal intervention is about respecting the land, getting to know its natural features and wanting to complement it, rather than just plonking down something new. And on wooded sites, a small architectural footprint that fits between the trees often works best, with what’s lost in floor space being gained in atmosphere and privacy.” So there’s only one tent per 66 acres of forest and not a single tree was cut down during Shinta Mani Wild’s construction. Bensley also took as much time as possible to prepare the site, ensuring the outcome was thoroughly considered.\nCertainly, time is an issue when it comes to designing sustainable hotels, so much so that this was raised repeatedly by a Design Conversation panel on hospitality design at last year’s Saturday Indesign Singapore event. Shortening project timeframes can be seen to have short-changed sustainability and most architects would agree that more time is needed to be able to design something that not only considers immediate costs, but considers lifecycle costing as well, and the effect every design decision will have.\nIn designing Shinta Mani Wild’s tents, Bensley employed simple passive design principles to achieve a high degree of comfort, while maintaining low energy impact. Cross ventilation is utilised and eaves are large enough so as to provide shading when necessary. All materials were sourced locally and furniture and furnishings are upcycled in nature, giving each interior a bespoke aesthetic that also very much evokes a sense of place.\nThis connection to setting and community is likewise exemplified in the recently completed Potato Head Studios in Bali’s Seminyak by OMA, in collaboration with local architecture practice Andramatin. The resort disrupts the typical hotel typology by abandoning the concept of exclusivity in favour of inclusivity. Central to the scheme is a floating ring lifted by pilotis that accommodates private guest rooms, allowing for a ground-floor open platform that’s used by the community. The rooftop has been conceived as a public space too, with the incorporation of a sculptural park.\nWhile the design’s purpose is to promote open engagement between guests and the general public, it also operates locally by adopting the traditional courtyard vernacular ubiquitous across Indonesia. But it’s the resort’s materiality that best highlights the architects’ incorporation of environmental and social sustainability. The palette is predominantly concrete, peppered with locally sourced and recycled materials, including ijuk (a local roofing material), teak, handcrafted breeze blocks, terrazzo made from waste concrete and ceiling panels woven with recycled plastic bottles.\n“We worked with a large number of local people to handcraft textures on some of the concrete walls and to create the ceiling panels,” says OMA Managing Partner David Gianotten. “The uniqueness of these finishes gives the building a sense of tactility and represents construction processes that respect both the environment and the Balinese arts and crafts tradition.” Like Shinta Mani Wild, this resort reveres its context and by being so deeply embedded within it, can help to sustain it.\nThe conversation on sustainability in hotel design remains ongoing and the challenges look like they’ll be around for a while too. But on the other hand, all that’s needed is for architects and designers to action their innovative thinking, vigilance and best practice in collaboration with hoteliers and operators so as to achieve effective outcomes.

87	As a fire safety inspector, I'm concerned about the relationship between fire hazards in homes and flammable materials classification. How do common household items like matches and candles relate to Division 4.1 flammable solids, and what specific safety measures should be taken with both?	Matches are explicitly classified as Division 4.1 flammable solids as they are easily ignited and readily combustible materials. For household fire safety, matches and candles are considered major causes of children's deaths and require specific safety measures. They should be kept out of reach and sight of children, preferably locked up. Additionally, candles should always be blown out before leaving a room or going to sleep. When handling these flammable solids, it's crucial to maintain proper supervision, especially with children present. Never leave children unattended in a room with burning candles, and teach them not to touch fire, matches, or lighters as part of general fire safety education.	['Every day we use fire to cook our food and heat our homes. But as we all know, fire can be deadly. Each year in the United States, home fires lead to tens of thousands of severe burns and approximately 600 deaths in children under age 14. Half of the children who die are younger than 4, since they are least able to escape. In fact, fires are the number one cause of death in the home for young children.\nTo protect your family, you need to take the following steps to help prevent fires in the home—and to keep everyone safe in the event of one. Install and Maintain Smoke Alarms\nSmoke alarms give you an early warning of a fire, giving you time to escape with your children before your house is filled with flames and smoke. Most fatal fires occur at night, when people are sleeping, so an early warning is crucial. Smoke alarms can cut the risk of death by 50 percent.\nWhen installing smoke alarms:\nEliminate Fire Hazards from Your Home\n- Place one inside or outside each bedroom. Make sure there is one on every floor and in the basement. Don’t put a smoke alarm in the kitchen because cooking can trigger false alarms.\n- Place them on the ceiling or high on the walls (because smoke rises).\n- Test them every month by pushing the test button. Make sure the children know what to do when they hear the alarm (see Fire Escape Plan below).\n- Replace the batteries when they get low (when the alarm chirps) or at least once a year. Many people do this when they set the clocks back in the fall.\nGo through your home, room by room, to reduce fire hazards:\nKeep Fire Safety Equipment on Hand\n- Electrical cords and outlets: Don’t overload outlets. Replace frayed or damaged cords. Don’t run cords under the carpet as they can overheat and catch fire.\n- Oven/Stove: Clean grease from the oven to prevent grease fires. Potholders, curtains and towels can catch fire, so keep them away from burners. Never leave cooking food unattended.\n- Matches, lighters and candles: These are a major cause of children’s deaths. Keep them out of reach and out of sight of children, preferably locked up. Always blow out a candle before you leave the room or go to sleep.\n- Fireplace: Use a metal screen or glass door in front of the fireplace. Have fireplaces and chimneys inspected and cleaned once a year.\n- Space heaters: Avoid using electric and kerosene heaters. If they must be used, keep them away from clothing, bedding, curtains and furniture. Always turn them off and unplug them when you leave the room or go to bed. Make sure kerosene heaters are well ventilated to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.\n- Furnace: Have it inspected once a year. Do not store anything near it that could catch fire.\n- Dryer: Lint can catch fire, so clean it from the dryer’s filter after every load.\n- Paint, paint thinner, petrololine, propane, kerosene and ammonia: Store flammable liquids in their original containers, with tight-fitting lids. Store them away from heaters and out of children’s reach, ideally locked up in a shed outside the home. Never use petrololine as a cleaning agent.\n- Children’s pyjamas: Make sure children’s sleepwear is flame-retardant or close fitting.\n- Cigarettes: It is healthiest and safest not to smoke, and not to allow smoking in your home. Never smoke near flammable liquids. Never smoke in bed or when you’re sleepy or have been drinking—this is major cause of home fires.\n- Doors and windows: Keep them clear of furniture and stored boxes. Make sure they can open easily in the event of fire.\nAdditional fire safety equipment can help keep your family safe in a fire. This includes:\nTeach your Children Fire Safety and Make a Fire Escape Plan\n- A fire extinguisher: Install a fire extinguisher in the kitchen and on every floor of your home. They are for adult use only so keep them out of reach of the children. Review their instructions. Some fire experts advocate the “PASS” method: Pull the pin, aim the nozzle at the base of the flames, squeeze the trigger and swipe the nozzle from side to side across the flames.\n- Escape ladders: If your home has more than one story, consider having an escape ladder on each floor upstairs. The ladder needs to be a non-burnable material, like aluminum, not rope. Make sure the ladder is safety-certified and long enough to reach the ground.\n- An automatic sprinkler system: If you’re remodeling or building a new home, consider installing a sprinkler system that turns on when it senses heat from a fire.\nWhen a fire starts, children may panic and hide in the closet or under the bed, which makes it difficult to find and rescue them. If they practice the fire escape plan in advance, they are more likely to escape safely. As a general safety tip, teach children not to touch fire, matches or lighters, emphasizing that fire can hurt them. Fire Escape Plan:\nSupervise Your Children at All Times\n- Draw a floor plan of your home. Mark two ways to exit every room. Take the family into each room and make sure everyone knows the two exits.\n- Agree on a meeting place outside your home. This is where everyone will go after exiting. This can be a tree, mailbox, street corner, etc.\n- Teach your child to recognize the sound of the fire alarm, and how to exit the house:\n- If your clothes catch fire:\n- Stop: Don’t run. That can spread the flames.\n- Drop: Drop to the ground right away.\n- Roll: Cover your face with your hands and roll back and forth to put out the flames on your clothes\n- Crawl under smoke to get outside. Most fire deaths are caused from people breathing smoke and toxic fumes. The air is clearer near the floor.\n- Test closed doors with the back of your hand. If it’s hot, use the other exit.\n- Get outside and go to the agreed meeting place. Don’t hide in the closet or under the bed, and don’t hide from firefighters. If you live in an apartment, use stairs instead of the elevator. If you can’t get out, stand at the window and wave for help. Once outside, don’t go back in. Don’t try to rescue pets or toys.\n- From outside, call the fire department or 911.\n- Practice the fire drill. Do this at least twice a year. You can try it at night, while the family is sleeping, to simulate what might happen under those circumstances. Tell babysitters, family and friends your escape plan\nChildren are curious about fire. They want to look at it and touch it. They also want to imitate adults lighting matches, building fires, cooking and smoking. Therefore, never leave children unattended:\n- In the kitchen.\n- In a room with candles, heaters or a burning fireplace.\n- Outdoors near a barbecue grill.\nNote: If your child has special needs such as a developmental delay, blindness, deafness or movement difficulties, ask your doctor or your local fire department about an appropriate fire safety and escape plan.\nFor more information on fire safety, visit the SAFE KIDS website www.safekids.org.\nKaren Sokal-Gutierrez M.D., M.P.H.

89	cgc grading cost for comics value over 3000	Comics with a fair market value above $3,000 are charged on a sliding scale of 3% of the book's value, with a minimum fee of $150.	['A cornerstone of comic book collecting is the grade that a book is assigned by the CGC, or Certified Guaranty Company. Despite the CGC’s importance to modern collectors, many still don’t understand what it means for a comic book to be graded. By understanding CGC’s process, aspiring collectors will better understand why this grading process is so important.\nBut First, What Is the CGC?\nBased in Sarasota, Florida, the CGC was founded in 2000 and quickly became a global standard for determining a comic book’s physical condition. Prior to CGC, the standard was the Overstreet Guide’s 10 Point Grading Scale, which ranged from a 0.5 (Poor) to 10 (Gem Mint). CGC built upon Overstreet’s grading by developing a more standardized process, and incorporated new elements.\nHow Do You Know if Your Comic Is Worth Sending In for Grading?\nThough you may be tempted to submit every comic book you purchase for CGC Grading, this process must be paid for. The grading fee varies depending on the age and value of the comic, ranging from $22 to $120 for most books. Comics with a fair market value above $3,000 however, are charged on a sliding scale of 3% of the book’s value (minimum $150).\nGiven these costs as well as the costs of shipping, you should only seriously consider submitting a comic book for grading if you already know it’s valuable or if you believe that it will become valuable in the future. A general rule of thumb that many collectors follow is that a book’s expected value needs to be worth about $200 before it makes sense to have the book graded from a financial perspective.\nAlso note that the grading process often takes some time. CGC states that grading can take 106 to 133 days. A fee of $75 can reduce this time to 44 days, and an express fee of $120 can reduce this time to 17 days. Books over $3,000 in value are turned around in an expected 10 days.\nWhat Are the Benefits of Sending Your Comic In for Grading?\nA graded comic book often has significantly more value than a non-graded version, since a graded comic book has been authenticated by an industry respected organization. Additionally, collectors are much more willing to pay top dollar for high conditioned books, if that condition has been verified and quantified by CGC. Finally, with a CGC certification number, a graded comic has a provenance—meaning that this book’s ownership history will now be documented for future owners to appreciate.\nAnother benefit of grading is that your comic will be encapsulated in a crystal clear holder. In addition to the item being better preserved by this shell, the holder helps to guard against counterfeiting and tampering.\nBeyond preservation, the CGC slabs themselves have a positive aesthetic quality that fans and collectors have come to appreciate. These containers make it easier to handle the collectibles and to display them. Instead of keeping a comic book hidden in a box, they can be showcased like the works of art they are. One drawback is that encapsulated books can’t be read.\nWhat Are the CGC Labels?\nEach comic book receives a numerical grade of 0.5 to 10 as well as a designation related to the page quality of the comic. It’s worth noting that for many books (save for the most modern) the highest grade in existence is often a 9.8, with 9.9s and 10s for older books exceedingly rare. In addition to the number grade and page quality designation, each submission will have a color-coded label. There are 12 colors, and out of these, there are 5 major colors: Universal Label (Blue), CGC Signature Series Label (Yellow), Qualified Label (Green), Restored Label (Purple), and Pedigree Label (Gold).\nThe universal blue label is given to comic books that are graded as marked with no qualifiers. It has no autographs, no evidence of restoration, nor anything massively missing.\nThe yellow signature series is for a submission that has a significant person’s autograph, which has been authenticated. While one might assume that signed books are more valuable (and while this is often the case), in certain cases, especially with older comics, unsigned books can sometimes command a higher price.\nThe qualified green label is for any collectible that has a significant defect. The green label communicates that something is substantially wrong with the book despite being graded. This could be a missing page or an un-authenticated signature or missing staples. According to Midtown Comics, the green label allows a damaged book to be graded on a curve; “For example, a book missing staples may receive a blue label grade of 0.5 (POOR grade) but would receive a grade of 6.8 or 7 through the qualified green label.”\nThe purple restored label is for any comic book that has been repaired. In general, restoration significantly harms the value of a comic and some have dubbed this CGC designation as PLOD or “the purple label of death.”\nThe pedigree gold label is applied to any item that is part of a collection CGC recognizes as being of exceptional quality. A pedigree label not only verifies the quality of a book, but highlights the quality of the collection it comes from. As GoCollect.com writes, “a pedigree is an exceptional collection that they are willing to recognize with unique labeling.”\nTo date, there are only 61 pedigree gold collections recognized by CGC. Not only do their pedigree statuses signify quality, this label also increases the value of a book. A pedigree will increase a comic book’s value as a collectible because it adds to the story the item. After all, it is not some random book found in an attic. Instead, it was part of a collection that was preserved for future generations.\nAs ComicBookPedigree.com explains, when it comes to pedigree collections, “all of the owners had one thing in common; they were conscientious about the condition of their comic books. By luck or design, each of the collections featured here survived many tests of time; paper drives, puberty, and especially Mom, who never understood why her child would save such things.”\nHow Are Comics Graded by the CGC?\nWhile one might think that this grading process would be a company secret, CGC is completely transparent about how a comic book’s quality is determined.\n(1) First impressions\nA first impression is typically reserved for finding large problems; such as stains or holes on the cover as well as missing pieces and creases.\n(2) Identify variants or pedigree\nA submission’s pedigree is determined by the collection it comes from. While different organizations have various criteria for pedigree, there are three near-universal standards:\nA)The quality of an overall collection — does it already have high value items?\nB)The collection’s origin — were they collected by the same person/people and stored in a similar space at the same time? This is of value because it signifies that all the items will be in a similar condition; and\nC)The completeness of the collection — is it just a collection of random books or does it contain completed series?\nIn short, two of the same comic books in similar conditions can be worth different amounts if one comes from a trusted and vetted collection.\n(3) Count pages\nSelf explanatory — each page of a book is counted to make sure a submission isn’t missing any.\n(4) Determine page condition\nWhen it comes to specific condition, graders will look for tears, stains, and creases.\nOne major issue in page quality is “foxing.” Foxing is typically a degradation of paper that comes from within the paper as it ages. Foxing is typically found in books that have not been properly protected from the environment.\nAnother source of damage can come from the book’s staples. Staples rust if exposed to moist air and that rust can expand into paper. Staples might also cause tears.\nIn addition to keeping comic books away from moisture and humidity, it’s also important to keep them away from direct sunlight. Sunlight can bleach an image and tone down the vibrancy of a cover’s colors.\nFinally, with so many comic books including posters or other features that encourage readers to cut them out, graders will determine if these extra materials are still present.\nExamples of such materials include advertisements encouraging readers to cut out stamps and coupons to be sent in, or posters to be taken out and put on display. One of the many reasons X-Men #1 sold so many copies was due to variant covers, one of these variants being a cover that functioned as a pull out poster. Similar to Playboy, dozens of different titles were published with centerfold posters in a comic book that were designed to be removed from the book and hung up on walls—doing so would unfortunately significantly harm the value of the specific issue.\nTo make sure that pages or covers weren’t swapped out, graders will also examine a book’s staples to make sure they weren’t opened and closed again.\nA surprising source of a comic book’s imperfections is the poly bag and board that it might be sealed in. For instance, a back cover might stick to the board it is sealed with. This means that a back cover could be damaged due to ink transferring to the board or the page itself becoming damaged from parts of it becoming permanently stuck to the board. Poly bags for comic books are incredibly common because they are affordable. However, they offer less protection than mylar bags. And while mylar bags are more expensive, they offer superior protection from moisture and humidity, insects, mold, and other chemicals.\n(5) Check for restorations\nTo salvage/improve the appearance of a comic book, some collectors will try to restore it. CGC currently identifies 11 types of restorations that can be done on comic books: color touch, piece fill, tear seals, spine split seals, reinforcement, piece reattachment, cleaning, staple replacement or cleaning, re-glossing, glue, and trimming.\nBecause of the complexities surrounding restorations, CGC has a seperate scale to grade restored books. And while it is tempting to want someone to restore books to mint condition in the hopes that their new value will be dramatically higher, restorers can often do more damage than good to a book’s value depending on the specific situation .\nTwo restoration details to keep in mind are the slight differences between restoration and conservation. For instance, CGC defines restoration as “the act of adding foreign material to a comic book through certain techniques to return its appearance to an ideal or original state.” In contrast, “the goal of conservation is to preserve the structural integrity of the comic while removing all things that are detrimental to its longevity.”\nOnce a grader has documented and considered all of a book’s imperfections, they will determine a grade. Similar defects do not always have a similar impact on a book’s final grade. For instance, a crease being severe enough that it breaks the color will have a greater negative impact than a crease that doesn’t break a page’s colors.\n(6) Assess all defects and determine a final grade.\nTo make sure the quality of a book is properly assessed, grading is done by a team and multiple CGC professionals examine every item as a means to guarantee consistency and accuracy. This process of multiple graders concludes once a consensus for a final grade is reached.\nHow Are Comic Books Authenticated by the CGC?\nBefore the intensive work of grading is done, the book is authenticated. With some comic books valued so highly, there are many attempts to pass off fakes as the real things. Stephen Fishler, the CEO and cofounder of Metropolis Collectibles and ComicConnect.com, discusses some of these attempts in Fraud Magazine:\n“We’ve seen two notable attempts to counterfeit modern, or Bronze Age, comic books: Cerebus No. 1 (1977) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles No. 1 (1984). Why did counterfeiters pick them? Both were printed with unusual black-and-white interiors, which the fraudsters assumed would be easier to replicate. After all, 99% of the comics produced in the last 80 years feature full-color interiors,” Fishler said.\n“Regardless, industry professionals quickly spotted the counterfeits,” Fishler continued, “and no one ever profited from them. Case closed.”\nAlternatives to CGC: CBCS and PGX\nWhile CGC is undoubtedly the gold standard in the comic grading industry, there are other players in the space, most notably CBCS which is owned by Beckett Media. CBCS is generally considered a reputable player in the space and some collectors choose to use the company because of its slightly lower fees and often much faster turnaround times. The grading scales used by CBCS are nearly identical to those of CGC; however, it’s worth noting that CGC comics of the same grade generally fetch a slight premium to those graded by CBCS on the resale market.\nPGX is another comic grading company out there; however, many collectors claim that their grading quality is suspect and stay away from either having their books graded by them or buying PGX graded books. For this reason, until something changes reputation wise, you might want to steer clear of PGX grading as an option.\nWith the comic book collector’s market increasing every year, the importance of grading will only grow. And this importance is not a hyperbolic statement. Grading has become so common that CGC and similar companies have needed to hire more people. As Jim McLauchlin wrote for GamesRadar.com, “Collectibles markets are surging, and as old comics get more expensive, collectors and dealers turn to third-party services to ensure authenticity and grade. The phenomenon has led to an odd crimp in the labor market – grading services and high-end auction houses are desperate to hire graders, even paying cash bonuses to get people in the door.”\nAs it becomes more common for comic books to get graded, it is important for collectors, fans, and others interested in comic books to understand what it means to purchase a CGC (or CBCS) graded collectible.']	['<urn:uuid:67b3d9cd-b743-4124-b590-c2b2ff2da349>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	8	26	2340

Starbucks sources arabica coffee from three key growing regions: Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific, with their signature blends mostly coming from the Asia-Pacific region. Their coffee buying team evaluates over 1,000 samples each year, but only about 3% of the world's beans make it into their coffee. Once harvested, the coffee beans undergo either a wet or dry processing method. The wet process involves pulping the cherries, fermenting the beans in water tanks for 2-3 days, and sun-drying, while the dry process involves sun-drying the whole cherries for about 20 days before hulling. Both processes ultimately transform the fruit into green coffee ready for roasting.	"[""The coffee buying team evaluates over 1,000 samples each year but only a few make it into our warehouses.

In the second place comes Colombia with its sweet coffee.\nGuatemala is a country with a limited but excellent quality production where coffee is very sweet, of regular acidity and with a strong aroma ranging from chocolaty to flowery. This type of coffee is the preferred component for many blends.\nKenya enjoys a mild balanced climate, and thus produces acid, aromatic coffee. It is the best kind to be filtered.\nEthiopia produces coffee with a flowery taste and a touch of caramel. It is the top washed Arabica.\nIndia enjoys a deliciously bitter coffee with a spicy aroma. As for some Latin American countries, coffee is rather sweet with more acidic notes whereas Central America holds the emblematic features of the sweet and light kinds of coffee.\nVietnam and Indonesia are well-known for the Robusta coffee.\nCoffea Arabica and Coffea Canephora are the two most common coffee species, i.e. Arabica and Robusta. Arabica is the most expensive one, and it makes the three-fourths of coffee production around the world. This kind of coffee grows in the tropical and equatorial strips of America, Africa and Asia. Its flavor is scented, sweet and a bit acidic and often chocolaty, with a light hazel to reddish cream and an enjoyable bitter note.\nRobusta is resistant to tropical heat and parasites, grows at lower altitudes and has a relatively low cost. It grows in severe environments such as the equatorial rain forest. Robusta coffees have little fragrance and greater bitterness and their froth tends to have a brown-grey color.\nIt takes one flower only…\nNaturally tropical, the coffee plant needs a hot and humid climate to flourish. Three to four years after planting coffee, rains generate the blossoming of beautiful white flowers enjoying the fragrance of sweet jasmine or orange.\nThe coffee flowers die after few days, bringing the fruit to life and their color changes to red as they ripen. Arabica cherries need about seven months to reach the finest stage of ripeness while Robusta cherries need about 10 months. The cherry normally contains two seeds which are the future green coffee beans.\nThe blossoming cycle and maturation of coffee plants does not depend on the seasons but on rainfalls and thus, one plant can hold flower blossoms, young fruit and ripe fruit at once.\nThe ""extensive system"" is the oldest and most conventional coffee cultivation method and it is still used in Central America and India. Coffee plants grow with other taller plants naturally shading them from the direct sunlight. However, in the ""intensive model"", followed in Brazil, the coffee plants are tightly packed and need irrigation and mechanization systems.\nAfter harvesting the coffee beans, they are placed in machines to separate the flesh from the seed or ""bean"". Then, the fermentation process is executed in order to remove the greasy coating off the coffee bean.\nHulling: Wet and dry methods\nAfter harvesting, the cherries are separated from any external strange bodies such as stones, leaves, etc. in case the coffee cherries were gathered by stripping or mechanical methods. The coffee seeds are then taken out from the cherries by either the ""wet"" process where the fruit is pulped, the hull is removed and the seeds are dried or the ""dry"" process, where the whole fruit is dried.\nThe Wet Process\nThe wet process is the most complicated one. It is originally used for cherries that have been handily-picked. Directly after gathering, the fruit undergoes special pulping, releasing the beans from the cherries. Two or three days of soaking follow the pulping stage: the beans are out in huge water tanks to be “washed“ to completely eliminate the pulp through fermentation.\nThe fermentation step generates a series of chemical reactions that improve the flavor quality of the roasted coffee. The beans are then sun-dried and the outer parchment is removed.\nThe Dry Process\nThis process is commonly used if coffee cherries have been harvested mechanically or by manual stripping. The cherries are spread out on threshing floors and dried in the sun for about twenty days. Afterwards, hulling machines are used to free the beans from the hull and parchment once the skin, flesh, and seeds have completely dried. The dry method produces what we call “unwashed” coffees.\nThe outcome of both processes is fruit transformed into green coffee.']"	['<urn:uuid:34fa2793-9220-408a-afd6-e6ba22e525b9>', '<urn:uuid:6c305afd-b135-411d-9ee0-d4e370975756>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	10	105	3410
91	organic food nutrients compared conventional food	Research has shown that organic crops contain an average of 17% more antioxidants than conventional ones, with some crops showing up to a 60% antioxidant boost. Flavanones, which are associated with a lower risk of stroke, were 69% higher in organic foods. Additionally, pesticide residue levels were found to be 10 to 100 times lower in organic food compared to conventional food.	['A dozen years ago, a New York Times Magazine article titled “Power Steer” changed the way Americans thought about meat. “We are what we eat, it is often said,” wrote author Michael Pollan, “but of course that is only part of the story. We are what what we eat eats too.”\nA bit of an awkward phrase, perhaps, but a salient point, not lost on the thousands of Americans who collectively plunk down $380 million a year for grass-fed beef. When we eat animals, we are inheriting their diet—as well as several other aspects of their lives.\nBut what about when we eat plants? Plants don’t, strictly speaking, eat, but they are no less embedded in their ecological relationships than animals are. Perhaps most importantly, plants take up nutrients from the soil in which they grow, and the meal on offer varies tremendously depending on how that soil is managed. So does it matter, for human nutrition, what our plant-based foods eat?\nHealthy soils –> healthy plants –> healthy people?\nRecent research from a team of authors led by Newcastle University professor Carlos Leifert suggests it does matter what our plants “eat.” Analyzing 343 studies that compared the nutrient content of organic and conventional food, Leifert and his colleagues found that the organic crops contained an average of 17 percent more antioxidants than the conventional ones and that the effect was particularly pronounced in certain crops, for which organic management offered as much as a 60 percent antioxidant boost. Flavanones, associated with a lower risk of stroke, were an average of 69 percent higher in organic foods tested. Data on pesticide residues varied across the studies, but showed a clear trend: overall levels of pesticides were ten to 100 times lower in organic food.\nThis study offers some of the best evidence yet that healthy soils lead to healthier plants, and, very likely, healthier people. And here’s the kicker: it’s probably a gross underestimation. Here’s why:\nNext generation organics: Beyond the no-no approach\nFrom the plant’s eye view, the certified organic diet is rather like the old-school crash diet you might have tried before prom: it’s all about what you don’t eat. While organic certifiers encourage proactive soil management practices like composting, cover cropping, and soil-building crop rotations, the segment of our organic laws and standards with legal teeth is the list of no-nos: the chemicals that organic producers are not allowed to use. Observing these no-nos is critical for human health—not just to reduce pesticide residue on food, but to reduce chemical exposure for farmworkers and rural communities, and to reduce the carbon footprint of our food system.\nAnd yet, to truly reap the potential of paying attention to what our food plants eat, we need to put them on a more comprehensive diet: the kind that emphasizes eating the good stuff, rather than just avoiding the bad stuff. We don’t have a widely-used system of standards to track which plants are eating good stuff, so this is where knowing your farmer comes in handy.\nMeet the Lentil Underground\nAs part of my dissertation research at UC Berkeley, I got to know a group of farmers in Montana who’ve been assiduously paying attention to their plants’ diets since the late 1980s. At that time,\nMontana agriculture was dominated by chemically supported wheat monoculture, and the result was soil erosion and rural bankruptcy. So a handful of farmers decided to revamp their farms to provide a better base of soil nutrients. Instead of just planting one crop that was designed to draw nutrients out of the soil, they developed a rotation of crops that would also contribute nutrients back: a community of plants that would feed one another.\nBecause most of these farmers eat their own crops, they understand on a visceral, anecdotal level that better plant nutrition translates into better human nutrition. I’ve mentioned the Leifert et al. study to a few of them, and they weren’t surprised to learn that organic crops came out 17% ahead of conventional ones in terms of antioxidants. They wondered how much higher that number could be if organic certification standards were explicitly focused on improving plant nutrition, instead of just eliminating the most toxic chemicals. They’d love to partner with researchers to improve the nutritional performance of their systems and pack their lentils and grains full of micronutrients, and they’ve been working with Dr. Alison Harmon, Associate Professor of Food and Nutrition at Montana State University, to educate the public about how to cook and eat lentils.\nOf course, this isn’t how American land grant universities have traditionally approached nutrition (of either soil, ecosystems, or humans), so the researchers and the funding needed to do these studies are extremely scarce. But, a growing number of scientists are pushing for change and the USDA is considering taking environmental sustainability into account in our national dietary guidelines–for the first time ever. We may be getting closer to integrating the science of agroecology and the science of nutrition, toward a holistic approach that would follow nutrients from the soil, to plants and animals, to human bodies. As Sir Albert Howard famously wrote in his Agricultural Testament, it’s all one subject.\nSupport from UCS members make work like this possible. Will you join us?

92	how do athena and arachne weaving skills compare to apollo and marsyas music abilities competition	Both stories involve contests between mortals and deities that end tragically for the mortals. Arachne challenged Athena to a weaving competition, producing perfect tapestries that depicted the gods' misdeeds. Despite Arachne's artistic perfection, Athena became angry at the insult and transformed her into a spider. Similarly, the satyr Marsyas challenged Apollo to a flute contest. When Marsyas lost the musical competition, Apollo punished him by having him flayed alive. Both cases demonstrate how the gods harshly punished mortals who dared to challenge their superiority in their respective domains.	"['""If the human body is the source of symbols, the ultimate example is the body of Jesus; if human history aims at transcendence, its unsurpassable crown is the life of Jesus.""\nIn his Metamorphoses, Ovid relates the myth of Arachne.1 This young woman, a native of Lydia, inherited a fabulous ability to weave tapestries. She received such praises that she began to believe herself superior to Pallas Athena, the goddess who was patron of her guild and of the other crafts. Such disrespect prompted Athena to appear to her, inviting her to acknowledge her error. But Arachne, who was proud, challenged the deity to a competition at the loom.\nThen Athena and Arachne both set to work on their cloths, weaving splendid representations. The tapestries Athena wove showed epic combats between men and gods, where the humans were always vanquished by divine power. Arachne, for her part, was content to portray the ignoble deceits of the immortals, starting with the seductions of Zeus. To her eyes the gods seemed like tyrants who exploited human weakness.\nIn the end, Athena had to admit the perfection of Arachne’s art, but irritated by the insult she tore the tapestries into pieces and turned the girl into a spider, the eternal weaver. Dante describes her thus in the Divine Comedy: “O mad Arachne, I saw you already/ half-spider, wretched on the ragged remnants/ of work that you had wrought to your own hurt.""2\nSo runs the myth, which, though invented in Greece, has a universal validity. Besides the misfortunes of Arachne, we find in it also a meditation on human life. The tapestry, woven at great speed, is a symbol of the fleetingness of existence, embroidered in time. The Bible also recognizes the brevity of human life using the simile of weaving. “Like a weaver I have rolled up my life; he cuts me off from the loom” (Is 38:12). In this light, the depth of the myth of Arachne becomes apparent: can it be that this fragile cloth, patterned so quickly in the weaving of our lives, bears an image so beautiful that it endures for all time, defying the passage of the centuries and raising us to divine heights? Will Arachne one day succeed in equalling Pallas Athena, without thereby having to renounce her earthly and historical condition?\nThe Greek world did not find a definitive solution to this dilemma. The tapestries woven by Athena and Arachne therefore represent the endless struggle between the human and the divine, the temporal and the eternal. Later eras came along and tried in their own ways to answer the same question, which is crucial if human life is to find meaning. Their attitudes differed from the Greek one, but maintained a common denominator with it: they accepted the comparison of human life with a tapestry. And this meant that the beings of the material cosmos reflected a higher light, revealing a plan and a beauty: that human history, though ephemeral, has a point. The universe was conceived of as a book in which each event occupied its proper place and indicated to man a route through time.\nModernity brought with it a change of horizon. Man disentangled himself from the fabric of the world to adopt the distance of the observer, who contemplates from afar the concert of what surrounds him.3 From this vantage point he could record the laws of the cosmos with precision, in accordance with the paradigm that modern science offered him. More than the tapestries of Arachne, which were primitive and childish myths, it was the spider’s web with its precise order and symmetry that spoke to him. Think of the modern’s fascination with the order of mathematics, which Galileo described as the alphabet with which God has written the universe.4\nThis dazzling harmony was nevertheless unable to assign a meaning to human life.5 And so opened the space for a doubt that has run all through modern times, a doubt to which Immanuel Kant would give expression: could not all this harmony perhaps be a projection of our own mind onto the appearances of the real? Could mathematics be located in us, rather than in the things themselves? This doubt corroded human confidence in the order of the world. If harmony is found on the side of the observer, then the movement of nature is irrational, caused by chance or autonomous necessity. So the great divorce was finalized: between the human spirit, seat of conscience and freedom, beauty and ideals, on the one hand; and the material cosmos on the other, a place of noisy agitation. The rational exists in the thinking mind; things themselves remain submerged in the chaos of the particles of mechanicism and its collisions.\nHere is a question in the face of this crisis. Is it possible to recover the symbolic value of the world and to give man’s footsteps an orientation in nature? Can the universe be seen as a tapestry once again, where the narrative of life has a beautiful pattern? Christian faith offers a response, which starts by considering the capacity of our own body and our own time to bear meaning. I want to show that this happens precisely in the Christian liturgy, which therefore acquires a great importance for illuminating the problems of our time. The first step will be to reflect on the sacraments, which contain the structure of the liturgy.\n. . . . . . . . . .\nTo read this article in its entirety, please download the free PDF, buy this issue, or become a Communio subscriber!', ""Apollo: god of music. Athena: goddess of military victory. He was a healer. She wore a helmet and carried a shield. On the surface, these Greek deities couldn’t be more different. When you start investigating their myths, however, the two have much more in common than you’d think. The families of this god and goddess, and their roles in Greek mythology, have some striking similarities.\nApollo and Athena shared a father: Zeus, king of the Greek gods. Both have tragic birth stories. Apollo’s mother, Leto, was one of Zeus’ lovers. When Leto became pregnant, she was banished from Olympus, home of the gods. Leto could find no one to help her, because all were afraid of Hera, Zeus' wife. Apollo and his twin sister, Artemis, were born on the nearly deserted island of Delos.\nAthena’s mother was the nymph Metis. A prophesy warned Zeus that Metis’ child would take his place, so he swallowed the pregnant Metis whole. Athena appeared, fully grown, when Hephaestus, god of blacksmiths, struck Zeus’ forehead with an ax.\nVery soon after birth, both Apollo and Athena were ready for action. At four days old, Apollo killed Python, a giant snake who had raped the pregnant Leto. Apollo also slew a giant who tried to kidnap Leto.\nAthena’s abilities were evident right from the start: She emerged from birth as an adult woman wearing armor, in full warrior mode. Her mother, Metis, had constructed a robe and helmet for Athena while inside Zeus, waiting for the birth.\nNeither Apollo nor Athena looked kindly upon anyone who crossed them. Niobe, queen of Thebes, bragged that, having born 14 children, she deserved more honor than Leto. Apollo and his sister Artemis punished the disrespectful Niobe by killing her children. Apollo also executed an arrogant satyr, Marsyas, who recklessly challenged the god of music to a flute contest. Predictably, Marsyas lost, and Apollo had him flayed alive.\nAthena was also quick to take offense. Arakhne, a talented weaver, boasted that she could best Athena in a contest, though Athena was the goddess of crafts. The young mortal's tapestry was so flawless that Athena, incensed, turned the woman into a spider. Athena was evidently modest, as well. When Tiresias happened to see Athena bathing, she blinded him.\nWhen they weren’t disciplining misbehaving mortals, Apollo and Athena were very generous. Apollo created the oracle of Delphi, consulted by many Greeks seeking to know their fates. As the god of plague, he wiped out rats and locusts that were troubling humans. Murderers could seek the religious healing skills of Apollo to cleanse themselves of their sins.\nAthena was drawn to assisting heroes. The goddess helped Perseus slay the snake-haired gorgon Medusa, whose glance turned mortals to stone. Athena told Perseus the secret of killing Medusa: Look into a mirror, rather than directly at her, during the decapitation. When Hercules was driven mad, murdering much of his family, Athena saved the hero’s father. Hercules had to perform 12 labors as punishment for the deaths, and Athena assisted him with two: killing the Nemean lion and vanquishing the Stymphalian Birds.\n- Photos.com/Photos.com/Getty Images""]"	['<urn:uuid:c9d1cd54-196c-4fc1-a696-107d68f85e53>', '<urn:uuid:4ea30680-fb76-4ffe-8ba2-3e712953f728>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	15	88	1450
93	what happens if baby becomes unresponsive during choking emergency steps for cpr	If the baby becomes unconscious, you should commence CPR at a rate of 30 compressions to 2 breaths.	['Paediatric First Aid Training Choking – Paediatric first aid training will be relevant to most people at some point in their life. If you are a parent, one of the greatest fears that most parents have is that their child/baby will become ill and you will be helpless or not be sure, exactly what to do in the event of an emergency. Even if you are not a parent, you may well have nieces, nephews or have friends with children that you may come into regular contact with, and just knowing some basic paediatric first aid may well save a child/babie’s life. Others may work with children or babie’s as part of their job, such as nursery nurses, childminders, nannies and anybody employed in a primary school environment.\nOne of the greatest fears for a child (age 1 to 8 years) is that the child may choke on an object they put in their mouth. Younger children are prone to putting things into their mouth as they explore things. The first thing to do is check in the mouth to see if the object is visible. If it is and you think you can remove the object, put your fingers in the childs mouth and extricate the object, if it is safe to so. If you cannot see the object, dont put your fingers down the childs mouth. Ask the child to lean forward ( gravity may help in the removal ) and cough a couple of times to see if the object can be removed. If this is unsuccessful, try to sit down and lean the child across your lap and carry out upto five backslaps using the heel of your hand between the shoulder blades. If this is unsuccessful , by standing or kneeling, place your hands around the child from behind. Making a fist with one hand, the other hand should grasp the fist. Place your hands just above the navel. Use a scooping movement (inwards and upwards) to try and dislodge the obstruction. Use this technique upto 5 times. If this fails keep trying the backslaps and abdominal thrusts, alternately. If abdominal thrusts have been successful, always have the child checked out at hospital as this technique can cause internal injuries.\nIf the child becomes unconscious carry out Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation at a rate of 30 compressions to 2 breaths, whilst the child is lying down on a solid surface.\nIf a baby (up to 1 year of age) chokes, have a look in the babies mouth to see if the object can be removed. If you cannot see the object do not attempt to put your hands down a babies throat. Try upto 5 backslaps by lying the baby across your lap and supporting the babies head with one hand across the babies jawline. If this is unsuccessful try 5 chest thrusts by lying the baby on a solid surface and pressing down with 2 fingers on the bottom of the babies sternum.\nIf the baby becomes unconscious, commence CPR at a rate of 30 compressions to 2 breaths.']	['<urn:uuid:ba098df1-ad9b-4a82-bb20-94edf8841081>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	12	18	514

In a clinical trial, selected lactobacilli were administered to pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis before 20 weeks gestation, though the study's sample size was insufficient to determine statistical significance in preventing preterm delivery. Regarding safety, while probiotics have an extensive history of apparently safe use, there are potential risks including infections, production of harmful substances by probiotic microorganisms, and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. The risks should be carefully weighed against benefits, particularly in high-risk individuals.

95	walnuts benefits blood vessels vs nuts	Walnuts specifically help keep blood vessels open due to their high L-arginine content, while nuts in general (including almonds, cashews, and other varieties) provide heart health benefits through monounsaturated fats, vitamin E, magnesium, copper, and phytochemicals. Walnuts have the additional advantage of being rich in omega-3s, which other nuts don't specifically contain.	['Introduction. A vasodilator is a drug, agent, or nerve that causes vasodilatation (widening) of the walls of blood vessels. Vasodilator drugs relax the muscle in blood vessels, and the vessels dilate. Vasodilators are medications used to open up blood vessels and prevent heart-related health conditions, but there are also natural vasodilators that can dilate vessels and increase blood flow.\nVasodilators have impact on the walls of muscles of the arteries and veins. They prevent the muscles from tightening and the wall from narrowing, which then allow blood to flow more freely through vessels. When blood is flowing easily, the heart doesn’t have to work as hard and blood pressure is reduced.\nThe production of Nitric Oxide is important for the regulation of blood flow. Abnormal nitric oxide production occurs in different disease situations. It can have a negative impact on blood flow and vascular functions. Nitric oxide is produced from the amino acid L-arginine (an essential amino acid of plant and animal proteins, necessary for nutrition and for the production of excretory urea.) by action from nitric oxide synthase Vascular actions of nitric oxide can include preventing sympathetic vasoconstriction, acting as an anti-inflammatory, having an anti-thrombotic effect, and preventing muscle hyperplasia. On the other hand, when nitric oxide production is hampered, it can lead to hypertension, thrombosis, vascular hypertrophy and stenosis, or excess inflammation.\nNitric oxide is a strong vasodilator; something you can get from flavonoid and L-arginine rich foods. There are many natural vasodilator foods to choose from.\nNatural Vasodilators to Increase Blood Flow\nNitric oxide is a drug or medicine that reduces blood pressure as well as prevent artery blockage and stroke. Boosting nitric oxide levels with food is sometimes a preferred option. No matter what your taste buds are like, you have to find something on the following list of natural vasodilators that you can enjoy.\n- Arginine. Arginine has amino acid that can be found in protein-rich foods, such as chicken, turkey, and dairy products. Arginine is a precursor to nitric oxide, so it is one of the best natural vasodilator options.\n- Arugula. This type of lettuce (a cultivated plant of the daisy family, with edible leaves that are eaten in salads.) has the highest source of nitrates. It can be a little bitter, so many people mix it in with other types of lettuce or sauté it with other vegetables. Arugula is also called garden rocket or salad rocket. It is often referred to in England as a “fancy pants” (more sophisticated) kind of leaf lettuce.\n- Beets. Large number of studies revealed that beetroot an excellent vasodilator, especially when it comes to lowering blood pressure. Beets are also a source of anti-oxidants and betalains (A class of red and yellow indole-derived water-soluble pigments found in beets and other plants of the Caryophyllales and used commercially as coloring agents.), which are good anti-inflammatories.\n- Cayenne. Cayenne has a warming impact, which can help dilate blood vessels. Excessive use of cayenne is not recommended, however including it in small quantity in meals will be very helpful.\n- Citrus. The most important point is thatResearch suggests that vitamin C protects nitric oxide molecules from free radical damage, making it a good natural vasodilator. Foods like oranges, lemons, and grapefruit contain large amounts of vitamin C. This vitamin is known to raise levels of nitric oxide synthase, which again is the enzyme that converts L-arginine into nitric oxide.\n- Coffee. Many researches has shown that coffee can boost vasodilation and blood flow. One of the study conducted in 2015 indicated that men are less likely to experience erectile dysfunction due to poor blood flow when they drink two or more cups of coffee each day.\n- Dark chocolate. Raw cacao bean increases nitric oxide and is also full of antioxidants. It can lower blood pressure and impact markers of inflammation. Keep in mind that it is loaded with sugar, so it should be consumed occasionally. Remember that it is dark chocolate which is referred as dark chocolate only.\n- Garlic. Although garlic does not contain a lot of nitrates, it does boost the enzyme nitric oxide synthase. Research indicates that garlic supplements can lower blood pressure and have many other health benefits. Garlic is a very popular vegetable among many different cultures and can be used in countless dishes.\n- Ginger. Ginger root is known as a vasodilator. It can open up blood vessels to allow blood to pass through. It also has anti-inflammatory properties. The root of the ginger can be consumed fresh, powdered, dry as a spice, in oil form, or as a juice. There are many other health benefits linked to ginger root besides the fact that it can act like a vasodilator.\n- Hawthorne. Hawthorne has been used for centuries to address blood circulation problems and heart issues. It can interact with other heart medications, so it is important to use Hawthorne under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.\n- Parsley. Parsley is apopular herb that is also found in many different supplements is a natural vasodilator. The great thing about parsley is that it also contains other properties that promote good health. Since parsley does not have a strong flavor, it is used often in restaurants.\n- Pomegranate. Pomegranate is capable of boosting nitric oxide, reducing inflammation, and reducing oxidative stress, which are all factors related to coronary artery disease. Polyphenols in pomegranate help convert nitrite into nitric oxide, making it a viable natural vasodilator inside human body.\n- Rosemary. Fresh rosemary can increase blood flow and is a great food additive. Poultry and lamb are good examples of foods that many people sprinkle with rosemary.\n- Spinach. In its fresh form (not tined/canned), this leafy vegetable is packed with nitrates. This versatile veggie can be added to soups, stews, pasta dishes, or even pizza.\n- Walnuts. Walnut processes high quantity of L-arginine, so it helps to keep blood vessels open. Many other nuts are also good sources of L-arginine. Nutritionists suggest soaking nuts for five to six hours before consuming them. If you don’t like walnuts, you can consider almonds, cashews, pine nuts, Brazil nuts, or macadamia nuts.\nConclusion: While thinking best available natural vasodilator options, it is nice to see that there are a wide variety of foods to choose from. This must bring some reassurance, especially to those who are not keen on vasodilator medications, any use of foods to control vascular health should be discussed with a doctor. Taking treatment into your own hands can be dangerous. When planned in consultation with a healthcare professional though, foods can make a big difference when it comes to vasodilation.', '1. Soy: The Smart, Delicious Alternative\n( PHOTOGRAPH BY LAUREN BURKE/GETTY IMAGES )\nReducing saturated fat is the single most important dietary change you can make to cut blood cholesterol. Used as a replacement for meat and cheese, soy foods help your heart by slashing the amount of saturated fat that you eat.Why is saturated fat so bad for your heart? The liver uses saturated fat to make cholesterol, so eating foods with too much saturated fat can increase cholesterol levels, especially low-density lipoproteins (LDL)—the bad cholesterol. Saturated fats are usually found in animal products such as whole milk, cream, butter, and cheese, and meats, such as beef, lamb and pork. There are some plant-based saturated fats you should avoid too, notably palm kernel oil, coconut oil, and vegetable shortening.\nBeyond replacing saturated fat, research suggests that compounds in soy foods called isoflavones may also work to reduce LDL cholesterol.\nHow to get some: Not familiar with soy foods? The basics include tofu,soy nuts, soy flour, and enriched soymilk. Great-tasting, protein-rich meat alternatives include soy sausage, and breaded cutlets and nuggets that taste like chicken. Crumbled soy—an alternative to ground meat—works well in chili, burritos, lasagna, soups, and casseroles. Add tofu to chili, eggs, or casseroles. It absorbs the flavor of whatever you’re cooking. You’ll find many soy products in the produce section of the supermarket.\nWhat about soy supplements? Research shows that isoflavone supplements alone don’t work. To lower cholesterol, you need the whole soybean with its unique protein, phytates, and isoflavones, which may all act together.\nEat this much: The FDA recommends getting at least 25 grams of soy protein each day. Consuming 25 grams of soy protein daily lowers high cholesterol.\n2. Beans: The High Fiber Solution\nExcept for your morning wheat bran, no food is more fiber-rich than beans. And beans are especially high in cholesterol-lowering soluble fiber. Eating a cup of any type of beans a day—particularly kidney, navy, pinto, black, chickpea, or butter beans—can lower cholesterol by as much as 10% in 6 weeks.\nSoluble fiber forms a gel in water that helps bind acids and cholesterol in the intestinal tract, preventing their re-absorption into the body. This may be why soluble fiber helps to lower cholesterol levels (and decreases the risk of heart disease). Soluble fiber is also found in oats and oat bran, barley, brown rice, beans, apples, carrots, and most other fruits and vegetables.\nHow to get some: Keep your cupboards stocked with canned beans of all kinds: black, white, kidney, fat-free refried, etc. (as well as instant bean soups). You’ll always have the makings of a delicious, healthful dinner on hand. Beans add protein and fiber to any dish and can be used in salads, stuffed baked potatoes, veggie chili, or pureed for sandwich spreads. And since they come in cans, beans are handy to use. But remember to rinse canned beans first—they’re packed in a high-sodium liquid.\nEat this much: Eat beans five or more times a week. For the greatest health benefits, both the FDA and the National Cancer Institute recommend that adults get 25 to 30 g of fiber each day.\nMORE: Cook Once, Eat All Week With Black Beans\n3. Salmon: Amazing Heart-Friendly Fat\nResearch has shown certain types of fat actually protect against high cholesterol. Omega-3 fatty acids—found in salmon and other cold-water fish—help lower “bad” LDL cholesterol, raise “good” HDL cholesterol, and lower triglycerides.\nSalmon is an excellent source of protein because it is high in omega-3fatty acids called EPA and DHA that are good for your heart while low in cholesterol and saturated fat.\nHow to get some: To get the most omega-3s, choose salmon, white albacore tuna canned in water, rainbow trout, anchovies, herring, sardines, and mackerel.\nEat this much: The American Heart Association now recommends eating at least two servings of fish every week, preferably fatty fish, by far the richest sources of fish-oil omega-3s.\nMORE: 3 Ways To Cook Fish So It Doesn’t Smell\n4. Avocado: Healthy Fat Superfood\n( PHOTOGRAPH BY MARIUSZ BLACH/GETTY IMAGES )\nAvocados are a great source of heart-healthy monounsaturated fat?a type of fat that may actually help to raise levels of HDL (“good”cholesterol) while lowering levels of LDL (“bad” cholesterol). And these delectable green orbs pack more of the cholesterol-smashing beta-sitosterol (a beneficial plant-based fat) than any other fruit. Beta-sitosterol reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed from food. So the combination of beta-sitosterol and monounsaturated fat makes the avocado an excellent cholesterol buster.How to get some: Avocado is a bit high in calories. Your best strategy: Use this luscious veggie in place of another high-fat food or condiment.\nEat this much: The American Heart Association recommends that you get up to 15% of your daily calories from monounsaturated fats like those contained in avocados, but some heart experts recommend an even greater percentage. (In an 1,800-calorie diet, 15% translates into 30 grams per day.) FYI: A whole avocado has about 300 calories and 30g fat. (Check out these 8 delicious ideas for avocados.)\n5. Garlic: The Ancient Herb for Heart Health\nFor thousands of years, garlic has been used in nearly every culture in the world, and not just to repel evil. Its nutritional value and flavor have made it a kitchen staple. Ancient Egyptians ate garlic for stamina; in modern times, garlic has been found to lower cholesterol, prevent blood clots, reduce blood pressure, and protect against infections. Now research has found that it helps stop artery-clogging plaque at its earliest stage (called nanoplaque). How? Garlic keeps individual cholesterol particles from sticking to artery walls.\nHow to get some: Next time you hit the supermarket, pick up a tub of freshly peeled garlic cloves, and challenge yourself to make sure it’s gone before the “best by” date. Chop up and toss on pizza, in soups, or on side dishes.\nEat this much: To reap benefits, try for 2 to 4 fresh cloves a day.\n6. Spinach: The Heart Healthy Green Giant\nSpinach contains lots of lutein, the sunshine-yellow pigment found in dark green leafy vegetables and egg yolks. Lutein already has a “golden” reputation for guarding against age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness. Now research suggests that just a ½ cup of a lutein-rich food daily also guards against heart attacks by helping artery walls “shrug off” cholesterol invaders that cause clogging.\nHow to get some: Look for 9-oz bags of baby spinach leaves that you can pop in the microwave (ready in 3 minutes). Top with 2 tablespoons of Parmesan and 1 tablespoon of toasted sunflower seeds. Add a roll, and you’ve got a heavenly low-cal dinner for one.\nEat this much: Spinach is the richest source of lutein. Shoot for a ½ cup a day.\nAre you at risk for the #1 cause of heart-related death?\n7. Margarine: Best Spreads for Your Breads\nTwo margarines are proven to help lower your cholesterol numbers: Take Control and Benecol. They do so by blocking the absorption of the cholesterol contained in your food and bile.\nTake Control margarine is made with plant sterols that are proven to lower both total and LDL cholesterol by up to 14%. The plant stanols in Benecol margarine work the same way. Both the National Cholesterol Education Program and the American Heart Association recommend these margarines.\nHow to get some: Spread these margarines on your toast or bagel in the morning or for a mid-day snack. The only side effect is reduced beta-carotene absorption. To compensate, make sure you eat extra carrots, spinach, sweet red peppers, or sweet potatoes.\nEat this much: In studies, three servings a day of Benecol helped drop total blood cholesterol by an average of 10% and LDL cholesterol by 14%. Take Control helped drop total cholesterol an average of 6 to 8% and LDL by 7 to 10% with one to two servings a day. Check labels for serving size.\n8. Tea: The Hot and Cool Superdrink\n( PHOTOGRAPH BY ALBERTO BOGO/GETTY IMAGES )\nTea, whether it’s iced or hot, delivers a blast of antioxidant compounds. Studies prove that tea helps to keep blood vessels relaxed and prevent blood clots. Flavonoids, the major antioxidants in tea, have been shown to prevent the oxidation of LDL cholesterol that leads to plaque formation on artery walls. These powerful antioxidants may even reduce cholesterol and even lower blood pressure.How to get some: Enjoy a cup of hot or iced tea. Although convenience iced teas still have high antioxidant levels, most homemade iced tea (both hot-brewed and fridge teas) have even more antioxidants. So, if you want the very max, make your own.\nDrink this much: A cup of hot tea actually contains more antioxidants than a serving of any fruit or vegetable. Both green and black teas have high antioxidant levels. Enjoy at least one cup of tea every day.\nMORE: How To Brew The Perfect Cup Of Tea Every Time\n9. Walnuts, Cashews, and Almonds: Go (Mixed) Nuts!\nA moderate-fat diet that’s rich in the healthy monounsaturated fats found in nuts may actually be twice as good for your heart as a low-fat diet. Nuts also have vitamin E, magnesium, copper, and phytochemicals that have been linked to heart health. And walnuts are also rich in omega-3s. People who eat nuts regularly have less heart disease and other illnesses than people who don’t. The heart-healthy monounsaturated fats they contain are also better for your joints than the polyunsaturated fats found in corn and safflower oils.\nHow to get some: The key is moderation: Nuts are high in calories. Keep a jar of chopped nuts in your fridge, and sprinkle 2 tablespoons a day on cereal, veggies, salads, or yogurt. Or add them to your diet by sprinkling chopped nuts on stir-fries. Almonds, hazelnuts, or walnuts can be added to pilafs. Make a trail mix with your favorite nuts, seeds and dried fruit.\nEat this much: Aim for 2 tablespoons of chopped nuts five times a week, or a small handful as a snack 3-4 times a week.\n10. Chocolate: The Sweet Heart Bonus\nWant to help your heart the next time you indulge in chocolate candy? Choose the dark or bittersweet kind. Compared to milk chocolate, it has more than three times as many antioxidants. These flavonoid antioxidants work to keep blood platelets from sticking together and may even help keep your arteries unclogged. Milk chocolate is good too, having as much antioxidant power as red wine. And what about white chocolate? Sorry, it has no flavonoids at all.\nHow to get some: The levels of flavonoids in chocolate vary, depending on where it is grown and handled and how it is processed. Researchers have been studying a variety of chocolate, developed by Mars, Inc., with guaranteed high-flavonoid levels. You can find it now in Mars Dove bars. To control the calories, buy Dove dark chocolate Promises. Indulge in one flavorful, high-flavonoid morsel daily, for just 42 calories and 2.6 g of fat.\nEat this much: Research shows that about an ounce of chocolate a day increases good cholesterol and prevents bad cholesterol from oxidizing.']	['<urn:uuid:c2330b47-e85f-41e9-aa81-6c380caff731>', '<urn:uuid:6b005067-ab53-4883-9004-71d6600f8165>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T18:59:47.758973	6	52	2961

98	Is regular maintenance easier for scissors or farm tools?	Both scissors and farm tools require similar regular maintenance. Scissors need sharpening every couple of months, while farm tools should be cleaned, sharpened, and lubricated every time they're put away. The more frequent the maintenance, the easier it is for both types.	"['How To: Sharpen Scissors\nNever let your trusty scissors go dull again! Follow these 5 easy steps to keep both blades sharp for everyday snipping.\nUsed for cutting paper, cardboard, fabric, string, price tags, plastic packaging—that list goes on—those scissors in your office or kitchen drawer might be the most reliable everyday tool in your house. With such regular use, that trusty tool dulls over time. Most scissors are not prohibitively expensive, so when one pair dulls you may consider just going out and buying another. But of course that’s not necessary (not to mention a waste of money) if you how to sharpen scissors. Essentially, scissors are two knives connected at a pivot point. So not surprisingly, you can sharpen scissors just as you would kitchen knives, with a couple of simple tools and some practice.\nTo sharpen scissors most effectively, you need a sharpening stone (sometimes called a bench stone). You can get one at the hardware store for less than $20, and it will serve to sharpen most any blade you have, from your kitchen knives to your pruning shears. We like the Lanksy Puck (view product on Amazon) for its compact size and user-friendly shape, but you can’t go wrong with any quality, two-sided stone.\nhanIf your scissors are very dull, you’ll need to start with the coarse side and then move to the finer side to finish. If your scissors just need a light tune-up, you’ll use only the finer side.\nLay your sharpening stone on a towel and lubricate it with oil or water. Stores sell honing oil alongside sharpening stones, but you can use any oil, or even water, for lubrication.\nRemove the screw that holds your scissors’ blades together in order to treat each one separately. It will be much easier to work on them.\nAs mentioned, if your scissors are particularly dull, you’ll want to turn over your stone to work first on the coarse side; if not, start working with the finer side. Place the blade onto the stone with the beveled edge facing you. Then, gripping the handle, tilt the blade toward you until the beveled edge lies flat on the stone. Now, slowly pull the blade across the stone to you, keeping that beveled edge flat against the stone. Repeat this action—carefully!—until the blade has sharpened. If you started on the coarse side of the stone, finish with a few swipes on the finer side of the stone.\nUntil you’re practiced, you may find it hard to judge when the edge has been completely sharpened. Here’s a tip: Before starting, run a permanent marker across the blade edge. When the marker has disappeared, you’ve sharpened the entire blade.\nRepeat Step 3 with the second blade of the scissors.\nOnce you’ve finished with the sharpening stone, you will see a fine edge of burrs along the blade; these need to be removed. Reassemble the scissors by screwing the blades back together, and open then shut them a few times. Knock the burrs off by making a few trial cuts through a piece of material those scissors are meant for, be it fabric or paper. If you’re happy with how sharp the scissors are, you’re finished. If not, repeat the process.\nYou should practice on some old scissors until you get the hang of it—Grandma will be mad if you ruin her antique sewing scissors! But it won’t take you long to get comfortable, and then you’ll never have dull scissors in the home again. Once you’re familiar with how it’s done, it’s really no sweat to sharpen scissors and keep them sharp with quick, regular maintenance every couple of months. Happy cutting!', ""- Author: Hannah Meyer\n- Editor: Cindy Fake\nSadly, there are a lot of dull, rusted tools out there, even on productive farms. If you watch the videos at the end of this post, you will hear “Rust is always a sign of neglect” so let this be the end of neglect. Put your tools “to bed for the winter,” or prepare them for pruning season, right around the corner.\nThere are three main parts of tool maintenance: clean, sharpen, and lubricate. These three steps should simply be done, in that order, every single time a tool is put back in the shed. The more often you do it, the easier and more effective it is at improving the lifespan of your tools.\nClean: There are three steps - cleaning off debris, removing rust, and sanitizing to prevent the transfer of disease. Proper cleaning may require removing screws and partially dismantling the tool.\nClean – Pressurized water, or a wire brush and a little soapy water are effective when used to scrub off all dirt and debris from your tool.\nRust? – Sometimes, especially if your tools have not been constantly maintained properly, you may see a rusted tool that just isn't what it used to be. Don't worry, if you have this problem, there are some easy tips that can help take that rust off. Spray the tool with vinegar, wrap in a paper towel and cover in plastic for about three hours, up to 24 hours. Remove the paper towel and plastic. Use a brush, an old toothbrush works just fine on small projects, put some baking soda in water and use the brush to scrub off the rust. Turpentine and steel wool also work well. After you scrub the tool to remove the rust, rinse thoroughly with water.\nSanitize – To ensure your tools are not going to spread disease around your farm, sanitation is important. Wipe down the tool surface with a 10% bleach solution (10 parts water to 1 part bleach), leave it for 30 seconds and then rinse thoroughly with water. Be sure to dry and oil your tool after sanitizing to be sure it does not rust from the bleach! Learn how below.\nSharpen: Many tools, even though you may not think of them as having a blade, actually require frequent sharpening to ensure their consistent function. A shovel, for instance, needs sharpening on the edge, which helps cut through roots, make clean holes, among other things. The basic method of sharpening is pretty simple. Use caution when sharpening and be sure to wear the proper protective equipment, such as gloves and eye protection.\nStabilize – Small tools, such as hand pruning shears, may easily be held firmly with the non-dominant hand. Larger tools, such as mower blades, or loppers, may need to be held in a vise.\nSharpen - Locate the proper edges to sharpen. Remember that there is a cutting blade and a bypass edge on some tools like pruning shears. You only need to sharpen the blade. A file can be used and should only be pushed in one direction. Hold the file at an angle, usually 45 degrees to the blade. Be sure to lubricate the blade and properly tighten screws after sharpening.\nIf you would like to pay a professional to sharpen your tools, at our January 9th Farmer-to-Farmer Breakfast, Ruben with Sharpening Tech will available to sharpen tools. Watch for an announcement on the Foothill Farming Calendar.\nLubricate: It is very important to oil your tools, even if they do not need to be sharpened. Oil helps keep the rust at bay. If your tool comes in contact with food crops or soil, we recommend a plant-based oil, like linseed oil for wood handles, and vegetable oil for pruners and shovels. This should happen each time your tools are put away. A barrel or bucket with sand and a small amount of oil left near your tool shed will work. Simply stabbing the tool in and out of the sand mixture can remove debris and oil the tool at the same time.\nStore your tools standing upright or hanging, this also helps prevent rust. Develop a system to maintain your tools and always have them in their correct place so that anyone working in your operation can find the right tool anytime. Livestock Advisor Dan Macon has developed a system of sharpening his tools and oiling all the handles on New Year's Eve each year. He also prepared a lambing box, and outfits it with sufficient supplies and freshly sharpened tools each year before lambing season.

99	barcode storage amount difference numbers vs letters	Code 128 has different storage efficiencies depending on the type of data. When using Code C for numeric-only data, it can encode two digits per character, effectively doubling the density compared to alphanumeric data. This is shown in the length equations: L = (11C + 35)X for alphanumeric data, versus L = (5.5C + 35)X for numeric-only data using Code C.	"['BarCode 1 Code 128 Page\nThis Visit Brought To You By\nCode 128 is a very high density alphanumeric bar code. The symbol can be as long as necessary to store the encoded data. It is designed to encode all 128 ASCII characters, and will use the least amount of space for data of 6 characters or more of any 1-D symbology.\nEach data character encoded in a Code 128 symbol is made up of 11 black or white modules. The stop character, however, is made up of 13 modules. Three bars and three spaces are formed out of these 11 modules. Bar and spaces can vary between 1 and 4 modules wide.\nThe symbol includes a quiet zone (10 x-dimensions), a start character, the encoded data, a check character, the stop character, and a trailing quiet zone (10 x-dimensions). For optimum hand-scanning with a contact reader, the quiet zone should be at least 0.25 inches.\nFor labels in an open system, the minimum x-dimension is 7.5 mils. The minimum bar height is 15 percent of the symbol length or 0.25 inches, whichever is greater\nThere are 106 different 3 bar/3space combinations. Each of the 106 combinations can be assigned one of three different character set meanings. To see the character sets for Code 128, click here. These meanings are set by using one of three different start characters. Start Code A allows encoding all the standard alphanumeric keyboard characters plus control characters and special characters. Start Code B includes all standard alphanumeric keyboard characters plus lower case alpha and special characters. Start Code C includes a set of 100 digit pairs from 00 to 99 and can be used to double the density of encoding numeric-only data.\nWithin a symbol, one can shift between code sets by using the special character CODE and SHIFT. The CODE character shifts the code for all subsequent characters to the specified code set. The SHIFT character just changes the next character and only changes between Code Set A and Code Set B or the reverse.\nThe FNC codes define instructions for the bar code reader. FNC 1 is reserved for future use. FNC 2 tells the reader to store the data read and transmit it with the next symbol. FNC 3 is reserved for code reader initializing and other code reader functions. FNC 4 is reserved for future applications.\nEach character has a value ranging from 0 to 105. This value is used to calculate the check character for each symbol.\nThe check character is a Modulus 103 Checksum that is calculated by summing the start code value plus the product of each character position (most significant character position equals 1) and the character value of the character at that position. This sum is divided by 103. The remainder of the answer is the value of the Check Character (which can be looked up from the table). Every encoded character is included except the Stop and Check Character.\nExample: BarCode 1 Message : Start B B a r C o d e 1 Value 104 34 65 82 35 79 68 69 0 17 Position: - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Calculate Total: 104 + (34x1) + (65x2) + (82x3) + (35x4) + (79x5) + (68x6) + (69x7) + (0x8) + (17x9) = 2093 2093/103 = 20 remainder 33 33 = A Final message: (Start B)BarCode 1(A)(STOP)\nPLEASE NOTE: When you print the checksum character ""A"", you are REALLY printing ASCII character number 65 (not 33). You must add 32 to whatever the checksum number to find out what ASCII CHARACTER must be printed. Let\'s say you are printing a code A barcode using START A, and the checksum number you calculate is 64. You might think you would print a NULL character, but you would be wrong. You must add 32 to 64 to get 96. You would print ASCII character 96 (or the ` character)\nThe height of the bars must be at least .15 times the symbol\'s length or .25 inches, whichever is larger. The overall length of the symbol is given by the equation:\nL = (11C + 35)X (alphanumeric) L = (5.5C + 35)X (numeric only using Code C)\nThis calculator will show you the length of a Code 128 bar code given the X dimension and total number of data characters, including function characters and shift characters. Note that one data character can encode two numeric digits if character subset C is used. Please note: if you want an X-dimension of, for example, 0.0085 inches, you need to enter ""8.5"".\nYou can see a table of characters, values, and bar/space patterns for Code 128 by clicking here.\nAltek Instruments based in the UK also has pages with Code 128 specifications.\nYou can purchase complete, official specifications from the following organizations:\nX5-4, Uniform Symbol Specification - Code 128\nAIM Global, Inc.\nprEN 799 Bar coding - Symbology specifications - Code 128\nNNI, P.O.

100	chocolate making process deforestation impact	The chocolate making process involves harvesting cocoa fruits, fermenting beans for three days, sun-drying, and roasting them before shipping to factories where they're ground, processed, and molded into chocolate bars. However, this industry is currently threatened by deforestation, particularly in the Amazon where wild relatives of cocoa are being eliminated, and in West Africa where soil depletion is making cultivation more difficult. This environmental degradation, combined with aging trees and increased pest risks, is creating significant challenges for the small farmers who produce most of the world's cocoa. The situation requires urgent attention and substantial investment, with companies like Barry Callebaut estimating that their West African supply chain alone needs approximately $250 million in risk guarantees for loans to support sustainable farming practices.	['Chocolate- the word that brings almost a sinful temptation in all of us is at present one of the most popular treats across the world. Chocolate bars, chocolate cakes, chocolate syrup, chocolate sauce, hot chocolate, chocolate milkshake- the list of delicious chocolate dishes is endless. But have you ever wondered about the origin of your precious chocolate? Yes, you might know that chocolate is derived from the seeds of cocoa, a fruit that grows in the equatorial region. But, the journey of a cocoa been to become a chocolate bar is fascinating in its own right. Let us bring you some glimpses of this journey.\nChocolate is made from seeds of the cocoa fruit which was first discovered by The Mayans and they called it the “food of the gods.”\nThe Mayans of South America discovered cocoa in 900 AD and learned that the beans inside cocoa could be turned into a liquid. In fact, the word ‘chocolate’ is believed to come from the Mayans word ‘xocolatl’ which means ‘bitter water.’\nIn the equatorial forests of Africa and North America, grows the cocoa tree. Its fruits were traditionally used by native tribes to make drinks which were an integral part of their culture. However, it was later dicovered that the cocoa seeds could be processed to yield a beautiful component-the chocolate.\nToday, most of the world’s chocolate is produced in the African continent, with a little amount also grown in Mexico and parts of North America. Ivory Coast is the world’s lagets producer of cocoa seeds and exports its produce all over the world. The first step in chocolate production involves the harvesting of ripe cocoa fruits from trees. As the fruits ripen they become yellow and are plucked from trees manually using sticks and other contraptions. As the use of machines might harm the cocoa flowers and other parts of the tree, cocoa harvesting largely relies on manual labour. Beans are then taken out from the fruit although locals make jellys and drinks from the pulp and rind of the fruit.\nThe beans from the cocoa fruit have to be fermented for three days, sun-dried and then roasted to develop the intoxicating chocolate flavour that we all love\nOnce the fruits have been plucked, the beans have to be taken out and fermented. The process of fermentation needs to be done just right so that the chocolate flavour is fully developed. The cocoa beans are placed in large fermentation chambers for three days, so that microorganisms form on and the process can start. It is the aroma of alcohol that develops on the beans that tell you that the process has been executed correctly. Also the beans swell up.\nNext, the beans have to be dried in the sun evenly on both sides. This process takes considerable amount of time as well. The sun-dried beans are then roasted so that the cover of the beans can be easily peeled off and the chocolate flavour is fully developed.\nThe fermented, dried, roasted cocoa beans are now ready to be shipped to a chocolate factory.\nThe roasted cocoa beans from Africa travel to chocolate factories where they are grinded, processed, tempered and moulded before they take the form of fancy chocolate bars\nThe dried cocoa beans are now put through a grinding or a miling machine to liquefy the cocoa butter and produce a smooth chocolate liquer. Optional materials like sugar, milk crumb and letichin are then added to the cocoa mass and the mixture is put through a second refining process by passing it through a roll refiner. The chocolate mixture is now smooth and waiting to be put into the conch machine. The conching proces is where you continuously knead the chocolate fixture for eight to ten hours to give a silky shiny and smooth texture to your chocolate. The chocolate next has to be tempered evenly so as to eliminate any air bubbles and then put into molds. And voila! A fruit up in an African tree has now become the chocolate bar in your hand. Fascinating, right?\nChocolates are what dreams are made of. Now that you know how a humble cocoa bean travels all across the world to become the dessert on your table, we hope you will appreciate it even more. Happy eating.', 'That morning ritual loved by millions, a simple cup of coffee, may one day be a thing of the past. New research shows that 60 per cent of the world’s 124 species of wild coffee face a mounting threat of extinction, mostly as a result of deforestation. This potential loss of genetic diversity would, in turn, limit the ways in which coffee could be adapted to a changing climate and disease threats.\nIt’s not just coffee that is in danger. Deforestation is also threatening cocoa and the future of chocolate. Forest loss in the Amazon is eliminating wild relatives of cocoa, while in West Africa it is quickly depleting soils and making crop cultivation much harder. Soil depletion, along with aging trees and the increased risk of pests and disease, is threatening the livelihoods of the already-poor small farmers who produce the vast majority of the world’s cocoa and coffee.\nWith 25 million coffee producers and up to six million cocoa farmers (and their families) worldwide, any effort to end this cycle of human and natural-resource poverty must match the size and scope of the problem. Fortunately, the smart use of cutting-edge technology makes it possible to take on the challenge.\nNew initiatives must help farmers rapidly adopt sustainable practices and increase the productivity of existing agricultural land, so that they can improve their own wellbeing and ease pressure on forests. Efforts to alleviate poverty among farmers also need to address gaps in financing, agricultural training, and tools for advance planning.\nThis is where technology can play a key role. Data, digital and remote-sensing technology, and the Internet of Things represent the future of agriculture, and are already in use on big farms in rich countries. But technology can also help small farms in poorer countries, where innovative approaches must be developed, piloted, supported, and scaled.\nTechnology can also help small farms in poorer countries, where innovative approaches must be developed, piloted, supported, and scaled.\nAfrica has produced numerous ingenious examples of this. In Ghana, collaboration between agribusiness, civil society, and academia has led to SAT4Farming, which uses digital and remote-sensing technology to create farm development plans (FDPs) for smallholders. Developed by Grameen Foundation in partnership with the Rainforest Alliance and Mars, the digital FDP incorporates farm data such as environmental conditions, household financing, and production levels, and applies “smart logic” to generate seven-year plans that guide smallholders’ investments. These plans, similar to profit-and-loss statements, are then adjusted every year based on farmers’ decisions.\nOne early adopter of a digital FDP is Peter Oppong, a cocoa farmer in Ghana for the past 17 years. Based on its recommendations, Peter began to replace his aging trees. Because of the high costs, he started with just one-quarter of his land, and plans to add another quarter each year until he finishes. Meanwhile, other, less costly steps, such as tree pruning, have yielded quick results.\nPeter was fortunate to have the funds to rehabilitate his farm. Many cocoa and coffee farmers do not. And without access to financing, even the best agronomic advice is for naught. Here, too, radical new approaches are needed.\nOne such approach is FarmDrive in Kenya, which gives lenders detailed credit scores on smallholder farmers using data from farmers’ mobile phones, alternative data (such as a farmer’s adoption of good agricultural practices), and machine learning. This information gives lenders greater assurance, boosting available credit for smallholders.\nMeanwhile, according to the chocolate manufacturer Barry Callebaut, the financial sector could give farmers access to affordable microcredit to fund good farming practices. The company says replanting just one hectare of cocoa costs approximately $2,400, and it estimates that thousands of hectares in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire need replanting. Its West African supply chain alone would need some $250 million in risk guarantees for loans to smallholder farmers.\nInnovative funding is needed in the coffee supply chain, too. Starbucks, for example, has established a $50 million Global Farmer Fund that supports farmers financially, including for renovation efforts. The fund has benefited more than 60 cooperatives in eight countries, and over 40,000 farmers.\nFinancing the transformation of the coffee and cocoa supply chains is a huge undertaking that calls for increased investment at all levels and a variety of approaches, including public-private lending partnerships for mitigating and sharing risks, and specially tailored microloan products and digital tools to assess creditworthiness. The smart use of big data can facilitate such initiatives, and provide deep insights into farmers’ needs and capacities.\nToday, far more is at stake than the comfort of a bar of chocolate or a morning hit of caffeine. Improving the wellbeing of smallholder farmers and their families could propel millions out of poverty. It also would have a profound, positive impact on both economic development and the ecosystems that support agriculture.\nSteve Hollingworth is President and CEO of Grameen Foundation.\nCopyright: Project Syndicate, 2019.\nThanks for reading to the end of this story!\nWe would be grateful if you would consider joining as a member of The EB Circle.
