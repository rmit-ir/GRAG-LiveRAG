1	maypole dairy margarine production capacity southall factory weekly output tons employees world largest	The Southall margarine factory was the largest in the world, covering 22,500 square yards and employing around 650 people. It had a weekly output of 700 tons of margarine initially, which increased to over 2,000 tons per week by 1918.	['Maypole Dairy was easily the largest retailer in Britain by 1913.\nThe Watson brothers and George Jackson\nGeorge Watson (1861 – 1930), Charles Henry Watson (1863 – 1927) and John Alfred Watson (1865 – 1931), were brothers born just outside Coventry to a prosperous farming family. They served as apprentices and later as assistants to George Jackson, a Birmingham dairy merchant.\nJackson had pioneered the sale of pure dairy butter at affordable prices by importing the product directly from Danish farmers. Jackson sold 30,000 tons of butter every year by 1893, and was the largest retailer of butter in the world.\nEstablishment of Maypole Dairy\nJackson’s strong reputation for butter meant that he was reluctant to branch out into margarine, which although gaining in popularity, was hampered by a downmarket image. However George Watson was free to take the chance, and he established the Maypole Dairy Company, with a margarine shop in Wolverhampton, from 1887. He was soon joined by his brothers, and outlets were opened across the Midlands. The shops also began to sell cheese and butter.\nMaypole Dairy was a high volume, low margin business, and outlets were concentrated in working class areas.\nCharles Watson was largely responsible for the expansion of the Maypole chain into Lancashire and Yorkshire.\nGeorge Watson introduced a profit-sharing scheme for management from 1890. Shortly afterwards, in a pioneering move, the scheme was extended to all employees.\nMaypole Dairy was the largest retailer of margarine in Britain by 1895. The business had 60 shops, eight creameries in Ireland and one in England, and purchasing offices in Denmark and Sweden.\nMaypole merges with George Jackson\nMaypole and George Jackson underwent a merger in 1898, and the company was incorporated with a share capital of £1 million. George Watson became chairman. The company had 185 retail shops and 17 creameries.\nMaypole acquired a margarine factory in Godley, Manchester, from Otto Monsted Ltd, a Danish company, in 1902. It was capable of producing 200 tons of margarine every week.\nMaypole had 560 retail shops by 1908, and was the largest retailer of tea, butter and margarine in the United Kingdom.\nMaypole reported a net profit of over £550,000 (£425 million in 2015) in 1912, of which all but £50,000 was distributed among shareholders as a 212.5% dividend.* By this time there were 712 stores across the United Kingdom, and the leading lines were margarine and tea. That year, George Watson was appointed a baronet.\nMaypole was the largest retail chain in Britain by a substantial margin by 1913, with over 800 shops.\nMaypole, and the Dutch producers Jergens and Van den Bergh produced most of the margarine sold in Britain, with Maypole producing almost as much as the other two combined by 1913.\nThe Manchester margarine factory was sold to Lever Brothers in 1914.\nMaypole acquired Otto Monsted’s margarine factory in Southall, Middlesex, and an edible oils refinery in Erith, South East London in 1915. The Southall factory covered 22,500 square yards, employed around 650 people and was the largest margarine factory in the world. It had a weekly output of 700 tons of margarine.\nMaypole margarine differed from competitors in that it was produced from tropical nuts and seeds rather than animal fats. Maypole established a groundnut operation in West Africa to provide raw material for margarine production in 1915. 25,000 to 30,000 tons of groundnuts were produced annually by 1919.\nMaypole dominated the sale and manufacture of margarine in the United Kingdom, with a 50 percent market share by 1918. The Southall site produced over 2,000 tons a week. Margarine accounted for 85 percent of Maypole sales.\nAcquisition by Home & Colonial\nMaypole capital amounted to £3 million (equivalent to just under £1 billion in 2015) in 1919. Turnover exceeded £36.5 million (£13.8 billion in 2015) in 1921.\nHowever shortly afterwards the company began to struggle with increased Dutch competition and the failure of its West African business. Six directors retired in 1924, including the chairman, George Watson, and they sold their stakes to Home & Colonial. Now the majority owner, Home & Colonial was itself controlled by Jurgens.\nMaypole increased its product lines to include jam, marmalade and lard from 1925. In 1928 biscuits were added, and cheese was re-introduced in packaged form.\nMaypole is absorbed into Unilever\nMaypole had over 1,040 retail outlets and a total capitalisation of over £9 million by 1929. That year, Jurgens and Van den Bergh merged with Lever Brothers of Britain to form Unilever. Maypole was now contractually obliged to purchase all of its margarine from Unilever. The Maypole manufacturing site at Southall was rendered redundant by the Unilever purchase, and was re-appropriated for the production of Wall’s sausages and ice cream. The Erith refinery was also closed.\nUnilever created a holding company for its grocery chains; Lipton, Home & Colonial and Maypole Dairy, called Allied Suppliers, in 1930. Allied Suppliers had a capital of £13.3 million, and was the largest grocery retailer in the world. Each retail company continued to be run independently, but there was co-operation in wholesale acquisitions and distribution.\nGeorge Watson died in 1930, leaving an estate valued at over £2 million (about £805 million in 2015).\nMaypole’s West African venture was sold to the United Africa Company, which was controlled by Unilever, in 1931.\nMaypole sold over 200,000 eggs in 1938.\nThere were 977 Maypole stores and 6,334 employees in 1939. Rivals such as Tesco, which utilised bulk purchasing from suppliers, began to challenge the vertical integration model practised by Maypole.\nBy 1943 all but two company directors, and practically all senior executives, were men who had started at the bottom ranks of the company and worked their way up.\nFaced with continued rationing after the war, Maypole began to extend its product range to include additional staples such as bacon from 1947.\nThe Maypole name is phased out\nThe independent management of Maypole ended in 1964. The Maypole name was phased out in the 1970s, when increased competition from supermarkets saw Allied Suppliers decide to concentrate on their Home & Colonial brand. Allied Suppliers eventually morphed into Safeway (UK), and the rights to the Maypole brand are now owned by Morrisons Supermarkets.\nUnilever continued to hold a 30 percent share of the global spreads market, until the divested their spreads unit in 2017.\n* Currency conversions are calculated by measuring wealth relative to the total output of the economy at the time.

3	What are the academic requirements to get into a criminal justice graduate program, and what are the physical fitness requirements to become a police officer in Tennessee?	For graduate programs in criminal justice, applicants need a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution, though it doesn't have to be in criminal justice specifically. Most programs require a minimum 3.0 GPA and GRE scores, with competitive applicants typically scoring between 155-160 on quantitative and verbal sections. As for physical fitness requirements in Tennessee, police officers must pass physical fitness testing at a POST-approved police academy as a requirement for graduation. This must be completed within their first year of employment to become certified officers.	"['Criminal justice students explore the creation, interpretation, and implementation of legal systems in the United States. Learners study legal procedures at the local, state, and federal levels. Graduates often work as police officers, lawyers, and forensic investigators.\nThe guide below includes crucial information on how to apply for graduate school.\nWhile a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice qualifies graduates for most entry-level law enforcement and legal positions, master’s degree holders are more competitive candidates for most roles. The guide below includes crucial information on how to apply for graduate school. Keep reading to learn the basic steps for applying to graduate school, including completing prerequisites, taking the GRE, writing a personal statement, crafting a resume, and securing letters of recommendation.\nCriminal Justice Graduate Program Prerequisites\nDo I Need a Bachelor\'s Degree in Criminal Justice to Earn a Criminal Justice Graduate Degree?\nApplying to graduate school in any discipline requires a bachelor’s degree. However, most criminal justice programs do not require applicants to have majored in criminal justice. Applicants to criminal justice graduate schools may have bachelor\'s degrees in areas such as psychology, information technology, social work, or forensic nursing. Non-criminal justice majors should, however, be proficient in statistics, research methods, public policy, forensic science, and sociology.\nStudents without sufficient experience in relevant subject areas can typically earn certificates of completion in specific classes to gain the academic experience necessary to attend criminal justice graduate schools. Some online graduate schools and most community colleges offer certificates of completion.\nApplicants must hold a bachelor\'s degree from a nationally or regionally accredited institution; graduate schools do not recognize degrees earned from schools without accreditation. However, because no professional organizations accredit criminal justice programs, undergraduates only need to ensure their school holds institutional accreditation.\nIs Work Experience a Prerequisite to a Criminal Justice Graduate Program?\nAlthough not all criminal justice graduate schools require applicants to have work experience, some do. In any case, professional experience strengthens a student\'s application. Many criminal justice master’s programs include fieldwork, during which students work in professional positions related to their career interests; work experience demonstrates an applicant\'s ability to succeed in a professional setting. Work experience in criminal justice roles, such as experience as a paralegal, a police officer, or a forensic nurse, is especially valuable for applicants with an undergraduate degree in a discipline other than criminal justice; professional experience in the field illustrates the applicant\'s passion and skill for the subject.\nDo I Have to Take the GRE to Apply to a Graduate Program in Criminal Justice?\nThe GRE is the most widely accepted standardized test for students applying to graduate school and comprises three sections: verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and analytical writing\nMost graduate programs, including criminal justice programs, require applicants to submit Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) scores. The GRE is the most widely accepted standardized test for students applying to graduate school and comprises three sections: verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and analytical writing. Test takers must interpret written material, solve problems using foundational mathematical concepts, and compose analytical essays. The GRE measures each test taker\'s readiness for master’s and doctoral programs.\nThe GRE costs $205 for U.S. applicants. A fee reduction program is available for eligible students who demonstrate financial need. While the GRE is a common admissions requirement, some applicants may qualify for a GRE waiver from their institution.\nWhile graduate programs commonly require applicants to submit GRE scores, most schools recognize that standardized test scores do not perfectly measure an applicant\'s ability to succeed in graduate school. An increasing number of schools do not require GRE scores and evaluate applications holistically. Applicants with exceptional GPAs and extensive work experience can sometimes apply to graduate programs without taking the GRE.\nExceptional students who do not perform well on standardized tests or who have extensive professional experience often benefit by applying to a program that offers GRE waivers or to one that does not require GRE scores. A GRE waiver allows students to apply to graduate programs without providing GRE scores. Students applying for waivers must typically document academic and work experience and must often provide a written essay demonstrating their proficiency in analytical and quantitative skills. Schools award waivers on a case-by-case basis, and qualifying for a waiver does not guarantee admission to the program.\nBreakdown of GRE Scores\nRaw GRE scores range from 130 to 170 for verbal and quantitative reasoning and zero to six for analytical writing. Exam results also include verbal and quantitative reasoning scores presented as percentiles, which indicate the percentage of test takers who earned lower scores. Verbal and quantitative reasoning scores are available immediately after completing the test, while analytical writing scores are available online 10 to 15 days after completing the exam.\nIdentifying GRE scores that qualify as ""good"" can be difficult, since program and school requirements vary. According to the Educational Testing Service, which administers the GRE, criminal justice majors earned average scores of 153 in verbal reasoning, 151 in quantitative reasoning, and 3.9 in analytical writing during the 2017–2018 test year. Though most criminal justice programs do not have minimum score requirements, applicants with higher scores are more likely to gain admission. Since criminal justice curricula require proficiency in reading, mathematics, and writing, competitive applicants typically earn quantitative and verbal scores between 155 and 160 and writing scores of at least 3.5.\n|Scaled Score||Verbal Reasoning Percentile Rank||Quantitative Reasoning Percentile Rank|\nGraduate Application Requirements\nTranscripts are one of the most important components of a graduate school application. Schools use transcripts to evaluate an applicant\'s ability to successfully complete graduate work. Most criminal justice graduate programs require applicants to have a minimum 3.0 GPA, although the top programs may require higher GPAs. Some schools emphasize the applicant\'s GPA for their final 60 undergraduate credits, as these credits are often in upper-division major courses.\nWhen students apply to graduate school, they must submit transcripts from all previous academic institutions, including study abroad programs and community colleges. Students can order transcripts through their institution’s registrar, and while some institutions send official transcripts for free, others charge for each copy. Applicants should order transcripts early, as transcripts can take days or weeks to reach the graduate school.\nOn test day, students can send four free score reports to schools of their choice. Test takers select destinations for reports after completing the exam but before seeing their scores. After test day, sending scores costs $27 per school. Students can send test scores through the Educational Testing Service website by entering the recipient school\'s GRE institution code, which is available on most admissions websites. GRE scores are valid for five years.\nMost criminal justice graduate schools admit applicants who demonstrate the ability to apply classroom knowledge in professional settings. Ideally, a strong resume for a criminal justice applicant would include experience in a law enforcement or legal profession. A weak resume may lack relevant professional experience, include gaps in work history, or include few supplementary activities, such as collegiate awards, volunteer experience, or publications.\nApplicants can strengthen a weak resume by crafting their resume strategically. Those with gaps in employment history can include selected employment experience, rather than listing positions chronologically. Additionally, list only experiences that are relevant to criminal justice, including unpaid internships and volunteer positions. Applicants without sufficient professional experience should consider contacting the criminal justice program directly; some schools allow applicants to compensate for a lack of professional experience by enrolling in a criminal justice internship.\nEssays and Personal Statements\nA personal statement or admissions essay should illustrate the applicant\'s goals for graduate study and describe why they are a good fit for the program. Though personal statements and admissions essays are similar, there are distinctions between them. Personal statements usually describe the applicant’s academic and professional background and explain their personal motivations for pursuing graduate study, while admissions essays generally respond to a specific prompt on a topic such as the applicant\'s experience working with diverse populations. Applicants to criminal justice programs must often describe their motivations for pursuing graduate work, specific topics of interest within the criminal justice field, and faculty members with whom they want to work.\nIn essays and personal statements, applicants should demonstrate critical-thinking skills, self-awareness, and a passion for the field. To write an engaging essay, avoid general, vague statements. Consider telling a story illustrating your passion for criminal justice. An applicant may describe an experience working in the criminal justice field, how this experience clarified their professional goals, and how they plan to achieve these goals through graduate studies.\nApplicants should complete the essay, even if it’s optional; a personal statement is a valuable opportunity for applicants to describe their strengths. California State University provides examples of successful criminal justice personal statements.\nLetters of Recommendation\nLetters of recommendation provide objective opinions on an applicant’s academic, professional, and personal achievements. Letters typically come from former professors or employers, but many schools have specific instructions regarding who can submit recommendations. Applicants should choose recommenders who can provide specific examples of their success as a student or employee in areas relevant to criminal justice, such as psychology professors or heads of law offices. Friends or relatives are never acceptable recommenders.\nA recommender should write about the applicant\'s accomplishments that are most relevant to criminal justice. For instance, a recommender who is a lawyer the applicant worked under as a paralegal should focus on how the applicant succeeded in that specific role and how the experience prepared the applicant for graduate studies. Since writing these letters takes time, students should approach prospective recommenders early in the application process; a last-minute request can result in a refusal or a poor recommendation.\nEnglish Proficiency Tests\nEnglish proficiency tests measure a test taker\'s ability to comprehend written and spoken English and to communicate with native English speakers. Most programs require international applicants from non-English-speaking countries to complete an English proficiency test.\nThe most widely accepted English proficiency tests are the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), and the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC). Each test includes listening, speaking, reading, and writing components. The TOEFL is designed to evaluate the test taker\'s ability to communicate in academic and classroom settings, while the TOEIC tests English proficiency in professional environments. The IELTS includes an academic test and an exam for general immigrants. The academic-focused IELTS requires test takers to participate in classroom scenarios, performing tasks such as listening to a lecture, engaging in discussion, and interpreting written passages.\nBackground Check and Drug Screening\nCriminal justice master’s programs often require applicants to successfully pass drug tests and/or background checks. Usually, students must do so to participate in field experience internships or clinical courses. This measure not only ensures the ability of each student to act responsibly—internships, for instance, often place students in law enforcement roles, while labs can deal with illicit substances—but also simulates the real-world background checks and drug tests that most criminal justice jobs require.\nHow Do You Apply to Graduate School in Criminal Justice?\nKnowing how to apply to graduate school can be difficult, as each school has unique requirements. However, the application processes for most schools have some similarities.\nTypically, application deadlines are between November 1 and January 31 the year before enrollment. However, many criminal justice master’s programs offer multiple deadlines for start dates in the fall, winter, spring, and summer. Since there is no common application for graduate school and each application requires individual attention, applicants should begin writing personal statements and requesting letters of recommendation and transcripts at least four months before the application deadline. Additionally, applicants should register for standardized tests four to six months before the application deadline to ensure scores arrive on time.\nMost applications are available online. Criminal justice programs typically charge application fees between $30 and $50, although many offer free applications or fee waivers for students who demonstrate financial need. Graduate schools usually allow college seniors to apply before completing their final semester of undergraduate coursework and occasionally accept letters of recommendation after the submission deadline.\nRolling admissions refers to an application evaluation style in which colleges consider applications as they receive them, rather than waiting until after a deadline. Generally, colleges with rolling admissions accept and evaluate applications until the program is full. For some schools, rolling admissions is a year-long process; others accept candidates on a rolling basis until a final deadline; still others have multiple rolling deadlines for various start times. The most consistent rule for rolling admissions is to apply as early as possible, when competition is less intense and more financial aid is available.\nThe flexibility of rolling admissions is convenient for applicants with full-time jobs or family obligations. Also, many programs with rolling admissions offer multiple start dates, allowing students to begin classes at the most convenient time for them. Rolling admissions is the most common evaluation method for criminal justice programs, although some schools use rounds admissions.\nColleges that use a rounds admissions process consider applications in stages. Programs evaluate and accept applications submitted before an initial deadline and then repeat the process for subsequent deadlines. The rounds admissions process usually involves three deadlines; however, some schools offer only two deadlines, and others offer five or more.\nPrograms that use a rounds admissions process fill the majority of spots and offer the bulk of available financial aid during the first two rounds. The odds of acceptance decrease with each round, so students who apply early are at an advantage. Applying during the first round can be difficult, as the deadline may be in early September; second rounds often have deadlines in January.\nApplying to a school that uses rounds admissions can be challenging, as applicants feel pressure to apply by set deadlines. However, the firm deadlines motivate some applicants. The rounds admissions process is most common for business schools; criminal justice programs are more likely to use rolling admissions.\nThe decision timelines for criminal justice graduate schools vary; some programs notify students within four to six weeks, while others require months. Prospective students who apply in December or January typically receive decisions by March.\nStudents should consider how their academic interests align with each program’s curriculum and faculty.\nStudents accepted by multiple schools should take their time choosing the best program for their needs. Students should consider how their academic interests align with each program’s curriculum and faculty. They should also evaluate available financial aid packages.\nOften, criminal justice programs require students to concentrate in a field such as behavioral science, substance abuse, or conflict and crisis management, and many criminal justice students must complete an internship or field experience. Students should contact the department for information about specific program requirements.\nRejection can be disappointing and frustrating, but it is also a valuable learning opportunity. Applicants who do not receive admission can show their personal statement to professors and mentors for constructive feedback. They may also consider and refine their academic and career goals and establish a firm timeline for their next round of applications.', 'Employment Requirements for Criminal Justice Professionals\nThe student will:\nA. Assess the impact of personal health practices and behaviors of criminal justice professionals. (Criminal Justice I Standard 10.1)\nB. Examine physical fitness requirements for criminal justice career occupations. (Criminal Justice I Standard 10.2)\nIntroduction -- Context\nThe objective of this unit is to provide students with information and an appreciation of positive physical and mental health practices that lead to successful careers in the criminal justice field. Criminal Justice professionals and specifically police officers have many times been portrayed in the media as out of shape individuals that feast on fast food and donuts. This unit will introduce students to the physical and mental challenges that officers train for prior to becoming a certified police officer. Prospective police officers are trained in a variety of military-like methods while in one of Tennessee\'s law enforcement training academies. Upon completion of a POST certified police academy successful police officers continue to maintain a level of physical fitness to deal with the physical and mental challenges of police work. Police officers are exposed to physical and mental challenges daily. Many officers become desensitized to anger, violence and death. Students will be further exposed to positive mental health practices that can lead to a successful criminal justice career. Students will be exposed to statistical data showing the alcoholism, drug addiction and suicide rates of police officers and how these maladies are related to clinical depression and post traumatic stress disorder. Students will be further exposed to Critical Incident Stress Debriefing and other Employee Assistance Programs currently in place to combat these workplace dilemmas. (UG-A, B)\nThe student will:\nA.

Certified police officers must complete a police academy recognized by Tennessee Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) Commission.\nB. POST approved police academies require that cadet officers pass physical fitness testing as a requirement for graduation.\nAs you will recall, we have explored the different areas of law enforcement. We have discussed the different policing agencies in the United States the differences between Federal, State and Local Jurisdictions. What does jurisdiction mean? Correct it is a geographic region or area where a police agency or court has authority. Today we are going to begin exploring training requirements for police officers in Tennessee. Over the next several days we will examine the physical fitness and other requirements for an officer to become commissioned in Tennessee. Most police officers in Tennessee are required to complete a basic police school at one of Tennessee\'s Law Enforcement Training Academies. Many larger agencies such as Metro Police Department, Knoxville Police Department and Tennessee Highway Patrol have chosen to operate their own police training academies. Most officers, as we have seen do not work for large agencies. What size agencies do most officers work for? Correct; approximately 90% of police officers work for agencies with fewer than fifty officers. The majority of agencies in Tennessee utilize Tennessee Law Enforcement Training Academy in Donelson to train new police officers. In Tennessee police officers must be complete a police academy within their first year of employment. This is a requirement of the Tennessee Peace Officers Standards and Training (POST) Commission. The POST commission is responsible for ensuring that all police officers in Tennessee meet minimum requirements to serve as a police officer. In Basic Police School cadet officers learn law and the legal system much like we are learning in this class. Officers are also trained in driving skills, defensive tactics, weapon proficiency, and participate in structured Physical Training or PT. In order to graduate from the police academy cadets are required to take and pass a PT test. Cadets unable to pass the PT test will not be allowed to graduate from the academy and will be unable to work as a police officer in Tennessee until they can pass the PT test. Today we will begin to explore some of the physical requirements for police officers to successfully complete the police academy and become certified police officers.\nA. By linking to previous discussions of policing agencies and career opportunities in the criminal justice field the students have developed a schema to make educated assumptions of how police officers must adhere to rules and standards. Students have also demonstrated knowledge of how media depictions of police and military training can influence assumptions of how police officers are trained. (Objective A, B)\nB. Using an approximately 15 minutes of video demonstrating physical requirements for law enforcement officers, students will be led into a short lecture and a PowerPoint presentation, the students will be exposed to the minimum physical requirements for officers to graduate from Tennessee Law Enforcement Training Academy.

Practice and/or Review:\nReview for this lesson will come in future demonstration regarding physical fitness in law enforcement. The students will be given essential questions and group discussion topics to apply the information given. Internet opportunities will be given to search the State of Tennessee website to further apply the knowledge.\n6. Monitor and Adjust:\nBy listening to student feedback and by observation, adjustments will be made to focus and redirect questions and unclear information.\nIn the likelihood that students do not understand physical requirements of Tennessee POST Commission, redirection and review will be provided with positive feedback. This standard and objectives will also be revisited and reviewed in future units such as defensive tactics, patrol techniques and officer safety.\n8. Materials/Media and their use:\nA.

4	joe satriani berkeley teaching role	He was a local guitar teacher at a guitar store in Berkeley, where he made his living. He taught students how to get around on the fret board and how to feel the guitar, without pushing specific aesthetic things.	['Grateful Web Interview with Charlie Hunter\nGrateful Web recently had an opportunity to speak to guitarist, composer and bandleader, Charlie Hunter.\nGW: This is Dylan Muhlberg of Grateful Web here with jazz guitarist Charlie Hunter. We’re gonna catch up with him about his influences, his projects and what he’s got going on right now. Thank you so much for joining us Charlie.\nCH: Thank you for having me.\nGW: What were your musical influences from childhood?\nCH: So many different things. My mom had all these old blues records around the house and listening to the radio I took in a lot of soul music. Some of the more obvious stuff too like the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix.\nGW: Growing up in Berkeley, California, during High School, you received instruction and guidance from legendary guitarist Joe Satriani. What did you take away from learning from him?\nCH: He was just a local guitar teacher for everybody there in Berkeley. And it wasn’t unusual for me to take lessons from him. Because everybody did. So I was lucky that respect. He was a great teacher of showing you how to get around on the fret board and how to feel the guitar. He didn’t push any specific aesthetic things on me, just really how to get around on the guitar.\nGW: So was he well into his professional career at the time and was just volunteering his time for the students?\nCH: He wasn’t volunteering his time. He was making a living at the guitar store.\nGW: Got you. So you’re from a generation of incredible progressive jazz musicians that have furthered the medium beyond anyone’s expectation. Les Claypool, Stanton Moore, Skerrik, Will Bernard just to name a few. One unified link is that none of you seem to adhere to a certain style or genre. Why do you prefer to bend the idea of genre when you compose or play?\nCH: I don’t even think of it. You have your influences and you try to be honest. You listen to lots of different music and do your best to be as honest as you can about it.\nGW: Who are some of vital musicians in the jazz community that have either influenced your style of playing or inspired you to continue to play?\nCH: There are too many people to name. Everyone you come in contact with teaches you all the time. You’re just trying to learn as much as you can and have your ears open.\nGW: Getting back to your style of playing, you pick on bass and guitar harmonics simultaneously; genuinely performing what it takes two sets of hands to play for most. How did you develop such dexterity and that specific part of your style?\nCH: You just practice and practice. Constantly. And that’s just how it is. The more you practice the easier it gets. Every day I go out into my shed and I try to figure out how to get better. And that never stops.\nGW: The axe you perform on is a custom guitar built just for you that most closely resembles a bass guitar. How was it built in particular for you?\nCH: We’ll I had been evolving the idea of this guitar over the years. And I just tried to hone in on what I wanted more and more. My first one Ralph Novack made for me about twenty-five years ago at this point. I’ve been evolving that ever since. Jeff Traugott out of Santa Cruz, California made the current one I play on.\nGW: So is it a bass guitar?\nCH: No, I call it a seven-string guitar. It’s got most of the range of a bass and most of the range of a guitar.\nGW: I’ve truly never seen anyone play like you. I’ve seen musicians like Steve Bailey and Victor Wooten who know how to play on multiple harmonics but that performance last weekend [at Dazzle Lounge, Denver] was something.\nCH: Thanks Dylan. It always again comes back to lots and lots of practice, playing with great people, and getting you butt kicked. There’s really no other way to do it. No short cuts.\nGW: Last year for Grateful Web I interviewed guitarist John McLaughlin. I asked him to describe the creative task of composition. He told me it was too daunting of a task to articulate. That he didn’t consciously preconceive what was coming, but that melodic suggestions built into something larger eventually. When you compose do you have a particular approach or is it too daunting to articulate?\nCH: If I’m thinking about writing. I just work off of a nice melody and play on it until it’s done. [Laughs] And that’s about that.\nGW: I have to say that I first learned of you not through the New Orleans and New York jazz circuits, Denver’s scene is still developing…\nCH: You got tons of great musicians in Colorado in both Denver and Boulder. It’s no lie. You have Ron Miles and Greg Garrison. I’m not taking that man. [Laughs]\nGW: Right on. So the band that I discovered you through that you were part of for a while was Garage A Trios. You played side by side with some really killer players and common collaborators. All the members had extremely outgoing musical personalities. Was it challenging to collaborate with such hyper active personalities all at once?\nCH: No because they just did everything that I told them to [Laughs]. We’re just friends’ man. It was just having fun. And what you need to understand about a situation like that nobody runs the show. Nobody has invested everything into a certain idea or premise. Everybody just had a really good time.\nGW: Listening to Garage A Trios it definitely sounds like you guys were having a good time.\nCH: Yeah, it was great when we did it.\nGW: You have a new album out with drummer and old friend Scott Amendola, “Not Getting Behind is the New Getting Ahead.” You’ve continued to collaborate with Scott over the years. Could you take about the project and playing with Scott?\nCH: Like you said he was on a bunch of my Blue Note records in the early days, and part of my quartet with Kenny Brooks and others. We worked together lot through the 90s and have always stayed in touch musically and otherwise. We’ve just been playing together for years so it seemed to come naturally.\nGW: What do you think about the separation of the higher musical integrity of the jazz community versus the jam band scene? Do you think things are best kept separate of that the two should coincide more often?\nCH: Basically there are two kinds of music. There’s good music and the other stuff. The goal is to make people feel good. However you do that is great. Just because the jam band music most of the time doesn’t work for me doesn’t mean for others it isn’t their jam.\nGW: I wanted to thank you for your time. Certainly a pleasure to watch you perform at Dazzle Lounge the other night and hope to see you in Colorado in not too long.\nCH: Great, can’t wait to come back.']	['<urn:uuid:e664f41a-a55e-4b78-bf59-8b93797971d3>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	5	39	1209
5	I've been hearing about some database called the Unified Agenda but I'm not sure what it's for. Can you explain what kind of information it actually contains?	The Unified Agenda provides standardized data about regulatory and deregulatory activities being developed by about 60 executive departments, agencies, and commissions. The 'active' entries generally show activities that will have a regulatory action within the next 12 months, such as proposed rules or final rules.	['For more than 35 years, federal regulatory agencies have been required to notify the public about their upcoming rules in the United States to ensure the transparency of the rulemaking process. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that Cabinet departments, independent agencies, and independent regulatory agencies publish “regulatory flexibility agendas” in the Federal Register each April and October describing regulatory actions they are developing that are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Further, Executive Order 12866 requires the same agencies to “prepare an agenda of all regulations under development or review, at a time and in a manner specified by the Administrator” of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\nAll agencies reportedly use the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (the so-called “Unified Agenda”) to satisfy both of these requirements. Since 1983, the Regulatory Information Service Center (RISC), located within the General Services Administration (GSA), has compiled the Unified Agenda for OIRA. Usually published twice each year, the agenda provides data in a standardized format on regulatory and deregulatory activities under development by about 60 executive departments, agencies, and commissions. The “active” entries in the agenda are, in general, activities that will have a regulatory action within the next 12 months. For example, a “proposed rule stage” agenda entry indicates that the agency expects to issue a proposed rule (or close a proposed rule comment period) within the next 12 months; a “final rule stage” entry indicates that the agency expects to publish a final rule or take other final action within the next 12 months. The agenda has been available online since 1995, and has been available exclusively online since 2007.\nHowever, concerns have been expressed about the predictive capacity of the agenda. A recent draft report prepared by Curtis W. Copeland for consideration of the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) provides further empirical evidence to raise concerns about the accuracy of the agenda.\nThis report indicates that a number of “significant” rules (primarily final rules issued by Cabinet departments and independent agencies, and proposed and final rules issued by certain independent regulatory agencies) were published in the first half of 2014 without the Unified Agenda indicating that they were about to be issued. Conversely, almost half of the “economically significant” proposed and final rules that were predicted by the Spring 2013 edition of the agenda (e.g., those expected to have a $100 million impact on the economy) were not published during the following 16 months. In fact, many entries have appeared at the same stage of the agenda for years without any rulemaking action. Further, the Unified Agenda sometimes did not provide accurate information about the nature of agencies’ significant rules (e.g., indicating that a forthcoming rule was not significant when the published rule indicated that it was significant). Most notably, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) does not use the agenda to identify forthcoming proposed or final rules, instead putting virtually all of the agency’s ongoing activity into a general “long-term action” category.\nThe total number of entries in the Unified Agenda declined in 2013 and 2014, perhaps because some entries have been kept in an undisclosed “pending” category that allows agencies to keep regulation identifier numbers and titles active while not publishing the entries in the agenda. Although some federal agencies reportedly update their agenda entries in the RISC database between the twice-yearly agenda publications, that information only becomes available to the public when the agenda is published twice a year. Two related databases that RISC maintains are updated daily, and some agencies maintain their own information systems and websites that provide more up-to-date rulemaking information than is available through the agenda.\nThe report recommends that OIRA determine whether the Unified Agenda should become a “real-time” database of agency rulemaking actions. If OIRA concludes that a real-time agenda is not justified or feasible for all rules, the report recommends that it take other steps to ensure that the public has access to more up-to-date information on agencies’ ongoing and completed actions by providing links on the Unified Agenda website to departmental and agency websites and information systems. If OIRA concludes that a real-time agenda is justified or feasible a number of recommendations are advanced by the report in order to reduce inconsistencies in the agenda information.\n(Fabrizio Di Mascio)\nPhoto credits: Philip Chapman-Bell']	['<urn:uuid:e544a61b-24cd-43a2-a052-d5f3e9cd6939>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	27	45	737
6	explain wave function schrodinger probability relationship	In quantum physics, a particle's behavior is described by a wave function that satisfies Schrodinger's equation, which is analogous to conservation of energy in classical mechanics. The wave function is interpreted using probability because we cannot specify exactly where a particle is located. When the system is undisturbed, it behaves like a wave, but when we make a measurement, the wave function collapses, giving us probabilistic outcomes rather than precise determinations.	"[""PhD., University of Maryland\nJonathan is a published author and recently completed a book on physics and applied mathematics.\nQuantum physics deals with matter with wave properties. The behavior of a particle is described with a wave function, using Schrodinger's equation. The wave function is interpreted using probability because we cannot say exactly where a particle is. We judge where something is using generalized probability but cannot perform a measurement without the collapse of the wave function.\nActually let's talk about quantum physics. What is quantum physics? Quantum physics is what happens to physics when we give wave properties to matter. So matter no longer is allowed to sit in just one place like objects sitting there. We've got to have it spread out like a wave, and that's why we call it, given wave properties to matter.\nAlright. So it's described by something called a wave function, alright, and so that's going to take the place of a position, a momentum and all those things. Instead of that we describe the behavior of a particle by its wave function. The wave function satisfies something called Schrodinger's equation which kind of takes the place of conservation of energy. You can think of it that way in quantum mechanics. Alright.\nSo, if we leave the particle alone, it behaves like a wave. So we're just sitting there letting the system do whatever it wants to do and it's described by its wave function. However, if we perform a measurement, suddenly we get something called the collapse of the wave function. So for example, if we've got a wave function that looks like that, and then we perform a measurement and we say, is the particle between these two green lines?\nWell, I mean, we're performing a measurement. It either is or it isn't. So it doesn't get to say, oh, part of me is there and part, no. It doesn't get to say that. We're performing a measurement. We're asking is it or is it not? It cannot be both. And that is going to give us a probabilistic interpretation from quantum mechanics. So the wave function will give us probabilities. It will say alright. If you did that measurement 100 times, 6 times you're going to find that it was between the green bars and the other 94 times you're going to find that it wasn't.\nNow, it's really a strange duality going on there because, if I were to leave it alone, it's kind of like part of it's inbetween and part of it isn't. But if I do the measurement, then it either is or it isn't. Whole thing is or whole thing is not. And so that's the weird part about quantum mechanics that makes people kind of fuzzy on it. Is that sometimes if you leave the system alone, it behaves like a wave and you can kind of think about it as partly being inbetween the green lines and partly being not. but if you do that measurement and you try to determine is it or is it not, then the answer is given probabilistically. You can't say before you do the experiment for sure how it will come out.\nAlright. Now this is associated with something called quantization. Interestingly enough, quantization is something that only happens with waves. And it happens as a consequence of something called boundary conditions. So just like we have a standing wave in between two points, we can have the first harmonic, we can have the second harmonic, we can have the third harmonic but we can't have anybody inbetween. So we can't have something that goes like this. Because it doesn't work, it doesn't satisfy the boundary condition. So I've got a whole hump, two humps, three humps. I can't have one and a half humps. It doesn't work that way. So this is what leads to quantization. When I impose these boundary conditions on the wave function. And when I do that, I get energy quantization so that I can only have discreet energies. I also get angular momentum quantization in certain situations I'll get momentum quantization and that's what leads to these strange properties of quantum mechanics.\nAnd that's Quantum Physics.""]"	['<urn:uuid:fccd5305-00de-4cbc-b575-f36048443861>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	6	71	705
7	Can milk products fix my discolored teeth?	MI Paste Treatment, which contains calcium and phosphate minerals from milk-derived proteins, can help fade intrinsic stains and create a uniform appearance. The treatment involves multiple office visits over 2-3 weeks and using MI Paste at home twice daily. It's safe for lactose intolerant people but should be avoided if you're allergic to milk products.	['White Spot Treatment\nDiscoloration on the teeth can be caused by a number of reasons. Extrinsic stains are on the exterior of the tooth and can generally be removed during your regular professional cleanings. Intrinsic stains and discolorations are within the tooth’s structure and can not be “cleaned” but rather require treatment to neutralize. Chalky white spots are known as decalcification. These spots form with poor oral hygiene or poor diet choices such as drinking sugary, acidic liquids (i.e., Mountain Dew, Gatorade, or juices). Chalky white spots are commonly seen post-orthodontic treatment (braces), where the tooth was not kept clean properly along the brackets. Another intrinsic stain or discoloration are bright white, yellow or brown spots. These spots are formed during tooth development (hypoplasia). Fortunately, to create a more uniform appearance and improve aesthetics, we have two options: MI Paste treatment and ICON resin infiltration.\nWhat is MI Paste Treatment?\nMI Paste Treatment: By re-working the enamel structure of a tooth from the inside out, the intrinsic stain fades, creating a uniform appearance. This uniform appearance is achieved through a series of the steps including, etching or opening up the enamel tubules, applying the MI Paste, curing and repeating.\nMI Paste is made up of calcium and phosphate minerals, using milk-derived proteins. It is safe to use even if lactose intolerant but should be avoided if you are allergic to milk or dairy products. For in office treatment, you will be seen four times every 2-3 weeks. You will be given a tube of MI Paste to use at home 2 times daily for best results. You must avoid dark staining foods and beverages for 48 hours after treatment. At the end of treatment, you will receive a pack of Crest White Strips to help brighten your smile! Call us at Winston Salem Office Phone Number 336-659-9500 to get started, or use our online appointment request form.\nAbout ICON Resin Infiltration\nICON Resin Infiltration: Resin infiltration is a minimally invasive procedure conducted to reduce the appearance of white spots through the use of composite material. This works by creating porosities in the enamel with a conditioner that allows a flowable resin composite material to penetrate the white spot and “fill in” the areas weakened by mineral loss.\nThis procedure is less invasive than the alternative filling or veneer. The infiltration of the composite helps to blend the appearance of the white spot so that it reflects light similarly to the neighboring teeth. The procedure does not require any “drilling” on the teeth being treated, local anesthetic will be used to create a comfortable atmosphere for your child.\nResults are immediate and will only improve with time as teeth regain their moisture after the procedure. Unlike the alternative filling or veneer options where treatment must be postponed until growth is complete; this is the best option for a teenage concerned with their white spots and desiring immediate results. The color stability of ICON can last up to 3 years, but similar to bleaching may require maintenance over time. Ready t get started? Call us in Winston Salem at Winston Salem Office Phone Number 336-659-9500 or use our online appointment request form.\nBefore and After Photos\nIt is important to note that results may vary depending on the degree of the intrinsic stain and the patients compliance with their home care routine.\nClinical Examples for MI Paste Treatment:\nClinical Examples for ICON Resin Infiltration:\nCall us with any questions or to make an appointment.336-659-9500']	['<urn:uuid:46e4420f-16eb-4962-9c77-94b1592af5c5>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	7	55	582
8	As someone interested in milk-based drinks from different cultures, I'm curious how kumiss from Kazakhstan compares to Kenyan chai in terms of the type of milk used and preparation method?	Kumiss and Kenyan chai use very different types of milk and preparation methods. Kumiss is made from fermented mare's milk and has a fizzy, sour flavor. In contrast, Kenyan chai is made by boiling regular (cow's) milk with black tea leaves and optional masala spices, then stirring until frothy and straining into cups.	"[""Vast, barren and enigmatic: deserts are among some of our planet's most spectacular landscapes.Read more...\nKazakhstan - Eating and sleeping\nKazakh cuisine is heavily based on the nomadic past of the Kazakh people. It is dominated by meat (especially mutton and horse) and various milk products, many of which have no direct English translation. The techniques of preparation emerged out of the importance of ensuring food preservation: thus, there are many dishes based around smoked meat and soured milk. Meat is an important part of the Kazakh diet, and there are numerous jokes about the legendary capacity of Kazakhs for consuming huge quantities of the stuff (the punch lines tend to be of a ‘right, where’s the main course?’ nature). An invitation to a Kazakh feast provides a great opportunity to try many of the classic dishes of Kazakh cuisine together with the rituals that accompany their apportionment, though most dishes are also available in Kazakh or generic central Asian restaurants.\nA Kazakh feast tends to be referred to as a dastarkhan, actually the name of the low table around which Kazakhs traditionally sat, on the floor or propped up against cushions, to eat their meals. In rural areas, this form of dining is still common; in larger towns, chairs and tables have taken over, at least among wealthier Kazakh families. On arrival, you will find the table already laden with things to eat, typically fruits, nuts and a range of salad dishes. Tea is served into handle-less cups called pialas, and will be constantly refilled throughout the meal, even as vodka toasts are called for, and other drinks, such as kumiss, a drink of fermented mare’s milk, are also passed round. Appetisers are brought out, focused heavily on sliced meats. Pride of place here goes to various sliced sausages made from horsemeat of varying degrees of fattiness: among the most important varieties are kazy, karta and shuzhuk. Th ere may also be a range of pastries on offer, such as a meat-filled variety, samsa, found throughout the region. Kurt, little balls of dried curd, is a salty snack which has the effect of draining all moisture from your mouth. At some point during the meal a dish of kuirdak will be served. This is made from the internal organs of a sheep or other freshly slaughtered animal: these are cut into small pieces, together with lumps of fat from the animal, cooked in oil, and served with onion and pepper.\nBeshbarmak is a traditional nomad dish of finely chopped boiled meat © Nykonchuk Oleksii, Shutterstock\nThe focus of the meal, and the signature dish of Kazakh cuisine, is beshbarmak. The name means, literally, ‘five fingers’, a reference to the traditional way of eating the stuff and not, fortunately, to its ingredients. It is generally served in a large dish, placed in the centre of the table. It involves large lumps of horsemeat or mutton, boiled on the bone, which are scattered across a bed of flat layers of pasta that have been boiled up in broth. Onion cut into rings, garlic and a scattering of parsley and fennel, completes the dish. The broth, sorpa, is served up separately, in pialas.\nBefore the beshbarmak is doled out, one tradition that is often incorporated into such a feast, particularly if there is a distinguished guest to be honoured, is the presentation to that guest of a boiled sheep’s head, or koy bas. Since a foreign visitor may well count as the ‘distinguished guest’, be aware that this could be coming your way. The ritual here is that the guest is given a knife, and cuts off pieces from the head, apportioning them to the others around the table. This is traditionally done by identifying pieces appropriate to individual recipients: thus young people often receive a piece of ear, so they may listen well to their elders. You needn’t worry too much about getting this symbolism right; if you can cut small pieces of meat from the head and apportion them, starting with the eldest person around the table and continuing in approximate age order, you will be considered to have discharged your distinguished guest function well. The lumps of meat on the beshbarmak itself are also distributed on the basis of various traditional customs. Thus, elderly or honoured guests tend to be given meat from around the hip, while it is never done to offer brains to children, for fear that they may become weak-willed, or a knee bone to an unmarried woman, lest she be left on the shelf (given the elbow?). Ak nan, a type of bread flavoured with onion, is often eaten with beshbarmak.\nSweet dishes served after the beshbarmak (though they may have been sitting on the table throughout the meal) include irimshik, which is not actually itself particularly sweet: it’s a dry yellowish/orange dish, made of soured cow’s or sheep’s milk that has been boiled and dried. It is, however, an ingredient of the classic Kazakh sweet, zhent, which also contains millet, sugar, raisins and butter and has a rather powdery consistency. Baursaki, small, spherical, fried doughnuts, have an important place in Kazakhstani culture, and feature in many forms of commemorative and celebratory meals. Fruit will also be served at this time. Do expect the unexpected in a Kazakh feast: the kuirdak is, for example, occasionally served right at the end of the meal, after the sweets.\nThe multi-ethnic character of Kazakhstan and the centuries of trading and interactions along the Silk Routes mean that the cuisine of modern Kazakhstan incorporates a large number of influences alongside those drawn from the nomadic Kazakhs. You will find here some of the dishes popular throughout the region, such as plov, a rice-based dish served with lumps of meat, and pieces of carrot and onion. In Kazakhstan, it is sometimes made in a sweet form, with the addition of dried raisins and apricots. Manty are also popular. These are dumplings, filled with spiced lamb or beef, sometimes with chopped carrot added, and cooked on a steamer. A range of noodle dishes, in particular lagman, are brought from Uyghur cuisine, while shashlik, skewered lumps of various barbecued meats, cooked over hot coals and served with raw onion, is a south Caucasus speciality popular across the region. Korean-style spicy vegetable salads are also found on many menus. Kazakhstan’s large ethnic Russian community has ensured the presence of numerous classic Russian dishes, including salads such as the chopped vegetable in mayonnaise confection described on menus here as olivye but known in western Europe as Russian salad, the ravioli-like pelmeni, sweet and savoury pancakes, or blini, and soups, such as okroshka, a Russian cold soup based on kvass, a fermented beverage made of rye bread, or the traditional Ukrainian and Russian-favourite borscht. In the regions bordering China, traditional Chinese dishes such as noodles and stir fries are also common.\nFuelled by the increasing wealth and aspirations of many Kazakhstanis, a whole range of newer arrivals from around the globe has supplemented these longer-established dishes. Thus, as the Where to eat and drink sections under individual towns make clear, it is possible in the larger cities to find Italian, Mexican, French or Japanese restaurants. Note that in Kazakhstani restaurants side dishes such as vegetables do not usually come automatically with your main dish, and have to be ordered separately. A 10% service charge is typically added. In some top-range restaurants and bars this may be set at 15%. Tipping beyond this is not expected. Many restaurants in Kazakhstan offer a business lunch: this will usually be a set meal or a buffet. These tend to be good value, and are usually served promptly, though they are often fairly unexciting. Restaurants are usually open every day, typically from noon until the last diner has finished up in the evening, though some close for an hour or two mid afternoon. Stolovayas, or canteens, often stay open 24 hours and offer a buffet with a good choice of local dishes for a budget traveller.\nThe drink most closely associated with the traditional Kazakh diet is kumiss, prepared from fermented mare’s milk, and believed by Kazakhs to have numerous health-giving properties, from the stabilisation of the nervous system to the treatment of tuberculosis. In parts of the south and west of the country, including Kyzylorda and Mangistau regions, it is supplanted by shubat, prepared from fermented camel’s milk, whose advocates ascribe it an equally impressive range of curative properties, recommending it for the treatment of tuberculosis, diabetes and stomach ulcers. Both kumiss and shubat have a slight fizzy quality and a sour flavour, and are definitely acquired tastes. A foreign delegation greeted on arrival into Kazakhstan by their Kazakh hosts may well be confronted with a girl in traditional dress holding out bowls of kumiss and shubat, accompanied by baursaki. Less frequently encountered, but rather more palatable for most western visitors, is kazhe, which is essentially shubat mixed with grains, which soften the flavour and texture of the drink.\nAnother important drink for Kazakhs is tea. Green tea is popular, especially in the south of the country, but ‘black’ tea, in other words the standard tea of the English-speaking world, is more prevalent. Ethnic Russians drink this black, sometimes with lemon, but, unusually for the region, Kazakhs traditionally drink their tea with milk. Do not be surprised if your host fills your tea cup only half full: it is an invitation for you to continue speaking. Once your cup is filled, you know it is time to leave. Coffee tends to be hit-and-miss, though there is an increasing range of coffee places offering the cappuccinos and lattes you get back home.\nAlthough some Kazakhstanis refrain from alcohol on religious grounds, the legacy of Tsarist and then Soviet rule has brought with it a tradition of vodka drinking. There are numerous local brands, from expensive varieties such as Snow Queen, which boasts that it has been distilled five times, to cheap and rather unpleasant products. You should avoid the cheapest offerings, particularly from outlets such as kiosks. Kazakhstan also produces a broad range of drinkable if rather sweet brandy, known locally as konyak. There are plenty of Kazakhstani beers: brands to look out for include Beliy Medved, Shymkent and Karaganda. However, in swankier bars and restaurants in Nur-Sultan and Almaty, local beers and spirits do not always feature on the menu, as they have been elbowed out by imported products. Viticulture has also been gaining momentum. Arba Wine have been producing quality wines since 2010 that have regularly won prizes at international fairs. Menus in swankier restaurants in Almaty and Nur-Sultan feature Arba Wine.\nRapid economic growth in Kazakhstan in the early 2000s and increasing interest from foreign investors have transformed the situation with accommodation across the country. In Almaty, Nur-Sultan and the oil-boom towns of the west, smart four- and five-star hotels run by international chains cater to the upper end of the business travel market. Elsewhere, once-shoddy Soviet hotels have been modestly refurbished, and new mid-range ones built, though often in rather bland buildings (frequently faced with silver-coloured metallic-look tiles, for some reason). Middle-class and wealthier Kazakhstanis have also shown interest in smarter accommodation in resort areas, from lakeside hotels around Borovoye to chaletstyle mountain retreats in the Zailysky Alatau. Less fashionable, but equally popular family resort areas, such as Lake Alakol, offer family-run and very reasonably priced bed and breakfasts, while greater numbers of young people and backpackers visiting Kazakhstan, mean that both Almaty and Nur-Sultan now have a good selection of hostels for budget travellers to choose from.\nWhat more authentic Kazakh experience could you have than staying in a yurt? © Maria Oleynik\nAnother budget option are the very basic dorms or private rooms with shared bathrooms, the so-called ‘retiring rooms’ at most of the major railway stations, though it would simply get too depressing to use these for more than the occasional night. Overnight train journeys themselves offer a good deal for the budget traveller, as you get a night’s ‘accommodation’ thrown in with your transport. And at the time of writing there was still to be found in most regional capitals at least one survivor from the hotel styles of the Soviet Union, with a dizhurnaya (a lady in charge of distributing keys and assisting guests) on every floor, clunking lifts and stucco-covered lobbies. The great merit of these places is that they invariably offer a wide range of prices, with at least some budget-end rooms with worn-out parquet floors and tiny wooden beds. Some have now been surprisingly well renovated and maintained without too much of an upward effect on the prices.\nCamping in the wild, including those national parks that do not have strict restrictions in place, is usually allowed, though as ever choose your site with care, taking local advice. There are also some well-organised camping sites, in particular in the Altai area. Otherwise, homestays are a good option, and locals often rent rooms out in rural areas. The range of NGOs providing such homestays has unfortunately declined, but asking around usually works. It is of course important to inspect the room on offer before agreeing to stay. Alternatively, Eco Centre in Almaty can help in finding a suitable homestay accommodation option."", 'All over the world, tea is a celebrated drink that forms part of daily life and social rituals. And although people across the world drink their tea differently, the simple pleasure of drinking tea unites us all. Whether it is white, green, black or herbal, tea is believed to relax the mind, offer consolation, improve mental clarity and cure all kinds of afflictions. The tea drinking ritual itself strengthens friendships, connects family members and shows hospitality to strangers. Let’s take a closer look at some of the tea rituals and customs on the African continent, where type of tea and style of serving varies from region to region.\nWelcoming guests in Morocco is not done properly without a glass of hot Maghrebi mint tea, also known as Touareg. Traditionally, the tea is prepared by the eldest male in the household from green tea leaves, lots of dried or fresh mint and heaps of sugar. It is poured into tall glasses from a standing position in an elegant gesture, to allow the tea to air and release its aroma throughout the room. Each guest is served three cups and each time the flavor varies, as they say: “The first glass is as gentle as life, the second is as strong as love, the third is as bitter as death.” Refusing any one of these servings is considered bad manners.\nRooibos tea (or red bush tea) is a popular herbal tea native to South Africa. The plant is found in the Western Cape region. Dutch settlers are said to have turned to the drink as an alternative to expensive imported black tea from Europe. Rooibos makes a bright red tea, typically served on its own without sugar or milk. The tea has a naturally mild and sweet flavor and can be consumed all day but especially before bed time as it has no caffeine. Many health benefits are attributed to rooibos, and the tea is consumed to combat headaches, insomnia and allergies.\nEgyptians love their tea, or shaias they call it. Traditionally, they drink tea with guests and after lunch and in the afternoon, the tea is accompanied with sweets, such as baklava, basbousa, or konafa. Koshary tea is black tea steeped in boiled water and flavored with sugar, milk and mint leaves. Saiidi tea is a long boiled and bitter black tea sweetened with copious amounts of sugar. Herbal teas and tisanes are also popular and are often consumed for health benefits. The bright red sweet-sour Karkadeh is made of dried hibiscus flowers and can be drunk hot or cold. It is considered good for the heart and often served at Egyptian weddings.\nTea culture in Senegal is defined by a ritual called attaya which is an important part of daily social life. Because the preparation of the tea takes up a long time – between one and three hours – there is plenty of time for conversation and the ceremony connects friends, family and guests.\nThe attaya ceremony consists of three stages. Green tea is boiled strong and bitter in a kettle over a charcoal stove. It is then poured from standing height into tall glasses called kas. The tea is then poured slowly from one glass to another until a thick foam is formed on top. This is a strong and bitter tea. In the next stages fresh mint is added and more and more sugar as you go so you end up with a thick and very sweet cup. The custom is to slurp when drinking, to avoid burning the tongue.\nIn Kenya, tea is served practically throughout the day, for breakfast, at mealtimes and also during Kenya’s teatime. It is also served showing hospitality to guests. Kenyan teatime embraces different cultural influences, from the British tradition of afternoon tea at 4pm, with finger food to the Indian way of preparing tea with masala spices. Most Kenyans drink black tea milk and sugar, which they call chai though there are some who prefer it just black. To make chai, bring the milk to a boil on the stove, add the black tea leaves and, if you like, the masala spices. Stir the mixture until frothy and pour through a strainer into a cup. Then add sugar. Kenyans like to drink their tea very hot!\nThis article appeared in Inzozi Magazine, Summer 2018 issue under the title “African Tea Rituals”']"	['<urn:uuid:ea8b99bc-bf2e-4c04-9ad1-ded19767b28f>', '<urn:uuid:e265aa55-f723-413f-a123-2b658008e1f8>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	30	53	2944
9	How did Nordic people use runes for fortune telling?	Rune casting for divination was done in two ways: rune casters would either lay runes facedown and select three to answer questions, or dump runes from leather pouches and read those that landed face up.	['The runes have both factual and mythological roots. From German tribes to Vikings and Odin to New Agers, runes have played a powerful part in history.\nRunes are an ancient alphabet, first seen among German tribes in Central and Eastern Europe. Although the runes adapted as they were received by different cultures (one set has 38), a standard set of 24 runes was established by 400 A.D. The word rune is derived from the Gothic word runa, which means mystery, and that is exactly what the runes represent. From their use in divination to a non-verbal form of communication, runes have resurged in New Age culture.\nAbout the Runes\nThe runic alphabet is known as “futhark,” which is representative of the first six characters, much like the English alphabet is named after the Latin names for the first two letters: alpha and beta. Runes have no lowercase letters and may be written from left to right or right to left. All runes are drawn using straight lines, which made them easy to carve into wood, stone and metal. Originally scratched into rocks, runes have also been found on items from great stone monuments to everyday, household items. The runes were carved to communicate both poetry and belonging.\nHistory of the Runes\nThe German tribes brought the runes to Scandinavia, and were popular in among the Swedes and the Danish Vikings. Often described as illiterate and barbaric, the Vikings were able to communicate using runes. They also used runes for fortune telling, protection and casting spells. The runes were believed to be sacred, magical symbols.\nWith the dawn of Christianity, the Latin alphabet became more popular. However, especially in Scandinavian countries, Latin and runes often appeared side by side on graves and monuments. During the 17th Century, the medieval Church banned the usage of runes for both magical and everyday practices. This was the Church’s way of purging superstition, paganism and magic from Europe. However, the runes lived on and have been used by many groups from Nazis to New Age followers.\nThe belief in the magical powers behind the runes dates back to Norse mythology. The chief of the Norse gods, and the one responsible for the knowledge of the runes, was Odin, god of wisdom, poetry and magic. He was also the god of battle. The name Odin means fury or frenzy, which governs the inspiration for both warriors and poets.\nThere are two popular myths that explain how Odin obtained knowledge of the runes. The first claims that Odin speared himself to the World Tree Yggdrasill for nine days and nights in self-sacrifice. Suspended from the tree, Odin learned of the runes and shared the knowledge with his people.\nThe second myth alleges that Odin traded one of his eyes for a sip from the Well of Mimir. Water from Yggdrasill seeped into the well and was known to contain great wisdom. With his drink, Odin was given the knowledge of the runes.\nRune masters were specially trained to use runes in divination and sorcery. One poem, carved in runes, read: “Let no man carve runes to cast a spell, save first he learn to read them well.” People truly believed in the immense magical powers the runes were rumored to have. One rune master carved protection runes on his drinking horn. When a rival attempted to poison his drink, the horn broke in half.\nAnother rune master was required to fix the mistake of the original, novice rune master, who had carved the incorrect runes on an ornament hung above a woman’s bed. Instead of receiving good health, she quickly became sick. The second rune master corrected the runes and the woman was instantly healed.\nRun casting, or reading the runes for divination purposes, is typically done in one of two ways. Rune casters, who were typically women, would lay the runes facedown before them and pluck three to answer the question asked. Rune casters would also keep their runes in leather pouches from which they would dump the runes on the reading surface. The runes that landed face up were used during the reading.\nAmerican Museum of Natural History: The History of the Runes\nNOVA/PBS: Runes through Time\nMyths Encyclopedia: Odin']	['<urn:uuid:0142e890-fe73-4de4-9c07-244e3cdc680b>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	9	35	705
10	who did eusebius collaborate with while writing defense of origen	Eusebius wrote five volumes of A Defense of Origen together with Pamphilius while the latter was imprisoned in 308.	['The Problem of Eusebius\nMANY PEOPLE KNOW EUSEBIUS OF CAESAREA as the “Father of Church History.” But as Robert M. Grant, a modern historian of the early church period, provocatively asked, “Did the Father of Church History write history?”\nJewish historian Doron Mendels describes Eusebius’s Church History as a “media revolution” and suggests that, because of his style of weaving short entries into a broader scheme, the author was “one of the fathers of the journalistic genre.” Another writer concludes that Eusebius was “less a historian than a mediator of knowledge.”\nOr perhaps a mediator of propaganda. This is the man who called Emperor Constantine “most beloved by God,” described the fourth-century church as being brought to “a state of uniform harmony,” and called Jews “a people who had slain the prophets and the Lord himself.”\nHowever one evaluates Eusebius’s achievement, his work remains foundational for our knowledge of the church in its first three centuries. And this foundation stands firm despite noticeable cracks.\nEusebius was not only a recorder of history, but one of the key players at a significant turning point for the church. His era was marked by the “Great Persecution” under Diocletian and his co-rulers (303-311), the conversion of Emperor Constantine (312), and the council of Nicea (325).\nAbout many events of his time, Eusebius could write as an eyewitness:\n“We saw with our own eyes the houses of prayer thrown down to the very foundations, and the divine and sacred Scriptures committed to the flames in the market-places, and the shepherds of the churches basely hidden here and there, and some of them captured ignominiously, and mocked by their enemies” (Church History 8.2.1).\nYet the one who told us so much about the church’s history and his own times did not tell us much about himself. Neither did anyone else.\nHe was born around 260 and presumably grew up in Caesarea of Palestine, where he came under the influence of Pamphilius, a learned teacher from Alexandria. Pamphilius, a devoted student of Origen, gathered an impressive library of Origen’s writings, as well as copies of the Scriptures and commentaries on them. This library and the library of Bishop Alexander of Jerusalem provided the basis of Eusebius’s learning.\nPamphilius was imprisoned in 308. Eusebius visited him often, and the two wrote five volumes of A Defense of Origen together. When Pamphilius died as a martyr, Eusebius, in gratitude, added to his name Pamphilii, becoming “Eusebius [son or disciple] of Pamphilius.”\nEusebius’s moderate stance on Arianism (a Christology denounced as heresy at Nicea) earned him temporary excommunication by a synod at Antioch in 324 or 325, but his zealous support of Constantine put the biggest blot on his legacy. Expounded in the celebratory Life of Constantine, this awed admiration also appears at the end of the Church History—where, to be fair, it makes some sense.\nEusebius had lived through terrible persecution. Constantine’s conversion to Christianity promised to end such horrors and begin an era unprecedented church strength. Eusebius’s support for the redeemed regime was a logical, albeit naive, reaction.\nEusebius enjoyed the emperor’s confidence and became the family’s chronicler. He also became bishop of Caesarea, apparently in 313, the year Constantine and Licinius issued the so-called “Edict of Milan” that granted toleration to Christians. Later, Eusebius was offered the more prominent episcopacy of Antioch, but he chose to stay in Caesarea. He died there sometime around 340.\nFighting for the Faith\nWith his great passion for learning, Eusebius became an accomplished exegete, theologian, apologist, orator, statesman, and, of course, historian. But while he is best known for his historical work, one could argue that he was above all an apologist. His biblical works respond to problems in the text of Scripture, and his historical works argue for the truth of Christianity.\nOne of Eusebius’s major apologetic works, Preparation of the Gospel, uses quotations from Greek authors to refute the mythology, oracles, and philosophy of paganism. Another apologetic work, Proof of the Gospel, shows that Christianity continues the religion of the Old Testament patriarchs and fulfills Judaic prophecy.\nApologetics motivated Eusebius’s early historical work, the Chronicle, as well. In it Eusebius lines up the principal events of universal and sacred history in order to prove that the Jewish people were older than other peoples. The works in praise of Constantine—the Life of Constantine, Praise of Constantine, and Constantine’s Address to the Assembly of the Saints—may be considered historical works but also have an apologetic thrust.\nHis Church History shares a missionary purpose with Eusebius’s more explicitly apologetic writings, but it abounds with historical details. The opening words state Eusebius’s six interests:\n“It is my purpose to write an account of the successions of the holy apostles;. ...\n“to relate the many important events that are said to have occurred in the history of the church;\n“to mention those who have governed and presided over the church in the most prominent parishes and those who in each generation have proclaimed the divine word either orally or in writing;. ...\n“to give the names. ... of those who through love of innovation have run into the greatest errors;. ...\n“to recount the misfortunes that immediately came upon the whole Jewish nation in consequence of their plots against our Savior;\n“and to record the ways and the times in which the divine word has been attacked by the nations and to describe the character of those who at various periods have contended for it in the face of blood and tortures, as well as the confessions that have been made in our own days, and finally the gracious and kindly succor that our Savior has afforded them all.”\nEusebius later adds a seventh interest: the canon of the Scriptures. Yet he discusses none of these themes in the first of his 10 books.\nEusebius begins his Church History by describing the divine nature of the pre-existent Christ and the “scattering of the seeds of true religion” among human beings from the beginning of time. Many people throughout history rejected this divine teaching, but it was always available. This point was crucial to Eusebius because it answered a significant question from pagans: If Christianity is the only true religion, why was it so late in coming to the world?\nFurthermore, the affirmation that Christianity began at Creation was central to Eusebius’s theology of history. To bolster his claim that God’s plan reached its climax in Christ, he had to trace that plan back through all time. On this basis, he could show how God continued to work through the church as well.\nEusebius wrote the History for ordinary Christians and interested non-Christians. This broad audience was not interested in doctrinal questions, so Eusebius gives such questions little attention. Instead, he concentrates on what would have popular—and enduring—appeal: sensational tales of martyrdom, juicy tidbits about famous leaders, lively quotations, and personal reflections.\nWeaknesses and strengths\nEusebius had many defects, both as a writer and as a historian. He assumed, inaccurately, that the early church looked just like the church he knew. He displayed no sense of doctrinal or institutional development, especially in the Latin West, a region about which he knew little.\nEusebius can also be accused of whitewashing what he did know. As he introduced accounts of persecution in his day, he stated that he was including only what would be profitable:\n“We shall not mention those who were shaken by the persecution nor those who in everything pertaining to salvation were shipwrecked. ... But we shall introduce into this history in general only those events which may be useful first to ourselves and afterwards to posterity” (Church History 8.2.3).\nOther complaints about Eusebius include his inattention to coherent narrative, his occasionally careless use of sources, and of course his belief that Christianity and the Roman state belonged together. But this negative picture can be exaggerated, and modern readers can be grateful for what Eusebius left us.\nWhatever may be said about Eusebius’s inability to organize his materials, he nonetheless had keen insight into themes that would have abiding interest for future generations. Who can forget the scenes recorded by Eusebius?\nThe apostle John fleeing the bathhouse upon finding Cerinthus, “the enemy of the truth,” there.\nJustin Martyr in a philosopher’s cloak preaching the Word of God.\nPolycarp confessing his faith before the governor: “Eighty-six years I have served Christ, and he has done me no wrong; how can I blaspheme my king who saved me?”\nBlandina, the slave girl, hanging on a stake as if on a cross, but inspiring her fellow martyrs, “who saw the One who was crucified in the form of their sister.”\nOrigen’s father admiring his sleeping boy as one in whom the divine Spirit was enshrined.\nEusebius did not perfect the discipline of church history, but he took the crucial first step of considering world events from a Christian perspective. It is a tribute to his accomplishment that such scholars as Rufinus, Socrates Scholasticus, Sozomen, and Theodoret continued his pursuit—though none attempted to rewrite what he had written. For centuries, historians only took up where he left off.\nBy Everett Ferguson\n[Christian History originally published this article in Christian History Issue #72 in 2001]Everett Ferguson is a distinguished scholar in residence at Abilene Christian University.

11	What are some essential items I would need if I wanted to start making drawings of a microphone at home?	You would need several basic materials: paper (either Bristol paper, regular printer paper, or a sketchpad - smooth paper is preferable but not required), pencils (specifically HB and B types) for drawing the outline, colored pens and markers if you want to add color (these are optional), a ruler (optional but helpful for drawing the diaphragm), and an eraser and sharpener.	['Drawing a microphone might seem like an easy task for many people, but it can be difficult to get the details right. It takes patience and skill in order to produce a realistic-looking microphone with all of its intricate parts.\nIn this article, we will answer the common questions that beginners often have when they are learning how to draw one, as well as provide detailed instructions on everything from sketching out your design beforehand so you don’t forget anything, adding shading techniques so your drawing looks more realistic.\nDrawing is an important skill for kids and adults alike, so why not take advantage of the opportunity to learn with our easy-to-follow instructions?\nDifferent Ways to Draw Microphones\nThere are many ways of drawing microphones depending on what you feel looks best and works for your skill level.\nWhat Do the Parts of a Microphone Look Like?\nA microphone consists of a housing that contains the components and wires, along with an end piece (a “grille”) that holds the diaphragm. Microphones also have a connector to attach them to other devices such as speakers/amplifiers, mixers, computers, etc. There are various types of these connectors but they all serve basically the same purpose: for signal transfer between different pieces of equipment via electrical wiring.\nWhat Is a Wired Microphone and What Does It Look Like?\nA wired microphone is a type of mic that transmits sound waves via wires connected to both the housing and an end piece. These are often used with speakers, amplifiers, mixers, or computers in various types of venues ranging from karaoke bars to classrooms/lecture halls to theaters…etc\nA wired microphone has an attached cord that will allow it to connect directly into the system.\nThe most common way for drawing these sorts of microphones is by making height lines first (to establish where everything should be drawn) followed by adding all the main details.\nDraw three lines that curve upwards slightly before meeting together in the center where two more vertical lines meet once again. The microphone will rest in between these two curved lines and the cord will extend downwards – sometimes into a spiraling shape but that’s completely up to you! Now, add your mic stand at the bottom of the drawing since it is resting on top of this object before adding any details such as color or shading (optional depending on what you want).\nWhat Does a Wireless Microphone Look Like?\nWireless microphones work just like wired microphones except they do not have a wire connecting the housing and end piece. Instead, these types of mics use radio frequencies to transmit sound waves from one place (the mic) to another (speakers/amplifiers). These types of microphones are often used by singers who need freedom when they perform.\nWireless microphones often have slightly more details because they do need to house several components within the body itself such as rechargeable batteries and their circuit boards which might even feature colorful LED lights!\nIs There an Easier Way to Draw a Microphone?\nTo make things easier, try taking some reference materials from your particular brand/model mic so you’re more likely to get accurate proportions and figure out what it looks like.\nMake sure you think about where all of the components fit inside the housing before doing any kind of detailing because once something has been drawn in, there is no way around it without ripping up your hard work and restarting from scratch!\nHow to Draw a Microphone Accurately\nIf you want your creation to look more realistic and appealing, start by carefully sketching out your design in pencil before you move on to using markers or pens for ink. This will help ensure that nothing is missed when it comes time for colorization so every part of the image looks its best.\nIn the end, practice makes perfect. So don’t get discouraged if your first few drawings aren’t exactly what you were hoping for because it’s bound to take a few tries before you have something that looks great.\nMaterials Needed to Draw a Microphone\n- Paper. Bristol paper, regular printer paper, or sketchpad makes a good substitute. Generally, smooth paper is nice to work on but not necessary.\n- Pencils (HB and B). A pencil is needed to draw the outline of your microphone.\n- Some colored pens and markers for adding color later on (optional). They are both good choices depending on what your personal preference is or how detailed you want your drawing to be.\n- A ruler is optional but helpful when drawing the diaphragm.\n- An eraser and a sharpener.\nHow to Draw a Microphone (Option 1)\nNow that we’ve answered some common questions about drawing microphones let’s learn even more by continuing with this tutorial.\nThe first step is to sketch out the microphone you want. Use simple shapes for this purpose.\nBegin by drawing a circle, this will be the front part of the microphone’s body. The shape should resemble a loosely drawn football.\nAfter you have drawn the circle, draw a long rectangle that is slightly angled to one side and connect this shape to your first body part.\nThe next step involves creating the microphone’s grille. Draw two long lines and add smaller ones for this detail of your mic.\nOnce your outline is sketched, it’s time to draw in more details like screws and knobs as well as a few lines representing cords or wires inside of the device (optional).\nTrace over everything in pencil or marker depending on what you prefer.\nYou can also add some shading techniques if you want but it is not necessary in order to draw a nice sounding mic. Now just color everything in however you like with colored pens or markers.\nYour microphone drawing is complete!\nHow to Draw a Vintage Microphone (Option 2)\nFirst, draw a rectangle with rounded corners on your paper for the microphone’s body. Make sure it is slightly slanted to one side.\nAdd some lines at the bottom of this shape so you have something representing where cords would go from an external source.\nDon’t forget to add small rectangles inside of the first rectangle representing a microphone’s grille.\nFinally, just draw in any details you want such as screws and more buttons/knobs. If you’re not sure what else to include that would be visually appealing but still realistic enough for this kind of drawing then stick with simple geometric designs until you can figure out how to make your products look their best later on down the road!\nYou can also add some shading techniques if you want but it is not necessary in order to draw a nice sounding mic.\nYour mic is now complete! Just color it using markers or pens. You could also try experimenting with different colors of paper and different types of pens to see what kind of cool-looking mic you can create next!\nHow to Draw a Cartoon Microphone (Option 3)\nStart by making a rectangle. This will be the microphone’s body. After doing so, draw another long rectangle for your mic’s handle.\nAdd another rectangle with rounded edges and a circle for the grille of your microphone. Draw a line on the grille.\nNow draw large and small circles for eyes and reflections in the eyes. Add a curving line for the mouth.\nNow finish off what you’ve started by adding some cute details such as stars, music notes, etc. Drawing something completely fictional like this, feel free to use your imagination!\nNow that you know how to draw a cartoon microphone, there’s no reason why your drawings couldn’t be of the most famous microphones in history. Just think about recording some music or creating an exciting video game with this drawing as part of its design!\nLearn more drawing techniques in our How to Draw Tears useful guide.\nHow to Draw a Microphone Stand\nThere are many ways to draw your mic stand depending on what you want yours to look like. If it’s super tall then try drawing three long vertical lines that branch out into smaller stems or curves, then add shading techniques or color later on if desired!\nWe recommend a wired microphone with a stand the shape of an inverted triangle for your first-time drawing – you’ll have more success that way!\nBegin by adding the base of the mic stand which will have three legs in a triangular position with one leg being slightly shorter than the other two. Exaggerate this so it looks like an actual triangle instead of just some straight lines meeting together to form something resembling a tripod or chair.\nNow, just draw in two rectangles and a circle for the microphone that will rest on top of your stand and add your mic’s cord.\nColor it however you want! The possibilities are endless here so don’t be afraid to experiment with various colors until you find one(s) that really look good enough to represent your mic (or, at least something aesthetically pleasing)!\nTry out different shapes for your mic stand! You can make it as simple or as detailed as you want, just be sure to have fun with it and remember that there are no wrong ways of drawing a microphone.\nTips for Drawing Microphones\nIf it is important for you to create accuracy when doing any kind of artwork involving something like a microphone, here are just some additional tips and tricks on making sure that everything looks perfect.\n- Draw knobs if attached or pressed onto something rather than those that stand alone without support. The knob on the front should face right/to point outwards.\n- Don’t forget to draw the cord coming downwards behind the mic and cut across about an inch above its base curving slightly.\n- Add shadows below objects if they’re being held up by someone’s hand so it will look more real. Be sure to make thematic sense with other shadows you put down around your microphone picture. If there isn’t enough light hitting an object from all sides, don’t include a shadow because it won’t make much sense!\n- Include some sort of surface or platform for your microphone picture to be standing on, such as a speaker stand. It gives depth and makes what you’re drawing more realistic.\n- Use reference images as much as possible because they can help prevent mistakes from being made simply by giving precise measurements without having to guess at anything since these usually have good lighting which allows every detail to be seen clearly.\n- Make sure the lines of your drawing look clean and clear without any unnecessary scribbles which could cause an issue later on down the road during coloring time.\n- Try practicing sketching out different kinds of mics in positions such as one attached to a person’s head or being held by a person. These are called “action poses” and they can make any drawing look more interesting to the eye of fans who enjoy seeing their favorite characters come to life on paper!\n- Use markers with fine point tips in order to get cleaner lines which will result in a higher quality end product that you should be proud of.\nBy following these simple instructions about drawing a microphone, anyone can learn even if they have no previous experience with graphic design or illustration whatsoever! Plus, now that we’ve covered some common questions as well as additional helpful tips for beginners who want to draw a microphone correctly from scratch without making any errors along the way everything should be pretty clear by now. So what do you think? Are you ready to give it a try?']	['<urn:uuid:ed695427-fd30-4a7e-b36a-c3452699d838>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	20	61	1957
12	compare effectiveness different treatment options psychotherapy medication dysthymic disorder chronic depression	Treatment for dysthymic disorder typically involves two main approaches: psychotherapy and medication. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective forms of psychotherapy, helping identify and change negative thought patterns. Medication alone is not recommended as symptoms often return when discontinued. Antidepressants, particularly SSRIs (like Paxil, Zoloft) and SNRIs (like Effexor, Pristiq), are commonly prescribed due to milder side effects. Other options include TCAs, NDRIs, and MAOIs. Treatment often requires trial and error to find effective medication with tolerable side effects. Additional remedies include regular exercise, avoiding substance abuse, self-education about the condition, and developing a support system.	['Depression comes in many different forms. One type that is quite common but not often discussed is a type of depression known as dysthymia. Dysthymia (also called dysthymic disorder) is a milder form of depression than major depression that affects nearly 11 million adults in the U.S. Whereas the symptoms of major depression need to last only 2 weeks in order to meet the criteria for a diagnosis, dysthymia is a chronic disorder. The symptoms must last for at least 2 years. For many people, however, the symptoms last for many years – even decades – if not treated. Unfortunately, many people with dysthymia don’t seek treatment because the symptoms don’t seem serious enough to them or they’ve been that way for so long that it feels normal. Although the symptoms of major depressive disorder are more intense and can be disabling, dysthymic disorder can be particularly challenging because it can last for many years. This takes a toll on those who have it, often making life feel like a constant challenge. It’s difficult to function or feel your best when you struggle with low self-esteem, lack of motivation, or a pessimistic outlook on life. In fact, although the day-to-day symptoms are mild compared to major depression, the chronic nature of the disorder can lead to thoughts of suicide.\nDysthymic disorder and major depressive disorder share many symptoms. The primary difference is that, with dysthymia, they are less intense. The primary symptom in adults is a chronically depressed mood, lasting for at least two years. This is typically described as feeling sad or down. To meet the criteria for a diagnosis of dysthymic disorder, two of the following 6 symptoms must also be present while feeling depressed:\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia (excessive sleep)\n- Poor appetite or overeating\n- Low self-esteem\n- Fatigue or low energy\n- Difficulties concentrating or making decisions\n- Feelings of hopelessness\nOther symptoms often include:\n- Feelings of emptiness\n- Apathy / loss of interest in day-to-day activities\n- Difficulties enjoying life\n- Feelings of helplessness\n- Social withdrawal or isolation\n- Frequent self-criticism\n- Persistent physical symptoms (e.g. problems with digestion, aches, headaches) that don’t improve despite treatment\n- Thoughts of suicide\nChildren with dysthymia may exhibit irritability rather than a depressed mood, and the symptoms need to last only 1 year. They may perform poorly in school and struggle socially. They tend to have a negative outlook as well.\nAs with most mental health disorders, the exact cause of dysthymia remains a mystery. However, it is most likely a combination of the following factors: Genetics: Dysthymia is more likely to develop when there is a family history of major depression or dysthymia. Biochemistry: As with other types of depression, dysthymia is likely caused in part by an imbalance of brain chemicals – neurotransmitters, such as serotonin – that help regulate mood. Environmental factors: Highly stressful events may trigger or contribute to the development of dysthymia. These may include things like the death of a loved one, work stress, or ongoing financial difficulties. Associated problems: Individuals with dysthymia often experience other problems as a result, including substance abuse, relationship and family problems, poor work or school performance, low productivity, and a decreased quality of life. They often become socially isolated. The risk for developing major depression is also increased for those with dysthymia. When both disorders occur at the same time, it is often referred to as “double depression”. The long term nature of this disorder can ultimately trigger thoughts of suicide and suicidal behavior.\nThere are no tests for dysthymia. Usually, the diagnosis is made by a mental health professional who recognizes the chronic pattern of symptoms. Other potential causes for the symptoms must be ruled out, including a health condition (e.g. hypothyroidism), a medication, or ongoing substance abuse. A diagnosis is not made unless the symptoms cause significant distress or create problems in important aspects of life such as work or school performance, personal relationships, or social functioning.\nThere are two types of depression treatment that are generally recommended for dysthymic disorder: psychotherapy and medication. Psychotherapy While many types of psychotherapy may be beneficial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective types of psychotherapy for depression, including dysthymia. A skilled cognitive behavioral therapist can help individuals with dysthymia identify and change negative thought patterns. These thought patterns often fuel the depressive symptoms, particularly low self-esteem, hopelessness, pessimism, and self-criticism. With dysthymia, these thought patterns have become deeply ingrained and can be difficult to change without the help of a trained therapist. Psychotherapy can also help people develop healthy coping skills, learn to manage stress more effectively, learn good decision-making skills, overcome self-defeating behaviors, and create a support network. Each of these things can help to significantly reduce symptoms and help individuals live a happier, more productive life. Medication Medication is not always necessary with dysthymic disorder. However, in some cases it may be a beneficial treatment when used in combination with psychotherapy. Generally, medication alone is not a good treatment for depression because once stopped, the symptoms often return. Since dysthymia is a chronic condition, medications usually need to be taken long term. Antidepressant medications are typically prescribed for dysthymic disorder. There are different types of antidepressants available. The two types most frequently prescribed are SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and SNRIs (serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). This is because their side effects tend to be milder than those of other types of antidepressants. They can be very effective, but as with all medications, they don’t work for everyone. SSRIs– Medications in this category include Paxil, Zoloft, Prozac, Celexa, and Lexapro. SNRIs –Medications in this category include Effexor, Pristiq, and Cymbalta. TCAs (tricyclic antidepressants) – These include Elavil, Anafranil, Tofranil, and Sinequan NDRIs (norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors) – These include Remeron and Wellbutrin. MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) – These include Nardil and Parnate. When it comes to medication, there is often a period of trial and error before finding a medication that is not only effective, but also has tolerable side effects. The benefits must always outweigh the costs. With most antidepressants, the full effects are not experienced for several weeks. Discontinuing any medication should always be done under a doctor’s supervision. Stopping some medications suddenly can cause unpleasant side effects or withdrawal symptoms. Common antidepressant side effects include sleep disturbance, weight loss or gain, problems with sexual performance or decreased libido, and dry mouth. Unlike other antidepressants, MAOIs can have serious (and potentially fatal) interactions with certain foods, beverages, and other medications. They are usually the last choice because of the serious restrictions involved when taking them. In order for treatment to be effective, it’s very important to stick with it. Although it can be tempting to skip a therapy session or medication dose, doing so will only defeat their purpose. In most cases, the symptoms will return if treatment is stopped prematurely.\nOther remedies and lifestyle changes that may help\nIn addition to psychotherapy and medication, there are other things you can do to help reduce the symptoms of dysthymia. These include: Exercise regularly. Numerous studies have shown that regular exercise – particularly aerobic types of exercise (e.g. running, biking, swimming) – helps reduce symptoms of depression. It also helps to improve sleep, increase confidence, and improve self-esteem. Stay away from street drugs, medications that aren’t prescribed, and alcohol. It can be tempting to self-medicate with substances when you feel sad or down. Unfortunately, they won’t help your depression and often make it worse. They can also interfere with your treatment. If you have a problem with substance abuse talk to your doctor or therapist about treatment. Educate yourself. Learning everything you can about your disorder. This will help you understand it better, and hopefully keep you motivated with regards to your treatment. It will also help you understand that it’s not your fault or a sign of weakness that you struggle with depression. Find a type of exercise you enjoy and do it consistently, even if you don’t feel like it. Find an exercise buddy to make it more fun and keep you motivated. Develop a good support system. People with dysthymia and other types of depression often withdraw socially. Over time, they can become very isolated. This often makes their symptoms worse. Make a commitment to develop a network of people who are positive and supportive. Make an effort to spend time regularly with people you enjoy.']	['<urn:uuid:8bb07347-d268-4b0e-ae38-a5c7546d596a>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	11	100	1412
13	What historical events and current challenges impact Indonesia's global coffee market position?	Historically, Indonesia rose to prominence in the global coffee market when Java coffee defeated Yemen's Mocha coffee in 1726, with 2,145 tons flooding the European continent. The Dutch colonial expansion of coffee cultivation throughout the archipelago and strategic marketing, like the 1893 Java Village exhibition in Chicago, established 'java' as a synonym for coffee. Today, Indonesia's position as a major coffee producer faces serious challenges from climate change. Scientific projections indicate significant decreases in coffee exports under high emission scenarios, with price increases of up to 109% by 2100. These climate impacts will affect not only Indonesia's production but the global coffee supply chain, requiring urgent mitigation efforts to maintain stable production and supply.	['History of coffee in Indonesia, a timeline\nSomething for those always looking for curiosities, as well as for those who just accidentally learn something very cool!\nBelow you will find a short history of coffee in Indonesia – its cradle, colonizers from the Netherlands and stories about the first plantations, pirates and royal expeditions.\nWe invite you to delve into undiscovered stories straight from the Indian Ocean – sit back (preferably with a cup of Indonesian coffee in your hand) and learn more.\nIn 1614 Dutch traders visited Aden in Yemen. Pieter van den Broecke, a cloth merchant in the service of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost- Indische Compagnie—VOC), visits the bustling trading port of Mocha on the southernmost tip of the Arabian Peninsula where he stumbles upon a drink that he describes as “something hot and black”.\nHe believes the drink, called qahwa by the locals, is interesting enough to be brought back to Amsterdam for analysis. For this he needs the seeds and given that the penalty for exporting seedlings is death, he is forced to smuggle them out. By 1616 Pieter van den Broecke was the first one to steal a bush from Mocha, Yemen and became the first person to bring a live coffee plant to Europe!\nIn 1640, the magical drink arrived in Amsterdam in the local cafes.\nThe Dutch by this time considered how to grow the coffee by themselves, rather than buying from Yemen and later from India.\nThe VOC, which is empowered to fight wars, drove the Portuguese from Ceylon by 1658—known today as Sri Lanka, hence securing the monopoly over cinnamon. As a bonus, it also acquires a small coffee plantation that is ready for harvesting. The Portuguese had colonized the Arabs 150 years previously and had stolen coffee seeds from them. Around this period, scientists at the Amsterdam Botanical Garden successfully cultivated coffee plants. They send some of the seeds to India’s Malabar Coast for planting.\nA little side tour – the VOC was often regarded as the first Ltd company in the world, which directly was the world’s first multinational corporation.\nEstablished in 1602 no other company predates. Granted powers to facilitate the spice trade, they became the monopoly of it, with powers to attack nations and individuals in their purpose of facilitating their trade, for 21 years. In 1619, only 17 years after its establishment it had 150 merchant ships, 50 warships, 50.000 employees, 10.000 soldiers and a ROI of 40% per annum.\nThe spice empire in Asia was ruled by the 17 Heren, The 17 Gentlemen (1725), who were shareholders representing different chambers of the VOC.\nThe Mayor of Amsterdam, Nicholas Witsen, instructs Adrian Van Ommen, the Dutch commander of the Malabar Coast, to ship seedlings from the Indian city of Cannanore to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies.\nThe seeds are planted on the Kedawoeng Estate, which is owned by Governor-General Willem van Outhoorn.\nThe pioneering effort fails as the fledgling coffee plantation is destroyed by floods. A second shipment of seedlings reaches Java in the following year. After a successful trial run on the island, the Dutch set their eye on cultivating the coffee in Indonesia.\nThe history of coffee in indonesia started 1696 in Java, Kedawoeng estate in Jakarta, or how it was known back in the days; Batavia. Unfortunately due to flooding this was not a success. It was 3 years that a high ranked Official in the VOC gave it another try. They moved land inwards from Jakarta toward the mountains and applied some of that dutch water management magic. These Yemenese varietal developed in Malambar, India, Arabica beans became the genes of most of the coffees found throughout Indonesia.\nThe plants traveled back along with their spoils to Amsterdam, which by the time of the 17th century was a rich trading hub for coffee from Asia, Africa and South America, due to the International character of the VOC. After 2 acclaims of being the best beans of the auction, and raised quite the premium for the dutch, colonially cultivated beans organised by the VOC.\nIn 1707 The governor met with all the regents in Priangan to discuss growing coffee on the higher plateaus of West Java, South of Jakarta. This area was not only selected for its nearness to the trading port of Jakarta, but also for its favourable growing conditions for the industrious scale of coffee cultivation (high plateaus). Only one local regent agreed, from Cianjur regency.\nIn 1711 the first 405 kilograms arrived from Cianjur and received the highest price ever paid at an Amsterdam auction. The equivalent of around 20 USD per KG, or a day wage for a worker in Amsterdam at the time.\nKing Louis XIV of France, asked for seeds of Coffea arabica var. Arabica or referred to as Coffea arabica L. var. typica which is hereinafter referred to as typika of the mayor of Amsterdam Nicolaes Witsen.\nThis is because the French King got the fact that Coffee from Java island got the highest price at an auction in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. So he wanted the coffee variety to be part of the Jardin des Plantes botanical garden in Paris, France. Javanese coffee seeds in the Jardin des Plantes botanical garden were brought by French naval officers to Martinique, one of the French colonies in the Caribbean.\nIn 1714, the Mayor of Amsterdam presented a gift of a young coffee plant to King Louis XIV of France. The King ordered it to be planted in the Royal Botanical Garden in Paris. In 1723, a young naval officer, Gabriel de Clieu obtained a seedling from the King’s plant. Despite a challenging voyage — complete with horrendous weather, a saboteur who tried to destroy the seedling, and a pirate attack — he managed to transport it safely to Martinique.\nOnce planted, the seedling not only thrived, but it’s credited with the spread of over 18 million coffee trees on the island of Martinique in the next 50 years.\nIn addition, in the early 1720s, the Dutch also sent Javanese coffee seeds to Suriname, because they were tempted by the high price of the variety’s, to open a plantation there. Of the two places, Javanese coffee seeds spread to Central and South America. According to Prawoto Indarto, who studies the history of coffee, Java coffee’s traces can still be found in South America.\n“Tipika is still found in their plantations,” he said. Blue Mountain coffee planted in Jamaica and Geisha (or Gesha) – in reference to a coffee-producing hamlet in Ethiopia-in Panama are two examples.\nIn 1726, no less than 2,145 tons of coffee originating from the island of Java flooded the continent of Europe, defeating Mocha coffee from Yemen which had previously been the ruler of the market. And because of that, coffee originating from Java Island began to be known as Java Coffee.\nIn the early 18th century, Amsterdam became the world’s coffee capital thanks to the coffee beans supplied from Java to Europe. The coffee trade was profitable and was under the control of the Dutch colonial government.\nThe main region to supply the huge demand, with hyperbolic margins, was between 4 peaks near Bandung, West Java: Malabar, Mega, Puntang and Haruman.\nFollowing the great profits from the trade, the Dutch further pushed coffee cultivation through the archipelago to East Java and later mandating its growth on Bali, Timor, Sulawesi and Sumatra.\nWith the VOC reeling from financial disaster, the Netherlands government takes over control of the archipelago and appoints Willem Daendels as Governor-General in 1808. His landmark policy is the construction of the Great Post Road that stretches from Anyer in the west of Java to Panarukan in the east.\nApart from postal purposes, the road is essential for the mobilization of troops, as well as to transport coffee from plantations that are scattered throughout different regencies to the port of Batavia.\n1876 AND LEAF RUST\nIn 1876 the whole lands of Coffee in Java were devastated by leaf-rust, which left a huge gap in supply that was quickly filled by the Brazilians.\nAs a first response the Dutch shipped Liberica varietal coffee that was native to west and Central African regions, these trees grew up to 20 meters, they produced larger fruit than arabica. The strategy worked, but unfortunately the success was short, as leaf rust attacked again in 1907, where the Dutch responded with the introduction of Robusta.\nHowever due to the agricultural impact that Robusta cultivation had, the Dutch only replanted the old plantations with Robusta, while new ones continued on Arabica.\nThe year is 1893, an exhibition to commemorate Christopher Columbus’s discovery of America was held in Chicago, presenting some of the latest technological and industrial innovations as well as cultures from across the world. One of the most popular venues at the event was the Java Village, an initiative bankrolled by some of the wealthiest benefactors in the Dutch East Indies.\nThe history of coffee in Indonesia found came to acclaim. Central to the village was the Java Lunch Room, where it served nothing but pure Java coffee. The experience was so memorable for the visitors that soon they would refer to the delicacy as “a cup of Java”. The impact of the marketing stunt was profound. To this day, the word “java” is still understood by many as meaning coffee.\nIn 1908 the Dutch returned the coffee business into the hands of the local people, in accordance with their new ethical policy in regards to colonial exploitation.\nSince then Indonesia has been developing many directions of unique flavors in coffee, that formed over a 350 year old history with the plant.\nIndonesia’s colonial masters did contribute immensely to the development of coffee in Java. After all, it was they who first introduced coffee to Indonesia, planting their pioneering seeds in 1696 at what was known as the Kedawoeng estate on the outskirts of Batavia, present-day Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia.\nThe experiment in Kedawoeng turned out to be a success with the coffees regarded as being of a very high quality. By the start of the 18th century, coffee from the estate was sent to botanical gardens around Europe, including King Louis XIV’s Royal Botanical Garden, which later spread it to France’s colonies in the West Indies, eventually reaching South and Central America.\nWhile the Kedawoeng estate no longer exists, many plantations left by the colonies are still in production, several of them are run by state-owned companies.\nOne notable mention is PT Perkebunan Negara XII. The company runs six estates in East Java with a combined size of 5,600 hectares.\nWhile most of the produce is Robusta coffee, the company still grows one of the world’s finest Arabicas at its estate in Jampit.\nWe hope you enjoyed the History of coffee in indonesia, NOW ARE YOU READY FOR A JOURNEY INTO THE BEST COFFEE INDONESIA HAS TO OFFER?\nCoffee varieties, varietal, cultivar; What does it all mean?\nWHY ARE COFFEE VARIETIES IMPORTANT?

COFFEE FROM THE GAYO REGION OF SUMATRA Cof...', 'Continued carbon emissions would significantly reduce rice and coffee production in Indonesia — one of the world’s top producers of both crops — according to a study.\nContinued carbon emissions would significantly reduce rice and coffee production in Indonesia — one of the world’s top producers of both crops — according to a groundbreaking study that will be published by a team of scientists led by a co-chair of the UN’s climate science panel.\nThe study, titled “Impact of Climate Change in Indonesian Agriculture”, found that continued climate change would cut Indonesia’s rice production by millions of tons a year, cutting exports by a third and leading to price increases of more than 50 per cent.\nLower emissions would still lead to reduced rice yields and price rises — but to a lesser extent.\nIndonesia is the world’s fourth-largest rice producer, and these cuts to yields could be expected to have a disastrous effect on the world’s poorest people.\nFood price rises this year, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have been a major factor behind increased hunger globally.\nLead author, Edvin Aldrian, said: “Our report shows the stark contrast between a world in which emissions are high, and one where emissions fall. There are significant economic incentives to increasing efforts to cut emissions, to save ourselves from the devastating impacts we would otherwise see.”\nCoffee production would also decrease under continued emissions — with high emissions, Indonesia’s coffee exports may fall around 2-35 per cent.\nThe scientists project an increase in coffee prices for both Arabica and Robusta bean varieties of around 32 per cent by 2050 and 56-109 per cent between 2050 and 2100.\nAlthough the study focuses mainly on Indonesia’s economic and food security, it is clear that Indonesia’s decreased coffee and rice outputs will affect the global supply chain, and producers elsewhere may see similar effects.\nSea level rise will increase salinization, flooding, and the loss of rice fields in coastal areas. The report shows that climate impacts will reduce Indonesian rice production by 3.5 million tons or equivalent to fulfilling the rice consumption of 17.7 million people.\nWithout serious mitigation efforts to shift away from fossil fuels globally, sea level rise may increase saltiness of soils, which will cause a 50 per cent loss of productivity amounting to a decreased production of 8 million tons or equivalent to the rice consumption of 42 million people.\nThis means that there will be a significant increase in world rice prices due to increased demand. Countries with significant agricultural production in their coastal areas will also be impacted in a similar manner.\nAccording to Elza Surmaini, an author of the study from BRIN — Indonesia’s main governmental research agency, “extreme climate conditions cause a significant reduction in planted area and agricultural production. We must enhance our adaptation and mitigation efforts to ensure food security”.\n“Without a significant increase in mitigation efforts, the number of days where the temperature and rainfall conditions are optimal for coffee cultivation in Indonesia will be reduced by 50 per cent by the end of the century,” reports Supari, a study author from BMKG –Indonesia’s meteorological agency.\nThese results clearly show how improved climate change mitigation actions are needed to avert the world from more catastrophic climate change impacts. The level of disruption climate change could have on Indonesia’s agricultural sector would affect the world’s agricultural supply chain. The only way this can be prevented is with faster action to reduce carbon emissions.\nPerdinan, a study author from IPB — Indonesia’s foremost agricultural institute, said: “The economic costs of the impacts of continued climate change on agricultural production show it is essential to make stronger commitments to manage climate risks and stabilize food supply, which are essential for achieving Indonesia’s development targets.”\nSource : Business Standard']	['<urn:uuid:eac95725-0c47-4cfe-8c18-55d7eec0d8b8>', '<urn:uuid:6bc55bdc-1624-4e28-946f-5d9cbef639b4>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	12	114	2557
14	How was dance used historically for healing, and how does it help with trauma today?	Historically, dance was used as a foundation for healing rituals, particularly in places like the rainforests of Brazil and the Kalahari Desert, where it remains the main element of spiritual and ritual healing techniques. In modern times, dance has been proven to help process trauma through the body - studies show it can decrease anxiety and boost mood more effectively than other physical activities. Research indicates that dance therapy can help trauma victims process stuck sensations and actions from traumatic events, allowing them to regain bodily familiarity and efficacy. This was demonstrated as early as the 1940s when dance therapy helped World War II veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder by decreasing body tension and minimizing isolation.	['v. danced, dan-cing, dan-ces\nTo move rhythmically, usually to music, utilising prescribed or improvised steps and/or gestures\nTo engage in or perform a dance\nThis is how the Oxford English Dictionary describes the term “dance”. What exactly does it tell us?\nDance is a form of art whereby people use their bodies to perform rhythmic movements to the beat of music. It has been done for eons throughout many cultures, and is used to express happiness, emotion, spiritualism and exercise and is often used as a manner in which to relay a story without the use of words.\nNot only humans can dance. Animals are also widely known for this behaviour as a non-verbal communication method, especially during mating rituals.\nThere are several genres and styles of dance. Ballroom, Ballet and the Tango is classical styles of dancing. African dancing can be described as interpretive (story telling). Step dances are classified by square dancing and electric slides. All dancing can be done as an individual, as a group in front of an audience, or as a social event.\nChoreography is an art form whereby dances are created. The person who is responsible for creating a specific dance routine or act, is more commonly known as a choreographer.\nIt is quite impossible to estimate exactly when dance rituals and dancing became an integral part of our lives. Other than cave paintings and ancient hunting tools, the art of dance has not left behind any distinct, physical relics. However, it has been thought dance in its form has been around from as early as the first stages of evolution as a form of trance before the commencement of a battle and/or war. It is believed that the trance-like state assisted the warriors to lose their true identities and to set them into a state of mind whereby they could fight effectively.\nThe earliest recorded structured use of dance has been during the telling of ancient myths. In the past, dance instead of speech or written language was also used to pass down tales from generation to generation. In that way, no words could be twisted; the dance would portray the true story.\nIn ancient times, dance rituals were used by men to show their sense of affection towards a potential female companion. This theory is closely coupled to the basis of the act of making love between a man and a woman.\nAn additional ancient application of dance is also thought to have been the foundation of healing rituals. In the rainforests of Brazil and the Kalahari Desert, dance is still the main element of spiritual and ritual healing techniques.\nMost dance forms that are classified as contemporary can be dated back in history. It is said that dances from Sri Lanka are all interconnected with the original aborigines and mythic devils which were known as yakkas. Legend also has it that the Kandyan dance was first performed as a magic ritual that removed an evil spell from a bewitched, ancient king.\nIn the early years most forms of dance was created to be performed as a pair. In the years that followed this practice continued, and thus some dances such as the Salsa, Tango, Waltz and the Jig has been developed. While it is true that most dances are performed with the accompaniment of music, certain dance forms such as tap dance, can be performed without the presence of music. Dance is commonly also performed to the rhythm or beat of a specific piece of music, but this is not a necessity. When a dance is executed without the presence of music, it is known as “dancing to your inner rhythm”.\nThrough the years, dance it itself has evolved to the age whereby dance competitions are very much a part of the concept. As we know, dance competitions are very competitive and performed in front of judging panels for some kind of reward; in some cases even cash prizes. Dance competitions which are classified as being “open”, allows dancers to perform any form of dance, usually as an individual. Dance as a sport, is mainly performed as couples and involves the more reformed Latin dances or ballroom dancing. Single Style dance competitions only allow a specific style of dance, such as Irish dancing.\nNo matter what style or form of dance you prefer, let your hair down and let your rhythm do the talking. For most of us who just let loose, it is often “therapeutic” and, no matter if you had a bad day, sure to make you feel better. So, dance like nobody is watching!', 'In the aftermath of a tragedy such as what occurred just one month ago on April 15, 2013 during the 117th annual Boston Marathon, for most of us, our body was left vibrating, questioning, confused, dysregulated, and perhaps disoriented. It is important to acknowledge that even those of us who were not direct victims or physically present at the event, collectively, were still affected. Our bodies take in these experiences and respond to such events. Trauma exists in many forms.\nAccording to the National Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder “a traumatic event is something life-threatening or very scary that you see or that happens to you…. Trauma also includes witnessing someone being killed or injured.“ Media broadcasts showing film footage over and over of traumatic events such as the Boston Marathon bombing are not only mental images but they become body memories that for some, can be extremely difficult to process and make sense of.\nTraumatic events can threaten our sense of environmental and bodily safety. These experiences need to be processed through the body. Research advances have emphasized the importance of including the body in treatment of any type of trauma. According to dance/movement therapist Claire Moore, ‘‘the sensations and actions that have become stuck in and after a traumatic event need to be integrated in the treatment process, so that the person can regain a sense of familiarity and efficacy in the body.”\nThis knowledge broadens the options for how people can receive support in order to move forward from common patterns of immobilization that often is experienced by victims of or witnesses to traumatic events. This means, rather than turning inward or self-soothing via means that disengage ourselves from our bodies (drinking, drugs, excessive binging, zoning out in front of the TV), our body can be an expressive vehicle utilized as an active resource to processing feelings.\nStudies have shown that dance, in particular, can decrease anxiety and boost mood more than other physical outlets. Researchers Leste and Rust (1990/1984) assigned patients with anxiety disorders to spend time in one of four settings: a modern-dance class, an exercise class, a music class, or a math class. Only the dance class significantly reduced anxiety.\nSo why dance in particular? Why should you dance? Why would dance be a vehicle to cope with daily stressors or even horrific tragedies such as the Boston Marathon explosions, or the Newtown School shootings? Perhaps this is based on the specific distinction that dance in itself is innately an expressive art form, not just a physical release of body tension alone.\nToday, media shows, such as Dancing with the Stars and So you think you can Dance, hint to this mind-body emotional connection that is inherent in the expressive power of movement.\nDance/movement therapists have long known the expressive nature of dance dating back to the effects of posttraumatic stress victims from World War II. Dance/movement therapy pioneer, Marian Chace, discovered back in the 1940s that her patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder were able to use dance therapy as a form of communication that assisted in the decrease of tension held in the body and minimized isolation. Dance/movement therapy, according to the American Dance Therapy Association, is based on the core belief that there is a fundamental interconnection between mind and body and what happens to the body can effectively influence the mind and vice versa. Dance/movement therapists are trained clinicians specializing in the interconnection between mind and body. The core premise lies within the therapeutic relationship where movement is the primary mode of connection, assessment and intervention.\nIn a Korean study at Wonkwang University with adolescents engaging in dance/movement therapy for 12 weeks, results suggested that participation in dance/movement therapy may stabilize the sympathetic nervous system and improve psychological distress in adolescents with depression.\nSo according to you, why do you dance? How does dance move you?\nTo learn more about dance/movement therapy and how it is used as a supportive resource for distressing feelings or for overall wellbeing and emotional health visit the American Dance Therapy Association.\nJeong, Y., Hong, S., Lee, M.

15	I'm learning about egg storage in commercial hatcheries. Why is it impossible to avoid storing eggs when running a commercial hatchery?	It is impossible to synchronize breeder egg production with final product production on a commercial scale, which often generates high levels of losses.	['This review discusses the benefits seen of heat treatment during storage in order to reduce embryonic mortality caused by prolonged storage in avian species.\nHeat treatment during storage\nThe longer eggs are stored, the higher the losses in hatchability. Stored eggs have a higher rate of embryonic mortality between days 2 and 3 of incubation, and need more time to complete incubation. This causes some live chicks to be rejected at take-off because they hatch too late. Several studies have investigated the possibility to limit the hatchability loss after long storage by applying short periods of heat treatment during storage, with differing results. Heat treatment for stored eggs has been around since the 1950’s, most commonly known as SPIDES but also known as PRESI in Canada and IDEAS in Turkey. In recent years, more and more successful attempts have been reported applying heat treatment during storage, even for large-scale trials. Nicholson (2012) and Aviagen (2014) have shown a consistent improvement of the hatchability of long stored eggs (Ross 308 & Ross 708 broiler eggs, as well as various GP & GGP lines) by applying one or more heat treatments in 34 small to large-scale trials.\nEffect of storage according to developmental stage\nDevelopment of the avian embryo begins immediately after fertilization in the infundibulum and continues as albumen and shell are deposited over the next 24-26 hours. The embryonic developmental stage at the moment of oviposition (egg laying) is variable for different genetic lines as well as parental ages. This may be genetically determined or linked to variations in oviductal transit time and/or body temperature. The effect of long storage times on embryonic development highly depends on the developmental stage of the embryos at oviposition. Although there are variations of staging at point of lay, according to breed type, etc. the stage should always be well away from the “point of no return”. However collection timing, farm storage, transport, etc. can all affect the embryo stage if the eggs are poorly managed and it must be remembered that to fill a commercial incubator will usually take more than one days egg collection or eggs from more than one farm. It has been reported that embryos at the pre-gastrula stage at oviposition are less able to withstand prolonged storage compared to embryos at the gastrula stage. For these embryos, incubation during storage may improve hatchability, since it can advance them to the developmental stage in which hypoblast formation is complete. In contrast, if development is already well advanced and embryos have started to form the primitive streak, incubation during storage may be detrimental since it brings the embryo in a more advanced stage of primitive streak formation (to around stage 3/4 H&H, 1951, period of active cellular migration and differentiation). Storage during such a period could impede critical embryonic processes. So there is some sort of “point of no return”- once this is reached, the embryonic development cannot be stopped anymore via returning the eggs to cold storage.\nHow does heat treatment during storage help?\nIn the egg holding room, eggs are kept at or under a so-called threshold temperature or physiological zero for development. However, some partial, but not a global or proportionate development can take place at these subthreshold temperatures. Different cells or tissues in these early embryos may have different threshold temperatures for development, resulting in uneven or disproportionate development. When this disproportionate development progresses too far it may interfere with embryonic viability and, hence also hatchability. Total heat treatment aims to be around 12 hours, but this will depend on egg size, cold store temperatures and egg temperature at removal. Using current technology adapted to work in a specialised way, has allowed the process to be refined to give accurate and consistent results irrespective of egg age, breed, size, egg weight or storage time of the loaded eggs. This consistency would the answer the question as to why previous heat treatments have been shown to give a benefit but with varying levels of success.\nStoring eggs is an inevitable practice when incubating eggs on commercial scale. It is impossible to synchronize breeder egg production with final product production, which often generates high levels of losses. Heat treatment during egg storage allows a significant reduction in these logistical discrepancies. There is undoubtedly a huge potential in restoring the hatchability of stored eggs, and even improving post-hatch performance. The initial series of commercial trials demonstrated that the operational parameters required in order to achieve a degree of benefits was relatively broad; however achieving the optimal gains considerably narrowed the parameter limitations. Add to this the logistical need to minimize space usage within the hatchery, it was clear there is a need for dedicated, accurate equipment that has a practical capacity. It is crucial to accurately and consistently control the key incubation parameters, as inadequate application of the technique will result in suboptimal results or might even lead to major losses. The precise measurement and control of the egg shell temperature in the incubator, as well as a controlled and uniform warm-up and cool-down phases of the eggs, are key to achieve consistent, optimal gains. The trials currently being undertaken under precise controlled conditions indicate gains can be achieved on eggs with relatively short storage. Taking an immature embryo to a more robust developmental stage either prior to or during initial storage has a major effect on embryonic viability as this gain is seen in the improved hatch of set figures.\nPresented at the 9th Turkey Science and Production Conference']	['<urn:uuid:64d212a6-3d01-4565-aea3-3571399641d2>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	21	23	920
16	Could you explain how the climate conditions differ between winter and summer seasons in the Seward Peninsula, Nulato Hills, and Kotzebue Sound Lowlands region?	These ecoregions experience distinct seasonal climate patterns. During winter, ice spans the sea, allowing direct passage of cold Siberian air, resulting in persistent cold and windy conditions. In contrast, summer is characterized by fog that blankets the coastlines. The overall climate of these three ecoregions is classified as moist polar.	['Location and Setting\nThe Seward Peninsula REA is comprised of three ecoregions: the Seward Peninsula, the Nulato Hills, and the Kotzebue Sound Lowlands (SNK). These three ecoregions’ climate is classified as moist polar. At this latitude, ice spans the sea early every winter, allowing direct passage of cold Siberian air. Persistent cold, windy conditions occur in the winter and fog blankets the coastlines in the summer. Vegetation is generally tundra on the peninsula (alpine Dryas-lichen tundra and barrens at high elevations) and moist sedge-tussock tundra in the lowlands with patches of low-growing ericaceous and willow-birch shrubs on better-drained areas. In the hills, vegetation patterns generally follow the terrain, with Dryas-lichen and sedge-ericaceous shrub tundra on hilltops, grading into willow-birch-alder shrublands and eventually spruce and birch woodlands at lower elevations. Moose, brown bears, caribou, arctic foxes, and Alaska hares are common in all of these ecoregions. Ribbon seals and walruses comb the coastline, and huge summer runs of pink salmon ascend the Unalakleet drainage.\nThe Nulato Hills are the remains of an ancient mountain range after extended periods of down cutting, weathering, and erosion. East of Norton Sound, these hills ripple inland in a southwest-northeast orientation with streams flowing in intervening valleys. Due to their modest elevation, most of these hills have been spared from recent glaciations and were part of the ice-free Beringia corridor linking North America and Asia.\nThe Seward Peninsula is a cold, wind-swept landmass jutting out into the Bering Sea and represents the southernmost haunt of polar bears on mainland Alaska. It is a landscape mosaic of coastal lowlands, expansive convex hills with scattered broad valleys, and small, isolated groups of rugged mountains. Permafrost is continuous and soils are therefore often wet, shallow, and organic. Ice-related features such as pingos and patterned ground are present. Dense concentrations of lakes and ponds support abundant waterfowl and nesting birds on the coastal plains. At its height, Pleistocene glaciation covered only the highest mountains and the peninsula was also part of the ice-free migration corridor between North America and Asia.\nThese ecoregions have strong ecological affinities to Asia that remain to this day with the presence of Eurasian birds (gray-headed chickadee, yellow and white wagtails, bluethroat), fishes (Alaska blackfish), and flora.\nEcoregion descriptions were excerpted and modified from “Ecoregions of Alaska,” Nowacki et al. 2000.\nGo to Top\nThe ecoregional assessment is driven and guided by management questions. These questions address specific information needs that produce meaningful information for future management actions. Management questions for the Seward Peninsula REA are based upon 10 broad themes:\n- Native Plant Communities\n- Aquatic Resources\n- Climate and Permafrost\n- Invasive Species\n- Reindeer Grazing\n- Regional Socioeconomics\nThe management questions for the Seward Peninsula REA are presented in the Task 1 Final Memorandum.\nGo to Top\nConservation elements are renewable resources of high conservation interest within an ecoregion. This REA assessed the current condition and forecasted future condition of two types of conservation elements:\n“Coarse-filter” conservation elements, which typically include all of the major ecosystem types within the assessment landscape, and represent all of the predominant natural ecosystem functions and services in the ecoregions;\nand “Fine-filter” conservation elements, which complement the first set of elements by including a limited subset of focal species assemblages and individual species.\nConservation elements for the Seward Peninsula REA include 32 terrestrial and aquatic ecological systems occurring in the ecoregions as well as 24 individual species of regional/landscape concern, 39 local species, and 3 species assemblages. A full list and explanation of the conservation elements can be found in the Seward Peninsula Task 1 Final Memorandum.\nGo to Top\nA key purpose of this REA is to understand the influences of significant, widespread change agents on the natural resources of the Seward Peninsula, the Nulato Hills, and the Kotzebue Lowlands ecoregions. Change agents are those features or phenomena that have the potential to affect the size, condition, and landscape context of conservation elements. Change agents in the Seward Peninsula REA landscape are:\n• Climate change\n• Invasive species\nA more complete discussion of change agents is presented in the Task 1 Final Memorandum.\nGo to Top\nData, Maps, and Models\nGeospatial data, maps, and models used in and produced by the REAs will be made available to the public upon final completion of each individual assessment.\nIn some instances, data may be released in phases for an REA to expedite public access to particular data sets. To learn more about REA data products and determine which REAs have available data, go to the REA Data Portal.\nMemos and Reports\nFor each REA, there is a series of memos which are supplemental documents to the final report. Memos document the major tasks and decision points made during the assessments and provide pertinent background information necessary to understand the justification and methods used during the assessment.

17	What are some tips for eating healthy at restaurants, and what environmentally-friendly practices do restaurants use to reduce waste?	For healthy eating at restaurants, you should control portion sizes by requesting small cuts of meat or packing half the meal before eating, choose dishes that are roasted, blackened, poached, or steamed instead of fried, and opt for healthier substitutions like salsa instead of sauces. As for waste reduction, restaurants implement trayless dining to reduce food waste, use the LeanPath system to track and decrease kitchen waste by 40%, and offer reusable container programs to replace single-use disposables.	"['|Print This Page Email this page to a Friend|\nTake Heart Articles\nDining out, eating on the go and overeating are just a few of the reasons why Americans are becoming increasingly overweight and obese, which puts them at higher risk for heart disease. A hearty meal at your favorite restaurant can be anything but hearthealthy, yet you do not have to stay home and cook every night. Palmetto Health Heart Hospital cardiovascular dietitian Roberta Jupp has put together a Restaurant Survival Guide so you can enjoy restaurant dining guilt-free.\nBefore arriving at the restaurant, keep the following goals in mind:\n• Eat heart-healthy foods\n• Control portion size\n• Stop eating before feeling overly full\n“Don’t be a member of the ‘Clean Plate Club.’ Most restaurant meals contain about two to three portions,” explains Jupp. “Also, refrain from arriving at the restaurant famished, which increases your chances of overeating.”\nWhen you arrive, check the menu for healthy choices before sitting down. If there are none, you may want to choose another restaurant.\nOrdering your meal\nAsk your server about substitution options, such as replacing sauces with healthier alternatives like salsa, mustard or balsamic vinegar.\nOther substitutions to consider:\n• Meals prepared in cooking wine or broth instead of oils\n• Whole wheat pasta or bread instead of white\n• Brown or wild rice instead of white\n• Plain baked potato with salsa or a sweet potato instead of one “loaded” with butter and sour cream.\n• Steamed or grilled vegetables instead of sautéed in fat.\nEnjoying happy hour\nBefore drinking or eating anything, have an eight-ounce glass of water. Avoid sugary drinks like amaretto sours or pina coladas. When ordering, consider these healthy options:\n• Water with a twist of lemon or lime or splash of juice\n• Red wine\n• Wine spritzer\n• Straight drink mixed with water, diet soda or tonic\n• Decaffeinated coffee\n• Unsweetened tea (sweeten with Splenda® or other sugar substitute)\n• Low-fat milk\nChoosing an appetizer\nTry appetizers served with non-fat sauces like chili sauce, ketchup or horseradish. Choose the shrimp cocktail, clear soup or consommé, or crudités (vegetables). Consider having the appetizer as your entree. The portions are usually smaller.\nSavoring a salad\nChoose dark leafy greens salads without cheese, eggs or bacon and with dressing on the side. Opt for any fat-free dressings or season your salad with lemon wedges and balsamic vinegar.\nEnter the entree\nChoose an entree that is roasted, blackened, poached, steamed or boiled, or ask that it be made in one of those ways. Avoid fried foods, except for stir-fries with canola or olive oil.\nTo control portion size, request a small cut of meat or fish. If they do not have anything under six ounces—about the size of a deck of cards—then consider sharing the entree or ask for a to-go box. Pack up half your meal before you take your first bite.\n“During dinner, take breaks by placing your fork or spoon on the table and stop eating if you feel full at any point,” recommends Jupp.\nDessert is hard to resist, so don’t. Order one dessert for your entire party to share. Or, ask your server for fresh fruit.\nRemember, the more fresh and natural the food, the better. Bon Appetit!', ""Your Sodexo Campus Dining Team is dedicated to sustainability. We know we can all work together to make a positive impact right here at Wayland Baptist University. In addition to the many initiatives we take on as a company, we have implemented the following programs specific to Wayland Baptist University.\nXprss Nap Dispensers save energy and waste. The napkins are made of 100% recycled paper and the dispenser will encourage customers to take (and waste) fewer napkins. Energy is saved because less power is used to recycle paper products than to create them from virgin material.\nAPEX combines technology and products designed to save water and energy, minimize the impact of products on the environment, and has a built-in method of measuring results. The APEX management approach uses a tablet PC and wireless technology to communicate with the system’s controller to download, process and analyze data to establish each foodservice operation’s “rack-to-guest ratio.” By monitoring and improving this ratio, the system helps reduce the amount of water and energy used at each facility, and improve total operational efficiency.\nWe are a trayless campus. Customers without trays typically waste less food and beverages. It is also a healthier approach to eating, as we all know that at times our eyes are bigger than our stomach. Trayless dining also reduces the amount of water and detergents needed to wash trays - and saves energy too!\nWeigh The Waste\nDid you know that 40% of the food produced in our country is wasted? Periodically throughout the school year, we conduct a Weigh the Waste event. During the event, we weigh all of the uneaten food from guest’s plates. We consolidate the findings and report back to the community. We tie this to an awareness campaign that informs guests about food waste and its impact to our environment and our communities. We hold frequent campaigns in which we compare our results (and hopefully see our waste decline).\nWaste Reduction Efforts Recycling\nOn campus we recycle the following products: cardboard, glass, aluminum, paper, plastic.\nThe Sustainability Management and Reporting Tool (SMART) is a comprehensive, yet easy to use dashboard that provides baseline sustainability performance, prioritizes initiatives, and tracks continuous improvement in four key areas - carbon and energy, water, waste, and healthy and sustainable food and environments.\nReducing waste is very important. It results in less food waste in landfills where it emits methane which is 21x more powerful than CO2. The LeanPath kitchen waste tracking system records and tracks all of the food waste from our kitchen. This helps us to identify and change practices which result in food waste. By tracking waste we inform our staff and focus our efforts. On average, Sodexo has experienced a 40% decrease in kitchen food waste when the LeanPath system is in place.\nIndividual packets of condiments are useful in some instances, but they result in extra waste. If you are dining on site or you can add the sauce to your item before you leave, please use the bulk dispensers to reduce our waste.\nRecycling Fryer Oil into Biofuel\nFrench fries to fuel. Indeed, our fryer oil is recycled into biodiesel that is used to power a variety of vehicles - from delivery fleets to farm equipment.\nChoose To Reuse\nChoose to Reuse is a reusable container program designed to reduce waste and help achieve Sodexo's Better Tomorrow commitments by replacing single-use disposable food and beverage containers with reusable containers.\nReusable Cup Discount\nThe environment and your pocketbook win! Bring your reusable cup to purchase a fountain soda on campus and receive a discount at every location, every time.

18	sartre photographs 1970s french photo album content activities shown	The French photo album from the early 1970s showed Jean-Paul Sartre in various contexts: alongside famous figures like Camus, Castro, and Simone de Beauvoir; addressing revolutionary students during May '68; baby portraits; and images of him working at his desk with manuscripts or at café tables writing. The photos captured both his public persona as a philosophical action figure and his private moments of work, showing him with a pen in hand and tobacco pipe in jaw while engaged in philosophical writing.	"['In the early 1970s, a French publisher issued a sort of photo album devoted to Jean-Paul Sartre, who was the most famous philosopher in the world. He had been for some while, so the photojournalistic dossier on him was quite full. The book is full of pictures of him alongside equally famous figures from the world stage -- Camus and Castro, for example, and Simone de Beauvoir, of course. You also see him in the midst of dramatic events, as when he addressed an assembly of revolutionary students during May ’68. There are a few images of the philosopher in a less public capacity. As I recall, there is a baby portrait or two. Plus there were pictures of the Sartrean babes, who seemed to get younger as he got older.\nThe man was a philosophical action figure, to be sure. But my favorite pages in the book show him at his desk, with manuscripts piled up precariously nearby, or at a café table, scribbling away. Sartre once said that he felt like a machine while working on The Critique of Dialectical Reason, grinding out each day’s quota of concepts. And that’s what’s happening in those photographs of him with pen in hand and tobacco pipe in jaw -- tuning out everything else but the hard work of philosophizing. But who knows? A photograph cannot document thought. It’s entirely possible that Sartre was updating his schedule to accommodate a new girlfriend, rather than analyzing Stalinism.\nThe same brain did both -- a fact that lends itself to philosophical inquiry. Just where do you draw the line between task-oriented thinking and whatever it is philosophers do while they are “doing philosophy”? It is a conundrum.\nIn his new book Philosophers, from Oxford University Press, the New Yorker photographer Steve Pyke assembles a portrait gallery of contemporary thinkers. It embodies a conundrum or two of its own -- beginning with the title. In 1995, the British press Zelda Cheatle issued a collection of Pyke’s photographs that was also called Philosophers, which now fetches a high price from secondhand dealers. These are, it bears stressing, completely distinct books. All but one of the pictures in the new collection were taken over the past decade. Only two images from the earlier volume appear in the new one -- in the introductory pages, separate from the hundred portraits making up the main body of the book.\nSo we have, in other words, two volumes of the same kind, on the same subject, by the same author. They bear the same title. And yet they are not identical. A teachable moment in metaphysics? Yes, but one with practical implications for the used-book trade: a certain percentage of people trying to buy the older volume online will end up getting really, really irritated.\nThe book from Oxford is quite handsome. And its status as an aesthetic object is not a minor consideration. (For that matter, its aesthetics as a status object are also pretty demanding. It feels like you should get a nicer coffee table, just to have someplace to put it.) Without going so far as to say that Pyke represents philosophers as a subcategory of the beautiful people, he certainly renders them in beautiful black and white.\nEthnography forms no part of what he has in mind: his photographs do not show subjects going about their daily routines or occupying their usual niches. It’s difficult to think of Sartre without picturing him in certain settings – bars, cafés, lecture halls, etc. Furthermore, these places aren’t just elements of his biography; they figure into his work (the waiter in Being and Nothingness is an obvious example). Pyke’s philosophers, by contrast, hang in the void. Usually they are set against a solid black backdrop. The one conspicuous exception is the portrait of Michael Friedman, with an unreadable chalkboard diagram behind him. Their heads loom like planets in the depths of space. The camera registers the texture of skin and hair, the expression on the lips and in the eyes. Scarcely anything else enters the frame -- an earring, perhaps, or the neck of a sweater. Most of the subjects look right into the camera, or just to the side.\nWith Pyke, the thinker becomes, simply, a face. The effect is intimate, but also strangely abstract. The place and date of the photo session is indicated, but the book provides no biographical information about the subjects. I recognized about a quarter of them off the top of my head, such as Robert Brandom, David Chalmers, Patricia Churchland, Arthur Danto, Sydney Morgenbesser, Richard Rorty. A couple are even on TV from time to time. Both Harry Frankfurt and Bernard-Henri Levy have been on ""The Daily Show."" That two or three pages could not be found to list a couple of books by each figure is puzzling, although most of the portraits are accompanied by very brief remarks by the subjects on the nature or motivation of their work.\n“Philosophy is the way we have of reinventing ourselves,” says Sydney Morgenbesser. Ruth Millikan quotes Wilfrid Sellars from Science, Perception, and Reality: “The aim of philosophy, abstractly formulated, is to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term.” Fortunately not everyone is so gnomic. The comments by Jerry Fodor seem the funniest: “To the best of my recollection, I became a philosopher because my parents wanted me to become a lawyer. It seems to me, in retrospect, that there was much to be said for their suggestion. On the other hand, many philosophers are quite good company; the arguments they use are generally better than the ones that lawyers use; and we do get to go to as many faculty meetings as we like at no extra charge.”\nThe ambivalence in Sally Haslanger’s statement felt more than vaguely familiar: “Given the amount of suffering and injustice in the world, I flip-flop between thinking that doing philosophy is a complete luxury and that it is an absolute necessity. The idea that it is something in between strikes me as a dodge. So I do it in the hope that it is a contribution, and with the fear that I’m just being self-indulgent. I suppose these are the moral risks life is made of.” That sounds quite a bit like Sartre, actually.\nIn the interview prefacing the collection, Pyke says that his intention is to make philosophers “seem more human, less of a mystery.” And that is where the true conundrum lies. Some philosophers look dyspeptic, while others have goofy smiles, but that isn’t what makes them human -- let alone philosophers. Making something “more human” precludes rendering it “less of a mystery,” since the human capacity for thought is itself an ever-deepening mystery.\nPyke thinks visually. A more interesting commentary on the figures in his portrait gallery might come indirectly, from the late Gilbert Ryle. An Oxford don and the author of The Concept of Mind, he gave a lecture that tried to sort out the relationship between deep cogitation and various other sorts of mental activity. To that end, he focused on the question of what that naked guy in Rodin\'s sculpture was doing -- and how it presumably differed from, say, a professor preparing to teach a class.\n“The teacher has already mastered what he wants his students to master,” said Ryle. “He can guide them because he is on his own ground. But le Penseur is on ground unexplored by himself, and perhaps unexplored by anyone. He cannot guide himself through this jungle. He has to find his way without guidance from anyone who already knows it, if anyone does know it…. The teacher is a sighted leader of the blind, where le Penseur is a blind leader of the blind -- if indeed the very idea of his being or having a leader fits at all.”\nThat seems like a good description of what the subjects of Pyke\'s photographs spend their time doing. Not, of course, while the camera is turned on them. To judge by the expressions of some, their thoughts may have been something closer to, ""Wow, I\'m being photographed by someone from The New Yorker. How did that happen?""\nSearch for Jobs']"	['<urn:uuid:f81febf9-1570-414a-bbc5-7d84474b4951>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	9	82	1380
19	ancient stone bridge france compare vietnam	The Pont du Gard aqueduct in France and the Golden Bridge in Vietnam represent very different approaches to stone bridge construction. The Pont du Gard, built by ancient Romans, has survived for over 2,000 years and uses carefully cut stones held together mostly by their own weight, with mortar only in the top tier. In contrast, the Golden Bridge near Da Nang is a modern structure that, while designed to look like ancient stone in its supporting hands, features a golden walkway and was built just a few years ago as a tourist attraction. While both bridges are remarkable structures, they serve different purposes - the Pont du Gard was built as an aqueduct, while the Golden Bridge is a 500-foot pedestrian walkway designed to provide stunning views of the surrounding forest.	['Ever wonder why certain bridges are so transformative and perfect for their locations?\nIt’s because designers and engineers have found the ideal structural solution to span a body of water, valley, or roadway.\nIn this two-part series, we’ll look at:\n- The four most common types of bridges.\n- How they’re engineered.\n- The locations and situations they’re right for.\n- The benefits of each.\n- Iconic examples across the globe.\nArch bridges are among the oldest crossings on earth. They’re also some of the strongest. Instead of pushing forces downward, the weight of arch bridges is pushed outward along the arch to the structural supports on either end. These supports, called abutments, carry the load and prevent the ends of the bridge from collapsing outward.\nWhen arch bridges support their own weight and that of the vehicles, railroads, pedestrians, and other things that cross it, all parts of the arch are under compression. That’s why they must be built of materials that can withstand extraordinary forces.\nArch bridges typically span shorter distances because of the limited stress levels that arches are able to withstand. However, there are ancient examples that cross very long distances by using multiple arches and contemporary ones that leverage modern engineering techniques and materials to extend their length.\nThroughout history, different civilizations have used a variety of materials to make arch bridges strong, to great — and lasting — structural and aesthetic effect.\nThe Pont du Gard is an ancient arch bridge built of carefully cut and placed stones.\nThe ancient Romans used stone. One of the most famous examples of a stone arch bridge is the Pont du Gard aqueduct built by the Romans near Nîmes, France. It has survived more than 2,000 years. The builders used mortar to secure the stones together only in its top tier. Those in the lower levels are held together by careful cutting and positioning and the force of their own weight.\nThe New River Gorge bridge is an example of a modern-age arch bridge. It frames its natural environment in an elegant way.\nMore recently, steel and prestressed concrete have made it possible to build longer and more open arches. An example is the inspiring 1,700-foot span over the New River Gorge in West Virginia, which was completed in the late 1970s.\nThe Natchez Trace Parkway Bridge is a sleek yet cost-effective addition to its natural setting.\nAnother contemporary iconic arch bridge is the Natchez Trace Parkway Bridge in Franklin, Tennessee. It was opened to traffic in 1994 and was the first arch bridge in the United States to be built from segments of precast concrete, a highly economical material.\nDespite the cost-effectiveness of this structure, it’s an extraordinary addition to its natural environment. It features two graceful arches that support the roadway.\nMost arch bridges use vertical supports to distribute the weight of the roadway to the arch below. However, the Natchez Trace Parkway Bridge was designed without the supports, to create a lighter and more open structure. Instead, most of the load of the bridge sits on the arcs of the two arches, which have been slightly flattened to better carry it.\nOver the years, this structure has changed how engineers and designers think about arch bridges. It has helped bring these ancient structures into the future.\nBeam (or girder) bridges are the simplest, earliest, and most inexpensive of all bridges. In their most basic form, beam bridges have a horizontal structure that’s supported on either end by piers. The weight of the beam pushes straight down on the piers.\nA recreation of an ancient beam bridge over a stream in France.\nThe earliest examples were built from stones or wooden beams and supported by stream beds, which acted as piers, or by stone slabs or wood beams.\nToday, prestressed concrete is typically used to build beam bridges. This material is effective because the concrete withstands the forces of compression, while the embedded steel is able to resist the forces of tension. As referenced in the section above, concrete is one of the least expensive materials used to build bridges, which is one of the reasons beam bridges are so common.\nThe Lego Bridge has been camouflaged to look like it’s built using the popular children’s toy.\nThe Lego Bridge is a simple concrete beam bridge in the city of Wuppertal, Germany. In 2011, an artist repainted the bridge in the style of Lego bricks, proving that even the most utilitarian structures can bring joy to the people who cross it or drive under it.\nHistorically, the biggest limitation of beam bridges is that they typically can’t span long distances. As the supports that hold up the beam get farther apart, the less stable the bridge become. Because of this, the supports of beam bridges typically cannot be more than 250 feet apart.\nDespite the limitation, modern designers and engineers have found ways to use beam bridges to span longer distances. They simply connect several of them together.\nThe two sections of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway are made up of thousands of interconnected beam bridges.\nAn example of this is the world’s longest continuous-span beam bridge. The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in Louisiana is almost 24 miles long. It’s a pair of two-lane sections that run parallel to each other. The south-bound lane, finished in 1956, is made up of 2,243 separate beam bridge spans. The north-bound section, completed in 1969, includes almost 1,500 longer beam bridge sections.\nThere are also seven crossover lanes that connect the two main sections, which serve as pull-over bays for emergencies. The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway bridge leverages the minimalist profile of beam bridges to limit its impact on the natural environment.\nIn part two of this series, we’ll look at iconic examples of suspension and cable-stayed bridges.', '6 Most Unusual Bridges in the World\nFor as long as humans have been around, we’ve been using creative ideas and innovative building techniques to explore our surroundings. Often, that means creating ways to get across rivers, valleys, and canyons.\nBridges come in all shapes and sizes. Some have stood for centuries, like Greece’s Arkadiko bridge, crafted from stone in 1300 B.C. and still used today. Some of today’s bridges use amazing engineering techniques, while others look like beautiful works of art.\nHere are 6 of the world’s most unusual bridges.\n1. Helix Bridge\nSingapore’s Helix Bridge looks like a massive double helix rolling across the water’s surface. That’s because the bridge’s creators had the shape of human DNA in mind when they designed it.\nWith a span of 920 feet, this gorgeous bridge allows people to walk easily from one side of the river to the other. Viewing platforms are perfectly positioned along the walkway. It’s an ideal place to stop and take a few photos of the surrounding city.\nAt night, strips of LED lights turn the Helix Bridge into a giant, glittering jewel. The bridge is so beautiful that it’s become a popular destination for tourists and Singapore residents alike.\n2. Royal Gorge Bridge\nWould you be brave enough to walk across 1,260 feet of wooden planks hanging 950 feet above a river below? That’s exactly what visitors to the Royal Gorge Bridge ask themselves!\nBuilt-in 1929, this suspension bridge is the highest in the Western hemisphere. The bridge has two steel towers, more than 2,100 strands of wire cables, and spans a deep canyon 956 feet below. It’s been standing since 1929.\nThe walkway itself is made of more than 1,250 wooden planks. Each year, 26 million people visit the Royal Gorge Bridge… but we’re not sure how many of them are brave enough to walk across it.\n3. Millau Viaduct\nSpanning 8,071 feet across France’s Tarn River valley, the Millau Viaduct is a marvel of modern engineering. It’s the highest cable-stayed road bridge (a bridge held up by cables that cars can drive across) on the planet.\nIts towers soar more than 1,100 feet into the air, making this bridge taller than the Eiffel Tower and almost as high as the Empire State Building! The bridge is so tall that, on a foggy day, it’s impossible to see the valley below. Drivers on the bridge say it feels as though they’re cruising above the clouds.\nIt only took three years to build this incredible bridge. The designers of the Millau Viaduct had to come up with an entirely new technique to make it work. Unlike other cable-stay bridges, the towers were constructed first, before the roadway was laid in place.\n4. Chenyang Wind and Rain Bridge\nFor centuries, the Dong people of China’s Guangxi Province have constructed strong, sturdy bridges… without using any nails! These gorgeous covered bridges are topped by towers, porches, kiosks, and pavilions that are meant to offer shelter from the weather. That’s why they’re known as “wind and rain” bridges.\nAmong the most famous is the Chenyang Wind and Rain Bridge. Just over 213 feet long, the bridge spans the Linxi River. It’s made completely from wood and stone, without any nails or rivets.\nThe soaring pavilions — up to four stories high — sit on sturdy stone towers in the river. The Dong craftsmen were so good at making the wooden pieces fit together perfectly, that the bridge has been standing for more than 100 years.\n5. The Twist\nIs it a bridge? A building? A sculpture? The Twist is all three and more. Spanning the Randselva River in Jevnaker, Norway, this unique bridge is truly a work of art; part of the Twist’s interior space even houses an art gallery.\nThe bridge is located in the middle of a forest, and designers had to overcome several challenges, including different heights at each end of the bridge. Architects came up with a clever solution: Twist the entire bridge by 90 degrees.\nThat means when you walk through the bridge, the ceiling and floor switch places. At the twist, the ceiling flows down the wall to become the floor, while the floor stretches up the other wall to form the ceiling.\n6. Golden Bridge\nJust north of Da Nang, Vietnam lies one of the world’s most unique-looking bridges. The Golden Bridge stretches for 500 (golden) feet across a beautiful forest. But the most amazing part about this bridge is that it’s held up by two giant hands.\nWalking across this shimmering bridge is like entering your favorite fantasy novel. Though it’s just a few years old, the hands are crafted to look like ancient stone, carefully holding up a glittering golden thread. Adding to the fun, visitors take a cable car ride to climb slowly up the mountain to reach this magical bridge.']	['<urn:uuid:adf3592a-8426-4da4-8c40-fe05f6f94ceb>', '<urn:uuid:b0b22a71-0bdf-4acd-8bff-f951fe4c484b>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	6	132	1779
20	what ratio shows if stock expensive compared sales	The Price to Sales ratio (P/S ratio or PSR) measures how much an investor pays for a stock in relation to its revenues. It is calculated by dividing a company's market capitalization by its total sales. Generally, a P/S ratio below 1 indicates the company is undervalued, while a value above 4 suggests it may be overvalued. This ratio is particularly useful for evaluating startup companies that haven't yet generated significant profits.	['What do you understand the Price to Sales ratio?\nThe Price to sales ratio is a price multiple ratios that measure the price for an investor to invest in a stock of a company by observing its related revenue.\nIn a short firm, it is also called the P/S ratio or PSR. This ratio is a computed year to year basis, usually, twelve months, that is why is it also called the revenue multiple.\nThe price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is a kind of valuation ratio or price multiple ratios that compare a company’s stock price to its revenues.\nThe P/S ratio is calculated to divide the company’s market capitalization by its total sales over a specified period.\nAs a concern with per-share, this ratio is obtained by dividing the stock price by sales per share.\nThe P/S ratio is also popularly called as a “sales multiple” or “revenue multiple.”\nThe Price to Sales ratio is particularly helpful for valuing new start-ups companies that have high growth potential. Due to the newly formed company is not able to generate noteworthy profits until now.\nPSR is also a valuable tool to measures the companies in cyclical industries or temporary negative income, but viewing signals of revival.\nPrice to sales is a very basic and easy ratio to understand valuation for the investors. This ratio simply put in front of investors to understand how much they are ready to pay for a company in its most basic form.\nGenerating revenue by selling goods or services is the most basic operation of a company. On the other hand, this is a market perceives to be the per dollar value of a company’s revenue.\nGenerally speaking, all things considered equal, a lower value of price to sales ratio is measured constructive as it represents undervaluation.\nWhen the value of the PSR ratio is less than 1 then its good sign for the investors that the company is undervalued.\nWhen the value is above 4 is a caution sign that the company is overvalued.\nAdvantage of Price to Sales Ratio\n- It is an analysis and valuation instrument that gives information on how much investors are eager to pay per dollar of sales for that specific stock.\n- Sales manipulation is more important for management to earn more profit or book value.\n- In the case of new startups earnings may be negative although sales are never negative.\n- Sales can be more consistent than earnings.\n- P/S can be useful for analyzing companies with no earnings, are cyclical, or have reached maturity.\n- Stock return trends can be analyzed within the context of differences in P/S values.\n- A low value of this ratio implies that the stock is undervalued so good sign of investment.\n- While the ratio with a higher value than the average price indicates that the stock is overvalued.\nDisadvantage of P/S Ratio\n- P/S ratio is not able to care whether the company makes any earnings or whether it will ever make earnings.\n- While comparing with heterogeneous companies, this ratio cannot able to prove as well.\n- Unprofitable companies can also show sales growth.\n- PSR is not able to reflect the cost structure of a company.\n- Different companies can have different revenue generation and recognition policies.\n- P/S ratio does not account for debt loads or the status of a company’s balance sheet.\nThe most way for calculating the price to sales ratio is by dividing the market capitalization and sales into a per-share basis.\nYou can arrive at sales per share by dividing the company’s total sales over an assigned period of time by the average number of outstanding shares of the company.\nThe average number of outstanding shares represents the average of the opening and closing number of outstanding shares of a company over the assigned time frame.\nMarket Capitalization determines the total market dollar value of all the outstanding shares of the company.\nWe reach the point by multiplying the current market price of the firm’s share with the total number of outstanding shares of the company as on that date.\nTotal Sales in the above formula refers to the total sales of the company over a period of a given time frame.\nThis period can be either the previous financial year or a present year or sometimes even the forecasted sales for the next financial year that are called:\n- Last twelve months\n- Next twelve months\n- Trailing twelve months(TTM)\nBut the often-used signal is total sales over the past 12 months, commonly referred to as Trailing Twelve Months (TTM), and can be found in the income statement of the company.\nExample of P/S Ratio\nCompany X has reported its quarterly sales result for the Financial Year 2019 as follows:\nIts quarterly forecasted sales for the financial year 2020 as below:\nThe firm X has 100 million shares outstanding as on Dec 31, 2019. The firm’s shares are presently trading at $5 per share.\nWhat will be the P/S ratio for the years 2019 and 2020?\nBefore calculating the P/S ratio, we will have to calculate the following values like:\n- Calculate the total sales separately for each year\n- Calculate the sales per share separately for each year\nFirst calculate the total sales for each year.\nThe total sales for the year 2019 will be:\nFY 2019 = 100+110+115+125 = 450\nThe total sales for the year 2019 will be:\nFY 2019 = 125+140+155+165 = 585\nNow we can calculate the sales per share for each of the years:\n|Total Sales/ Number of shares outstanding||450/100||585/100|\n|Sales Per Share||4.5||5.85|\nNow putting Price to sales formula to calculate the ratio:\nAs you can see from the above example, the PSR of firm X is forecasted to improve significantly from 1.11 to 0.855. The reason behind this growth is projected sales growth of 30% in the year 2020.\nTo analyze the firm X’s stock is overvalued or undervalued, you require to compare it with the industry’s P/S ratio.\nSimply say, the industry’s P/S ratio is 1, then it can be concluded that firm X’s stock is trading at a premium valuation in 2019 but is expected to observe a fall in valuation in the year 2020.\nInterpretation and Analysis of Price to Sales Ratio\nThe Price to Sales Ratio works by measuring the company’s fairly estimated worth against its revenues.\nFor instance, if an investor wants to settle on whether to purchase shares in a start-up that is yet to turn profitable, he can take a gander at the P/S ratio to choose whether the company’s stock is exaggerated or underestimated.\nHe can do this by comparing the P/S ratio of the company with that of companies in the same industry. On the off chance that the industry’s P/S ratio is higher than that of the start-up, at that point it may merit investing in the share.\nP/S ratio is also a significantly important tool in situations where the use of the Price Earnings ratio (P/E ratio) probably won’t be very advantageous.\nFor instance, in an industry like FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods), the P/E ratio of most companies is very high.\nIn such cases, if investors take a gander at the P/E ratio as an indicator of valuation that would not provide the genuine picture.\nIn such cases, PSR could be a decent measure to see whether a particular FMCG stock is exaggerated or underestimated based on its revenues.\nPSR can also be useful in distinguishing turnaround situations. Say, a company has suffered a temporary setback and has not produced profits because of which share prices are at an unequaled low, a shrewd investor can use the company’s income as an indicator to measure its development, instead of its earnings.\nAlbeit very instinctive, PSR comes with its own set of limitations.\nPSR is not useful to compare companies across industries. Sales turnover probably won’t be a reasonable indicator for companies in specific sectors such as innovation and service where the per dollar income is a lot higher than what you may see in say, FMCG or construction companies.\nThe other increasingly important issue is with the P/S ratio itself. The ratio ignores two important money related wellbeing indicators – obligation and profitability.\nAs much as turnover is an important money related wellbeing indicator, a company’s definitive objective is to create profits.\nOn the off chance that a company keeps developing aggressively without creating profits over a sustained period, at that point it is essentially destroying investor riches. PSR completely ignores this factor.\nA company’s obligation is an important factor that needs to be considered while esteeming a stock.\nFor instance, on the off chance that you are comparing two companies (one utilized and the other unleveraged) with the same P/S ratio, at that point the unleveraged one is the more appealing option.\nThis is so because a utilized company may need to create higher sales than an unleveraged company to service its obligation.\nBecause of its limitations, one can presume that the investment decision should not be based on just this one measurement.\nA savvy investor should always use a wide scope of pertinent budgetary and valuation ratios and metrics to esteem a company’s stock price.']	['<urn:uuid:d9802ec3-a003-46e8-90eb-b65d237033ed>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	8	72	1542
21	risk assessment five steps cybersecurity	The five steps of risk assessment are: 1) Hazards identification through interviews and safety audits, 2) Definition of who may be harmed and how, 3) Evaluation of risks and deciding on precautions, 4) Recording findings and implementing them, and 5) Reviewing and updating the risk assessment periodically.	['Figure 1: Top 15 cyber threats (source: ENISA)\nAutomation and emergent cyber-security threats\nAutomation is the key factor that will be increasingly present in the factories of the future. By definition, automated systems are characterized by a set of software and hardware components that allows computer systems, network devices or machines to function without any manual intervention. Processes are completely automated with the help of control loops and special logic: these systems use several events as input and perform operations based on conditional decision-making and specific control logic. Therefore, operations can be performed without a human operator physically located at the site where the system is installed.\nThis type of systems is used in a wide range of applications, such as control and monitoring systems, data security applications, factory automation systems, automated message response systems, autonomous vehicles etc.\nThe rise in automation leads to significant advantages in economic and safety terms. Some of the benefits are the elimination of the risk of human errors, the improvement of user productivity, the development of standardized operations and a greater operations management. At the end of the processes, the accuracy and precision of the final job is even greater in most of the cases.\nA crucial issue of automated systems is without doubts the high security standards that these devices must guarantee; in fact, they are exposed to spam, virus and security threats, therefore they need a certain degree of protection. Regarding cyber security, threats against automation networks are indiscriminate, but they can carry potentially destructive results. Examples of attacks are network spoofing and denial of service which can cause the loss of process alarms and, indeed, potential serious safety issues which can cause damages to the system itself but also to the external environment (other systems, workers, etc.).\nAn example of a cyber threat against operation technologies that caused significant material, economic and reputational damages was the Stuxnet computer virus . It caused the destruction of the uranium enrichment centrifuges in IRAN through legitimate commands (syntactically and semantically correct) but incorrect for the functioning of the system. The purpose of the software was the sabotage of Iran’s Natanz nuclear power plant. In particular, the virus had to disable the centrifuges of the plant, preventing the detection of malfunctions and the presence of the virus itself.\nThe Stuxnet architecture is extremely complex with three large modules: a worm that damages PLCs and allows the software to self-replicate on other machines, a link that runs the copies created by the worm and a rootkit that hides the virus making it undetectable.\nTo be successful, a cyber-attack against an automated system must learn the information on the targeted plant and its operating methods. This information is acquired by the malware through sniffing operations that is passive interception of data passing through the network in a prolonged first phase in which operation is dormant. An example is Blackenergy3 which was found to be installed and dormant in some control systems of various American utilities for at least 5 years. Indeed, latency is a weakness for this type of attack as there is the possibility that the malware can be identified during normal verification operations, sometimes even fortuitously as recently occurred in Saudi Arabia where investigations to determine the causes of a fire caused the discovery of dormant malware (which had no implications for the fire).\nRisk Assessment as a countermeasure\nRisk Assessment is a methodology aimed at identifying hazards and risk factors that have the potential to cause harm (hazard identification), analyzing and evaluating the risk associated with that hazard (risk analysis, and risk evaluation), and determining appropriate ways to eliminate the hazard, or control the risk when the hazard cannot be eliminated (risk control). Indeed, Risk Assessment can represent a useful weapon against cyber-security threats as main tool for prevention.\nThe aim of the risk assessment process is to evaluate hazards, then remove that hazard or minimize the level of its risk by adding control measures, as necessary. By doing so, a safer and healthier workplace has been obtained. The goal is to try to answer the following questions: what can happen and under what circumstances? What are the possible consequences? How likely are the possible consequences to occur? Is the risk controlled effectively, or is further action required?\nAssessments should be done by a competent person or team of individuals who have a good working knowledge of the situation being studied. Include either on the team or as sources of information, the supervisors and workers who work with the process under review as these individuals are the most familiar with the operation.\nIn general, a risk assessment is developed following the five following steps :\nStep 1: Hazards identification\nHazards can be identified by using a high number of techniques: one of the most common remains interviewing operators and make safety audits and test on the examined systems. Moreover, database could be useful to carry out further analysis on external factors, e.g. identify most frequent cyber threats.\nStep 2: Definition of who may be harmed and how\nOnce hazards have been identified the hazards, the relative levels of risks must be evaluated. It is necessary to understand which component of the system can be damaged, which services can be affected and which level of business disruption could be caused by the cyberattack.\nStep 3: Evaluate the risks and decide on precautions\nOnce hazards have been identified, the step consists of the completely remotion of the associated risks. When it is not possible, then certain control measures should be put in place. A risk assessment matrix is one of the possible methods to quantitatively measure the level of risk and residual risks, but evaluation is growing more and more accurate through forefront methodologies, data analysis, modelling and AI algorithms.\nStep 4: Record findings and implement them\nSignificant findings should be recorded. These findings should include the hazards identified, the risk level estimated, the likelihood and potential impact of each threat, the potential mitigation effect of countermeasures etc.\nStep 5: Review risk assessment and update if necessary\nRisk assessment must be periodically reviewed and updated. Changes could be in terms of new equipment, substances, and or tasks, that have been introduced since the last assessment took place. In case of significant changes on past risk assessments, a new assessment is necessary to consider new hazards, as well as possible control measures that should be introduced.\nNew findings for Risk Assessment of Automated Systems\nThreats mitigation and the improvement of the security levels in the field of automated electronic systems is a widely discussed topic. As a consequence, several methodologies have been developed in order to implement a valid risk analysis in the best possible way. A first help for the identification and mitigation of risks affecting information and automated systems could be provided by software applications. For instance, applications could be designed for the use with a database containing historical data on errors and risks, as well as an approach based on risk assessment and neutralization. This allows excluding the most serious risks at the earliest stages of the life cycle of the information system, while focusing on those that are considered relevant for the examined system.\nBeing automated systems domain very broad, targeted methodologies have been developed to respond to needs of a certain sector. For what concerns Automated Driving (AD) systems, new concepts have been recently introduced, such as a state-of-the-art framework for cyber-security analysis, known as Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA). It quantifies the likelihood and the impact of attack and combines them in order to derive an attack risk value. A novelty that could be introduced is the bespoke integration of the impact calculation, which incorporates the notion of controllability of an attack by the AD system and/or by the driver . While, for instance, in the Robotic field researchers have proposed an “Attacker” model and they have confronted it with the minimal set of requirements that industrial robots should honour: precision in sensing the environment, correctness in execution of control logic, and safety for human operators. It has been demonstrated that the modelled attacker can subvert such requirements through the exploitation of software vulnerabilities, leading to severe consequences that are unique to the robotics domain .\nThe combination of all studies relating to risk assessment for the various automated systems are useful and crucial to the design of any system and the result will be a safer overall environment for the users to operate, as well as resilient and protected equipment to safeguard continuity of operations and economic value of assets.\n Josh Fruhlinger, “What is Stuxnet, who created it and how does it work? | CSO Online,” 2017. https://www.csoonline.com/article/3218104/what-is-stuxnet-who-created-it-and-how-does-it-work.html.\n Health and Safety Executive, “Risk Assessment: A Brief Guide To Controlling Risks In The Workplace,” Toxicol.

22	What role does technology play in both traditional art and virtual experiences, and what challenges do creators face in both fields?	In traditional art, the main technical challenge involves choosing the right materials - artists must select specific paints (like acrylics or oils) and surfaces that work best for each project and ensure longevity. In virtual reality, the technical challenges focus on equipment performance - the headset and computer must maintain minimal latency (under 20 milliseconds) between display and head movements, and achieve at least 60 frames per second to prevent discomfort and nausea in users.	['Art Mortimer didn’t exactly plan to become an artist; it was something he stumbled into. He was born in Long Beach, and he says he had a particularly normal childhood, with no real artistic influence.\n“My father was a college math and physics teacher, and my mother was a housewife,” he says. “I think living life, pretty much just the way it presented itself, led me into an exploration of feelings and emotions through representational art. Turns out there were a lot of artistic people in my parents’ families, including my two grandfathers, but I did not really experience that much through them.”\nAlthough he always admired artists and their interesting lifestyles, it was not until college that Mortimer realized he could be one.\n“I became an art major after a failed attempt at physics,” he explains. “In art-history classes, we learned about artists and their lives, and I always wanted to be like them– the guy in the garret in Paris with the smock, beret, goatee and the babes. But I did not think it was possible. Many years later I had matured enough and learned enough to believe that it was possible.”\nHe graduated from Occidental College in Eagle Rock, California, and has since become a freelance artist and art educator.\nMortimer paints scenes of everyday life; many of his acrylics are of beaches, bridges or piers. He is also known for his detailed murals, most of which are historic and representative of a certain city or surrounding areas.\nHe has painted close to 100 murals since 1971, and several of them having been displayed in newspapers, books and films in the United States and across the world.\nRecently, he completed a project that he calls “A Mural in a Weekend” in Twentynine Palms, California. He has also been working at Dodger Stadium, creating murals that celebrate memorable events in the history of the Los Angeles baseball team.\nIn painting, what is the biggest challenge you have faced?\nThe biggest challenge, of many, is the original concept. Particularly in a mural. Without that, all the other challenges are unattainable.\nDo you think about placement before you begin a project, or do you freestyle in the moment?\nI plan out where I am going. In a mural, I plan and design very carefully. In a painting, a rough outline and then let it evolve as it goes.\nIs there a special technique or theme that has become a staple of your art?\nIn murals: historical themes, and a collage approach. In paintings: the intersection between nature and the man-made.\nIs there a process in choosing the materials you will use for your paintings/murals?\nThrough experience, I know what works best for a mural in a specific situation to make the work go smoothly and to make the mural last as long as possible. But some mural projects require special or different materials, so that necessitates a research and learning process to find the best solution(s) for that project. For paintings, I like to work on canvas with paints I am familiar with.\nWhich mediums do you prefer to work with?\nFor murals, artists’ acrylic. For canvases, acrylics and oils.\nDo you prefer working alone or in groups?\nI prefer working alone, but on murals [I] often hire people to assist me to make the work go faster and easier.\nHow has your artwork developed over the years?\nBig question. Very complex answer. Every project or painting is a new challenge and requires me to try something I have never done before. So my work has gotten progressively more sophisticated and challenging– not to mention more complex and informed by all that experience.\nIs there a piece that you favor more than others?\nYes. Always. But it keeps changing, depending on how I feel about my latest projects.\nIs there anything you hope people can take away from your pieces?\nI hope, through my murals, to make people’s daily lives more enjoyable and richer. A historical and beautiful mural becomes part of people’s daily lives. That is a wonderful thing for me. With my paintings, I hope to be able to express feelings and emotions through depicting scenes that people can resonate with and feel a sense of communion with the world they live in and experience.\nIn what type of setting do you work best?\nAlone or with one or two others doing their own thing as well. Mostly outdoors, too.\nAre there any artists that influenced you?\nVan Gogh, Monet, Rembrandt, Toulouse-Lautrec, Winslow Homer, Maxfield Parrish, etc.\nHow has your art shaped who you are today, or who you want to be?\nArt has been the defining element in my life. I have pursued nothing much else, and it has allowed me to develop and expand the sensitivities to and awareness of the world and life around me that were always there. To experience the world through the eyes of an artist is a very profound experience.', 'Virtual reality offers experiences that are often rich in emotions. However, some users suffer from side effects that can be annoying to the point of totally ruining the experience. An update on these inconveniences that are often linked to motion sickness.\nCybersickness: the side effects of virtual reality\nMany users reported suffering from dry eyes or headaches, but most often nausea. These symptoms, now known as “Virtual reality sickness” or “Cybersickness,” are similar to those experienced by some people in transport.\nAccording to a study conducted by video game publisher Ubisoft, 45% of users acknowledged some discomfort during the experiment, and 6% admitted to having been particularly affected by these symptoms.\nThe reasons for nausea are known\nFor doctors, nausea experienced by some users has well-known origins. It is the same principle as kinetosis (motion sickness). Doctors explain that the brain can feel inconsistencies during a virtual reality experiment and its reaction is to cause nausea to indicate that something is wrong.\nMovement headset virtual reality nausea motion sickness\nIndeed, the visual information he receives does not correspond to the data coming from the balance. The brain sees that the body is moving or accelerating but does not feel this information from the inner ear, which is responsible for sending information about the body’s balance and movements. Also, there is often a slight discrepancy between the movements of the head and the images, disturbing the brain. Low resolution or low image display frequency can also contribute to these unpleasant symptoms.\nRecommendations of the experts\nExperts who have studied cybersickness have pointed out some areas for improvement. First, the equipment. The headset and the associated computer or smartphone must limit the time lag between the display of images and head movements. Scientists believe that latency of 20 milliseconds should be the maximum tolerable. They also recommend a display frequency of 60 frames per second or more.\nOn the software side, experts advise application developers to avoid sudden or erratic acceleration movements. Scientists have also realized that the amount of information on the screen is essential. Indeed, the more elements of the decor likely to attract the eye of the user, the more he does not know where to look, making him more sensitive to nausea. Giving the player fixed landmarks is also essential. For example, experts recommend leaving a dashboard exposed in a piloting simulation application.\nThe difficult case of lack of movement and acceleration\nAlthough the recommendations made above by the scientists partially correct some of the factors that can trigger nausea, the lack of correlation between the movements and accelerations visualized and those felt by the inner ear is not affected.\nFor this particular point, the most obvious solution is to use an armchair that reproduces the movements and accelerations reproduced on the screen. This technology exists and has even been used for years in some amusement parks. However, it is extremely costly and difficult to implement. However, researchers are working on another technology, simpler and cheaper, which uses a headset that sends electrical signals to the inner ear artificially reproducing movement and acceleration information. This technology is not yet fully developed.']	['<urn:uuid:3b841b70-ab46-41da-95af-c3f35e53e79d>', '<urn:uuid:1461d947-2ad5-48ba-8721-dfc7abde85d0>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	21	75	1352
23	I'm learning Buddhism. What are the basic moral rules to follow?	The five precepts are the basic ethical code for Buddhist laity: (1) Abstaining from taking life, (2) Abstaining from taking what is not given, (3) Abstaining from sexual misconduct, (4) Abstaining from false speech, and (5) Abstaining from fermented and distilled intoxicants which are the basis for heedlessness.	['The Five Precepts\nThe need to internalize ethical virtue as the foundation for the path translates itself into a set of precepts established as guidelines to good conduct. The most basic set of precepts found in the Buddha’s teaching is the pañcasila, the five precepts, consisting of the following five training rules:\n(1) Abstaining from taking life.\n(2) Abstaining from taking what is not given.\n(3) Abstaining from sexual misconduct.\n(4) Abstaining from false speech.\n(5) Abstaining from fermented and distilled intoxicants which are the basis for heedlessness.\nThese five precepts are the minimal ethical code binding on the Buddhist laity. They are administered regularly by the monks to the lay disciples at almost every service and ceremony, following immediately upon the giving of the three refuges. They are also undertaken afresh each day by earnest lay Buddhists as part of their daily recitation.\nThe precepts function as the core of the training in moral discipline. They are intended to produce, through methodical practice, that inner purity of will and motivation which comes to expression as virtuous bodily and verbal conduct. Hence the equivalent term for precept, sikkhapada, which means literally “factor of training,” that is, a factor of the training in moral discipline. However, the formulation of ethical virtue in terms of rules of conduct meets with an objection reflecting an attitude that is becoming increasingly widespread. This objection, raised by the ethical generalist, calls into question the need to cast ethics into the form of specific rules. It is enough, it is said, simply to have good intentions and to let ourselves be guided by our intuition as to what is right and wrong. Submitting to rules of conduct is at best superfluous, but worse tends to lead to a straightjacket conception of morality, to a constricting and legalistic system of ethics.\nThe Buddhist reply is that while moral virtue admittedly cannot be equated flatly with any set of rules, or with outward conduct conforming to rules, the rules are still of value for aiding the development of inner virtue. Only the very exceptional few can alter the stuff of their lives by a mere act of will.\nThe overwhelming majority of men have to proceed more slowly, with the help of a set of stepping stones to help them gradually cross the rough currents of greed, hatred, and delusion. If the process of self-transformation which is the heart of the Buddhist path begins with moral discipline, then the concrete manifestation of this discipline is in the lines of conduct represented by the five precepts, which call for our adherence as expedient means to self-transformation. The precepts are not commandments imposed from without, but principles of training each one takes upon himself through his own initiative and endeavours to follow with awareness and understanding. The formulas for the precepts do not read: “Thou shalt abstain from this and that.” They read: “I undertake the training rule to abstain from the taking of life,” etc. The emphasis here, as throughout the entire path, is on self-responsibility.\nThe precepts engender virtuous dispositions by a process involving the substitution of opposites. The actions prohibited by the precepts — killing, stealing, adultery, etc. — are all motivated by unwholesome mental factors called in Buddhist terminology the “defilements” (kilesa). By engaging in these actions knowingly and willingly we reinforce the grip of the defilements upon the mind to the point where they become our dominant traits. But when we take up the training by observing the precepts we then put a brake upon the current of unwholesome mental factors. There then takes place a process of “factor substitution” whereby the defilements are replaced by wholesome states which become increasingly more deeply ingrained as we go on with the training.\nIn this process of self-transformation the precepts draw their efficacy from another psychological principle, the law of development through repetition. Even though at first a practice arouses some resistance from within, if it is repeated over and over with understanding and determination, the qualities it calls into play pass imperceptibly into the makeup of the mind. We generally begin in the grip of negative attitudes, hemmed in by unskillful emotions. But if we see that these states lead to suffering and that to be free from suffering we must abandon them, then we will have sufficient motivation to take up the training designed to counter them. This training starts with the outer observance of sila, then proceeds to internalize self-restraint through meditation and wisdom. At the start to maintain the precepts may require special effort, but by degrees the virtuous qualities they embody will gather strength until our actions flow from them as naturally and smoothly as water from a spring.\nThe five precepts are formulated in accordance with the ethical algorithm of using oneself as the criterion for determining how to act in relation to others. In Pali the principle is expressed by the phrase attanam upamam katva, “consider oneself as similar to others and others as similar to oneself.” The method of application involves a simple imaginative exchange of oneself and others. In order to decide whether or not to follow a particular line of action, we take ourselves as the standard and consider what would be pleasant and painful for ourselves. Then we reflect that others are basically similar to ourselves, and so, what is pleasant and painful to us is also pleasant and painful to them; thus just as we would not want others to cause pain for us, so we should not cause pain for others. As the Buddha explains:\nIn this matter the noble disciple reflects: ‘Here am I, fond of my life, not wanting to die, fond of pleasure and averse from pain. Suppose someone should deprive me of my life, it would not be a thing pleasing or delightful to me. If I, in my turn, were to deprive of his life one fond of life, not wanting to die, one fond of pleasure and averse from pain, it would not be a thing pleasing or delightful to him. For that state which is not pleasant or delightful to me must be not pleasant or delightful to another: and a state undear and unpleasing to me, how could I inflict that upon another?’ As a result of such reflection he himself abstains from taking the life of creatures and he encourages others so to abstain, and speaks in praise of so abstaining.\nSamyuttanikaya, 55, No. 7\nThis deductive method the Buddha uses to derive the first four precepts. The fifth precept, abstaining from intoxicants, appears to deal only with my relation to myself, with what I put into my own body. However, because the violation of this precept can lead to the violation of all the other precepts and to much further harm for others, its social implications are deeper than is evident at first sight and bring it into range of this same method of derivation.\nBuddhist ethics, as formulated in the five precepts, is sometimes charged with being entirely negative. It is criticized on the ground that it is a morality solely of avoidance lacking any ideals of positive action. Against this criticism several lines of reply can be given. First of all it has to be pointed out that the five precepts, or even the longer codes of precepts promulgated by the Buddha, do not exhaust the full range of Buddhist ethics.\nThe precepts are only the most rudimentary code of moral training, but the Buddha also proposes other ethical codes inculcating definite positive virtues. The Mangala Sutta, for example, commends reverence, humility, contentment, gratitude, patience, generosity, etc. Other discourses prescribe numerous family, social, and political duties establishing the well being of society. And behind all these duties lie the four attitudes called the “immeasurables” — loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.\nBut turning to the five precepts themselves, some words have to be said in defense of their negative formulation. Each moral principle included in the precepts contains two aspects — a negative aspect, which is a rule of abstinence, and a positive aspect, which is a virtue to be cultivated. These aspects are called, respectively, varitta (avoidance) and caritta (positive performance). Thus the first precept is formulated as abstaining from the destruction of life, which in itself is a varitta, a principle of abstinence. But corresponding to this, we also find in the descriptions of the practice of this precept a caritta, a positive quality to be developed, namely compassion. Thus in the suttas we read: “The disciple, abstaining from the taking of life, dwells without stick or sword, conscientious, full of sympathy, desirous of the welfare of all living beings.” So corresponding to the negative side of abstaining from the destruction of life, there is the positive side of developing compassion and sympathy for all beings. Similarly, abstinence from stealing is paired with honesty and contentment, abstinence from sexual misconduct is paired with marital fidelity in the case of lay people and celibacy in the case of monks, abstinence from falsehood is paired with speaking the truth, and abstinence from intoxicants is paired with heedfulness.\nNevertheless, despite this recognition of a duality of aspect, the question still comes up: if there are two sides to each moral principle, why is the precept worded only as an abstinence? Why don’t we also undertake training rules to develop positive virtues such as compassion, honesty, and so forth?\nThe answer to this is twofold. First, in order to develop the positive virtues we have to begin by abstaining from the negative qualities opposed to them. The growth of the positive virtues will only be stunted or deformed as long as the defilements are allowed to reign unchecked. We cannot cultivate compassion while at the same time indulging in killing, or cultivate honesty while stealing and cheating. At the start we have to abandon the unwholesome through the aspect of avoidance. Only when we have secured a foundation in avoiding the unwholesome can we expect to succeed in cultivating the factors of positive performance. The process of purifying virtue can be compared to growing a flower garden on a plot of uncultivated land. We don’t begin by planting the seeds in expectation of a bountiful yield. We have to start with the duller work of weeding out the garden and preparing the beds. Only after we have uprooted the weeds and nourished the soil can we plant the seeds in the confidence that the flowers will grow healthily.\nAnother reason why the precepts are worded in terms of abstinence is that the development of positive virtues cannot be prescribed by rules. Rules of training can govern what we have to avoid and perform in our outer actions but only ideals of aspiration, not rules, can govern what develops within ourselves. Thus we cannot take up a training rule to always be loving towards others. To impose such a rule is to place ourselves in a double bind since inner attitudes are just simply not so docile that they can be determined by command. Love and compassion are the fruits of the work we do on ourselves inwardly, not of assenting to a precept. What we can do is to undertake a precept to abstain from destroying life and from injuring other beings. Then we can make a resolution, preferably without much fanfare, to develop loving-kindness, and apply ourselves to the mental training designed to nourish its growth.\nOne more word should be added concerning the formulation of the precepts. Despite their negative wording, even in that form the precepts are productive of tremendous positive benefits for others as well as for oneself. The Buddha says that one who abstains from the destruction of life gives immeasurable safety and security to countless living beings. How the simple observance of a single precept leads to such a result is not immediately obvious but calls for some thought. Now by myself I can never give immeasurable safety and security to other beings by any program of positive action. Even if I were to go on protest against all the slaughterhouses in the world, or to march against war continuously without stopping, by such action I could never stop the slaughter of animals or ensure that war would come to an end. But when I adopt for myself the precept to abstain from the destruction of life, then by reason of the precept I do not intentionally destroy the life of any living being. Thus any other being can feel safe and secure in my presence; all beings are ensured that they will never meet harm from me. Of course even then I can never ensure that other living beings will be absolutely immune from harm and suffering, but this is beyond anyone’s power. All that lies within my power and the sphere of my responsibility are the attitudes and actions that emanate from myself towards others. And as long as these are circumscribed by the training rule to abstain from taking life, no living being need feel threatened in my presence, or fear that harm and suffering will come from me.\nThe same principle applies to the other precepts. When I undertake the precept to abstain from taking what is not given, no one has reason to fear that I will steal what belongs to him; the belongings of all other beings are safe from me. When I undertake the precept to abstain from sexual misconduct, no one has reason to fear that I will try to transgress against his wife. When I undertake the precept to abstain from falsehood, then anyone who speaks with me can be confident that they will hear the truth; my word can be regarded as trustworthy and reliable even in matters of critical importance. And because I undertake the precept of abstaining from intoxicants, then one can be assured that the crimes and transgression that result from intoxication will never be committed by myself. In this way, by observing the five precepts I give immeasurable safety and security to countless beings simply through these five silent but powerful determinations established in the mind.\nSource: Taken and adapted from “Going for Refuge & Taking the Precepts”, by Bhikkhu Bodhi.

24	What are pregnancy nutrition requirements and fetal obesity risks?	Pregnancy nutrition requires 27mg iron, 600ug folate, 11mg zinc, 1000mg calcium, and 85mg vitamin C daily. Meanwhile, factors in the womb can influence obesity development, including maternal diabetes, being overweight/obese during pregnancy, and excessive pregnancy weight gain, which can program the child's metabolism toward obesity.	['I got this in an email this week, and Lisa okayed me putting the info here for you all.

What can help today’s children — and tomorrow’s adults — avoid obesity-related problems such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer? What can a mom do before and during pregnancy to help her child enjoy lifelong health? Research in our Division of Endocrinology is focused on finding answers in this important, emerging field.\nOur specialists are looking at fetal origins of disease. We want to know more about how metabolism is programmed, especially by abnormal conditions in the mother’s body. Creating a healthier environment for the short time in the womb may be easier than applying weight loss and exercise strategies throughout life.\nA Mother’s Body May Influence Her Child’s\nOur physician researchers want to tackle the burden of obesity from very early on for a child. Jami Josefson, MD, an attending physician in our Division of Endocrinology and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine has begun several related studies. In a pilot study on maternal body size and vitamin D levels, Dr. Josefson gathered information about the body fat of newborns, relating it to the amount of a nutritional element (vitamin D) in the blood of mothers and the umbilical cord of their newborns. Collaborating on this study was Craig Langman, MD, head of our Division of Kidney Diseases and the Isaac A Abt, MD, Professor of Kidney Diseases and Professor of Pediatrics at the Feinberg School.\nIn the MANNA Study (Maternal Nutrition and Newborn Adiposity) , Dr. Josefson is collecting information from mothers on their diet during pregnancy and measuring the body fat of newborns using the Pea Pod® Infant Body Composition System. The goal is to identify factors in the womb that influence development of body fat at birth.\nAt the Lurie Children’s Clinical Research Unit, Josefson is looking forward to meeting children and mothers in the Hyperglycaemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Follow Up Study. This study is looking at glucose metabolism and body fat in both moms and their children. Wendy Brickman, MD, attending physician, Endocrinology, and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at the Feinberg School is the Principal Investigator for the study at Lurie Children’s. Eight to 12 years ago, data was collected both nationwide and internationally on thousands of mothers and their newborn children. “It’s exciting for us to be part of this long-term, follow-up study. We’re expecting to bring back about 300 moms and kids,” said Dr. Josefson.\nFor Northwestern University’s MOMFIT study (Maternal-Offspring Metabolics: Family Intervention Trial), Dr. Josefson is working with a collaborative team of investigators on a randomized/control diet and lifestyle intervention trial for overweight and obese pregnant women. Dr. Josefson will gather information on the body fat of infants and toddlers of mothers enrolled in this study.\nDr. Josefson likes being able to help families break the cycle of obesity and insulin resistance. As a pediatric endocrinologist at Lurie Children’s, she counsels our team and families in her care. This subject is especially important today because so many women of childbearing age are overweight or obese. Their children face greater health risks as a result.\nAn Epidemic Fueled in the Womb\nFinding ways to prevent obesity requires big thinking. What is really fueling the obesity epidemic?\nLifestyle: Of course, what children eat (or are fed) and how active they are matters. But making these improvements may only be part of the solution to the problem.\nGenes: Inherited genes can be a factor. But the problem isn’t always an old defect in a family’s genes. The child’s genes might have adapted to conditions in the uterus.\nFetal origins: A child’s metabolism may be wrongly programmed by poor conditions in the mother’s body during the pregnancy.\nWe’re studying how conditions in the womb may program a child’s body toward obesity. Three conditions of concern are getting lots of attention, says Josefson:\nDiabetic effects during pregnancy: Does the mom have diabetes while she is pregnant? Does she have more glucose in her blood than is healthy for the developing fetus?\nPregnancy when overweight or obese: What happens when the mom starts the pregnancy at an unhealthy weight? What transfers to or changes in the fetus as a result?\nGaining too much weight when pregnant: What happens when the mother gains extra weight during the pregnancy? For example, how is the child’s metabolism changed or how is an organ, like the kidneys or liver, affected while it forms?\nSome diseases that we see in childhood and adulthood may have started not in the home, but in the womb. Conducting further research about these conditions gives us new avenues to protect children from obesity and its complications.']	['<urn:uuid:e5f9f012-f610-4ae7-ade9-564fd98afc78>', '<urn:uuid:07e8a0fa-74c3-4dd6-ba74-dab02d6ceca2>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	9	45	1387
25	What's the highest frequency at which the computer's Real Time Clock can reliably generate interrupts on most machines?	On most machines, the RTC interrupt rate cannot go higher than 8 kHz.	"['A typical OS will use the APIC or PIT for timing purposes. However, the RTC works just as well. RTC stands for Real Time Clock. It is the chip that keeps your computer\'s clock up-to-date. Within the chip is also the 64 bytes of CMOS RAM.\nIf you simply want information about reading the date/time from the RTC, then please see the CMOS article. The rest of this article covers the use of RTC interrupts.\nThe RTC is capable of multiple frequencies. The base frequency is pre-programmed at 32.768 kHz. It is possible to change this value, but this is the only base frequency that will keep proper time. For this reason, it is strongly recommended that you NOT change the base frequency. The chip also has a ""divider"" register that will generate other frequencies from the base frequency. The output (interrupt) divider frequency is by default set so that there is an interrupt rate of 1024 Hz. If you need an interrupt frequency other than 1024 Hz, the RTC can theoretically generate 15 interrupt rates between 2 Hz and 32768 Hz. On most machines however, the RTC interrupt rate can not go higher than 8 kHz.\nProgramming the RTC\nRTC interrupts are disabled by default. If you turn on the RTC interrupts, the RTC will periodically generate IRQ 8.\nAvoiding NMI and Other Interrupts While Programming\nWhen programming the RTC, it is important that the NMI (non-maskable-interrupt) and other interrupts are disabled. This is because if an interrupt happens, the RTC may be left in an ""undefined"" (non functional) state. This would usually not be too big a deal, except for two things. The RTC is never initialized by BIOS, and it is backed up with a battery. So even a cold reboot may not be enough to get the RTC out of an undefined state! See the NMI page for more information about disabling and enabling it, and the effects of it.\nSetting the Registers\nThe 2 IO ports used for the RTC and CMOS are 0x70 and 0x71. Port 0x70 is used to specify an index or ""register number"", and to disable NMI. Port 0x71 is used to read or write from/to that byte of CMOS configuration space. Only three bytes of CMOS RAM are used to control the RTC periodic interrupt function. They are called RTC Status Register A, B, and C. They are at offset 0xA, 0xB, and 0xC in the CMOS RAM. To write 0x20 to Status Register A you would do this:\ndisable_ints(); // important that no interrupts happen (perform a CLI) outportb(0x70, 0x8A); // select Status Register A, and disable NMI (by setting the 0x80 bit) outportb(0x71, 0x20); // write to CMOS/RTC RAM enable_ints(); // (perform an STI) and reenable NMI if you wish\nOther bytes of the CMOS RAM are used by the RTC for other functions, or by the BIOS and other such services.\nSince the IRQ number is 8, it has a lower priority in the PIC than the IRQs with lower numbers. While those other interrupts are being handled (until your OS sends an EOI and STI), your OS will not receive any clock ticks. Any IRQ handlers that depend on clock ticks may fail for that reason, because an IRQ of higher number will not preempt an IRQ of lower number.\nTurning on IRQ 8\nTo turn on the periodic interrupt, all you have to do is:\ndisable_ints(); // disable interrupts outportb(0x70, 0x8B); // select register B, and disable NMI char prev=inportb(0x71); // read the current value of register B outportb(0x70, 0x8B); // set the index again (a read will reset the index to register D) outportb(0x71, prev | 0x40); // write the previous value ORed with 0x40. This turns on bit 6 of register B enable_ints();\nThis will turn on the IRQ with the default 1024 Hz rate. Be sure that you install the IRQ handler before you enable the RTC IRQ. The interrupt will happen almost immediately.\nChanging Interrupt Rate\nChanging the output divider changes the interrupt rate, without interfering with the RTC\'s ability to keep proper time. The lower 4 bits of register A is the divider value. The default is 0110b, or 6. The setting must be a value from 1 to 15. A value of 0 disables the interrupt. To calculate a new frequency:\nfrequency = 32768 >> (rate-1);\n""Rate"" is the divider setting. If you select a rate of 1 or 2, the RTC will have problems and ""roll over"" so that it generates interrupts of .81 mS and 3.91 mS, rather than the expected interrupts of 61.0 uS or 30.5 uS. So, the fastest rate you can select is 3. This will generate interrupts of 8 kHz or 122 uS. To change the rate:\nrate &= 0x0F; // rate must be above 2 and not over 15 disable_ints(); outportb(0x70, 0x8A); // set index to register A, disable NMI char prev=inportb(0x71); // get initial value of register A outportb(0x70, 0x8A); // reset index to A outportb(0x71, (prev & 0xF0) | rate); //write only our rate to A. Note, rate is the bottom 4 bits. enable_ints();\nInterrupts and Register C\nIt is important to know that upon a IRQ 8, Status Register C will contain a bitmask telling which interrupt happened. The RTC is capable of producing a periodic interrupt (what this article describes), an update ended interrupt, and an alarm interrupt. If you are only using the RTC as a simple timer this is not important. What is important is that if register C is not read after an IRQ 8, then the interrupt will not happen again. So, even if you don\'t care about what type of interrupt it is, just attach this code to the bottom of your IRQ handler to be sure you get another interrupt.\noutportb(0x70, 0x0C); // select register C inportb(0x71); // just throw away contents\nYou could use just the RTC and not use the PIT (the RTC is easier to program in my opinion). My favorite use is to use the RTC for my main kernel clock (controls scheduling and all), and then use the PIT to provide a more accurate wait() function, that can operate on timescales of micro-seconds.\nSome RTC timer code may not work on some real machines. I have only found about one out of 5 computers that does not work right. The observed problem is a timer tick happened about once every second. I\'m not sure why this is, and am trying to find a solution. The machine I observed this on was a 2005 or so Dell (which also has issues USB booting...)']"	['<urn:uuid:f452dd72-fef6-41b8-a0eb-8d440e43fc44>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	18	13	1105

These laws include:\nDLP ensures all data is kept safe within protection compliance laws and will take action to keep software safe when a potential breach is detected. DLP also offers other features that help to ensure data cannot be accessed by unauthorized people, while also giving organizations more visibility into their operations.\nDLP works with data loss prevention software that monitors data to help ensure it isn’t at risk of landing in the wrong hands, deliberately or otherwise. Data can be monitored at multiple locations such as in the cloud and at end-user points. When a potential breach is detected the data loss prevention software reacts. This typically includes alerts or encryptions that will make the data indecipherable.\nDLP software also provides reports that identify potential weaknesses in data loss prevention software processes. The reports ensure that organizations are keeping within the laws and regulations regarding DLP.\nDLP software is beneficial to businesses in several ways that can be broken down into 3 main categories:\nLosing sensitive data can be detrimental to any organization. There’s the potential for losing information that could be used by competitors to their benefit. If you lose sensitive data that belongs to customers then your reputation could be harmed which could cause you to lose customers. DLP software helps to prevent your data from being used against you and keeping your brand reputation intact.\nCompanies that hold sensitive data are bound by law to keep that data safe. Having DLP software installed can help companies to comply with these laws. Not only can DLP software help to prevent loss of data, it can also produce DLP reports for auditing purposes. These reports can demonstrate that the appropriate security measures are in place. The reports can also identify potential weaknesses in data loss prevention software and protocols that might otherwise be exploited.\nAn organization can learn a lot by tracking how data is being used within their organization. It might reveal individuals who are misusing the data, for example, allowing the company to act accordingly. It could also give valuable insights into how data is being used in your company.\nThe DLP market is expected to expand from around $1.64 billion in 2021, to $2.28 billion in 2023. Some of the reasons for this expected increase include:\nCloud computing is growing. More cloud-based platforms are being developed all the time, increasing their functionality and appeal. Some of the largest organizations on the planet are adopting cloud technology, along with countless smaller businesses. This means a lot more data that needs protecting, increasing the demand for DLP.\nData breaches are becoming increasingly frequent as more people look to access data – sometimes for illegal purposes. Some of the world’s biggest organizations have experienced data breaches, making it increasingly important that all data is protected with the most effective data loss prevention software available. DLP provides effective data loss prevention against all kinds of data breaches, including the most sophisticated hackers in the world.\nAs platforms develop, data that is increasingly valuable is accessed and used across the internet. Not only does sensitive data include things like your customers’ personal details, but also information on business methodologies and pricing models that competitors could use to their advantage.\nHackers are always on the lookout for vulnerabilities that could be exploited, so data loss prevention processes need to evolve simultaneously. DLP helps organizations keep up with changing compliance regulations to avoid penalties.\nChief Information Security Officers (CISOs) are taking a more prominent role in the workplace as businesses get up to date with technology. DLP gives CISOs the tools and information they require to do their job effectively and report to the CEO.\nAs internet-based systems become more functional, more data needs to be protected. DLP plays a valuable role in data protection because it supports keeping data safe. DLP provides more than barriers that keep data safe but also reports that ensure all protocols are compliant. Data loss prevention software also monitors for potential weaknesses in software and procedures.\nCompanies have a growing need to understand how data is being used, internally and externally. DLP provides valuable reports that give organizations a clearer picture of how their data is utilized, potentially giving them insights that enhance their business operations. DLP systems also provide more features as they evolve which makes them more valuable to the organizations they service.\nThese DLP industry safe practices should be put into action to maintain the integrity of your data:\nThere are 4 main DLP employment architectures that can be put in place. These are:\nEach DLP architecture type is designed to meet different objectives. For the best results, you establish what you hope to gain from using DLP software. Protecting your data is the most obvious objective, others include complying with regulations and gaining more visibility.\nThere are numerous data security solutions to choose from, with varying strengths and weaknesses. For maximum protection, choose a data loss prevention solution that is most relevant for your needs. This makes it necessary to evaluate all the data loss prevention software options that are available.\nFor DLP systems to be effective, you need to know which roles and responsibilities your employees have. You will need to know who should have access to what data, and put checks and balances in place to ensure that processes are followed. Roles and procedures should also be regularly evaluated to offer continuous protection of your data.\nDefine which metrics will tell you how successful the adoption of your DLP program is. Develop KPIs that can be shared with senior management to help highlight successes and potential gaps. Monitor your KPIs regularly and act on them whenever they identify room for improvement.\nDLP software incorporates some of the most advanced online security tools and features available. It helps keep your data safe by preventing accidental or criminal loss of data that could be very costly for your organization. DLP software offers insights into your organization’s personnel and operations and ensures that your organization remains legally compliant.

27	programs offered british columbia nature society	Northwest Wildlife Preservation Society offers three main programs: Indoor Wildlife Workshops, Nature Walks & Workshops, and Youth Environmental Leadership programs. These programs are offered year-round.	['Through engaging education and stewardship programs, Northwest Wildlife Preservation Society introduces British Columbians to the wonders of the natural world to encourage understanding of and an enduring respect for wildlife in the Pacific Northwest. Our three main programs are Indoor Wildlife Workshops, Nature Walks & Workshops, and Youth Environmental Leadership programs. All programs are offered year-round. Thanks to our generous corporate and foundation grantors and individual donors, programs are free of charge to inner-city school children and youth, as well as other at-risk/disadvantaged/marginalized groups to ensure everyone is given an equal opportunity to understand their interconnected relationship with wildlife and the importance of protecting it. For groups more fortunate, we request a modest honorarium to help cover our costs. We work with all kinds of groups including but not limited to public and private school classes, First Nations groups, summer camps, youth groups, boy/girl scouts, retirement homes, and new immigrants.\nIndoor Wildlife Workshops\nLearn about wildlife in these engaging workshops tailored to groups of any age, from preschoolers to seniors.\nWith twelve program topics to choose from, these highly interactive hour-long sessions are a wonderful way to learn about the incredible biodiversity we are blessed with in British Columbia. Program topics include Bats, Bears, Wolves, Owls, Wildcats of BC, Marine Wildlife, Temperate Rainforest, Wildlife of BC, Endangered Species, Climate Change, Reptiles & Amphibians, and Salmon of the Pacific.\nFor school groups, the content is created in line with the curriculum to enhance the topics currently being studied in class. All the programs are designed around principles of interactive education and include ample opportunity for group discussion and engaging hands-on learning. This teaching style is facilitated by the use of biofacts like animal skulls, antlers, and animal mounts (ie bats and owls), helping students connect better with the topic and seeing for themselves physical characteristics and clues to animal diets and behaviour.\nUnlike exposure to similar artifacts in a museum or with live animals, by using biofacts we can encourage participants to learn by touching and examining the biofacts closely without stressing out a live animal. We also use various forms of technology including awe-inspiring photography and video as well as audio recordings of animal vocalizations. Using diverse learning tools is complimented by interactive demonstrations, educational games and activities that make learning both exciting and memorable.\nThanks to our generous donors, these workshops are offered free of charge to inner city schools and disadvantaged groups. For those more fortunate we ask for a modest honorarium to help cover our costs. The honorarium is $100/group throughout the Greater Vancouver Regional District. For program requests outside of GVRD, please contact us for pricing.\nNature Walks & Workshops\nOur Nature Walks & Workshops provide first-hand experience learning about wildlife during a full-day outdoor class and field workshop in a regional park. Participants are engaged in discussions about natural history, wildlife behaviour, animal adaptations, biodiversity, threats to the environment and solutions to these issues. Learning about wildlife in this setting allows people to use all of their senses to understand the environment and to become connected with the natural world that surrounds them.\nIncreased stress on our natural world has resulted in a growing need for environmental education and activities that work with nature instead of against it. Children especially are becoming more disconnected from their environment, particularly in large cities where many natural spaces are fragmented, bordered by busy roadways and not easily accessed by public transportation. Due to this separation, many community residents are unaware of the impacts their actions have on wildlife. Our programs offer students the opportunity to get acquainted with their environment. Connecting them with the incredible biodiversity we are so fortunate to have here in British Columbia is pivotal for inciting a passion for preservation in our future generation of leaders.\nThis program is predominantly offered to inner-city school classes thanks to the generous funding support from our corporate and foundation partners, as well as our amazing group of individual donors. All costs including the school bus to transport students are taken care of. Please inquire for more information if you are interested in booking a program. Note this program is in very high demand and often has a wait-list.\nYouth Environmental Leadership Programs\nThe Youth Environmental Leadership program is innovative, extensive and hands-on. It provides youth aged 9 to 14 the opportunity to participate in real conservation work, which they design and lead under the guidance of our program instructor. Students learn how important healthy habitats are to the sustainability of many threatened plant and animal species as well as to the entire ecosystem of which we’re all a part. For example, they learn how conserving and restoring wild habitats can help mitigate the effects of climate change, as well as provide sanctuary to various wildlife species that have previously been extirpated from an area.\nOur programs are inclusive and provide opportunities to kids with all types of learning abilities. Students acquire and enhance many skills related to biology, environmental science, ecology and chemistry. It also promotes healthy, active living as students are walking outdoors and completing physical activities for a good cause.\nThanks to our generous donors, these programs are offered free of charge to inner city schools and disadvantaged groups. Please inquire for more information if you are interested in booking a program. Note this program is in very high demand and often has a wait-list.']	['<urn:uuid:e9d487f5-2479-46b3-80d3-234c92a14272>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	6	25	900

These range from temporary artworks in streets to established displays which have lasted over decades.\nA leisurely stroll along the riverbanks of Barham and Koondrook will allow you to marvel at statues carved out of Redgum. These chainsaw carvings exhibit exceptional\ncraftsmanship and provide a wonderful narrative drawing on the stories of our great pioneers and those of our local animals. The trail commences at Riverside Park in Barham\nand finishes in the main street of Koondrook, you can pick up a map at the newsagency on Noorong Street in Barham.\nThe ARTback sculptures lie along the Long Paddock Touring Route, which follows the stock route along the Cobb Highway. This route stretches from Echuca-Moama on the Victorian border, through to Wilcannia and onto the iconic outback towns of Bourke, Broken Hill & White Cliffs. There are eleven major public artworks along the route, reflecting the heart and soul of our small rural communities.\nA series of timber sculptures lie along the Long Paddock Touring Route, which follows the stock route along the Cobb Highway. These sculptures are designed to pay tribute\nto the significant economic and social contribution of the timber industry to the region, with timber cutters and barge masters depicted along the way. This route stretches from\nEchuca-Moama on the Victorian border, through to Wilcannia and onto the iconic outback towns of Bourke, Broken Hill and White Cliffs.\nThe Moama and Echuca Botanic Gardens are located central to Moama at the Moama Recreation Reserve, Perricoota Road, Moama. The Gardens are situated next to the Moama Adventure Playpark and the sporting facilities of the Moama Recreation Reserve.\nThe Gardens began as a community idea to enhance the Recreation Reserve. Now fully supported by Murray River Council, and volunteers, they are a serene and peaceful space surrounded by play and sporting facilities.\nAn ongoing project designed by Landscape Architect Mr Chris Dance, the Gardens feature indigenous plantings and are contemporary, unique, water wise and Riverina themed. Three stages have been completed : the formal entrance garden with a boardwalk and lake, the Settlers Garden and Dry Billabong. The recent addition of a statue, La Belle Helene 2, by sculptor David Maughan adds significant interest and value to the Gardens.\nThe Friends of Moama Echuca Botanic Gardens Inc are committed to continue to work with Murray River Council to implement the designer\'s plan, stage by stage.

There is so much to see under one roof. To help get your bearings, here are some Borghese Gallery artworks you definitely must lay eyes on during your visit.\nThat means, if you have to skip the rest, you have at least covered the top gems that this museum has to offer.\n- 1 Artwork at Borghese Gallery and Museum – How Many Rooms and Floors Is in Borghese Gallery?\n- 2 10 Galleria Borghese Sculptures\n- 3 5 Wall and Ceiling Paintings at Borghese Gallery\n- 4 The Borghese Gallery Mosaics\n- 5 Get Tickets For Famous Artworks In Borghese Gallery Museum\n- 6 Location and How to Get There\n- 7 Opening Hours And Best Time To Visit\n- 8 FAQs\n- 9 Conclusion\nArtwork at Borghese Gallery and Museum – How Many Rooms and Floors Is in Borghese Gallery?\nSpread across two floors, the Borghese Gallery artworks, located in the Villa Borghese, are held in 20 different rooms.\nYou’ll need to bring your comfortable walking shoes for a trip to this museum!\nLet’s check out all of the amazing pieces, from Borghese figurines to sculptures and paintings in this guide.\nA lot of the pieces represented in this article are so impressive that we have individual full-length guides about them on this site.\n10 Galleria Borghese Sculptures\nThe museum is pretty big, and 20 rooms of Borghese gallery artwork soon becomes overwhelming!\nWe have selected the best pieces, starting with sculptures, to help you on your way.\n1. David – Gian Lorenzo Bernini\nOther famous sculptures of David – including the renowned one by Michelangelo – show David just after his victory over Goliath.\nBut Bernini’s piece on display in the Borghese Gallery shows him mid-flow in action. Just about to raise his sling to kill the bad giant, this stunning piece created in 1623 shows David in motion and is truly a must-see, standing at 170cms high.\nBernini’s artwork at the Galleria Borghese is a masterpiece!\n2. Apollo and Daphne – Gian Lorenzo Bernini\nBernini surely knocked out some gems. The next must-see Gallery Borghese sculpture is another one of his works.\nCommissioned by Cardinal Scipione Borghese, it stands right in the center of one of the rooms in the museum. Apollo and Daphne is placed there strategically, as the statue has been made to be able to view it from any angle, so it makes for a stunning focal point.\nIt stands at 95 inches (243 centimeters) high and was completed in 1625.\n3. Venus Victrix – Antonio Canova\nA statue that shows no other than Napoleon Bonaparte's sister is sure to be worth a look.\nLounging on the couch, she echoes the goddess Venus. Bonaparte’s sister Pauline was married to Camillo Borghese, who took it upon himself to commission the sculpture in 1805 so that we can see what she looked like to this day!\n4. The Rape of Proserpina – Bernini\nNumber 4 for a masterpiece that stands in Room 4 in the museum (The Room of the Emperors).\nThe Rape of Proserpina by Pluto is a stunign masterpiece, most notably for the way that Bernini was able to make the hard cold marble look like soft flesh.\nLook at the part of the sculpture where Pluto's hands are grasping Proserpina’s flesh – it is truly remarkable.\n5. Bust of Cardinal Borghese – Bernini\nYou’ll find this sculpture of the late Cardinal Borghese by Cardinal Scipione commissioned for himself (being the extremely modest man that he was).\nIt is a very lifelike sculpture – you can almost hear him talking – but this artwork is dedicated to the man that is the founding father of the impressive Borghese Gallery Artworks.\n6. Sleeping Hermaphroditus – Bernini (copy)\nThis fascinating sculpture by Bernini is actually a copy of the real one that is to be found in the Louver.\nBut it is still pretty interesting. Hermaphrodites were a popular subject in the Hellenistic times, but for us the most interesting part is that Bernini managed to make cold stone marble look like a soft and comfy mattress on which to sleep!\n7. Statuettes of Black Hunters – Campi\nThe statuettes are found in the Stanza del Gladiatore, the hunters are both holding birds of prey. One has a dog at his feet, the other one has a lion.\nIt is generally accepted that the statues were commissioned to be placed together, as they are both looking in the same direction. They were completed in 1650 by Campi.\n8. Marcus Curtius Throwing himself into the Chasm – Bernini’s father – Bernini!\nLegend has it that Marcus Curtius threw himself into a huge hole that had opened up in the Roman Forum after a massive earthquake in a bid to save the city.\nIt worked, and the hole closed up around him. He sacrificed his life to save Rome. This relief/sculpture was created by another Bernini – Pietro. He is the father of our other beloved Gian Lorenzo Bernini.\n9. Candelabrum – Unknown from the 2nd Century AD/ restored by Antonio D’Este\nYou usually see the older artworks and sculptures on display in the Vatican museums, but the Borghese Galleries also have their fair share.\nOne such piece is this interesting 2nd Century AD sculpture. This was actually recreated in the 19th century using parts of the original and more modern additions. It is a hark back to the ancient with a modern twist.\n10. Aeneas, Anchises, And Ascanius – Bernini\nThis sculpture is located in room VI of the Borghese Gallery and depicts Aeneas and her flight out of Greece with her father into exile in Italy.\nLegend has it that her lineage eventually leads to Romulus, the founder of Rome. So whilst this sculpture is one of Bernini’s least known works, it is no less of an important one for the locals.\n5 Wall and Ceiling Paintings at Borghese Gallery\nPaintings too feature heavily on display amongst the Galleria Borghese Artworks.\nLet’s check out the top 5 wall and ceiling paintings in this amazing museum.\n1. The Deposition – Raphael\nThis is another very famous piece of art on display amongst the Galleria Borghese artworks.\nShowing Jesus following His removal from the cross on the way to the tomb, it was commissioned after the death of Atalanta Baglioni’s son in the early 16th century.\nAnd eventually made its way into the hands of Cardinal Scipione Borghese and is on display as part of an altar in the Borghese Gallery.\n2. Sacred and Profane Love – Titian\nCreated in 1514 this Renaissance painting draws curiosity from all who view it.\nOne clothed woman and one nude sit on a fountain, and a baby is crawling on the fountain in the background.\nIt is the subject of much debate as to what the meaning of the painting actually is. However, it is generally believed that the painting was commissioned by a local councilor to celebrate his new marriage.\nThe lady on the left, clothed, is thought to represent marriage, with the nude on the right perhaps representing Venus, the goddess of love.\n3. Young Sick Bacchus – Caravaggio\nCaravaggio's Young Sick Bacchus is amongst some amazing artwork at the Borghese Gallery and Museum. But it needs to be seen to be believed. The painting is teeming with symbolism.\nFor example, it was painted when Caravaggio wasn’t feeling great himself in 1593, and art commentators call out the grapes in his hand that show signs of decay, compared to the ripe and plump fruit sitting on the counter.\n4. Susanna and the Elders – Peter Paul Rubens\nThe Biblical story of Susanna comes to life in this stunning painting. Susanna is innocently taking a bath, when some dirty old men come to spy on her.\nIn the Bible story, the men are eventually put to death because they accused her of adultery. In the Rubens artwork from 1607, Susanna can be seen being surprised by the men, who are encouraging her to remain silent.\n5. Danaë – Correggio\nThe King of Argos daughter Danae is on display here. In Greek mythology, she had been imprisoned in a golden tower and was eventually rescued by Jupiter.\nThe painting shows the exact moment that angels and Jupiter come to her rescue. The painting was completed in 1531 and became known as one of the first mannerist styles of painting.\nThe Borghese Gallery Mosaics\nThe Borghese Gallery Mosaics are a collection of 5 impressive mosaics brought to the museum by Cardinal Scipione and are one of the most amazing features of the museum.\nThe Gladiator Mosaics\nLocated in the Salone of the Galleria Borghese these different mosaic scenes were uncovered at a different location in 1834 and transferred to the museum.\nThe story of gladiator fights is told across several scenes, with the name of each Gladiator shown beside them.\nInterestingly, you can also tell who died in the fight, and which Gladiators became victors. Those who won have a little “vic” beside their name.\nGet Tickets For Famous Artworks In Borghese Gallery Museum\nBe careful when visiting the Borghese Galleries!\nTickets are limited and are only offered for certain time slots.

29	Being interested in trout fishing, I'm wondering how upstream water protection affects Montana's trout populations. What's the connection between headwaters and trout survival?	Trout in Montana depend directly on cool, clean flows from upstream headwaters. Protecting upstream waters and wetlands is a key mechanism for protecting Montana's downstream blue ribbon trout fisheries. However, some parts of EPA's proposal could limit trout protections under the Clean Water Act by categorically exempting certain types of water.	['Last Friday we joined Waterkeeper Alliance in submitting these technical comments to the Environmental Protection Agency concerning its proposed, revised rules defining the jurisdiction of the federal Clean Water Act.\nWe support the Proposed Rule to the extent that it maintains protections for Traditionally Navigable Waters (“TNWs”), Interstate Waters, and Territorial Seas. Additionally, we support the agencies’ and the Science Advisory Board’s (“SAB”) work to document the “significant nexus” between these historically regulated waters and tributaries and adjacent waters. We agree that all of these waters (including headwaters, intermittent streams, ephemeral streams, and adjacent waters) are connected to downstream waters that are covered under the CWA, and that they should be categorically protected.\nAt the same time, we are greatly concerned by, among other things, the agencies’ decision to narrow the class of tributaries and impoundments that have been historically given categorical protection, the agencies’ removal of the broader interstate commerce grounds for protection of tributaries, adjacent waters and “other waters,” and the addition of new categorical exclusions for waters that have been covered historically and which can have a significant impact on downstream water quality.\nAmong other things, our technical comments urge the agencies to leave in place all portions of the existing WOTUS definition that have not been invalidated by the Supreme Court, to remove new definitions and other language that limit jurisdiction in a manner not supported by law or science, remove categorical exclusions that are not supported by law or science, and to rely on all valid jurisdictional tests for categorically protecting waters to the full extent permissible under the Commerce Clause. While we agree that waters with a “significant nexus” to TNWs, Interstate Waters and Territorial Seas should be jurisdictional, we do not agree that these are the only “other” waters that should be protected under the CWA.\nA strong, scientifically-grounded new rule is particularly important to clean water protections and restoration efforts in SW and West-Central Montana because, as a headwaters region, a substantial proportion of waterways are intermittent, ephemeral, constitute ditches, and/or are hydrologically linked to groundwater. In particular, ditches are an important water vector in Montana, regardless of whether they are manmade or scientifically natural tributaries, and therefore we strongly argued that EPA’s new rule should clarify that ditches are categorically covered by the CWA when they otherwise meet the definition of a “water of the United States,” including specifically a tributary.\nFurthermore, fully extending CWA protections to upstream waters benefits Montana’s fisheries! Our trout depend directly on cool, clean flows from upstream headwaters. Unfortunately, some parts of EPA’s proposal could limit trout protections under the Clean Water Act by categorically exempting certain types of water. That’s one key reason why we submitted our technical comments urging EPA to use proven science in determining appropriate, upstream and headwater protections. Protecting upstream waters and wetlands is a key mechanism for protecting Montana’s downstream blue ribbon trout fisheries!\nAs the only organization dedicated exclusively to protecting and improving water quality in SW and West-Central Montana, we rely directly on sound science and protections grounded in the federal Clean Water Act. A strong, scientifically-grounded rule that properly protects Montana’s waters (including headwaters, intermittent streams, ephemeral streams, tributary ditches and adjacent waters) is key to our unique outdoors culture, rural traditions, and strong local communities!']	['<urn:uuid:98eb0044-3a7e-4554-8bbb-163d9364d94d>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	23	51	549
30	autocad attribute properties list	AutoCAD Attribute objects have several properties including: Alignment, Layer, Backward text direction, Entity transparency, Field length, Text height, Insertion point, Invisibility status, Lock position, Object name, Oblique angle, Preset status, Rotation, Scale factor, Style name, and Verification status.	"['In my previous article I discussed AutoCAD Block objects and other related objects related to the AutoCAD Block class. In that article I also briefly introduced Block atrributes. Now, in this article, I mainly focus on the AutoCAD Attribute class.\nI am using the pyautocad module for this article, but I can also use communication modules such as pythoncom, and win32com.\nWhat is an AutoCAD Attribute object?\nThe AutoCAD Attribute object is basically a meta-data that describes the characteristics of an AutoCAD object. For example, it can describe the characteristics of AutoCAD Block objects.AttributeReference is the object class containing text that characterizes some AutoCAD block object.\nAs I have already explained in one of my previous articles covering AutoCAD Block objects the AutoCAD Block is an element of the BlockCollection class. To use AutoCAD Block object I have to create an instance of a specific block in my drawing. The resulting object is a BlockReference instance.\nSimilarly, an AutoCAD AttributeRefrence object is an instance of the Attribute class.\nIn daily working activities such as e.g. tagging entities, creating drawing labels and annotations, notations for a particular object, viewport setting adjustments, etc. I will need attributed AutoCAD Block objects.\nTherefore, understanding the various AutoCAD Attribute related commands is of great importance.\nAutoCAD Attribute object properties\nIn this section I will discuss some of the important properties of Attribute objects. Besides that, I would like to point out that all the properties that are apply to Attribute objects apply to AttributeReference objects too.\nI have used the same example for this practice as I have already used in my previous AutoCAD Block article. I recommend that you check out that blog post for comprehensive understanding of the AutoCAD Block class.\nfrom pickle import TRUE from pyautocad import Autocad, APoint, aDouble acad = Autocad(create_if_not_exists=True) ip = APoint(0, 0, 0) b1 = acad.doc.Blocks.Add(ip, ""Attributed_Block_1"") pl = b1.AddPolyline(aDouble(0, 0, 0, 10000, 0, 0, 10000, 5000, 0, 0, 5000, 0, 0, 0, 0)) l = b1.AddLine(APoint(0, 250, 0), APoint(10000, 250, 0)) l = b1.AddLine(APoint(5000, 250, 0), APoint(5000, 0, 0)) #0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 .... 10 a1 = b1.AddAttribute(50, 0, ""DATE"", aDouble(200, 100, 0), ""DATE"", ""Date: 17/07/2022"") a2 = b1.AddAttribute(50, 0, ""DWG"", aDouble(5200, 100, 0), ""DWG"", ""Drawing Name: Drawing 1"") a2.MTextAttribute=True br = acad.model.InsertBlock(APoint(50, 50, 0), ""Attributed_Block_1"", 1, 1, 1, 0) print(""Does the Block contain any Attributes: "", end="""") print(br.HasAttributes)\nNow, I can see that a reference to the AutoCAD Attributed Block has been created in my document.\nBelow I demonstrate the properties of the Attribute object and the AttributeRefrence object that I created.\n#General Properties print(""Attribute alignment: "", end="""") print(a1.Alignment) print(""Layer of attribute: "" + a1.Layer) print(""Is the direction of text backward?

False Object name: AcDbAttributeDefinition Oblique angle of the object: 0.0 Is the attribute preset? False Rotation of object: 0.0 Scale factor for the object: 1.0 Style name of the attribute object: Standard Is the attribute set for verification: False\nSimilarly, there are some other properties that define the attribute name, attribute content, and type of text. And so on. See the code and program output below.\n# multiline text / text properties if(a2.MTextAttribute==True): print(""Attribute content: "" + a2.MTextAttributeContent) print(""Boundary width of multiline text: "", end="""") print(a2.MTextBoundaryWidth) print(""Multiline text direction: "", end="""") print(a2.MTextDrawingDirection) print(""Prompt string of an attribute: "" + a1.PromptString) print(""Tag string of the attribute: "" + a1.TagString) print(""Text string of the attribute: "" + a1.TextString) print(""Alignment point of the text: "", end="""") print(a1.TextAlignmentPoint) print(""Attribute text generation flag: "", end="""") print(a1.TextGenerationFlag) O/p: Attribute content: Drawing Name: Drawing 1 Boundary width of multiline text: 0.0 Multiline text direction: 5 Prompt string of an attribute: DATE Tag string of the attribute: DATE Text string of the attribute: Date: 17/07/2022 Alignment point of the text: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) Attribute text generation flag: 0\nAs I show in above code there is a property for multiline text that returns the value of text direction. It has five possible return values in the form of integers. Those options are as follows:\n- acBottomToTop: 1\n- acByStyle: 2\n- acLeftToRight: 3\n- acRightToLeft: 4\n- acTopToBottom: 5\nMethods of the AutoCAD Attribute class\nSome methods of the Attribute and AttributeReference class are similar to other methods of other AutoCAD object classes. I list some of the important methods below:\nI demonstrated the use of the AutoCAD Attribute, AttributeReference, and AttriburtedBlock classes. Obviously, the most important thing is implementing this information in our day-to-day life to automatize repetitive and costly tasks in an effort to increase productivity.

31	I'm fascinated by old Chinese movies. Which is older - wuxia films or A Touch of Zen?	Wuxia films significantly predate A Touch of Zen. The earliest wuxia films date back to the 1920s, with films like 'Lady Swordfighter of Jiang-Nan' (1925) and 'Red Heroine' (1929). In contrast, A Touch of Zen was released in 1971 and was directed by King Hu as part of the later evolution of the wuxia genre.	['please visit http://neopangaia.com – adult mmo / virtual planet earth\n|Part of the Wikipedia series on\nChinese martial arts\n|List of Chinese martial arts|\n|view â¢ talk|\nWÇxiÃ¡ (traditional Chinese: æ¦ä¿ ; simplified Chinese: æ¦ä¾ , Mandarin IPA: [wÃ¹ÉiÉÌ], Cantonese Pinyin: mou5 hap6), literally meaning “martial (arts) heroes”, is a distinct quasi-fantasy sub-genre of the martial arts genre in literature, television and cinema. WÇxiÃ¡ has figured prominently in the popular culture of Chinese-speaking areas since ancient times to the present, and the most important writers have devoted followings.\nThe wÇxiÃ¡ genre is a blend of the philosophy of xiÃ¡ (ä¿ , “honor code”, “an ethical person”, “knight-errant”), and China’s long history in wÇshÃ¹ (“kung fu” or “martial arts”). A male martial artist who follows the code of xiÃ¡ is called a swordsman, or xiÃ¡kÃ¨ (ä¿ å®¢/ä¾ å®¢). Japan‘s samurai bushidÅ traditions, Western Europe‘s knight chivalry traditions, and America‘s gunslinger Western traditions all share some aspects with China‘s swordsman xiÃ¡ traditions. The swordsmen in wÇxiÃ¡ need not serve a lord or hold any military power and they are not required to be from an aristocratic class, although some are.\nWuxia stories have their roots in some early yÃ³uxiÃ¡ (æ¸¸ä¾ , “Chinese knight-errant“) and cÃ¬kÃ¨ (åºå®¢, “assassin”) stories around 2nd to 3rd century BC, such as the assassination attempts of Jing Ke and Zhuan Zhu (å°è«¸/ä¸è¯¸) listed in Sima Qian‘s Records of the Grand Historian. In the section entitled “Assassins” (åºå®¢åå³/åºå®¢åä¼ ), Sima Qian outlined a number of famed assassins in the Warring States who were entrusted with the (then considered noble) task of political assassination. These were usually cÃ¬ kÃ¨ (åºå®¢, literally “stabbing guests”) who resided in the residences of feudal lords and noblemen, rendering services and loyalties much in the manner of Japanese samurai. In another section, “Roaming Xia” (æ¸¸ä¿ åå³/æ¸¸ä¾ åä¼ ), he detailed many embryonic features of the xia culture of his day. This popular phenomenon continues to be documented in historical annals like The Book of Han (æ±ä¹¦) and The Book of Later Han (å¾æ¼¢æ¸/åæ±ä¹¦).\nXiÃ¡kÃ¨ stories made a strong comeback in the Tang dynasty in the form of Chuanqi (å³å¥/ä¼ å¥, literally “legendary”) tales. Stories like Nie Yin Niang (è¶é±å¨/èéå¨), The Slave of Kunlun (å´å´å¥´/æä»å¥´), Jing Shi San Niang (èåä¸å¨), Red String (ç´ ç·/çº¢çº¿) and The Bearded Warrior (è¬é«¯å®¢) served as prototypes for modern wuxia stories, featuring fantastic, out-of-the-world protagonists, often loners, who performed daring heroic deeds.\nThe earliest full-length novel that could be considered part of the genre was Water Margin, written in the Ming Dynasty, although some would classify parts of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms as a possible earlier antecedent. The former was a political criticism of the deplorable socio-economical state of the late Northern Song Dynasty, whilst the latter was an alternative historical retelling of the post-Han Dynasty‘s state of three kingdoms. Water Margin’s championing of outlaws with a code of honor was especially influential in the development of Jianghu culture. Three Kingdoms contained many classic close combat descriptions which were later borrowed by wuxia writers.\nMany works in this vein during the Ming and Qing dynasties were lost due to prohibition by the government. The ethos of personal freedom and conflict-readiness of these novels were seen as seditious even in times of peace and stability. The departure from mainstream literature also meant that patronage of this genre was limited to the masses and not to the literati, and stifled some of its growth. Nonetheless, the genre continued to be enormously popular, with certain full-length novels such as The Strange Case of Shi Gong (æ½å ¬æ¡å¥è/æ½å ¬æ¡å¥é») and The Romance of the Heroic Daughters and Sons (å å¥³è±éå³/å¿å¥³è±éä¼ ) cited as the clearest nascent wuxia novels. Justice Bao stories seen in San Xia Wu Yi (ä¸ä¿ äºç¾©/ä¸ä¾ äºä¹, which was later extended and renamed Qi Xia Wu Yi ä¸ä¿ äºç¾©) and Xiao Wu Yi (å°äºç¾©/å°äºä¹) incorporated much of social justice themes of later wuxia stories.\nThe modern wuxia novel genre started in the early 20th century. The early 20th century and the 1960s to 1980s are often regarded as two golden ages of wuxia writing.\nWuxia fiction was banned by the Chinese Communist Party when they came to power in the People’s Republic of China. (The ban was lifted in the 1980s, with China’s liberalization.) As a result wuxia writing continued in earnest only in 1960s in Taiwan and especially Hong Kong, headed by pioneers Liang Yusheng and Louis Cha, who founded the ‘new school’. Writing serially for papers and magazines, they incorporated many fictional techniques from the West. Although Cha declared the genre effectively dead in the 1990s, its fiction is facing a resurgence, as seen in the sci-fi wuxia novels of Huang Yi and countless amateur Internet writers.\nTheme, Plot and Settings\nThe modern wuxia stories are basically adventure stories set in ancient China. Plot differs largely from writer to writer, but there are very clear similarities with wuxia protagonists and those of the modern Western fantasy genre. The fantasy element is not a prerequisite; it is possible for wuxia fiction to be largely realistic, such as Louis Cha‘s Swordswoman Riding West on White Horse or The Book and the Sword. But as the genre requires, some, perhaps most, of its characters should know martial arts.\nA common plot typically features a young male protagonist in ancient China, who experiences a tragedy (e.g. the loss of a family or an old master) and goes through exceeding hardship and arduous trials to learn. Eventually the protagonist emerges as a supreme martial arts master unequalled in all of China, who then proffers his skills chivalrously to mend the ills of the “Jianghu” world.\nAnother common thread would involve a mature, extremely skillful hero with an equally powerful nemesis with whom he has had misgivings, and the storyline would meander to a final showdown between the protagonist and his nemesis.\nOther novels, especially those by Gu Long, create detective-type and romance stories in the setting of ancient China.\nThe Code of Xia\nTo understand the concept of xia from a Western perspective, consider the Robin Hood mythology: an honourable and generous person who has considerable martial arts skills which he puts to use for the general good rather than towards any personal ends, and someone who does not necessarily obey the authorities.\nForemost in the xia’s code of conduct are yi and xin, righteousness and honour, which emphasize the importance of gracious deed received or favours (æ© Än) and revenge (ä» chÃ³u) over other ethos of life. Nevertheless, this code of the xia is simple and grave enough for its adherents to defend for.\nThe Use of Wushu\nAlthough wuxia is based on true-life martial arts, the genre elevates the mastery of this art to fictitious levels of attainment. Combatants have the following skills:\n- Kung fu. Fighting using a codified sequence of movements known as zhÄo (æ), based on actual Chinese martial arts.\n- Use of objects such as sewing needles, ink brushes, benches, abaci, or musical instruments as weapons with unfailing accuracy. The sword, staff, and spear weapons are still the most commonly used by combatants.\n- Use of qÄ«nggÅng (T: è¼å S: è½»å), or the ability to move swiftly and lightly, allowing them to scale walls, glide on waters or mount trees. This is based on real Chinese martial art practices. Real life martial art exponents practise qinggong by going through years of attaching heavy weights onto their legs. Its use, however, is greatly exaggerated in wire-fu movies where practioners appear to circumvent gravity.\n- Use of nÃ¨ijÃ¬n (å §å) or nÃ¨ilÃ¬ (å å), which is the ability to control mystical inner energy (qi) and direct it for attack, defense, healing, or to attain superhuman stamina.\n- Use of diÇnxuÃ© (T: é»ç©´ S: ç¹ç©´) through dim mak (é»è), chin na (ææ¿), or other related techniques for killing, paralyzing, poisoning, or controlling opponents by hitting or seizing their acupressure points (xuÃ© ç©´) with a finger, knuckle, elbow or weapon. Real life martial artists train in these seizing and paralyzing techniques. Their effectiveness is greatly exaggerated in wuxia stories.\nThese skills are usually described as being attainable by those who devote themselves to diligent study and practice. The details of the most powerful skills are often to be found in manuals known as mÃ¬jÃ (ç§ç¬). In some stories, specific techniques can be learned by spending several years either in seclusion with a master or cloistered with the Buddhist monks at a Shaolin temple.\nJiang Hu: “The World of Martial Arts”\nJiang Hu (æ±æ¹) (Cantonese: Gong Woo), literally means “rivers and lakes” and is translated as “The World of Martial Arts” or “the martial (arts) world”.\nThe Jiang Hu is a “shared world“, an alternate universe, made up of martial artists and pugilists gathered in wulin (æ¦æ), usually congregrating in sects, clans, disciplines and schools of martial arts learnings. It is inhabited by wandering knights and princes, thieves and beggars, priests and healers, merchants and craftspeople. The best wuxia writers draw a vivid picture of the intricate relationships of honor, loyalty, love and hatred between individuals and between communities in this milieu.\nA common aspect to jiang hu is the tacit suggestion that the courts of law are dysfunctional. Differences can only be resolved by way of force, predicating the need for xia and their chivalrous ways. Law and order is maintained by the alliance of wulin or wulin mengzhu, the society of martial artists. They are elected and commanded by the most able xia, who is usually (but not always) the protagonist of that novel (in some versions, such as the TV miniseries Paradise, the position is hereditary). This alliance leader is an arbiter, who presides and adjudicates over inequities and disputes. He is a de jure chief justice of the affairs of the jiang hu.\nAlthough new and original wuxia writings have dwindled significantly in the last twenty five years, particularly so as patronage and readerships of the genre decimated due to the readily available alternatives in entertainment like DVDs, affordable gaming-consoles and so forth, the genre has proliferated in kinds in comic strips in places like Hong Kong and Taiwan, with the core essentials of the wuxia living on in weekly editions equivalent of the Japanese manga comic books.\nThe earliest wuxia films date back to the 1920s. Films created by King Hu and Shaw Studio featured sophisticated action choreography using wire and trampoline assisted acrobatics combined with sped up camera techniques. The storylines in the early films were loosely adapted from existing literature.\nCheng Pei-Pei and Jimmy Wang-Yu were two of the biggest stars in the days of Shaw Studio and King Hu. Cantonese screen idol Connie Chan Po-chu grew up starring in wuxia films and was famous for her male roles. Jet Li is a more recent star of wuxia films, having appeared in the Swordsman series and Hero amongst others. Yuen Woo Ping was a choreographer who achieved fame by crafting stunning action-sequences in films of the genre. Mainland Chinese director Zhang Yimou‘s foray into wuxia films was distinguished by the imaginative use of vivid colours and breathtaking background settings.\nWuxia was introduced to the Hollywood studios in 2000 by Ang Lee‘s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Following Ang Lee‘s footsteps, Zhang Yimou made Hero, targeted for the international market, in 2003, and House of Flying Daggers in 2004. American audiences are also being introduced to wuxia through Asian-television stations in larger cities, which feature well-produced miniseries such as Warriors of the Yang Clan and Paradise, often with English subtitles. With complex, almost soap-opera storylines, lavish sets and costumes, and veteran actors in pivotal roles, these tales can appeal to a variety of audiences.\nSignificant wuxia films include:\n- Lady Swordfighter of Jiang-Nan (1925) serial starring Chin Tsi-ang\n- The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple (ãç«çç´ è®å¯ºã1928) â early wuxia film\n- Red Heroine (1929); revenge-themed 13-film serial starring Fan Xuepeng \n- Ru Lai Shen Zhang (ãå¦ä¾ç¥æã1964) â starring Cho Tat Wah and Yu So Chow\n- Dragon Gate Inn (ãé¾é¨å®¢æ ã1966) â King Hu wuxia\n- A Touch of Zen (ä¿ å¥³ 1971) King Hu wuxia\n- The Magic Blade (ãå¤©æ¶¯ææåã1976) â Shaw Brothers wuxia\n- Zu – Warriors from the Magic Mountain (ãæ°èå±±åä¿ ã1983) â A Tsui Hark Film;\n- The Legend of Condor Heroes (ãå°éè±éä¼ ã1983) â serial starring Barbara Yung\n- A Chinese Ghost Story (ãå©å¥³å¹½éã1987)\n- Swordsman II (ãç¬å²æ±æ¹ä¹æ±æ¹ä¸æã1992) â the high water mark of 90s wuxia pian\n- The Bride with White Hair (ãç½é«®éå¥³å³ã1993) â A Ronny Yu Film;\n- Ashes of Time (ãä¸éªè¥¿æ¯ã1994) â A Wong Kar-wai Film;\n- Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (ãå§èèé¾ã2000) â An Ang Lee Film; Hollywood wuxia\n- The Legend of Zu (ãèå±±ä¼ ã2001) â A Tsui Hark Film;\n- Hero (ãè±éã2002) â A Zhang Yimou Film; Movie set at time of Qin Shi Huang with Jet Li as Nameless.\n- House of Flying Daggers (ãåé¢åä¼ã2004) â A Zhang Yimou Film; A movie starring Takeshi Kaneshiro and Ziyi Zhang\n- Kung Fu Hustle (ãåå¤«ã2004) â A Stephen Chow Film; A parody of wuxia\n- The Promise (ãæ æã2005) â A Chen Kaige Film; A movie based on the wuxia story “The Slave of Kunlun”\n- Seven Swords (ãä¸åã2005) â A Tsui Hark Film; Adapted from wuxia author Liang Yusheng‘s novel\n- Curse of the Golden Flower (ãæ»¡åå°½å¸¦é»éç²ã2006) â A Zhang Yimou Film; A movie starring Gong Li and Chow Yun-Fat\n- The Banquet (ãå¤å®´ã2006) â A Feng Xiaogang Film; A movie starring Zhang Ziyi and Daniel Wu\nWuxia novels constitute a highly popular genre of their own throughout Greater China, Singapore and Chinese speaking communities around the world.

Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon did almost zero for me, but I once had an incredibly weird trailer for Master of the Flying Guillotine, and was delighted to catch up with the whole demented movie. Criterion’s blurbs present King Hu’s A Touch of Zen as one of the treasures to be found among classy Hong Kong and Taiwanese martial arts epics.

The stranger also prowls around a doctor-apothecary who sells medicines from a booth in the square. While taking care of his mother, Gu comes in contact with an equally mysterious woman, Yang (Hsu Feng), who has taken up residence in a ‘haunted’ ruin and has a habit of disappearing at a moment’s notice. More investigation reveals that representatives from the East are searching for Yang and the doctor, who are actually survivors of an unjust enemies purge at the Emperor’s court. Several years ago Yang’s father was tortured to death and his entire family sentenced to die. Yang escaped with two loyal generals and was saved from imperial patrols by a group of monks. But now they have been found and an entire army is on the way. Gu is not a fighter like Yang and her comrades, but he fancies himself an amateur military strategist. He advises the group on when and how to ambush their enemy, and suggests a novel way of getting an advantage: use the reputation of the haunted ruin to frighten the Emperor’s troops.\nWelcome to the special Asian martial arts genre called wuxia. Director King Hu’s approach and style to epic action adventure is so Western-friendly that little or no adjustment is needed for newbie viewers. The basic story is simple enough, and there’s no necessity to remember dozens of names and faces, as sometimes is the case with traditional Japanese historical fantasies. Hu has terrific instincts for direction and a traditional approach to blocking out his scenes — we’re never at a loss for what is happening, where we are, or what our immediate surroundings are. This is important for a film with long passages without dialogue, especially in the first half.\nIn building his initial mystery, King Hu adopts the basic subjective camera technique of Alfred Hitchcock. As Gu follows the stranger through town, and seeks the elusive mystery woman that attracts him so, Hu alternates shots of Gu’s curious face and precise trucking shots representing what he is seeing. The interesting surroundings and Gu’s likeable personality do the rest. King Hu’s narrative skill is such that a full hour passes before the first real action scene, which comes as a big surprise to our cultured hero. Gu has no idea that the quiet Yang is actually a blazingly fast swordfighter, and moves to protect her against an aggressive intruder. Yang instead steps forward, produces hidden weapons and engages the stranger in a running battle, vaulting between buildings and clashing on a bridge above a garden. We’re just as dazzled as is Gu.\nA Touch of Zen uses standard flashbacks to fill in the story, elegant dissolves shift us in and out of different time frames, such as one from a campfire to a row of misty mountains. It doesn’t matter that the characters aren’t deep, as their externalized personalities are fascinating. We’re always watching their reactions to see when they’ll detect danger. A calm scene will be interrupted by a Leone-like close-up of giant eyes darting to one side. Yang and her two fighting confederates strike heroic poses, and turn their heads as one to react to an approaching foe. King Hu’s precise camerawork uses trucking shots that emphasize the warriors’ instinctively fine-tuned motions, starting and ending camera motions in perfect cadence with the characters.\nPerhaps what makes Hu’s action scenes so special is that they are constructed like old American Musicals — it’s not ‘real’ combat, but the kind of Peking Opera whirling-dervish fighting that substitutes dynamic, ‘cool’ moves for realism. I hope that the slightly sped-up action is what’s making it all look so dangerous, as accidental sword-actor contact seems almost unavoidable. Lightning-fast blade slashes basically fan the air in front of Yang’s face. Simple hand-blocks stop what should be crushing blows. Heroes and villains alike toss thin iron mini-lances in groups of three, while archers shoot arrows in groups of three. Arrows shot full force are swatted away like they were tossed twigs. Yet the high intensity of the fights — the reactions, the editing, the visual elegance — makes all the CGI-enhanced light saber-ing in Star Wars look tame.\nAlso amusing are the yellow-clad monks, fighters that can hold off more than twice their number of armed soldiers despite carrying no weapons. It has to be magic: they can stop sword blades with a well timed two-finger pinch, block hammer blows with their fingers and send foes flying insensible with a flick of a wrist. Do their super-duper skills come from all that meditating? The leader talks like Yul Brynner crossed with an aloof poet.\nThe loosey-goosey physics in these battles serve mainly to make them more exciting, as in old American westerns wherein fist-fighters exchange scores of kayo punches and neither party receives more than a light bruising. Some use is made of wire rigs, but Yangang and others often bound across rooms, leap through windows and hop through gardens with the aid of hidden trampolines. Again, it all seems derived from the aesthetic of comic books and musical choreography: it’s an action fantasy, not a historical document. If it looks exciting and dynamic, who cares if it’s not ‘real?’ We worry not about who will survive, but about what will happen between the unlikely couple Gu and Yang. Will Gu shake off his scholarly reserve and participate in the fighting? The two share a great ‘instant heat’ romantic night in the empty fort. Will they fall in love, or will Yang tell us that her life is now dedicated to fighting for justice?\nKing Hu’s visual taste and judgment are impeccable. His shots are beautifully framed. The movie will frequently pause for us to take in a few stunning images of nature or the overgrown fort, before forging ahead with its story points. Three hours later, it all seems over much too soon.\nWe’re told that A Touch of Zen was originally shown in two parts, over a year apart. That might explain the under-performance of part two. Only three years later was it was revived at a film festival and given a new exhibition and critical life.\nThe Criterion Collection’s Blu-ray of A Touch of Zen looks great. It was mastered from a 4k restoration done in Italy and funded by the film’s star Hsu Feng, in honor of the great King Hu. The picture is rich and colorful, with only a few scenes (or shots, really) betraying some source issues. We do notice things that weren’t removed, such as a scene that had dirt on the lens. Also, one must simply accept that King Hu’s anamorphic lenses have severe distortion issues. In pan shots across rooms and distant scenery, the image w a R p s like a barrel. I suppose the distortion could be neutralized digitally, but after a few scenes I thought the effect gave the picture character, as if it were meant to be projected on a curved screen.\nStars Hsu Feng and Shih Chun are still with us, and both look terrific in new interviews from Criterion disc producer Curtis Tsui. Their memories make A Touch of Zen seem even more of an accomplishment: the show took three full years to film. We learn about King Hu’s earlier career with the Shaw Brothers, before leaving Hong Kong to produce and direct on his own in Taiwan. The martial arts aspect of the movies is addressed as well. King Hu left in an unplanned shot where Yang’s perfect warrior hair suddenly falls in her face: it happened because an errant sword swipe had just grazed her scalp, right above the hairline.\nThe interviews continue with directors Ang Lee and critic Tony Rayns, and a French docu from 2012 goes even deeper into Hu’s career and legacy. Criterion’s A Touch of Zen is a really special disc — Asian martial arts fans will appreciate the gorgeous restoration, and the educational extras allow newbies like myself to understand what’s going on in the wild wuxia action scenes.\nOn a scale of Excellent, Good, Fair, and Poor,\nA Touch of Zen Blu-ray\nSupplements: Documentary on director King Hu; new interviews with actors Hsu Feng and Shih Chun, filmmaker Ang Lee and film scholar Tony Rayns; trailer; insert flyer essay by David Bordwell and notes by director Hu from a 1975 Cannes Film Festival press kit.\nDeaf and Hearing-impaired Friendly?

32	new to astronomy need help why is it hard to find objects in night sky with telescope	Looking through a telescope is challenging because it's like looking through a straw - you see only a tiny portion of the sky at once. When randomly pointing a telescope, you'll mainly see stars that look similar to each other, making it difficult to find reference points. It's easier to start with bright objects like the Moon, which is easily visible and can be found in the eyepiece. Finding specific objects requires converting information from star maps and phone apps into the right telescope position, which can be tricky unless you have a computerized mount that can automatically locate objects.	['Looking through a telescope is a bit like looking through a straw, unless you know exactly what its pointing at then it can be really difficult to know what you’re seeing. Just pointing a telescope randomly at the sky will result in seeing a bunch of stars. Unfortunately stars look about the same and it can be hard to find a reference point. This is essentially the problem the first time you look through a telescope. It’s a bit easier to start with something like the Moon, which being super bright is very easy to spot and get in the eyepiece. This is the challenge, actually getting what you want and to look at in the eyepiece. Converting the information in star maps and handy apps on your phone can be rather tricky. If you’ve purchased a computerised mount then you still have to line it up so the telescope knows where it’s pointing. From there it’s pretty easy as the telescope’s mount will do all of the tricky work is locating things to look at. For those of us without an automated mount then you have to do the hard work in finding stuff and pointing the telescope in the right direction.\nI have a small amount of experience flying aeroplanes and before a pilot straps in and starts boring holes in the sky they check that the aeroplane is airworthy and safe to fly. Handling an expensive and heavy telescope can be both dangerous to your head and pocket so I think it’s worth having a pre-flight check list for astronomy as well, especially if it’s the first time you’ve used the telescope. The system in using a telescope can be usefully thought of as having three parts, the telescope (or optical tube assembly), the mount and the accessorises (eyepieces and cameras etc). Important areas to check are moving parts, joins between parts, optical covers and fastening mechanisms.\nSo the first thing to do is have a good look at your telescope during the day as it is a good idea to become familiar with it when you can see it. I’ll assume you’ve managed to assemble the mount and the telescope is safely mounted. Make sure the mount is secure and the legs are locked in place. For a dobsonian mount, make sure it’s on a firm and flat piece of ground. Then you check all of the bolts and lugs holding the telescope on the mount, as if it falls off it can hurt – both physically and mentally. For setups with weights you need to make sure it is balanced so when you release the axis brakes the telescope won’t rapidly move out of control. Check the telescope has free movement in every direction and you know how to lock it in a particular position. Get used to the feel of moving the telescope left and right and up and down. For EQ type mounts ensure you know where the main axis of the mount is, as this is the axis that must line up with the celestial poles. For dobs that doesn’t matter. The picture below is one of the Sydney Observatory telescopes, all ready and mounted for some solar astronomy.\nThe next bit is to check where all of the covers are and how to take them off and put them back. One of the most common mistakes for the newbie astronomer is simply not removing the cover. It’s worth thinking about where you will put them when you take them off too, so you don’t lose them. There will normally be a tube cover on the end of the telescope as well as a small cover on the focuser, these all stop dust getting on the optics so don’t lose them. Most telescopes also have a finder scope which will need the dust covers taken off as well, or else you won’t be able to see through it and lineup on the celestial objects you want to see.\nNow it’s time to familiarise yourself with how the telescope actually works. Like most things with a telescope, you’re better off learning how it works and getting familiar with it when it’s light rather than trying to work it out in the dark. So first up, have a look at the focuser and ensure it has free movement and notice how much travel there is. The position of the focuser, to have a view in focus, will depend on the telescope and the eyepiece you’ve got. Some focuses have a fine tuning control which can be very useful for getting the view as fine as possible. It’s worth looking at how your eyepieces slot into the focuser too. You don’t want to be figuring this out in the dark and risk dropping one. Check how the eyepiece is secured how much travel there is so you know what it feels like.\nNow you want to look through the telescope to make sure you know how to focus it and get a nice clear picture in the field of view. Again it’s best to do this during the day. What you need to do now is lineup the finder scope with the main telescope. To do this you find something prominent in the distance like a towel or a tree or a rock, or something that’s a couple of kilometres away, and you adjust the finder scope so that the main object is in both the telescope and finder scope. A finder scope is basically a tiny telescope so it will need to be focused and can be adjusted where is pointing usually buy a few little screws. Once you’re happy with where the finder scope is pointing then lock it in place.\nnow is the complex question of collimation. For a reflecting telescope this is where you line up the mirrors (see above picture) so the light is going in the right direction to the eyepiece and into your eye. Collimating a telescope is a whole topic on its own. Now that your telescope is ready and lined up and you know how to remove all of the dust covers and you know how it moves, you are ready to take it outside and start viewing the night sky.']	['<urn:uuid:d5af755d-9d70-4ab1-89c0-bea5b73092d0>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	17	100	1045
33	What are the challenges that small grocery stores face in providing healthy food options, and how can schools help address these nutrition issues through local food programs?	Small grocery stores and convenience stores in urban and rural areas face significant challenges - they operate at lower volumes and higher costs than large supermarkets, resulting in reduced availability and higher prices for fresh fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy products. However, schools can help address nutrition issues through Farm to School programs that connect schools with local farmers and producers. These programs provide fresher food that doesn't travel long distances, create educational connections between food and nutrition, help develop healthy eating habits, and give students opportunities to learn about agriculture and food science through hands-on experiences like school gardens and cooking classes. The USDA supports these efforts by distributing around $5 million in grants annually to help schools connect with local producers.	['- Grocery store availability. As the population density in urban and rural communities has decreased, large grocery stores have moved out. Often, only smaller stores are available to the community. These small corner grocery or convenience stores offer less variety of fresh foods and healthy items (Morland, 2002).\n- Quality of healthy foods. Urban and rural grocery stores operate at a lower volume and higher cost than large supermarkets. As a result, there is a reduced availability of fresh fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy products. In addition, the prices for the fresher foods are often higher (Zenk, 2005).\n- Access to nutrition education. Many nutrition concerns in rural America stem from the lack of proper education and available dietitians. In addition, schools may lack resources for adequate nutrition interventions (Tai-Seale, 2003).\n- Socioeconomic status. The socioeconomic status of individuals living in urban and rural communities might explain differences in healthy food intake (Drewnowski, 2004).The per capita income in rural areas is lower than in urban and suburban areas. Also, individuals living in these areas are more likely to live under the poverty level. For minorities, the disparity in income is even greater (NRHA, 2005).\n- Higher fat intake. Studies show that rural residents have a higher fat and calorie intake than others (Tai-Seale, 2003).\n- Sedentary lifestyles. Rural youth may spend more time watching television than their urban peers. This leads to an increase in snacking, increased desire for highly advertised foods, and less time participating in calorie-expending activities (Tai-Seale, 2003).\nStrategies to address these considerations\n- Improve availability of affordable, healthy food choices. Work with local community- and faith-based organizations, businesses, and governmental leaders to increase the healthy options available at existing markets and restaurants (Zenk, 2005). Some communities have offered grants, loans, and tax benefits to stimulate the development of neighborhood groceries, farmers’ markets, community gardens, and farm-to-cafeteria programs (IOM, 2005). A larger supermarket will carry more fresh items at lower prices (Zenk, 2005).\n- Improve access to healthy food choices. Creating a network that includes community groups, local government, nonprofit organizations, local farmers and food processors can help expand accessibility (IOM, 2005). It may be useful to work with city officials, urban planners, transportation departments, and faith-based organizations to develop city- or county-wide strategies related to land use planning and transportation so as to provide equal access to healthy food choices (Yancey, 2004).\n- Improve access to nutrition information. It may be useful to work with registered dietitians, school and worksite personnel, and community-based organizations and community members to ensure that the messages, content, format and placement of educational materials are appropriate for the population of interest. It may also be useful to work with healthcare providers in rural and urban settings to enhance their ability to convey appropriate nutritional counseling (Tai-Seale, 2003).\n- Use established settings. Strategies should maximize participation in the nutrition education intervention by having meetings or events at convenient locations and times (Bank-Wallace, 2002). It may be useful to schedule intervention activities with other church or community social events.\n- Convenient dissemination of nutrition information. Correspondence or web-based courses may prove useful in overcoming barriers to meeting places and times in rural areas (Tai-Seale, 2003).\n- Increase usage of supplemental food and nutrition information programs. Helping individuals get to the right place at the right time, and with necessary information, to enroll or participate in food and nutrition assistance programs can increase usage of food assistance programs (Strasser, 1991). Case management has also been suggested as a mechanism to help individuals overcome barriers and increase use of food assistance programs (Heslin, 2003).\n- School/Worksite Environment. Many successful interventions have focused on making more healthy choices available in schools and worksites as well as incorporating nutrition education and time for physical activity (Tai-Seale, 2003).\n- Involve the priority populations. It is important that individuals who are from the community of interest take an active role in planning, implementing and evaluating interventions (Bank-Wallace, 2002).\n- Engage community stakeholders. Leadership and active participation by community members, especially health care providers and community and religious leaders, can strengthen the credibility of and respect for the intervention (Bank-Wallace, 2002).\nPrint this window', 'Farm to School: Sourcing School Meals Locally\nEducation is more than what happens in the classroom. Students are learning about the world they live in, how to interact with each other, and how to stay healthy. People are becoming more environmentally aware and conscious of what children put in their bodies, particularly as awareness about obesity has spread.\nSchool districts are starting to focus on something that impacts both student health and the environment they live in:\n- The nutritional content of their school food\n- The local content of their school food\nIn some cases, the availability of junk food at schools has made them co-conspirators in the development of unhealthy eating habits. Ignoring local food sources in favor of imported food only increases the environmental footprint of schools. Locally sourcing healthy lunch options for students is an excellent opportunity to develop nutritionally- and environmentally-conscious young citizens.\nWhat Is the Farm to School Movement?\nThe USDA’s Farm to School Program is an effort to bring local food into schools to help students educationally and nutritionally, as well as to support the local economy. The USDA distributes about $5 million in grants each year to help schools connect to local producers and to bring students hands-on learning opportunities, such as farm visits, cooking classes and school gardens. The food isn’t limited to fruits and vegetables — local producers can be farmers, ranchers or manufacturers.\nWhat is it?\n“Farm to School” is both a federal term for a program and one applied to a movement that includes all efforts to introduce locally or even regionally produced food into the schools. This includes agricultural produce and even meat and poultry that goes into the meals students eat in the cafeteria. It also encompasses various hands-on learning opportunities. It is all part of an integrated approach to learning that extends beyond the classroom.\nBenefits of the Farm to School Programs\nWhen schools join the Farm to School movement, they are making connections that will have long lasting effects. This applies to both the children at the school as well as the farmers who produce the food. When schools source local food they find that children benefit in a number of ways. Farm to School programs provide:\n- Fresher food that does not have to travel lengthy distances\n- An educational connection between food and nutrition\n- Healthy eating habits\n- Educational opportunity for students and their families to make informed choices about their food\n- A chance to learn more about the agricultural resources in their region\n- Teachers a chance to teach students about agriculture, food science and other related topics\n- A lesson in protecting the environment by decreasing a school’s environmental footprint\n- A chance to learn about small-scale farming if a school garden is incorporated\nMoreover, it is not only children and the education system that benefit. The local producers do as well. Research indicates that sourcing local or regional food helps growers, producers and others involved in the local food economy.\nSolving a Problem without Creating Any New Ones\nThe Farm to School movement is one that works toward solving several problems: decreasing childhood obesity by instilling healthy eating habits, helping the local economy and encouraging environmental consciousness in students. With the potential to support local food producers and inspire the minds of children, this program does more than fill bellies with healthy food!\nPhoto: Locally-sourced school lunch served at a Washington, D.C. middle school.

34	carbon clean solutions tac vs futureGen investment amount	Carbon Clean Solutions received $6 million from the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change and an additional $5.7 million from private equity firms, totaling $11.7 million, while the FutureGen 2.0 project received $1 billion from the US Department of Energy in 2010.	"['The saying, “one man’s trash is another man’s treasure” stands true for the company Tuticorin Alkali Chemicals (TAC). While Carbon dioxide is considered as a dangerous waste for planet Earth, it is an important element for TAC as it is a vital input in making soda ash. The company is completely dependent on a SPIC fertilizer plant for this gas, but in the near future with the changing technology it will have to drastically reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that it requires. In order to prepare itself for this future crunch, the company even attempted to produce the gas by making using of a lime kiln, but unfortunately they had to be abandoned this midway due to poor quality, high costs of lime and a number of other reasons. Hence, the company was in an urgent need of a fresh source of CO2 that could have the potential to take care of the growing soda dash demand that the company was facing. Here’s where Carbon Clean Solutions, a startup by IIT Kharagpur amlumni, came to its rescue.\nStarted in the year 2009 by two undergraduate students, Mumbai-based Carbon Clean Solutions visions to become a world leader in carbon dioxide separation technology. While extracting carbon dioxide from flue gases in power plants and using it to make valuable chemicals is still considered a difficult task in technology and economic terms, but the startup claims that its method has the potential of achieving the results cheaply.\nTAC already had boilers in a small thermal plant for producing flue gases. Carbon Clean Solutions has successfully set up its equipment to capture CO2, which also has the potential of capturing the soot and other pollutants from coal. The thermal plant is now able to function cleanly, and TAC is getting enough carbon dioxide supply for its present needs as well as for future.\nThermal plants are considered as an important carbon dioxide emissions source in the world. There is a strong belief present in the scientific world that capturing and sequestering thermal plant emissions is an important step so as to deescalate the alarming rate at which global warming is currently growing. This is mainly because currently humans have no choice but to keep using fossil fuels for a few more decades.\nResearch firm Markets and Markets predict that the global market for carbon capture and sequestration will stand at a whopping $8.05 billion by the year 2021. It is important to note that carbon capture technology is still in its nascent stage, and has the potential of becoming something quite big in the near future as billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide is emitted each year by coal plants. Seeing the graph of growth that one can have in this sector, there is a sudden urgency all around the world to develop solutions to capture and sequester carbon dioxide, or, if possible, even develop valuable products.\nThe startup, Carbon Clean Solutions, has been co-founded by Aniruddha Sharma and Prateek Bumb, who are currently serving as CEO and CTO of the company respectively. Both the co-founders are Alumni of the prestigious IIT Kharagpur and are involved in the day-to-day operations of the company so as to achieve the company’s mission of delivering step changing products that can significantly reduce the cost of carbon dioxide capture.\nThe journey of Carbon Clean Solutions started seven years ago when its co-founders (who were still students back then) entered a business plan competition at IIT Bombay and came third. This was followed by them winning an award at the prestigious Pan-IIT conference. This is when a mentor, who is still unnamed, approached them and offered to give them some seed money. Since, back then, their Alma matter IIT Kharagpur did not have the labs where one could carry out this kind of research, they decided to started building things from scratch, outside from the purview of IIT Kharagpur. This led them to approaching Mumbai’s Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT) in Mumbai, where they ended up setting a small pilot plant. At ICT, they both developed and tested a proprietary solvent that could successfully dissolve carbon dioxide using a proprietary catalyst. The solvent proved out to be extraordinary according to the existing industry standards back then and could remove 90% of the carbon dioxide from flue gases.\nThis success led Sharma and Bumb to venture out of the country for testing and expanding their business. During its seven year long journey, they have succeeded in getting angel investment from India and Europe, and a whopping $6 million from the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change for technology demonstration. In fact, the startup also received money from the US government, for demonstration in a pilot plant. In 2015, the startup raised another $5.7 from private equity firms. Its technology has also been tested at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, called TNO in Europe, and according to TNO’s principal scientist Earl Goetheer, the startup has made a breakthrough in energy consumption.\nIndia is currently generating approximately 186 gigawatt of coal-based power, and these plants are emitting about 600-700 million tonnes of carbon dioxide gas every year. When compared globally, Indian thermal power plants are considered highly inefficient as they emit far more carbon dioxide than most of the plants in the world. In fact, even if the country has very efficient plants, it will still be emitting far more carbon dioxide than the country should, if it is serious about controlling the rapid climate change that planet is currently experiencing.\nAlthough the number of coal-fired thermal plants are now declining in the developed world, they still continue to hold importance in the developing countries for a while. This is the reason that a number of public-funded labs and private companies are trying to develop innovative methods to capture and sequester carbon dioxide but at a cheap cost.', ""Carbon Capture and Sequestration: A Potential “Win-Win” for the Oil Industry and the Public\nIn 1972, the first commercial carbon dioxide (CO2) flood project in the world began with the injection of CO2 into the Scurry Area Canyon Reef Operators Committee (SACROC) unit in the Permian Basin in Scurry County, Texas. The goal was simple: To arrest declining oil production and recover bypassed reserves. Today, nearly 40 years later, CO2 injection is being considered on a much wider scale, and for a different purpose altogether: To help arrest an increase in the average surface temperature of the planet.\nCO2, among other gases such as methane and nitrous oxide, is a “greenhouse gas,” a gas that traps heat in the Earth’s atmosphere by absorbing and emitting radiation within the thermal infrared range, causing a greenhouse-like warming effect. The presence of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere is vital, for without them, Earth’s surface would be on average about 59°F colder than at present. CO2 is also a key ingredient that nourishes plant life through photosynthesis.\nHowever, it is a delicate balance. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the atmospheric presence of greenhouse gases has risen dramatically since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s (Fig. 1), along with a rise over the past century in the Earth’s average surface temperature of about 1.3°F. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, seven of the eight warmest years on record have occurred since 2001. In the past 30 years, the rate of warming across the globe has been approximately three times greater than the rate over the past 100 years. Since one of the primary sources of CO2 is fossil fuel combustion, the petroleum industry is bearing much of the blame in the current politically charged environmental debate (Fig. 2).\nPolitics and blame aside, fossil fuels currently comprise approximately 85% of the world’s overall energy portfolio, and there is no existing alternative energy source that will significantly impact this figure for the foreseeable future. Simply put, current economic stability and ongoing economic growth are possible only with the presence of fossil fuels and their derivative products. This dependence comes at a price, however. According to IPCC estimates, global CO2 emissions stemming from fossil fuel sources are projected to increase 40% to 110% by 2030 if climate policies to mitigate this rise are not implemented. As the problem is global, it would seem logical for governments to be proactive in finding ways to mitigate the greenhouse gas effect arising from fossil fuel use. Enter carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS.\nCCS technology is similar to the CO2 flooding technology that has been used on a commercial scale since the SACROC flood began almost 40 years ago. It involves capturing carbon dioxide from a stationary source, like a coal-fired power plant; compressing the gas; transporting it via pipeline, truck, or barge; and injecting it underground for very long-term storage (or sequestration).\nPower plants now account for approximately 40% of all human-generated (anthropogenic) emissions in the world. The IPCC estimates that carbon capture technology deployed at these CO2 sources has the potential to capture 20% to 40% of all CO2 emissions by 2050. In its CCS Task Force Report, the Environmental Protection Agency, the United States’ environmental regulatory body, states that CCS “could play an important role” in reducing overall CO2 emissions in the United States, given enough economic incentives to make the technology commercially viable. There are other hurdles to overcome before CCS becomes a widely used reality, such as the development of CO2 transportation pipelines, the identification of appropriate geologic reservoirs, and the resolution of long-term storage liability issues. Nonetheless, governments around the world have expressed varying degrees of support for the view that CCS is potentially a critical technology essential for helping transition from fossil fuels to next-generation energy sources.\nOil and gas companies have an opportunity to help mitigate global warming, while at the same time possibly contributing to their bottom line by using captured CO2 to stimulate further production of hydrocarbons otherwise uneconomical to recover. A report issued by the US Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage states that one of the many potential benefits of carbon capture is use of the CO2 in enhanced oil recovery.\nCCS has not been joined with EOR on a commercial scale yet, but many operators around the world have large CCS demonstration projects currently under way. The Statoil-operated Sleipner Project, the world’s first commercial-scale CCS project, began operation in 1996 and currently injects more than 1 Mt of CO2 per year about 1,000 m below the sea floor. Total has invested approximately EUR 60 million in the Lacq Project, which it touts as Europe’s first end-to-end carbon capture, transportation, and storage demonstration facility, in Lacq, southwestern France. As operator of the massive Gorgon Project in Western Australia, Chevron, along with joint venture partners ExxonMobil and Shell, is currently building what will be the largest CCS project in the world, capturing 120 Mt of CO2 over the predicted lifetime of the project. In addition, both Schlumberger and Halliburton have dedicated CCS units and are involved with various active pilot CCS projects around the world.\nGovernment support for CCS is crucial in its current developmental stage. Governments are demonstrating varying degrees of interest in and support for CCS through grants and subsidies to CCS pilot projects. In 2009, as part of the European Energy Recovery Program, the EU announced EUR 1.05 billion in available funds for seven CCS projects. In 2010, USD 1 billion was granted by the US Department of Energy to the FutureGen 2.0 project in Illinois, a “clean coal” power plant and CCS network.\nWhile there is evidence that worldwide CO2 storage in geological formations such as oil and gas reservoirs, deep saline aquifers, and unmineable coal seams has contributed to mitigating the effect of CO2 emissions, the public and private sectors still need to work together to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Tax incentives and government grants can aid in developing new technology and effective CO2 storage projects, and much can be learned from the many currently operating CCS projects around the world.\n|Todd Willis is a workover and completions engineer for Chevron in the Partitioned Zone, Kuwait.

35	Why is an air gap necessary in a drainback system?	"An air gap is necessary in a drainback system to prevent freeze damage. Without an air gap, water would be held in suspension in the return pipe when the device turns off, exposing solar collectors to potential freeze damage. The air gap can be as simple as a 1/8\"" hole drilled in the return pipe inside the reservoir, allowing the system to drain back into the building when the device stops."	['- One area of concern for hydronics folk is the use of the term “pump” versus “circulator”\n- I’ve learned that the difference between the two is the end application\n- So as with any hydronic question, there is only one correct answer: that answer is “It depends ...”\nMany industries suffer some of the same problems that our industry does when it comes to the jargon used by its tradesmen. Acronyms make it even more difficult in most cases, because when people don’t know or understand, they make things up. For example, PRV — is it a pressure-reducing valve or a pressure-relief valve? There’s a big difference between the two.\nOne area of concern for hydronics folk is the use of the term “pump” versus “circulator.” Visually, they are one and the same. Technically speaking, they both create a pressure differential for the purposes of moving a liquid. Maybe we should change their names to PDM (pressure differential machines). That way, regardless of the application, everyone associated with the industry would know exactly what it was that you were referring to if you said you needed a PDM.\nIn my many years of experience, I’ve learned that the difference between the two is the end application. If the PDM is used to physically “lift” water, therefore overcoming atmospheric pressures, then it is considered a “pump.” Think of a submersible well pump; it physically lifts water from way down below the earth’s surface, generating enough additional pressure to cause the water to move through pipes to the point of use. Once it reaches a fixture such as a showerhead or toilet, enough pumping pressure remains to cause the device to operate as designed. This is the function of a true pump.\nIn my many years of experience, I’ve learned that the difference between the two is the end application.\nOur industry friend Dan Holohan explains an operating circulator as being the functional equivalent of a ferris wheel ride. Once the ride is full, the weight of the people being raised to the top of the ride is countered by the weight of the people revolving to the bottom of the ride. The motor that actually performs the work isn’t really working all that hard, except when the ride is being loaded up. This is when the motor will struggle the most. Once the ride is loaded with people, the pump’s workload is significantly reduced.\nIn a hydronic application, a “drainback” solar thermal system can use a “circulator” as a pump. However, its minimum net positive suction head pressure (NPSHA) must be maintained in order for it to perform to its rated performance curve. That’s a whole other subject for coverage at another time, but what I am trying to show is that it doesn’t matter what you call it, it matters how you use it.\nEven in the case of the drainback solar system, once the fluid has been lifted all the way to the top of the system, there has to be enough residual pressure available to start water flowing downward in the downcomer (return) piping. In fact, the velocity of the fluid has to be such that it actually establishes a siphon in the downcomer. Now, instead of physically having to lift all the fluid vertically to the top of the system, the weight of the water flowing down the return pipe counters the weight of the water being lifted up the supply riser, and what was a pump seconds ago now becomes a circulator. Amperage draw will drop significantly, and the flow rate will increase significantly in seconds, once the siphon has been established.\nThis process will continue as long as the PDM remains in the “on” position. It is critical that the downcomer be terminated above the highest standing column of water in the reservoir tank, because when the PDM turns off, the weight of the water will cause the riser to flow backward, causing the upper portion of the system to drain back into the heat of the building. If the return pipe were terminated below the standing column of water in the reservoir, the water would be held in suspension, exposing the solar collectors to the real possibility of incurring freeze damage. Think straw full of water with a finger held over the top of it, holding the water in a vacuum. This required “air gap” can be as simple as a 1/8” hole drilled in the return pipe just inside the reservoir where the pipe enters, but it must be present or water will freeze in the pipe and damage the pipe or even the solar collectors. No check valve is used anywhere in a drainback system’s solar loop.\nIf the pump is marginally sized to only lift the water to the highest point of the system, and not left with enough residual energy to establish a siphon on the downcomer, it enters a “stall.” Water reaches the high point of the system, but the undersized pump doesn’t provide adequate pumping “head” to push it over the top of the hill and begin its journey down.\nNow you know the difference between a circulator and a pump, and as I have just demonstrated, it can change mid-stream.\nNow you know the difference between a circulator and a pump, and as I have just demonstrated, it can change mid-stream; so as with any hydronic question, there is only one correct answer. That answer is “It depends ...” But now you know.\nIf you’ve not yet joined the Radiant Professionals Alliance, check us out at Radiantpros.org.

37	early vs late bearing problem signs compare	Early signs of bearing problems include increased ultrasonic amplitude readings (8-12 dB above baseline) and changes in sound quality that can be detected through headphones, such as crackling or rough sounds instead of normal rushing/hissing noises. These occur in the beginning stages of fatigue failure. Late-stage bearing problems involve more severe conditions - as the lubrication failure progresses, there is loss of proper lubrication at interfaces, leading to high friction, adhesive wear, overheating of rollers, and ultimately catastrophic damage to the roller, race and cage surfaces. The progression typically starts with loss of lubrication at the roller-to-cage interface before affecting the roller-to-race interface.	"[""- Buyer's Guide\nConfirm Proper Lubrication Using Sonic / Ultrasonic Monitoring\nMultiple frequency sonic/ultrasonic analysis can be effectively used to monitor the lubrication quality of greased bearings. These systems are typically the Achilles’ heel of the lubricant condition-monitoring program. As a proactive tool, ultrasonic lubrication monitoring can eliminate under/over greasing, common root causes of failure, before costly damage occurs. Likewise, ultrasonic monitoring can detect a bad-acting bearing in the early stages of failure to facilitate scheduling of corrective actions.\nWhile practical from a testing point of view, applying traditional oil analysis to grease lubricated bearings, it is often impractical due to the difficulty in obtaining a representative sample of grease to analyze. Considering the vast number of grease lubricated machines in the typical plant, the challenge to ensure proper lubrication is a serious one that needs to be addressed.\nResponding to the damage caused by over-greasing, under-greasing, wrong grease, and sometimes no grease is among the most significant challenges faced by maintenance professionals. Below is a summary of the primary challenges to lubricating greased systems:\nOver-greasing - This increases bearing temperature due to surface-to-lubricant friction, compromises seal integrity and causes shedding of oil from its thickener. Over greasing also contaminates motor windings\ncausing further problems.\nUnder greasing - This causes inadequate lubricant delivery, surface-to-surface friction and wear.\nWrong grease - The wrong grease in a bearing can affect the machine in a number of different ways depending upon the nature of the grease that is incorrectly applied.\nNo grease - A complete lack of grease causes severe mechanical wear and thermal degradation of seal and bearing material. Bearings don’t run very long without lubrication, especially journal bearings and thrust bearings.\nAll these problems result in poorly lubricated bearings and an increased failure rate. Poor lubrication results in energy loss due to friction in the form of mechanical energy (ultrasonic) and thermal energy (heat), both of which can be effectively measured to reveal the problem. The trick is to detect the signs of lubricant starvation with enough advance warning to take corrective action before damage occurs to the components. Doing so enables the technician to take preemptive measures before reliability becomes at-risk.\nThe Progression of Bearing Failure\nRolling element anti-friction bearings are designed to operate under elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication at the roller-to-race interface, and under hydrodynamic lubrication at the roller-to-cage interface. Lube starvation produces boundary and mixed film lubrication instead of the desired hydrodynamic and elasto-hydrodynamic modes. When a bearing is losing lubrication, it is postulated that hydrodynamic lubrication at the roller-to-cage interface is first lost. This results in high friction caused by sliding-action at the cage-to-roller interface. This is thought to be true because a 20 micron oil film is required to support the hydrodynamic lubrication at the roller-to-cage interface (see Figure 1). Conversely, only a one micron oil film is required to support elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication at the roller-to-race interface (see Figure 1). As such, it is believed to typically be lost later in the lubrication failure progression.\nBecause the roller-to-cage interface is lightly loaded, high-friction might not immediately equate to high wear. Eventually, however, boundary lubrication conditions take their toll on the cage and adhesive wear begins to occur resulting is secondary damage and accelerated progression toward failure. If the bearing’s load and speed are high, the rollers may also begin to overheat. In the absence of an adequate oil film between the roller and race, the result is increased friction and torque that is focused upon the surfaces of the roller, race and cage and leads to catastrophic damage.\nOur stated goal for condition monitoring is to detect the early signs of lubricant starvation and take corrective action before the onset of bearing damage. Because of sampling limitations using conventional oil analysis, we turn analytical techniques that examine the mechanical and thermal signatures of the component to identify the telltale signs of friction. One such technique involves the use of a multi-frequency sonic / ultrasonic measurement with calibrated decibel (dB) output quickly identify bearings starved for grease lubrication. The premise is that a change in the amplitude (dB) of sonic / ultrasonic energy signifies the presence of a problem, while the frequency at which the change occurs indicates the problem’s nature (see Figure 2). It should be noted that unlike vibration analysis, the target frequency is not a function of the machine’s running speed (rpm). Figure 3 depicts one such device for collecting sonic / ultrasonic readings.\nA study of 13 different rolling element bearings on the conveyor line at a food processor plant was undertaken to test the effectiveness of sonic/ultrasonic analysis in detecting poor lubrication. The bearings under investigation were scheduled for regular greasing. Six of the bearings evaluated were very accessible for re-lubrication. The other bearings in the study were not easily accessed for re-lubrication. Three measurements were collected before and three after greasing each bearing to determine the Peak Hold (PH) and Average Value (AV) dB readings at 4 kHz (sonic) and 30 kHz (ultrasonic) frequency ranges. Temperature measurements were also collected for each of the bearings. Headphones were also used during data collection, but interference due to plant noise caused diminished resolution. The calibrated dB reading, especially the AV readings were deemed more reliable.\nThe easy-to-reach bearings indicated no significant difference before and after greasing the bearings, suggesting that they have been effectively lubricated all along. The hard-to-reach bearings, on the other hand, did show before-after differences on several bearings. One bearing was particularly hard to reach for re-lubrication, and it showed a dramatic variation in the before after readings as is summarized in Figure 4. The data from the bad-actor bearing revealed the following:\nProcedure for Measuring Lubricant Performance with Sonic/Ultrasonic Analysis\n1) Setup instrument to display the average dB level at 30 kHz.\n2) Set the dB level alarm at 25 dB (typical levels for well-lubricated bearings is less than 15 dB), adjust alarms according the specifics of the application.\n3) Attach the sensor to the bearings housing or onto the grease fitting while the machine is running to collect data the dB reading at the 30 kHz frequency.\n4) Collect thermometric data for the bearing.\n5) Diagnose readings as follows:\nUsed routinely, sonic / ultrasonic analysis can play an important role in ensuring proper lubrication of greased bearings. While not conventional “oil analysis” the technique fills an important gap where conventional oil analysis falls short. Proactive in nature, the technique effectively identifies when lubrication is required. Properly applied, it proves an effective defense against over or under lubrication. It also enables those\nhard-to-reach bearings to be greased on-condition only, avoiding unnecessary cost and risk or discomfort to the lubrication technician. This experience-based technique could become even more valuable as we continue to learn about and understand the relationship between inadequate lubrication and sonic / ultrasonic measurement.\n1) Neale, M. and D. Summers-Smith (1997)\n“Improving the Reliability of Machines by Understanding the Failure of their Moving Parts”, Master Series Course Book, CSI: Knoxville, TN, October.\n2) Robinson, J., J Van Voorhis, K. Piety and W.\nKing (1999) “Machinery Surveillance Employing Sonic/Ultrasonic Sensors”, Proceedings from Reliability Week, CSI: Knoxville, TN."", 'MONITORING BEARING WEAR\nUltrasonic inspection and monitoring of bearings is by far the most reliable method for detecting incipient bearing failure and conditions such as lack of lubrication. The ultrasonic warning appears prior to a rise in temperature or an increase in low frequency vibration levels. Ultrasonic inspection of bearings is useful in recognizing:\na. The beginning of fatigue failure.\nb. Brinelling of bearing surfaces.\nc. Flooding of or lack of lubricant.\nIn ball bearings, as the metal in the raceway, roller or ball elements begins to fatigue, a subtle deformation begins to occur. This deforming of the metal will produce irregular surfaces, which will cause an increase in the emission of ultrasonic sound waves.\nA change in amplitude from the original reading is an indication of incipient bearing failure. When a reading exceeds a baseline reading by 8 dB with no substantial change in the sound quality, it can indicate lack of lubricant. If the reading exceeds a baseline by 12 dB, it can be assumed that the bearing has entered the beginning of the failure mode.\nThis information was originally discovered through experimentation performed by NASA on ball bearings. In tests performed while monitoring bearings at frequencies ranging from 24 through 50 kHz, they found that the changes in amplitude indicate incipient (the onset of) bearing failure before any other indicators including heat and vibration changes. An ultrasonic system based on detection and analysis of modulations of bearing resonance frequencies can provide subtle detection capability, whereas conventional methods are incapable of detecting very slight faults. As a ball passes over a pit or fault in the race surface, it produces an impact. A structural resonance of one of the bearing components vibrates or “rings” by this repetitive impact. The sound produced is observed as an increase in amplitude in the monitored ultrasonic frequencies of the bearing. The sound quality of these changes can also be heard through headphones.\nBrinelling of bearing surfaces will produce a similar increase in amplitude due to the flattening process as the balls get out of round. These flat spots also produce a repetitive ringing that is detected as an increase in amplitude of monitored frequencies.\nThe ultrasonic frequencies detected by an ultrasonic translator such as the Ultraprobe®, are reproduced as audible sounds. This “heterodyned” signal can greatly assist a user in determining bearing problems. The heterodyned signal may be analyzed through spectral analysis software or by connecting the instrument to a vibration analyzer. When listening, it is recommended that a user become familiar with the sounds of a good bearing.\nA good bearing is heard as a rushing or hissing noise. Crackling or rough sounds indicate a bearing in the failure stage. In certain cases a damaged ball can be heard as a clicking sound whereas a high intensity, uniform rough sound may indicate a damaged race or uniform ball damage. Loud rushing sounds similar to the rushing sound of a good bearing only slightly rougher can indicate lack of lubrication. Short duration increases in the sound level with “rough” or “scratchy” components indicate a rolling element hitting a “flat” spot and sliding on the bearing surfaces rather than rotating.\nIf any of these conditions are detected, more frequent examinations should be scheduled. Data should be collected to note and trend decibel rises. In addition the bearing sound should be analyzed using spectral analysis software or by connecting the ultrasound instrument to a vibration analyzer.']"	['<urn:uuid:86d1ff6d-a419-440c-8878-3f526995882e>', '<urn:uuid:6941274b-88aa-497f-b03b-82cb255c1d1d>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	7	103	1759
38	I'm looking for a natural way to clean my nose from allergies - can you tell me how to use one of those teapot-looking things for nasal rinsing?	The neti pot, which looks like a small teapot, can be used by mixing 2.5 grams of salt in 8 ounces of warm water. Insert the spout into one nostril and tilt your head to one side, allowing the warm saline solution to travel up one nostril and down the other, washing out dirt, dust, and pollen.	"[""Natural Allergy Solutions\n(Featured as a Two-Part Article in Lifestyles 55)\nWhile most Winnipeggers are happy to have survived another winter, spring can make many allergy sufferers wish winter had stayed around a bit longer.\nWith the annual awakening of vegetation that had been dormant or covered in snow, along come the most common seasonal allergies like hay fever. Also called allergic rhinitis, hay fever is usually triggered by weed or grass pollen, although dust mites, mold, and pet dander can also be causes.\nExposure to allergens doesn't cause a reaction with most people they're usually harmless. Allergy symptoms occur when the body mistakes these particles as invaders, setting off a strong reaction and production of the antibody immunoglobulin-E. The next time you are exposed to that allergen, your immune system causes specialized mast cells to release various chemicals including histamine. These reaction chemicals produce the classic allergy symptoms including congestion, itchy eyes, sneezing, and mucus production.\nA troubling aspect for many older people is that allergens that have never produced a reaction in the past can become a trigger later in life. As we age, it is critical to keep our immune system in balance. We want to avoid the 'overreactions', but we also need our immune system to protect us from potential environmental threats like pathogens and harmful microbes.\nFortunately, there are a number of products designed to help ease allergy symptoms naturally by either eliminating the allergy triggers or by modulating the immune system to prevent the exaggerated response.\nA study published in the International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology found a significant improvement in symptoms of allergic rhinitis in children using LED phototherapy. Bionette produces a specific 630 nm wavelength of red light that can be very effective for treating seasonal allergies. The device is inserted in the nose for 4.5 minutes, for up to three times a day initially, reducing to once or a twice a day once symptoms have improved.\nShaped like a small teapot, the neti pot is one of the most popular natural products that helps relieve allergy symptoms by cleansing the nasal passages with a salt solution, using 2.5 grams of salt in 8 ounces of warm water. Simply insert the spout into one nostril and tilt your head to one side, allowing the warm saline solution to travel up one nostril and down the other, washing out dirt, dust, and pollen.\nPersonally, I prefer a more modern version of this traditional solution. The Nasaline rinsing system allows you to control the flow and pressure, making it easier to use and more effective than a neti pot.\nConventional salt solutions can dry out the nasal passages, and some find the solution a bit harsh for the delicate nasal membranes. I recommend a buffered salt/xylitol solution that combines sodium bicarbonate and xylitol with powdered Himalayan crystal salt. A natural sugar alcohol found in many fruits and vegetables, xylitol keeps the nasal membranes moist and helps prevent bacteria from adhering to the nasal passages, enhancing the effect of the salt solution.\nTo make your own buffered salt/xylitol solution, mix 100 g of baking soda with 300 g Himalayan crystal salt (fine powder) and 800 g of xylitol. This mixture should be enough for about 200 cleanses. Use 6 g (about a teaspoon) for every 8 ounces of water.\nEasier to use than a neti pot, saline sprays can help with symptoms but generally are not as effective as a neti pot or Nasaline. I recommend Xlear as a superior alternative to regular saline sprays as it combines a saline solution with xylitol, better protecting delicate nasal tissues while keeping them hydrated.\nOne of the best ways to reduce indoor allergy symptoms is with a HEPA air filtration system. HEPA filters trap pollen, mold, and many other allergy triggers. For best results, keep windows closed to prevent allergens from entering the home. Portable units can be more effective in small spaces however, HEPA filters that are attached to your HVAC system are recommended as they reduce allergens in the entire home. Combining both solutions is ideal.\nHEPA filters help to remove airborne particles, but they can't kill all the bacteria present in our living environment. New technologies that produce OH radicals can kill up to 10 times more pathogens than photocatalytic oxidation, the conventional method of generating OH radicals in air purifiers. An exciting new disinfection system developed in Korea, the Air Vaccine 015+ is especially effective for rhinitis and respiratory infections. Suitable for spaces up to 1300 square feet, the Air Vaccine works to remove 98% or more of dangerous contaminants like E. coli, smallpox virus, Influenza type A (H1N1), and many other volatile organic compounds in just a few hours.\nMany older homes (particularly those with damp basements) can have mold that infiltrates the home. If allergy symptoms persist, hire a company to test the air. If mold is present, there are companies that do mold remediation and can help ensure that it won't be an ongoing problem. Ideal as a preventative measure in homes and cottages, the Airfree Onix 3000 air sterilizer safely uses heat to help reduce indoor pollution by incinerating mold spores, bacteria, and viruses.\nAs many allergy and asthma symptoms are caused by dust mites, it is important that you work to eliminate mites from your bed, bedding, pillows, carpet, and furniture. I recommend breathable total encasement mattress and pillow protectors that use silver ions to kill dust mites and bacteria. Mattress protectors like PureCare and Natura's Protect Deluxe are effective at reducing allergy symptoms, as they integrate silver ions in the fabric (killing mites and bacteria).\nThese lifestyle recommendations can help you to effectively deal with allergy symptoms. The next article will outline foods and dietary supplements that can help balance the immune system and prevent the overreaction that ultimately causes allergy symptoms.\nIn the last entry in this series, I outlined a variety of products and lifestyle changes that can help to reduce or eliminate allergy symptoms including phototherapy, nasal cleansing, and air filtration. In addition to lifestyle modifications and environmental improvement, there are a number of natural supplements that can reduce allergy symptoms.\nAs mentioned in Part I, exposure to allergens doesn't cause a reaction with most people the particles are generally harmless. Allergy symptoms occur when the body mistakes these particles as invaders, triggering an overreaction of the immune system that causes increased production of the antibody immunoglobulin-E (IgE). The next time you are exposed to that allergen, specialized mast cells release various chemicals including histamine which lead to the classic allergy symptoms including congestion, itchy eyes, sneezing, and mucus production.\nThe connection between the microbiome (our gut microbiota) and the immune system is one of the most active areas of medical research today. Our immune system health is closely linked with healthy oral and gastrointestinal bacteria. Increasing levels of good bacteria through supplementation can help to balance immune response and prevent the overreaction to allergens. I recommend a quality probiotic, taken two to three times a day.\nSome of the powerful dietary supplements that work to balance the immune system include Proligna pine cone extract, plant sterols, Pycnogenol, magnesium, zinc, stinging nettle, olive leaf extract, and quercetin.\nProligna Pine Cone Extract (PPC): Pine cone extract has a long history of usage around the world, particularly in Japan. Fourteen patents and over 31 peer-reviewed studies support its use for immune enhancement, antiviral, antibacterial, and anticancer activities. I take one small capsule daily, and have not succumbed to a cold or flu for as long as I've been taking it.\nAllergy research has identified the importance of dendritic cells in helping balance the immune response that results in allergy symptoms. PPC boosts dendritic cell development nine-fold in just nine days, and reduces IgE two-fold in fourteen days, while promoting disease-fighting T cell response.\nPlant Sterols: These naturally occurring plant fats are found in whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes. Plant sterols have a wide range of health benefits including helping to modulate the inflammatory response to allergens. They can also help lower cholesterol, block the enzyme associated with male pattern baldness and enlarged prostate, and decrease levels of cortisol -- the stress hormone that can adversely affect the immune system.\nNature's richest source of plant sterols is rice bran solubles. Supplements that work well to alleviate allergy symptoms have a minimum of 117 mg of beta-sitosterol per capsule, combined with Cellasate and Enzogenol. Cellasate is a blend of essential fatty acids designed to increase bioavailability, and Enzogenol is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory plant compound from the bark of New Zealand pine trees.\nButterbur (Petasites Hybridus): An herb frequently prescribed for the treatment of migraine headaches, recent research found it to be as effective at reducing allergy symptoms as a well-known anti-histamine drug, but without the drowsiness that is a common side effect.\nBlack Cumin Seed Oil (Nigella Sativa): Also called black seed oil, many health professionals believe this oil to be among the most powerful natural immune balancing products, with a tremendous range of health benefits. For allergy relief, I recommend two 500 mg capsules twice a day, or one tablespoon of black cumin seed liquid daily.\nPycnogenol: Research indicates that Pycnogenol reduces hay fever, nasal, and ophthalmic symptoms. Additional benefits may be seen when taking it for at least 5 weeks prior to allergy season some users report being able to lower or eliminate their allergy or asthma medications. An extract from French maritime pine bark, Pycnogenol is one of the most effective supplements for improving microcirculation, male fertility, and athletic performance. It helps maintain beautiful healthy skin, and can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (including deep vein thrombosis and varicose veins).\nOlive Leaf: When taken at the onset of symptoms, olive leaf helps the body produce a decongestant effect in the body. I prefer the liquid complex, which is higher in anti-inflammatory components than olive leaf extract capsules. Olive leaf can also help normalize blood pressure and reduce the incidence of colds and flu.\nOmega-3: A German study found those with the highest levels of omega-3 essential fatty acids were less likely to overreact to potential allergens. Researchers found the higher the omega-3 levels, the greater the effect. Omega-6 fats can cause inflammation, while omega-3 fats are anti-inflammatory. I recommend a balanced 1:1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats in the diet, and avoiding oils high in omega-6 including grapeseed, corn, safflower, sunflower, rice bran, canola, peanut, walnut, and soybean oil. Choose oils high in monounsaturated fat (olive, macadamia nut, avocado), saturated fat (coconut, red palm, MCT) and omega-3 (camelina and flax).\nVitamin C with Bioflavonoids: Two to three grams of vitamin C taken in divided doses (ideally 500 mg every four hours) can be effective at reducing allergy symptoms. Choose a formula with bioflavonoids, which help strengthen capillaries and stabilize mast cells. I recommend buffered forms of vitamin C, which combine ascorbic acid with minerals like magnesium and calcium to increase the alkalinity. Mineral ascorbate forms of vitamin C are easier on the stomach, with the added benefits derived from the minerals in the formula.\nI also recommend vitamin C formulas that use threonic acid enhanced buffered calcium ascorbate combined with alpha lipoic acid, a powerful antioxidant that recycles vitamin C in the body. This combination maintains high levels of vitamin C in the bloodstream for up to 12 hours, while most formulas must be taken every 3-4 hours for optimal results.\nQuercetin: One of the most effective natural antihistamines, quercetin is a bioflavonoid found in onions, apples, blueberries, okra, buckwheat, olive oil, citrus fruits, green tea, and red wine. Quercetin may also be effective at reducing symptoms of asthma. Researchers at Tufts Medical Center found that 300-1000 mg per day can help alleviate allergy symptoms by reducing the inflammatory response.\nStinging Nettle: The roots of stinging nettle have traditionally been used to help reduce an enlarged prostate, but the shoots can be effective for treating kidney stones, arthritis, and allergy symptoms including hay fever. In a recent study, 60% of those taking 300 mg per day experienced relief.\nZinc: Studies show that over 40% of seniors are deficient in zinc, one of the most important minerals for the immune system. When histamine-producing mast cells are zinc deficient, zinc lozenges can help stop the release of histamine and provide quick relief, often lasting up to 12 hours. Oral lozenges containing zinc acetate or zinc gluconate are usually recommended to help combat the common cold, but with continued use, some find that allergy symptoms disappear completely. I recommend taking a multivitamin that supplies a minimum of 15 mg of zinc per day, but if you are a vegetarian or don't often eat animal products, I recommend 30 mg.\nMagnesium: According to Terry Phillips, Ph.D, magnesium deficiency definitely accentuates the allergic situation. A key nutrient that is required for over 360 biochemical reactions in the body, over 60% of the population is deficient, and many pharmaceutical drugs interfere with its absorption. Magnesium helps relax constricted airways while inhibiting the release of histamine from mast cells. Studies have found that higher levels of histamine are associated with magnesium deficiency. I recommend a multivitamin that contains a 300-500 mg of magnesium per day in divided doses. For the highest bioavailability, I recommend Magnesium Synergy from AOR, as it also contains zinc and nutrient cofactors that improve magnesium absorption.\nThe key to alleviating allergies is modulating the immune response to prevent the overreaction that results in allergy symptoms. The recommendations outlined here can help control the response without the side effects of prescription medicines, and can provide additional natural health benefits.""]"	['<urn:uuid:5ba7bc31-4caf-418a-b0c6-741bca84183a>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	28	57	2274
39	difference between short term and long term stress effects on body workplace performance	Short-term and long-term stress have distinctly different effects. Short-term stress, such as from a single event like an exam, typically resolves quickly if the outcome is positive - the fight-or-flight response withdraws, the parasympathetic system normalizes, and cortisol levels decrease. However, long-term stress can have serious consequences - excess cortisol can impair memory formation, weaken the immune system, and cause body-wide inflammation leading to disease. In the workplace context, this prolonged stress is becoming a significant issue, with nearly half of US workers citing their job as their primary stress source. The impact is measurable - workers under severe mental strain take nearly five times more sick days than average workers, leading to substantial productivity losses.	['Stress: What it really is and how to handle it\nOriginally posted by Jordon Johnston on the UBC Life Blog.\nWhile, tragically, both puberty and phone calls seem to be facts of life for now, you don’t have to accept overwhelming stress as the status quo.\nI had the privilege of speaking to Dr. Eli Puterman, Assistant Professor in the UBC School of Kinesiology and Principal Investigator of the Fitness, Aging, and Stress Lab, about how stress affects our bodies and what we can do to manage it.\nWhat is stress?\nDr. Eli Puterman\n“If you’re a student that perhaps didn’t prepare as well, you may be threatened by the exam, and the physiology of that stress will become more heightened and might interfere with your performance.”\nWhat’s happening inside your body?\nYour body goes through these steps when you feel stress:\nStep 1: The fight-or-flight response\nYour sympathetic nervous system is activated, and the parasympathetic system withdraws. Your heart pumps faster and your blood vessels constrict to get you ready to engage in activity. Your body is essentially energizing you to deal with whatever you’re facing, from a sabre-tooth tiger to a presentation on Ulysses for English 110 (same diff).\nStep 2: Cortisol release\nCortisol, a hormone released by your adrenal glands, helps you feel more alert. But if cortisol levels get too high, you might actually perform less well on whatever challenge you’re facing (whether that’s a carnivorous feline or James Joyce).\nStress in the short term\nIf you complete a stressful event, like an exam, and feel that it went well, then your whole system will calm down. The fight-or-flight response withdraws, the parasympathetic system returns to normal, and cortisol levels decrease.\nShort-term stress once in a while is unlikely to cause any serious side effects. However, what if you didn’t do well on the exam, and continued to worry about it? Your system would stay activated, and this is where some more serious effects of stress begin.\nStress in the long term\nAccording to Dr. Puterman, too much cortisol can impact your ability to form new memories, slow down your immune system, and cause inflammation throughout the body that can lead to disease.\nFrequent stress over a long period of time can actually decrease your body’s ability to deal with stress. You can build up a resistance to stress for a while, but eventually it can become fatigued and make it harder to deal. (\nThis is obviously why I never finished reading Ulysses I easily finished reading Ulysses on time.)\nBefore you start quietly cursing me for bringing such a miserable topic into your life, note that this isn’t something a university student would deal with in a day or a month, and you might not necessarily notice the effects for a long time. However, stressors can build up over a 4+ year degree, and it’s important to be aware of how stress may affect you down the road.\nBut don’t get stressed about stress! There are simple things you can do to help manage your body and your mind’s ability to cope with stress, and stay healthy and happy.\nFight stress with exercise\nDr. Puterman specializes in the relationship between exercise and stress, and his research has provided a definitive link between the two. According to him, “Exercise is the best thing anyone can do for every single part of their body.”\nThough I wish that burying yourself in a mound of pillows while eating copious amounts of M&Ms was the best thing you could do for your body, Dr. Puterman’s research has shown that “one single bout of exercise can change our mood and physiology even an hour later.”\nFrequent exercise may even help lower heart rate and cortisol levels when stressed out over the long term!\nHere are some tips directly from Dr. Puterman on exercise:\nPractice mindfulness, avoid rumination\nAside from physical activity, Dr. Puterman also mentioned mindfulness, the concept of focusing on things in the present moment, as an effective way to combat stress. He said rumination and worry—dwelling on stressful events, both past and future—can lead to more stress and getting caught in toxic thought patterns. At the end of the day, overthinking too much keeps our systems activated at unhealthy levels.\nMindfulness can help this. Though it can be difficult to learn how to calm your mind, practicing mindfulness everyday can help you feel calmer. That’s because you’re creating new synapses and neurons that can change how you feel in a moment or in a day—pretty cool.\nDr. Puterman recommends Mindfulness for Beginners by Jon Kabat-Zinn as a place to start.\nIf you’re feeling stressed, anxious, or depressed, he also highly recommends speaking with a therapist. He shared his own experiences of how going to therapy helped him sit with his emotions and accept that sometimes, just like everyone else, he gets stressed out, too.\nIf you want to talk to someone, a good place to start is the Wellness Centre in the UBC Life Building or the 24/7 Empower Me helpline at 1-844-741-6389. For support and resources on a variety of topics—from academics to health—check out the Support page of the Student Services website.\nFind positive stress in healthy challenges\nDr. Puterman and I both agreed that positive stress exists, usually in the form of a challenge. A lot of events in our life—going to university, moving, facing down telemarketers at inconvenient times—are challenging, but we can handle them and gain a lot from our experiences.\nStress is a part of life, but there are many ways to manage it and lead a healthy, happy life. Don’t be afraid to take on those challenges, but make time to get moving and stay focused on the incredible present!', 'Poor mental health costs businesses more than $45 billion\nNearly 50 percent of US workers cite their job as the primary cause of their poor mental health. In a recent Gallup Poll, a growing number of employees report extreme stress and anxiety at work, with forty percent stating that their job negatively impacts their mental health. Half of these workers are Millenials between 18-29 and account for over one-third of the US workforce.\nWith the incidence of poor mental health cases related to work rising, so does the cost. For example, the average worker calls off work unexpectedly, only 2.5 days annually. By contrast, those under severe mental strain take 12 days off each year, at an estimated $46.7 billion in lost productivity. This growing price tag has business experts wondering if a mental health pandemic is on the horizon.\nThe symptoms of anxiety and depression disorders include prolonged feelings of anger, stress, worry, and sadness. Left unattended, poor mental health can destroy employees’ teams, families, schools, and institutions. Currently impacting 41.5% of US adults, mental health disorders are a growing threat to workplace ideas and energy. Small businesses, which employ 50% of the American workforce, are at the most significant risk and paying a high price tag.\nGlobal Healthcare Organizations call on businesses to address employee mental health.\nIn the last year, global healthcare organizations are recognizing that we are on the edge of a potential mental health crisis at work and are calling on leaders to address their negative impact on the mental health of their employees.\n“The workplace is the missing link in improving population mental health,” Dr. Leslie Hammer, co-director of the Oregon Healthy Workforce Center and professor of occupational health psychology at Oregon Health & Science University, told ABC News.” The next steps are for workplaces to look hard at the culture around mental health support.”\nIn October, the US Surgeon General released the “New Framework for Mental Health and Wellbeing in the Workplace,” reinforcing workplaces’ role in supporting their employees’ mental health and well-being. A similar recommendation was issued by the World Health Organization a month earlier, identifying three areas of change that would significantly move toward creating a positive mental health culture at work. They were:\n1. Training for managers to improve their ability to recognize and respond to employees who might be experiencing emotional distress\n2. Training for employees to improve their mental health awareness and knowledge\n3. Easy access to mental health resources within existing health programs to improve individual mental health and reduce its stigma in the workplace.\nTraining builds employee insights\nIt can be challenging for managers to initiate a caring conversation if they notice an employee struggling with negative thoughts and feelings when mental health, anxiety, and depression. Despite growing public recognition and acknowledgment of mental health illnesses, many organizations carry a negative bias towards their discussion at work. However, according to Johann Berlin, CEO at TLEX Institute, organizations were trending away from transactional interactions and repetitive tasks to more adaptive, empathetic, and connected cultures before the Covid19 pandemic and beginning to offer training to build mindfulness and emotional intelligence. Today, nearly 22% of employers now offer meditation and mindfulness training with access to apps like Calm or Headspace to reduce employee anxiety, improve working memory and increase creativity.\nThe business case for mindfulness training remains positive for personal wellness and relationships. But as Mark Sidney notes, the benefits are only possible through sustained practice. “Theory informs practice,” he states, “True mindfulness involves developing a deeper understanding of the processes and foundational attitudes necessary for mindfully living and working.”\nLasting impact requires more than insight. It requires Mental Fitness.\nMost of our attempts to make positive changes fail. Why? Because we stop at insight and don’t build habits. We lose momentum after the initial excitement of learning a new skill and return to our former practice. But recent advances in neuroscience research offer hope for lasting change by retraining our brains.\nIn his NY Times Best Selling book, Positive Intelligence, Shirzad Chamine describes how building mental muscles activate and build new neural pathways. Using new functional Magnetic Resource Imaging (fMRI) technology, he describes the research that shows tissue growth in the region of the brain where positive emotions originate.\n“All our negative emotions – stress, anxiety, self-doubt, anger, shame, and frustration – exist physically in our left brain. In contrast, positive emotions like peace and joy live in the right brain. Building and strengthening the neural pathways that create a positive mindset and reduce negative ones are called mental fitness.”\nBuilds mental muscles. Increase Mental Fitness. Create positive lasting change.\nMental fitness, by definition, is the ability to handle life’s challenges from a positive mindset with less stress. Using factor analysis, the breakthrough research by Positive Intelligence identifies three core mental muscles, radically simplifying mental fitness. Validated by more than 500,000 individuals, including students, CEOs, elite athletes, and sales, operations, and technology teams, the Positive Intelligence Mental program is proven to build measurable improvements within six weeks of practice.\nStrengthening the mental fitness of individuals and teams may offer businesses a simple and lasting way to avoid the potential mental health pandemic and improve wellness, relationships, and performance in the process.\nFor BusinessLearn More\nCouncil, Forbes. “This Expert Says Meditation Is On The Rise Among C-Suite Executives.” Forbes, Forbes, 20 Oct. 2020, https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesmarketplace/2020/10/20/this-expert-says-meditation-is-on-the-rise-among-c-suite-executives/?sh=40bf67204281.

40	which focuses more on celebrating foreign literature national translation month or ode on a grecian urn poem	National Translation Month is specifically focused on celebrating foreign literature through translations, with goals to promote translators' work, encourage reading literature in translation, and support literary translators worldwide. In contrast, 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' is primarily focused on describing and interpreting ancient Greek art, specifically a marble vase with carved scenes, rather than promoting foreign literature.	"['Here are a list of frequently asked questions and answers about National Translation Month. A downloadable version is available here.\nQ: What is National Translation Month (NTM)?\nA: National Translation Month (NTM) is a celebration of literary translations throughout the month of September. Each year, we publish award-winning authors and translators on our web site; we hold numerous readings across the U.S., London and other cities in collaboration with At the Inkwell and other organizations; and we celebrate accomplished translators through social media campaigns and interview series. Since its creation, National Translation Month has built a large following of 5,000+ fans on social media, bringing awareness and promoting literature in translation each September.\nQ: Who started it?\nA: Inspired by the successful celebrations of Black History Month (February), Women’s History Month (March), and Academy of American Poets’ National Poetry Month (April), National Translation Month was founded in 2013 by poet, author, educator, and journalist Loren Kleinman and by Romanian-born poet, editor, and translator Claudia Serea. Along the way, we partnered with numerous organizations, literary journals, publishers, presses, and organizers, most notably At the Inkwell, our events and readings organizer led by Monique Antonette Lewis. You can see our list of partners here.\nQ: Why was September chosen for National Translation Month?\nA: September 30 is already celebrated worldwide as International Translation Day with the feast of Saint Jerome, the beloved patron of librarians and libraries, schoolchildren, students, Bible scholars, and translators. It seemed only fitting to launch a month-long celebration in September—in an ultimate effort to encourage literary translation readership year-round.\nQ: What are the goals of National Translation Month?\nA: The goals of National Translation Month are to:\n- promote the work of translators and highlight their craft\n- encourage the reading of literature in translation\n- encourage increased publication and distribution of works in translation, and\n- encourage support for literary translators, authors, and presses from around the world.\nQ: Shouldn’t we celebrate literary translations all year-round, not just in September?\nA: Yes, of course! We encourage reading and sharing works by your favorite authors in translation year-round. Join our mailing list or follow us on social media (Twitter and Facebook) to receive news and updates about translators, awards, authors, and new translated books getting published or recognized all year long.\nQ: Do organizations need permission to participate?\nA: No. You don’t need our permission to celebrate, just as you don’t need anyone’s permission to celebrate Black History Month, Women’s History Month, National Poetry Month, or National Ice Cream Month in July. We encourage you to use our badge, which can be downloaded here.\nQ: What can I do to celebrate NTM?\nA: There are thousands of ways to celebrate.

What maidens loth?\nWhat mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?\nWhat pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?\nHeard melodies are sweet, but those unheard\nAre sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;\nNot to the sensual ear, but, more endear\'d,\nPipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:\nFair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave\nThy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;\nBold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,\nThough winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;\nShe cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,\nFor ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!\nAh, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed\nYour leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;\nAnd, happy melodist, unwearied,\nFor ever piping songs for ever new;\nMore happy love! more happy, happy love!\nFor ever warm and still to be enjoy\'d,\nFor ever panting, and for ever young;\nAll breathing human passion far above,\nThat leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy\'d,\nA burning forehead, and a parching tongue.\nWho are these coming to the sacrifice?\nTo what green altar, O mysterious priest,\nLead\'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,\nAnd all her silken flanks with garlands drest?\nWhat little town by river or sea shore,\nOr mountain-built with peaceful citadel,\nIs emptied of this folk, this pious morn?\nAnd, little town, thy streets for evermore\nWill silent be; and not a soul to tell\nWhy thou art desolate, can e\'er return.\nO Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede\nOf marble men and maidens overwrought,\nWith forest branches and the trodden weed;\nThou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought\nAs doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!\nWhen old age shall this generation waste,\nThou shalt remain, in midst of other woe\nThan ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say\'st,\n""Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all\nYe know on earth, and all ye need to know.""\nJames Arthur Comments:\nI first encountered “Ode on a Grecian Urn” in college. But I developed a more personal relationship to the poem years later, in grad school, when required by one of my mentors, the wonderful poet Richard Kenney, to commit “Ode on a Grecian Urn” to memory. The ode’s subject, an ancient marble vase, is carved with the scene of a Dionysian revel. And because the revel exists only as an image on the urn’s surface, Keats imagines that the feast-goers live in a static world, in which spring can’t progress into summer, in which young lovers remain young forever, leaning toward each other, never kissing—a world in which a piper plays without making any music that we can hear. The ending of the poem is mysterious. Living people, unlike the revelers, must change, grieve, and die… and the urn’s message to them, according to Keats, is that beauty and truth are one and the same. Does Keats mean for us to take that message to heart? Or does he mean for us to read the utterance skeptically, thinking of the great distance separating our reality from that of the people on the urn? Or is the poem’s meaning more complicated still?\nAbout James Arthur:\nJames Arthur was born in Connecticut and grew up in Toronto, Canada. His poems have appeared in The New Yorker, The New Republic, Poetry, Ploughshares, Best New Poets 2010, and Best Canadian Poetry 2008. He has received a Stegner Fellowship, a Hodder Fellowship, the Amy Lowell Poetry Travelling Scholarship, a Discovery/The Nation Prize, and a residency at the Amy Clampitt House, as well as fellowships at Yaddo and the MacDowell Colony.

41	what info needed manage building assets	Essential building asset information includes as-built plans, building systems information, real-time system performance, warranty documentation, performance specifications, inspection records, permits, critical spare parts, manufacturer make and model, year of installation, and expected life cycle.	['Bringing a new facility to life and integrating with an existing asset portfolio, can be a stressful endeavor for the receiving organization expected to operate, manage, and maintain the building with finite resources. Value engineering may have saved considerable construction dollars, but may have also affected life–cycle costs and maintainability. Owners of newly constructed facilities can be faced with a building that underperforms, requires unplanned downtime, additional rework, or provides a lesser occupant or visitor experience.\nFor a new facility to reach its full potential and deliver the maximum value to occupants and owners, it must perform as intended and deliver the expected physical environment for the organization, employees, visitors, and occupants. A predictable opening day that can confidently deliver the intended environment, whether it is focused on production or customer service, is dependent on three primary factors: workforce planning; effective facility transition planning; and transference of relevant facility asset information.\nThe identification of training needs for operating, maintaining, and managing the new facility is essential for preparing the facility operations and maintenance workforce for the transition. Staffing requirements should be determined based on best practices for organizational processes and maintenance procedures, including response times, maintenance levels, reliability goals, preventive maintenance frequencies, and predictive maintenance practices. Staff preparedness requires advanced training for building systems, applicable codes and regulations, building familiarization and wayfinding, scenario planning and testing of emergency procedures, awareness of locations for critical spare parts, and vendor contact information.\nOpening day risks associated with workforce preparation can be limited to chaos finding tools, or can be as impactful as negatively affecting the customer or user experience if issues such as room temperatures, lighting, or access cannot be quickly resolved. A fully staffed response team should be deployed for opening day to quickly respond to any customer or employee initiated requests to adjust facility components for occupant comfort including air quality, noise and potential odors.\nNow that the staff is prepared, is the building prepared?\nFacility Transition Planning to Asset Management\nFor the long–term operational success and viability of a new facility, asset management requires attention and development during the design and construction phase where the focus is predominantly on building the physical assets, driven by the high pressures imposed for schedule and budget compliance. If not planned, the baton pass from construction to occupancy and asset management can be less efficient and less effective.\nTransitioning from a construction zone to an occupied facility requires a series of validations that building systems and equipment are operating as designed and within efficient tolerance levels as specified by the design and commissioning teams. A building monitoring system will provide valuable insight into the overall performance and efficiency of the building, while allowing fine-tuning and adjustments during the system stabilization period. Including engineering and maintenance teams in the performance validations will offer early training and understanding of any potential systems that may require additional monitoring and adjusting to ensure operational efficiency during and after the stabilization and equipment burn-in phase. A smooth baton handoff during the commissioning and stabilization phase will ensure the facility management teams are not stumbling to balance building systems when customers, visitors, or staff are in the building. Ideally, the engineering and maintenance team should be fully trained and capable of operating the facility prior to the relinquishment of the site by the construction and commissioning teams.\nA seamless transition from construction to operations with asset management will reduce startup costs and provide a higher quality occupant and user experience from opening day. A defined plan that addresses organizational needs for asset information and implemented business processes will frame the transition and improve reliability and maintainability. Shifting the focus to long-term maintainability and asset management early in the design and construction phase will enhance cost reductions throughout the life of the facility and ease the transition from construction to asset management.\nEngagement of the operations and support teams, including security, environmental health safety and security, facility management, and engineering and maintenance, throughout the system startup and commissioning phases will have staff better prepared to accept full operations and maintenance responsibility during the transition to a fully operational facility with the ability to support the owning organization in a productive and safe environment.\nTransference of Relevant Facility Asset Information\nThe ability to respond quickly to unplanned events is frequently dependent on accessible, reliable, and accurate information about the building; including as built plans, building systems information, and real time system performance. Additional information, such as warranty documentation, performance specifications, inspection records, permits, critical spare parts, manufacturer make and model, year of installation, and expected life cycle are valuable attributes to proactively manage the building assets through the use of an integrated work management system (IWMS).\nEstablishing a document library early in the process that organizes and tracks information received throughout the construction and commissioning process will help to identify any documentation gaps at final acceptance of the new facility. This process can be streamlined by pre-determining relevant information for the facility and systems that will need to be captured during the design, construction, and commissioning phases. If an enterprise asset management system (EAMS) is being used to manage the building portfolio, then data can be mapped for direct transference from the design and construction software such as building information models, CAD tables, progress photo databases, inspection reports, commissioning data, etc.\n- Operations and Maintenance Best Practices Guide Release 3.0, Chapter 7: Commissioning Existing Buildings']	['<urn:uuid:d578b74d-e235-47af-9f5c-3c4236472193>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	6	34	904
42	How did medieval men use cosmetics, and how do modern Korean men approach beauty care?	Medieval men primarily used cosmetics to combat aging signs, particularly for treating baldness, washing hair, and dyeing grey hair to appear youthful and attract women. In contrast, modern Korean men, known as Flower Men, take a more comprehensive approach to beauty care, spending significant amounts on skincare (about $900 million in 2013), using makeup, getting facials and massages, styling their hair, and even pursuing cosmetic surgery, with approximately 15% of Korean men having undergone plastic surgery by 2010.	['By Sandra Alvarez\nIt’s easy to differentiate between cosmetic and medical procedures in the present day but if we take a look back at the Middle Ages, the distinction wasn’t always so clear. Thanks to several prominent medical writers, we can get a glimpse of how medieval medicine viewed the use of cosmetics, and how some of these products were used.\nGalen and Avicenna: Cosmetics vs. Medicine\nAll medieval medical writers looked to the writing of the famous Greek physician, Galen (129-216 AD). Galen’s medical teachings were the gold standard until the sixteenth century and some treatments he advocated managed to remain popular (like bloodletting) until the nineteenth century. According to Luke Demaitre, in an article on medieval urban cosmetics, Galen’s views on make up to enhance the appearance vs. procedures for health were well defined. He complained bitterly about the mixing of medical treatments and cosmetics in his writings, stating,\nThe object of the cosmetic part of medicine is to produce an enhancement of beauty, while the object of the decorative part is to preserve everything natural in the body that is naturally accompanied by beauty. The appearance of the head suffering from alopecia is ugly, as it is with the eyes when the eyelashes and the hairs of the eyebrows fall out; and these hairs contribute not only to beauty but much more to health of the parts…But to make the colour of the face whiter by means of drugs, or redder, or the hair of the head curly, or yellow, or black, or to make it much longer, as women do, and the operations like these belong to the depravity of cosmetics and not to the healing art.\nWhat concerned Galen were the differences between services provided for health, decoratio, and services provided solely for the embellishment of looks, ars comptoria/cosmetica. Decoratio did not have the same connotation it does today – to decorate something; to medieval physicians it meant “care of” or “decorum”. Decoratio was the term used for treatment of a condition that ‘went against nature’, diseases like leprosy and alopecia did not just make the individual ugly in appearance; but according to Galen, they also adversely affected a person’s health. To Galen, there was a vast difference between curing someone who suffered in appearance and in their health and someone who sought medical assistance to alter their appearance simply to look more attractive.\nHowever, Galen reluctantly conceded that there were certain situations where a physician could not refuse a cosmetic treatment, like when commanded to treat royalty. Galen included some of these recipes for colouring hair, and preventing baldness used on royal patrons, and cited other physicians who worked for emperors like Criton of Heraclea, the famed physician to the Roman Emperor Trajan (53BC – 117 AD) to justify his addition of these practices, in his works.\nAnother medical heavyweight was Persian physician, Avicenna (980-1037 AD). Avicenna produced over 450 works on early medicine, and also wrote about alchemy, astronomy, mathematics and philosophy to name but a few topics of his vast knowledge. He became a doctor at the age of 18 and his reputation as a physician made him famous. Like Galen, physicians used his medical expertise until well into the seventeenth century. However, on the topic of cosmetics, unlike Galen, Avicenna wasn’t bothered by their inclusion in standard medicine and made no effort to separate the two in his work The Canon of Medicine. Medieval medical writers mainly followed Avicenna’s lead on blending medicine and cosmetics until the fourteenth century.\nHair and Make-Up for Men\nCosmetic enhancement wasn’t the sole sphere of women; men were definite consumers of cosmetics in the Middle Ages. Cosmetics were frequently used by men to stave off the appearance of old age. They sought treatment for baldness, paid to have their hair washed, and bought colourants to dye away greys. Says Demaitre, “Men who had their hair washed inferentially for aesthetic rather than hygienic reasons, were willing to spend money for other improvements of their appearance.”\nSuch activities that focused on improving the male appearance were often viewed as emasculating and treated with contempt. An interesting tale of “death by vanity” is recounted in the story of Amadeus VII ‘the Red’, Count of Savoy (1360-1391). In 1391, Amadeus used an ointment to thicken his hair because he was balding and he died shortly afterwards at the age of 31. His physician was accused of poisoning him at the behest of his mother, Bonne de Bourbon (1341-1402). This was perhaps meant as a little warning story against vanity. Nearly all cosmetics documented for men revolve around hair loss and covering greys in order to appear youthful and attract women.\nAlms for the Poor? : Make-Up and Leprosy\nAnother interesting medieval concern regarding the use of make-up was its ability to deceive. Make-up wasn’t only used by men to look younger, or women to attract men, but also used by beggars to fool people into giving them money. By the sixteenth century, some people began to use make-up as a way to mimic the look of leprosy so that they could be granted a begging license. Ambroise Paré (1510-1590), one of the fathers of surgery, related the tale of a beggar caught in in 1520 trying to trick Paré’s brother Jehan into believing he was a leper.\nThe beggar sat in front of a church, with several coins strewn in a handkerchief at his feet. His face was covered with large pustules, made of a certain strong glue and painted in a livid reddish fashion, approximating the colour of lepers, and he was very hideous to see, thus out of compassion everyone gave him alms. The artful imposter tightened, from beneath his cloak, a rag which he had wrapped around his neck, so as to make the blood mount to his face…After removing the rag, the surgeon washed his face with warm water, which caused all his pustules to become detached and to fall off…the beggar confessed that he knew how to counterfeit several illnesses, and that he had never found greater profit in it than when he counterfeited lepers.\nCosmetics were becoming lucrative in urban centres and situations such as these gave physicians reason to pause and consider Galen’s earlier warning about the inclusion of purely cosmetic procedures with medical ones. Although most medieval medical practitioners didn’t mind mixing cosmetics with medicine, a growing number began to question their part in aiding people to radically alter or fake their appearance.\nLuke Demaitre, “Skin and the City: Cosmetic Medicine as an Urban Concern”, Between Text and Patient: The Medical Enterprise in Medieval and Early Modern Europe, pp.97-120 (2011).\nTop Image: BNF Français 343 fol.3v', 'by Lilia Yamakawa\n“Beauty” and what one considers beautiful depend a lot on a person’s own culture and ethnicity. On the streets of Korea, it is not unusual to find Flower Men (FMs), called “kkotminam” (“flower handsome men”). You will know them by their pretty and “soft masculinity” and by their attention to the way they look. They are willing to spend a lot of time and money on their appearance and lifestyle. They may use make-up and other beauty products, pluck their eyebrows, manicure their nails, gel and style their hair, get facials, get massages, and even have cosmetic surgery. They are also associated with soft speech and traits such as gently caring for their families. They are seen as being pure and innocent, and they are very polite. In this report, I will examine some of the reasons to explain the Flower Man boom.\nFirst, the boom is part of the larger global phenomenon of the “metrosexual” male, which has spread throughout both the East and the West. The metrosexual man is one who takes care of his physical appearance through means that were once considered feminine. The FM is just one example of this wide global trend. The East Asian metrosexual trend is so prominent that Time magazine did a cover story on it in 2005. Ling Liu wrote in this article:\nA few years ago it may have been considered sissy for a guy to be fussy about his clothing and appearance. Real men demanded the world accept them on their own uncouth, unkempt terms. But in Asia nowadays, the definition of masculinity is undergoing a makeover – and narcissism is in, thanks to economic growth, higher disposable incomes, shifting gender roles, and fashion and cosmetics industries eager to expand their customer bases. No longer content to be the drabber sex, Asian males are preening like peacocks, perming, plucking and powering themselves to perfection in an effort to make themselves more attractive to their bosses, their peers and, of course, to women.\nAlthough the boom is worldwide, it seems that Korean Flower Men have taken it to a further extreme than men of any other ethnic group and nationality. In 2013, South Korean men spent roughly $900 million on skincare. This was almost one-fourth of sales worldwide for men’s skin care. There are many salons and spas just for men that offer hair, facials, massages, and other procedures. Plastic surgery is also common, and there are also a number of clinics that cater solely to men. In 2013, Korean Air began training male staff to use beauty products (Fujita 2005).\nThe FM phenomenon itself began in the 1990s, around the time the Korean government began to allow more pop culture from Japan to come into the country (in 1998). Many manga and anime, which were previously hard to find, could now be bought and read in public. Young male actors and singers, especially in the boy bands, began to look like Japanese and Korean manga and anime characters, especially those in “girls’ comics” or “shojo manga” where the ideal image of a male is “bishonen” or “beautiful boy.” The flow of media between Korea and Japan also included tv dramas, cinema, and advertising (Sun 2010). The “yaoi” type of manga, which became very popular in Korea, is also said to be a big influence on the FM trend. The men in these manga often look like elves or fairies, and they are soft, sweet, and sensitive.\nUp to the 1990’s the popular image of male beauty in Korea was a rather macho-type man. Since then, the soft male type has become much more popular. Two groups of FBs best exemplify the phenomenon today. One is the Korean boy band DBSK of idols. The other is the Korean tv drama called “Boys Over Flowers.” It was based on the Japanese manga and anime called “Hana yori dango” and was broadcast in Korea in 2009. It is a typical shojo Cinderella story of a poor high school girl who is befriended by the four richest, most handsome boys in the school, the F4. It became super popular in Korea, and later, in many other Asian countries including Japan. With “Boys Over Flowers”, the male image of the “kkotminam” became even more popular in Korea. More and more males aspired to look soft and gentle and pretty. Men’s fashion came to include pinks and floral prints, and cute “boyish” hairstyles with long bangs became the rage (Lee 2010).\nAdvertising has played an important role in spreading the FM image. Cosmetics companies have been very eager to sell cosmetics to this whole new group of buyers. Large areas of department stores are now devoted to men’s beauty care. Famous idols and actors, including members of both the DBSK and the F4, are used to advertise men’s beauty products. More and more men in Korea aspire to look like these idols.\nThe Korean economy is very strong now. This makes it possible for many Korean men to spend their money on personal beauty. With the economic power they become more confident, and more men want to look good even if it costs them.\nA major reason for the “kkonminam” craze is that men want to look good to be competitive in the job market. They want to have “the right face”, which looks youthful, lively, friendly, and upper-class. Job applicants must send in photographs with their applications. Many Koreans believe that a person’s character can be read in the face, and even that their looks are more important than their skills (Jeffreys 2007).\nHistorically, Korean is a country ruled by strong Confucian ideals, which emphasize taking care of and making both the mind and the body strong. It is said that one reason for the “hallyu” (“hanryu” or “Korean Wave”) throughout East Asia is that the men are good-looking but show “a lack of profanity and sex, as befitting Confucian morals” (Maliangkay 2010).\nDavid Coad believes that sports figures, such as David Beckham have been important in popularizing the metrosexual and the FB trend. They stand for traditional masculinity in their sports skills, but they also take care of their personal appearance in ways that were once thought feminine. The long-haired Korean soccer player, Ahn Jung-Hwan became very popular at the 2002 World Cup. He is known not only for his soccer skills, but also for his looks and his actions that show a softer side of men. He kissed his wedding ring after winning a major game. Then, he went on to advertise men’s liquid foundation. Coad writes:\nThe immediately obvious hyper-masculine and generally assumed heterosexual status of most sportsmen has been vital in changing attitudes about exposing, eroticizing, and taking care of the male body. Without some of the most celebrated heterosexual athletes in the world endorsing and embodying different facets of metrosexuality it is uncertain if masculinity norms would have changed so rapidly in so many different cultures. Metrosexuality, in a way, is indebted to sportsmen for its very existence. (Coad 2008)\nSome people believe the most important reason the FM phenomenon is spreading throughout Korea, but especially in urban areas, is that women like it. Bae Yong-joon, who was so popular in the tv drama “Autumn Sonata”, is also well liked among somewhat older Korean women. His popularity is based on his character in the drama which was soft looking, passionate, sincere, and polite. James Turnbull, who writes for The Korea Times, has an interesting theory about the origins of the FM.\nWhen focusing on men, it can be easy to lose sight of the fact that it is actually women’s changing tastes in them that drive changes in their fashions and grooming jabits, and accordingly it ultimately proves to be married Korean women in the late-1990s that are responsible for flower men’s origins. (Turnbull 2009)\nTurnbull goes on to explain that during the “IMF Crisis” of 1997, many more women were laid off from their companies than men were because it was assumed that their husbands could support them. They had only recently gotten the legal right to not be fired upon marriage. Then they were encouraged by society to support “Korean’s hardworking men” to help get through the crisis. He says that many women, at this time, started to reject “the ideals of men as strong, provider types, and it is no coincidence that a sudden glut of movies appeared featuring romances between older women and younger men, and that this was when the first, identifiable, flower men began appearing in advertising too.” Korean women wanted men who were more interested in satisfying them than their companies (Turnbull 2009).\nIt is obvious that many females from mid-teens to their 30s also like the FM. They fill social media sites with comments about popular singers and actors. They use various interesting words to describe the men: pretty, sweet looking, a hootie, cute, looks like a pretty girl, etc. One blogger on Korean pop culture expresses what seem to be the views of many young women:\nSo why do flower boys act like women? There is only one answer to this. Because their fans love it. I guess there is something about a handsome man trying to act like a woman which makes them even more endearing. Somehow, there is an inexplicable and irresistible urge that makes women want to pinch flower boys’ cheeks every time they do their “cute acts”…flower boys are pretty to look at and they are cute and entertaining. But, why are they so popular? The ultimate reason, I believe, is that flower boys represent certain qualities of a man women look for – a man unafraid to explore his soft side…his emotional side and admit that he is vain after all. (Deen 2011)\nAbout those pretty cheeks the women want to pinch, many times they might be pretty as a result of plastic surgery. The Korean Association for Plastic Surgeons estimated that in 2010 approximately 15% of Korean men had plastic surgery. The Korean Herald reported that 44% of male college students were considering plastic surgery (“Think plastic surgery” 2013).\nIn an excellent article on cosmetic surgery in Korea, Ruth Holliday and Jo Hwang point out that plastic surgery is popular and accepted in Korean society. The former president of Korea, among many other famous people have had work done on their faces. They write that “the body emerges as a site for negotiating and reinforcing national identity.” After1945, Koreans wanted to look more western in order to look very different from the Japanese colonizers. Later, they wanted to embrace their Koreanness by consulting with fortune tellers of physiognomy to find out what is their particular auspicious face. Surgeons and physiognomists often work together in the clinics. A survey found that 7 of 10 Koreans approve of plastic surgery, and even more say they would do it if they had the money. The government supports plastic surgery tourism, does not control the industry strictly, and even approves of it through the insurance program in many cases. With plastic surgery accepted so widely in Korea, it is not surprising that men are commonly having surgery on their eyelids to make them look bigger, on their noses to make them more pointed, and on their jaws to make them look less angular. Liposuction to suck out fat is also popular among men. (Holliday & Hwang n.d.)\nThe Flower Man as a positive male image partly has its origins in the worldwide metrosexual trend and in Japanese manga and anime. It is, however, uniquely Korean. It was made popular by the “soft masculinity” of pop idols and actors in dramas. It has been promoted by advertising of cosmetic firms who want to open up and make money in the new market of male beauty aids. This happened just at a time when the Korean economy was relatively strong. The Korean job market is very competitive, and appearance is important. Nonsexual boys fit in with traditional Confucian ideals. Sportsmen have shown that a man can be traditionally masculine and traditionally feminine at the same time. Some women want men to be a mixture of male and female, more androgynous, and not masculine Rambo types. Finally, striving for ideal beauty (and the range of what is considered “beauty” seems to be quite narrow in Korea) and using means such as plastic surgery to get it has been a part of the Korean culture for a long time. Procedures such as cosmetic surgery are readily accepted by the general public.\nSouth Korea is a country with a military draft. All men must serve in the military for at least one year. Some men said they started using face creams as soldiers because they wanted protection in the sunshine. It is even possible to buy a set of camouflage face paint, healthier for the skin than the usual, to wear during military service. (Ling 2012) This shows that the traditionally male identity and the newer Flower Man identity are blending well in Korean society.\n- Coad, David. (2008).

43	As a saltwater angler, what's the difference between east coast and gulf coast fishing resources and crab regulations?	The east coast has several dedicated resources including Pierandsurf.com for shore anglers, Nor'east Saltwater magazine, and Cape Hatteras Surf Fishing Reports. For the Gulf Coast, there are platforms like Reel Gulf Coast Fishing with marine conditions and Fish or Shut up focusing on southwest Florida. Regarding crab regulations, which apply across regions, crab traps must be marked with a 2-inch stainless steel self-locking tag, have at least three escape rings, and cannot be placed in navigable channels. Metal crab traps are specifically restricted in certain Gulf waters like the Calcasieu River System.

44	How do the dew point and freezing point differ in terms of their relationship with water and atmospheric conditions?	The dew point and freezing point represent different temperature thresholds for water. The dew point is the temperature at which water vapor in the air condenses into liquid water (dew), which occurs when the air can no longer hold water vapor in gaseous form. The freezing point, on the other hand, is the temperature at which liquid water begins to freeze, specifically at 0°C (32°F). While the dew point relates to atmospheric moisture and affects humidity levels and comfort, varying based on the amount of water vapor present in the air, the freezing point is a fixed temperature threshold for the phase change of liquid water to ice.

The phrase “relative humidity” is more familiar compared to the term “dewpoint”, but humidity can fluctuate depending on the temperature.\nIn fact, higher relative humidity values occur in the morning when the temperature is low, and the relative humidity falls during the day when the temperature is high — but the amount of moisture stays the same.\nThis is why the “dewpoint” is helpful in communicating the amount of moisture in the air: Unless wind is transferring warmer or drier air into a region, the dewpoint is going to stay relatively constant until there is a change in the wind.\nWhat is the “dewpoint”?\nThe air we breathe consists of a mixture of gases including oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor (as well as mix of other trace gases).\nWater vapor is simply water in gaseous form, and greater amounts of water vapor can be present in warmer temperatures compared to cooler temperatures.\nWhen air is cooled to a certain point, the water vapor within the air is also cooled to the point that it can no longer remain in a gaseous state — it then condenses into liquid water, which we call “dew”.\nSo the dewpoint is the temperature at which air needs to cool in order for water vapor to condense into liquid water. The dewpoint is the limit at which air can cool, so on dewy mornings, the coolest air temperatures are close to — if not equal to — the dewpoint.\nThe dewpoint also impacts stormy weather: If the air has higher amounts of water vapor within it, this water vapor will provide the “fuel” necessary for thunderstorms to develop. In a nutshell, the higher the dewpoint, the more humid the atmosphere — and the more “fuel” available to develop thunderstorms.\nWhat does the dewpoint have to do with comfort level?\nIn a nutshell: the higher the dewpoint, the more muggy or “miserable” it feels to be outside. But why?\nThe higher the dewpoint, the more water vapor that is present in the atmosphere. This means that any liquid water on the earth’s surface (or perhaps the surface of your skin) will have a hard time evaporating and changing from liquid to gas — it’s as if the atmosphere is saying “no thanks, we’re full”. In true scientific terms, the atmosphere is close to saturation when the air temperature is close to (if not equal to) the dewpoint.\nSweat contains a mixture of salt as well as liquid water — and if the dewpoint is high enough, the water within the sweat won’t evaporate off of your skin. It’s that evaporative process that cools your body: Heat is drawn from your body to the atmosphere when sweat evaporates, causing your body to cool.\nSo if the dewpoint is too high, the body’s cooling mechanism breaks down — sweat builds up, but its got no where to go. As a result, you feel damp and clammy and…well, miserable.\nThe dewpoint and you: Your daily forecast\nYou may not necessarily notice the dewpoint in our on-air presentations, but we do reference it from time to time in some of our tower camera banners.\nFor the next week or so, dewpoints will be rather high (in the mid to upper 60s) as tropical air continues to flow into the Southeast. This muggy air will continue to provide the possibility of rain showers and thunderstorms for the next several days.

45	who sponsored howard carter egypt expedition when did he find tutankhamun tomb what happened to sponsor	Lord Carnarvon sponsored Howard Carter's expedition to find Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt. Carter and Carnarvon made history when they became the first people to enter King Tutankhamun's tomb in over 3,000 years. The discovery was made in late 1922, with Carter unsealing the burial chamber on February 16, 1923. Tragically, Lord Carnarvon (George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon) died shortly after the discovery on April 5, 1923, as recorded in British records of that year. He was an English financier of Egyptian excavations who had been born in 1866.

46	How does someone with a behavioral addiction respond in their brain compared to someone addicted to drugs?	When behaviors such as gambling or sex are engaged, it triggers the release of pleasure hormones and initiates a reward signal, similar to how most addictive drugs act on the pleasure and reward centers of the brain.	['Addiction is a destructive disease that can lead to once-unthinkable consequences. And the addiction doesn’t have to be to heroin, alcohol, cocaine, or any chemical substance for that matter. It is possible and more common than one may think, to be addicted to a particular behavior. Substance addiction and behavioral addiction are different, but there are also a number of similarities between those who struggle with either form of addiction.\nWhen searching for a definition of addiction, most sources focus on chemical dependency and substance addiction. Even on the American Psychiatry Association (APA) website, addiction is defined as “a complex condition, a brain disease that is manifested by compulsive substance use despite harmful consequence”. Note the use of the term “substance use”. However, we discussed above that behavioral addictions are not that different from substance addiction. Unfortunately, the APA definition reads the way it does because the only behavioral addiction listed in the DSM-V is gambling due to insufficient evidence to support other behavioral addictions. The DSM-V is the most widely used publication guiding the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders.\nStanley Peele is a psychologist, psychotherapist, and co-author of the book Love and Addiction. In this publication, Peele describes addiction as when addicted individuals are dependent on a particular set of experiences and goes on to explain that the reaction to chemical substances is just one example of this dependence. This somewhat broader understanding of addiction seems more accurate when considering the reality of behavioral addictions.\nThe APA definition of addiction being a compulsion to use substances despite harmful consequences is quite accurate when referring to chemical substance addiction. Dependency is when the substance needs to be consumed in order for the individual to simply feel normal. An individual with chemical dependency likely will experience withdrawal symptoms if they discontinue drug use. Physical dependence is one criterion for diagnosing a substance use disorder, but the two usually go hand in hand. Treating drug and alcohol addiction requires addressing the physical effects, as well as the behavioral issues that may be associated with use.\nBehavioral addiction is a psychological dependence on a particular set of experiences that are not a reaction to chemical substances, rather behaviors. Unlike a drug or alcohol addiction, someone with a behavioral addiction is not experiencing a physical addiction to anything. This lack of physical addiction means many signs that make it easy to identify the addiction may not be present.\nExamples of behavioral addictions include:\n- Gambling addiction\n- Eating disorders\n- Sex Addiction\n- Gaming Addiction\n- Shopping Addiction\n- Pornography Addiction\n- Exercise Addiction\nHow are substance and behavioral addictions alike?\nThe multitude of similarities between substance addiction and behavioral addictions may be surprising to many. Most addictive drugs act on the pleasure and reward centers of the brain. Similarly, when behaviors such as gambling or sex are engaged, it triggers the release of pleasure hormones and initiates a reward signal. Additionally, addiction to behaviors can have consequences on the same areas of one’s life as drug addiction. The addict may display functional impairments in there work, relationships, and in various social situations. In both cases, the addict is also likely to continue on with their behavior despite negative consequences that arise.\nBehavioral Therapy & Addiction\nAlthough most behavioral addictions are not covered in the DSM-V, behavioral therapy is recognized as one of the most effective forms of treatment for addiction. The goal of behavioral therapy is to identify unhealthy behaviors and change them to produce better outcomes. Behavioral therapy is a promising treatment option for individuals struggling with any form of addiction, but treatment plans should be personalized to meet each individual’s needs.']	['<urn:uuid:9992e3d1-caf4-47e7-8dda-442e1e778741>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	17	37	612
47	cities digital adoption worldwide benefits and privacy security concerns	Digital adoption offers benefits like economic growth and improved services, with the Arab world seeing a 31% increase in tech investments reaching $900M in 2018. However, there are significant privacy concerns, as smart city programs involve extensive data collection that could reveal sensitive personal information like living locations, work patterns, and medical issues. Cities must find a balance between utilizing data for optimization while protecting citizens' privacy rights and preventing unauthorized access to personal information.	['The Arab world needs to fast-track balanced regulation that supports the opportunities created by the Fourth Industrial Revolution while protecting data privacy, if it is to capitalize on the region’s emerging technology scene.\nThe Middle East and North Africa boasts a growing number of start-ups, with a 31% increase in investments to $900 million in 2018 compared to 2017 across sectors including transport, healthcare and fintech. Such businesses offer the potential for a new wave of economic growth in a part of the world traditionally handicapped by weak infrastructure and a limited industrial base.\n“I view the Fourth Industrial Revolution as our opportunity to catch up, as our opportunity to leapfrog and actually get to parity with the rest of the world,” said Mudassir Sheikha, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of ride-hailing firm Careem.\nCareem has emerged as a poster-child for the Arab digital economy after it was acquired last month by Uber for $3.1 billion – a milestone for Arab tech deal-making. It comes on the heels of the $580 million purchase of Dubai-based e-commerce company Souq by Amazon in 2017.\nAfter steam, mass production and information technology, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is bringing accelerating cycles of innovation, driven by artificial intelligence, robotics and biotechnology. It offers the promise of new high-tech jobs in a region struggling with high levels of youth unemployment – provided countries can deliver the right educational foundations.\nBut the rapid pace of change also raises concerns at a time when digital giants such as Facebook are confronted by a growing “techlash” over data privacy. Regional sensitivities over cultural norms add an extra level of complexity.\n“It’s a very nuanced situation,” said Wafa Ben-Hassine, Counsel, Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Policy at Access Now, who argues that governments in the region must adopt a user-centred framework to ensure privacy and freedom from surveillance and censorship.\nSome countries are already moving to embrace the new technological future, with Bahrain – recently selected as the site of new Amazon data centres – having passed a law allowing data stored there by foreign companies to be governed by laws of their home country.\n“We think that is going to be a ground-breaking law,” said Khalid Al Rumaihi, Chief Executive, Bahrain Economic Development Board. “We, of course, have to manage risk but we have to not ignore opportunity.”\nThe United Arab Emirates, meanwhile, has appointed Omar bin Sultan Al Olama as the world’s first Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, underscoring the Gulf state’s determination to carve out a niche in the new digital world.\n“Not one country is going to lead in the Fourth Industrial Revolution,” Al Olama said. “There are going to be hubs of excellence across the world and each hub is going to champion one or two domains – and we want to champion the domain of government, first and foremost.”\nFor governments and companies alike, the new digital economy will bring pluses and minuses, especially when it comes to employment prospects – a dilemma showcased vividly by Careem, which has created 1 million jobs since it started operating seven years ago, but could also destroy employment with the arrival of autonomous cars.\nIn practice, Sheikha said, the impact of self-driving cars will be felt more gradually in the Middle East thanks to cheaper labour costs, with driver costs accounting for an average 25% of trip expenses in the region against 80% in the United States.\nIn region known for its big governments, it is important that regulations do not create stumbling-blocks to optimizing the benefits of technology, according to Murat Sönmez, Managing Director and Head of the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Global Network, World Economic Forum. “We need to make sure we don’t get in the way of the potential.”\nAnd Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman, World Economic Forum, warned that the Middle East simply cannot afford to be left behind. “Those countries that absorb the potential of the Fourth Industrial Revolution first will be the most competitive countries,” he said. “We have to make sure that countries and regions are not lagging behind.”\nUzbek home appliance manufacturer Artel joins United Nations Global Compact\nThis week, Artel Electronics LLC (Artel), Central Asia’s largest home appliance and electronics manufacturer, has become an official participant of the United Nation Global Compact (UNGC). Launched in 2000, the UNGC is a voluntary leadership platform for the development, implementation, and disclosure of responsible business practices. Artel becomes Uzbekistan’s third company to participate.\nArtel joins over 10,000 companies worldwide, including Microsoft, Facebook and Nestlé, in affirming the Compact’s ten principles. These include a commitment to human rights, labour standards, sustainability, and anti-corruption. The company will also seek opportunities to promote the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As one of the country’s largest companies, Artel’s membership will provide significant momentum towards the alignment of the Uzbek private sector with international standards.\nFurthermore, Artel has become a founding member of the Coalition of Business Champions for the Sustainable Development of Uzbekistan. Artel will use its position alongside coalition partners to promote placing environmental and social considerations at the heart of the country’s growth. This builds on the company’s significant work on water provision, gender equality and education.\nBektemir Murodov, CFO of Artel Electronics, said: “We are delighted to join the UN Global Compact and become part of such a proactive global community of businesses working towards sustainable development. As a large Uzbek company, we have a huge responsibility to promote sustainability as well as international labour standards, human rights and anti-corruption. This reaffirms our commitment to these principles.\nWe also know that this is a great opportunity to learn from some of the world’s leading companies, and we look forward to taking an active part in the conversation around how to promote the SDGs in Uzbekistan.”\nBecoming a participant of the UNGC is the next step in Artel’s ESG development. The company has restructured its corporate governance to align with international best practice, and continually works to increase the efficiency of its products and reduce the environmental impact of its operations. Artel also has significant social projects that focus on water access and education. Most recently, Artel promoted the UN’s 16 days of Activism against Gender-based Violence and will soon launch a Women’s Development Programme with a legal clinic to promote legal literacy and gender equality.\nWorld Bank Provides $100 Million to Accelerate Rwanda’s Digital Transformation\nThe World Bank Group today approved $100 million in financing under the International Development Association’s (IDA) Scale Up Window to help the Government of Rwanda increase access to broadband and selected digital public services, and strengthen the digital innovation ecosystem in Rwanda.\nThe new Digital Acceleration Project will support the government to expand digital access and adoption by spearheading a series of innovative digital access and inclusion initiatives, including supporting 250,000 households with financing to help acquire smart devices as well as training three million people in basic digital literacy (with targets for girls and women).\nThe project will also enhance the government’s digital service capabilities by equipping it with the ability to harness the power of big data and develop at least 30 new or upgraded digital services through large-scale investments in shared digital standards, platforms, and infrastructure. These will enable the government to safely scale more fully transactional and remote service delivery, including enrolling and issuing new digital ID credentials to 75 percent of the population. Finally, the project will increase Rwanda’s capacity to support digitally enabled innovation by strengthening the local entrepreneurship ecosystem, developing Rwanda’s digital talent base and helping tech firms to move from startup to growth. At least 300 digital start-ups will be directly supported by the project, with a focus on those that are female-owned.\n“Expanding digital access and adoption, enhancing digital public service delivery and promoting digitally enabled innovation are essential for Rwanda’s digital transformation which can in turn help drive a robust post-COVID-19 recovery,” said Rolande Pryce, World Bank Country Manager for Rwanda. “The Rwanda Digital Acceleration Project encompasses all these elements and will contribute to Rwanda’s vision to become a knowledge-based economy and upper middle-income country by 2035, by leveraging digital technologies to accelerate growth and poverty reduction.”\nThe project will also support Rwanda’s efforts to crowd in private sector investment in digital inclusion initiatives, digital infrastructure and through support for digital innovation and entrepreneurship – with the goal of preparing the country for a data-driven and e-service based economy capable of supporting sustainable recovery in a post-COVID-19 context.\n“For Rwanda to leverage digital transformation as a driver of growth, job creation and greater service delivery, digital adoption needs to markedly improve. This project will help Rwanda tackle the affordability of digital devices and services, but also bridge lingering basic digital literacy gaps, to increase local demand for digitally-enabled services and platforms,” said Isabella Hayward, World Bank Digital Development Specialist, and Task Team Leader of the project. “The project will also support the GoR’s aspirations of providing 24-hour, cashless, paperless and fully transactional Government-to-Government, Government-to-Business, and Government-to-Person e-services both at the central government and sectoral levels.”\nThe project will be co-financed in the amount of $100 million by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), of which Rwanda is a non-regional member. This will be the AIIB’s second investment in Rwanda, and the first digital project investment financing to be co-financed with the AIIB.\nThe City of Ideas platform is a unique opportunity to make the city comfortable\nThe Moscow City of Ideas platform is a platform where citizens can propose ideas for solving various issues related to the life of the capital and vote for proposals selected by experts.\nIdeas with the largest number of votes are implemented in the city. Over the seven years of such projects, more than 270 thousand Muscovites have sent about 112 thousand ideas for the development of urban infrastructure. More than four thousands of them were selected by experts for further study, over three thousand ideas have already been implemented.\nThe citizens took part in projects like “My Park”, “Electronic House”, “Moscow Central Diameters”, “Moscow child health center”, “Museums of Moscow” and much more. Thanks to the proposed ideas, new public transport routes have appeared, a Moscow standard for children’s recreation has been developed, public service centers, children’s and adult clinics, libraries, and parks have been transformed.\nAfter modernization, the City of Ideas platform has become more user-friendly. Citizens themselves propose suggestions of improving the platform. 12 thousand residents of the capital took part in the project. They proposed with over 600 ideas. The implementation plan included 121 of them, some have already been implemented.\nToday, the platform provides short video instructions and materials explaining how to use platform. This will help both beginners and advanced users. Now citizens can submit their ideas directly from the platform’s main page. When sending a photo attached to the text.\nThe modernization also affected the voting process: the ideas that pass the expert selection will be presented in a single list. You don’t need to go to each page for grading.\nAnd most importantly, the City of Ideas platform today has a modern design. These changes were suggested and supported by the citizens.\nThis service is available to individuals, representatives of legal entities and individual entrepreneurs.\nIsraeli competition against Egypt in the energy and natural gas sector\nSince the success of the (June 30th revolution and the departure of the Muslim Brotherhood’s rule in Egypt), then the...\nEducation Must Come First in Cameroon: Yasmine Sherif calls for an end to attacks on schools\nThe future of humanity hangs in the balance.

It brings up new innovative technologies and possibilities but also risks and could have unpredictable outcomes and consequences. A good way to portray the size and growth potential of smart city market is that today over half of global GDP is produced by 380 cities and by 2025 the estimates are that 600 cities will be responsible for more than 60% of economic growth (Iliev, 2018). For the sake of comparison there were over 4000 cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants in 2015 and to this date that number has undeniably only grown bigger (Brilliant Maps, 2018).\nThe IoT (Internet of Things) has given a possibility for cities to make themselves more reachable and interconnected with its citizens and the technological advancements in data gathering and analyzing will lead to substantial cost savings and economic growth. This will also give outside investors a chance to be part of these rapidly growing programs. The effect of big and smart cities in global economy and future growth cannot be underlined enough. And if estimates come true, 66% percent of human population will be living in urban areas by the year 2050 and therefore there needs to be major accomplishments in technology and proper allocation of resources to handle this huge population (Low, 2018).\nWhat Makes a City Smart?A city might have a large population and a lot of big companies in technology and business, local public transportation and a good economical situation. But what makes a city smart is the communication, data collection and analyzation of this data and the use of it in daily life. Whether it is about optimizing the public transportation to efficiently match the needs of citizens and the current traffic flow or adjusting the lighting and heating in an office building based on the amount of natural light and warmth and more importantly the location of workers and the nature of work they are doing. The optimizing based on people’s location and the things they do extends all the way to water and energy usage and transportation and sewerage (Gardner, M., Brown, M. and Petel, G. 2018), (du Preez, 2017).\nAll these things have a huge impact on citizen well-being, cost-savings due to optimizing the usage of energy and water, transportation all-around and on environmentally sustainable life in a city. An optimal and desirable smart city is efficient, focused on making life better on all areas, non-discriminating, environmentally friendly and sustainable and has a wide range of possibilities on communication with the citizens and is continuously listening to ideas for improvement. That is a place everyone would be happy to live and should be a target for all governments and city councils all around the globe.\nStrategy of Smart City Investing\nAs a company investing in a smart city is a little different from usual as there is also the government and city council to cooperate with and that lays out some new challenges that separate the smart city investing from regular business to business or business to customer -based thinking. There is a lot of restrictions involving the procedures used, quality, sustainability, safety and privacy and all the work has to be done with close interactions and communication with the authorities and there needs to be a report on everything that is done or will be done and it has to be properly and with caution delivered to the authorities who verify and check everything to make sure it matches the restrictions (Gardner, M., Brown, M. and Petel, G. 2018).\nSince there is a lot of competition on the technological field concerning smart cities, the company absolutely needs to have a stand-out innovation plan that most proficiently fills the needs of the city and is sustainable, environmentally friendly and has an overall positive economic impact. And there must be a realistic plan to reach these requirements since failure in a matter of this significance and size is not really an option to the city and therefore the strict restrictions are in place.\nThere has been a lot of talk about the privacy concerns a smart city faces since the whole idea is based on data collecting and analyzing. One idea to most effectively keep the information safe is to cooperate with technology-businesses that have a lot of experience in protecting data and all kinds of challenges it creates like Google, Apple and Facebook. Cities using this data will have to find the happy medium in the depth of the data analyzing since eventually there will be a gray area of information that the citizens will not be willing to give up for use and don’t want to risk losing that information to third parties.\nA lot of the smart city ideas are based on following the locations of people. For example when a person wants to go to a business meeting in the center of the city with a car during the worst rush hour, an app could tell him where the nearest free parking spot is and where he has to turn to access this parking spot. Eventually this kind of location monitoring adds up to patterns that reveal extremely indistinguishable information about people that they certainly do not want to share. That kind of information can be where they live and work, what kind of hobbies they have, where do their friends live and what kind of medical issues they have. At some point in addition the law comes an obstacle in at least most of the modern states that value human rights and privacy (Gardner, M., Brown, M. and Petel, G. 2018).\nWays of Investing in a Smart City Ways of investing in a smart city vary on all levels of imagination. Whether it is about funding a sustainable green energy project just outside the city to cover a major part of the energy consumption in the city or developing a new kind of data storage system that can handle the massive amount of data collected and can withstand the growth of that data in the future as well (Iliev, 2018).\nMost likely the most used way of investing is and will be buying shares of the companies that have the connections and possibilities to in a major way affect some aspect of smart city technology and can be most profitable in the long run. An investor has to be extremely careful when investing in these companies though, since the smart city program is relatively new and we do not yet know how everything will turn out with it because there are no experiences from the past to compare to. In addition there is a massive amount of technology companies that want to be part of these programs but only a small proportion of them will succeed and have a profitable role in the smart city world. An investor needs to find the most potent, innovative, stable, ambitious and well-funded companies that have the necessary elements to be a successful operator in the field.\nEconomic Benefits of a Smart CityI\nmplementation of the Internet of Things allows a city to create variety of ways to both save and generate money through reducing energy and water usage and being more efficient in car-parking and speeding fines to name a few. Most importantly applying Internet of Things in the basic fundamentals of a city saves everyone’s time, money and effort and also the environment as the data collected allows cities to adjust their services and businesses to most efficiently do their work (Eichler, 2018).\nA significant effect on being a stable and profit generating city is that it attracts even more investors to make the city an even better place to live through continuous investment and new smart technology projects.\nThere has been concerns about the funding necessary for cities to start a program to implement the Internet of Things even though the overall amount of money invested in smart cities is exponentially growing. The reasons to this are mainly location- and state -based since the main proportion of funding comes from the local authorities (Eichler, 2018).\nIf a proper plan is introduced, a smart city project will get a big share of private funding, but as mentioned before, the privacy and security concerns need to be properly addressed and that requires the local authorities to have a substantial part in the developing and maintaining process, hence the need for local funding too. In addition the city itself is always held accountable for the safety and functionality of the technological systems and the area as a whole. Therefore it is understandable that the first thing to start a smart city program is to find a government-backed funding plan. Other significant reason for the hold-ups of smart city projects is the lack of infrastructure to back the systems needed to create a sufficient technological entity for the Internet of Things to be implemented (Eichler, 2018). Business Insider’s estimation of Internet of Things attracted investments. (Business Insider Intelligence)\nAs the technology grows and people keep on moving in large cities after work, family and way of life, the cities have to create more ways to save costs and at the same time be more reachable and environmentally friendly. This offers numerous chances for investors as technology companies implementing the Internet of things line up for cities to choose from. Investment choice has to be even more carefully planned than usual since the massive competition in the field compared to the amount of companies that will actually be used to build up the city’s communications- and data analyzing -systems.\nThere is a bright future in the technology-business considering the smart city programs. There is also a moral incentive as the smart city idea itself is to quarantee the well-being of the citizens and to provide sustainable and environmentally friendly services and power in addition to a huge impact on economic growth.\n- Iliev, I.

48	what two main sources liability employers face from internet harassment claims	Employers face two main sources of increased liability: 1) terminated employees seeking to add internet harassment claims to their wrongful dismissal claims, and 2) employees quitting and claiming 'constructive dismissal' based on the employer's failure to protect them from internet harassment.	['How ‘internet harassment’ could affect your workplace\nBy John Hyde\nEDITOR’S NOTE: ‘Legal steps & missteps: Addressing common workplace concerns’ is a weekly Talent Canada series, in partnership with John Hyde of Hyde HR Law in Toronto. This series takes a deeper look at issues in which organizations can be proactive to prevent legal issues and highlight where common errors occur.\nThe Ontario Superior Court of Justice has just opened the door to a new category of personal injury claims, based on harassment over the internet.\nEmployers should take note, as failing to take active steps to protect employees from internet harassment could lead to costly missteps and serious liability.\nWhat is internet harassment?\nIn a recent February 2021 decision, an Ontario court recognized a new category of personal injury in the form of “internet harassment.”\nThe facts of that case were extreme: The defendant, by the name of Atas, carried out a “systemic campaign of malicious falsehood,” including anonymous unsupported claims of pedophilia and sexual predation, against a wide-ranging group of individuals and organizations, including a former employer. The court found that Atas’ conduct was culpable because she intended to (and did) cause fear, anxiety, emotional upset, and harmed the dignity of her victims.\nWhile most employers know better than to publicly sling mud at ex-employees, the new tort of internet harassment potentially expands a different kind of liability — workplace harassment from external sources.\nA lesser-known employer obligation is the duty to protect employees from workplace harassment from members of the public.\nThe court’s decision in Atas now makes it very clear that internet harassment is a form of workplace harassment, which is serious, actionable, and results in liability.\nThe common employer misstep? Assuming that coping with online vitriol is just part of the job for some employees.\nWhat kind of internet harassment must employers protect employees from?\nImplausible as it may seem, some case law from the labour relations space suggests that employers have an active duty to respond to keyboard warriors who publish abusive messages about employees on social media platforms like Twitter.\nWhile the @TTChelps did not participate in any of the abusive behaviour, it failed to respond adequately to violent, racist, and homophobic tweets about TTC employees, by merely directing the abusers to TTC’s help line or e-mail address.\nThe inherent difficulty in protecting employees from internet harassment\nProtecting some employees from internet harassment may seem like a Sisyphean task. Social media allows customers to be more rude and less empathetic than ever before, and it is a constant, inescapable presence for many employees.\nHow do you protect a social media manager from rage-fuelled discussions on twitter? How do you protect service employees from cruel customers who are looking for an excuse to get angry? How do you protect employees from so-called “doxing” (a form of targeted internet harassment where an individual or organization’s previously private personal information is disclosed publicly)? Who protects the protectors?\nThese questions are becoming more and more pressing, as the law continues to adapt and recognize the harm that online words can inflict.\nAs this develops, more voices are joining social media platforms every day. At the same time, most service and retail companies now consider a social media presence to be mandatory, and the companies that opt out are being left behind.\nPotential liability for employers\nEmployers now face two main sources of increased liability:\n- First, employers may see a surge in terminated employees seeking to “tie in” claims of internet harassment to their wrongful dismissal claims.\n- Second, more employees may quit claiming “constructive dismissal” based upon the employer’s failure to protect them from internet harassment.\nBoth sources of liability can be unexpected, and employers who take a passive approach to online harassment may be blindsided by unexpected demand letters from lawyers.\nWhat can employers do to protect themselves?\nThis is a very big question for employers, and we expect that it will continue to be a big question for years to come as the law in this area develops.\nGenerally, we recommend that employers approach these issues with four main principles in mind:\n- Recognition is key — employers need to be aware that online vitriol against employees is not just background noise; it is a serious potential source of liability.\n- If a company has a social media presence, it must ensure it takes an active role in responding to abusive messages.\n- As always, employers must ensure that all complaints of harassment from employees are investigated and responded to accordingly — including complaints that do not necessarily use the word “harassment.”\n- In the event of any uncertainty, seek legal advice.\nJohn Hyde advises management on all aspects of employment and labour law, including representation before administrative tribunals, collective agreement negotiation, arbitrations, wrongful dismissal defence and human rights.\nNicholas Goldhawk, an associate at Hyde HR Law, co-wrote this commentary.\nPrint this page\n- Montreal businesses clean up after anti-curfew protest turns violent\n- Salesforce to allow vaccinated employees to return to work: report']	['<urn:uuid:77b76415-ed86-4389-be3d-747a4760ae7e>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	11	41	840

The site chosen was Waverley in Surrey, and the abbey was colonized from the Norman abbey of L'Aumone. The expansion of Cistercian monasteries was rapid afterward, with about fifty new foundations added by the end of King Stephen's reign in 1154.

Thomas\nAlthough holy wells and certain other religious sites generally pre-date the grand medieval abbeys of Wales, like the surviving Castles of Wales, medieval abbeys still dominate the Welsh landscape today. The ruined abbeys of Wales have their own set of unique charms and special histories, tempting visitors to learn more about Britain's medieval monastic past. These structures often overwhelm us with their size and still fire the imagination as we try to picture them in their former glory prior to the Dissolution. But at the same time, they can invoke a sense of sadness as well because of their purposeful destruction that resulted from the political struggles between church and state during the reign of Henry VIII.\nAny discussion of the abbeys of Wales must, by necessity, lead to the Cistercians. The Cistercian order dominated Wales for nearly four centuries prior to the Dissolution. Immediately following the main menu below, you will find an essay discussing the influence of the Cistercian order in England and Wales, taken from the Cadw guidebooks for Tintern and Strata Florida abbeys.\nIn addition to her marvellous abbeys, Wales is home to other important religious sites as well, including handsome cathedrals and mystical holy wells. We recommend that you take the time to visit some of these marvellous ruins and holy sites, monuments that represent an important part of the medieval heritage of Wales.\nBelow: view of the dormitory and its fine selection of sculptured grave slabs at Valle Crucis Abbey in north Wales.\nA List of Abbeys, Churches, Religious, and Pre-Medieval Sites\nHoly Wells & Other Sites:\n- St Cybi's Well\n- St Davids Bishops Palace\n- St Non's Chapel & Holy Well\n- St Seiriol's Well\n- St Winifred's Well\n- Abbey Cwmhir (Welsh Language version)\n- Basingwerk Abbey\n- Cymer Abbey\n- Margam Abbey\n- Neath Abbey\n- St. Dogmaels Abbey\n- Strata Florida Abbey (Welsh Language version)\n- Talley Abbey\n- Tintern Abbey\n- Valle Crucis Abbey\nCathedrals & Priories:\nMonasticism in 12th-century Wales was ripe for a change. There were still those who recalled the memory of St David (Dewi Sant) of Wales, who had - according to his biographer - 'imitated the monks of Egypt and lived a life like theirs'. But St David's legendary austerities - his hard manual labour, his vegetarian diet, his constant genuflexions and cold baths - were no longer regularly practised by the self-indulgent hereditary canons of the Welsh clas churches. These ancient mother-churches, once the pioneer instruments of Christian conversion, were well-endowed communities, often headed by monk-bishops. But they had learned to guard the spheres of influence like so many old hens, and they were riddled with every vice of private property.\nSt Benedict formulated his Rule, laying down the way of life for Christian religious community, as far back as A.D. 540 at Monte Cassino in Italy. By the 8th century this Rule had been widely adopted by monasteries throughout western Europe, which can thus be styled Benedictine. In England, these were to receive serious setbacks during the Scandinavian invasions of the 9th century. However, from about 940 the Benedictines saw a great revival, and by the Norman Conquest they were well established in many parts of the country. In contrast, Wales had remained outside mainstream European monastic developments. From the 6th century onwards, it retained its own brand of Celtic monasticism, based on ideals initially introduced to its western shores by early missionary saints.\nAlmost inevitably, standards of discipline and devotion varied from one monastic house to another, but by the later 11th century there was growing dissatisfaction with the regime of existing Benedictine abbeys. Gradually, there emerged a reforming spirit, a movement aimed at correcting abuses and introducing fresh ideals to the monastic life. It was from this impulse that the Cistercian order was born. It takes its name from Citeaux, a monastery near Dijon in Burgundy where, in 1098, a group of pioneering monks settled to a new life of simplicity and asceticism.\nThe success of the order owed much to a series of strong constitutional documents initially formalized during the abbacy (1109-34) at Citeaux of an Englishman, St Stephen Harding. Although scholars have shown that the details of the Cistercian constitution were modified over the next two centuries, it was the Carta Caritatis (the Charter of Divine Love), written around 1119, which provided the legislative framework for the order's spiritual ideals.\nFearing the corrupting influences of riches on monastic zeal, the Cistercians placed a new emphasis on austerity and rejected all sources of luxury and wealth. Their constitution laid down strict rules for the location of new houses. Cistercian abbeys were to be sited in isolation away from towns or villages, and 'far from the concourse of men'. Their churches were to be plain and devoid of all ornament. They were to wear habits of coarse undyed wool (hence they were known as the 'white monks'). There were strict rules of silence and diet, and their services were stripped of all the liturgical intricacies which had become attached to services at the older Benedictine monasteries.\nThe order was already well established in Western Europe when, in 1128, William Giffard, bishop of Winchester, established the first Cistercian abbey on English soil. The site chosen was Waverly (Surrey) and the house colonized from the Norman abbey of L'Aumone. As in Europe, subsequent expansion was rapid, and by the end of King Stephen's reign (1154) some fifty new foundations had been added to the order.\nYorkshire and the north became the cradle-land of Cistercian settlement in England, though Wales also proved attractive to the white monks. In all, some 75 Cistercian monasteries were eventually established in England and Wales. Within the area of the modern Principality itself there were thirteen abbeys during the Middle Ages. The course of their foundation and history, can virtually be seen in two distinct streams. On the one hand, those of the south and east such as Tintern (founded 1131), Margam (founded 1147) and Neath (becoming Cistercian in 1147) were founded by Anglo-Norman lords, and their subsequent fortunes were largely dependent upon later Marcher Lords. In contrast, the other stream lay in the heartland of Wales, with important foundations at Whitland (1140), Strata Florida (1164/84), Aberconwy (1186) and Valle Crucis (1201), all of which were patronized by native Welsh princes.\nAs Anglo-Norman momentum faltered in Wales in the mid-12th century, there emerged a remarkable resurgence in Welsh supremacy in the southwest - the kingdom of Deheubarth. It was Rhys ap Gruffydd (d.1197), prince of this rich and fertile kingdom, who restored native control to the the southwest. Genial and civilized, long-lived and shrewd, Rhys knew the value of monks in his strategy. The Lord Rhys, as he is known, assumed the patronage of both Whitland and Strata Florida. He especially 'loved and cherished Strata Florida'; if not strictly as the founder, he was certainly the effective guarantor of the abbey's fortunes. Within a decade, Strata Florida was to become the scriptoriam where the native Welsh annals were henceforward kept. Under Rhys's generous patronage, the monks eventually laid plans to move to a new site two miles away from the original abbey, where the present ruins now stand.\nBelow: Strata Florida Abbey\nPhotograph copyright © 2002 by Jeffrey L. Thomas.\nMore significant than Rhys's concern for this one Cistercian community was his support for the entire body of hermit-monks. Freed from the yoke of its Anglo-Norman identity, Whitland was to become the stem of a new tree. Monks from Whitland colonized Strata Marcella in 1170, and returned to Cwmhir in 1176. Others left Strata Florida for Caerleon (alias Llantarnam) in 1179 and for Aberconwy in 1186. In turn, Cymer was settled from Cwmhir in 1198/99, and Valle Crucis from Strata Marcella in 1201.\nSo it came to be that, in native Wales also, these soldiers of St Bernard 'showed forth the discipline of Clairvaux whence they came, and by works of piety they spread the sweet savour of their mother-abbey, as it were, a strong perfume from their own house. The story spread everywhere that men of outstanding holiness and perfect religion had come from a far land. Many therefore were moved to emulate them by joining this company whose hearts had been touched by God. Thus very soon they grew into a great company...'.\nDuring the formative years of the 12th and 13th centuries, life within a Cistercian monastery could almost be seen as falling into two halves. This was, to a large extent, a result of the emphasis placed upon manual labour by the order. They were forbidden the customary 'feudal' sources of revenue such as tithes, manors, mills and rents, and therefore the intensive cultivation of agricultural land was as much an economic necessity, as it was an essential facet of the Cistercian monastic life. However, it was in the further stage of providing a labour supply to undertake this work, that the order proved so revolutionary.\nAlthough the choir monks, those in full monastic orders, undertook some manual work, the greater part of the heavy agricultural labour was undertaken by lay brothers, or conversi. Recruited from among unlettered men, the latter made their contribution by their labour. During the early Middle Ages they arrived at abbey gateways in large numbers, and often outnumbered the choir monks by two or three to one. Some lay brothers worked in the immediate vicinity of the abbey. Others travelled to work on outlying estates, usually within a day's journey of the home abbey, where lands had been acquired and organized into characteristic Cistercian farms, known as granges.\nAt the abbey, the lay brothers lived as part of the full community, though they were bound by less severe rules. None the less, this division between choir monks and conversi had powerful influences upon the architectural arrangement of Cistercian monasteries.\nEven before the close of the 12th century, the drive to increase revenue led Tintern and other Cistercian houses to ignore earlier Cistercian ideals and acquire church tithes. The deposition of Abbot William in 1138, following a visitation from Citeaux, may have been linked to this early breach of constitution. Even so, other churches were appropriated and tithes acquired in following centuries.\nIn 1348 the Black Death swept the country and, although we have no direct evidence for its impact on the Cistercians, the effects are clear. It became almost impossible to attract new recruits for the lay brotherhood. Widespread changes in the economy, with feudal service giving way to a system based on wages, were increased by labor shortages following the plague. At the grange of Merthyrgeryn in 1387-88 most of the area formerly worked by lay brothers had been leased out to tenants.\nIn the 1500s monastic life in England and Wales was brought to an abrupt end by the political actions of King Henry VIII. The Dissolution of the Monasteries was part of the king's policy to establish total control over the church in his realm. But in addition to severing links with Rome, their suppression was a considerable source wealth to the crown. Even so, the brutal demise of some 800 religious houses between 1536 and 1540 was a major step, perhaps made easier by a changing tide of opinion against the monasteries and what they stood for. Certainly, by the time of the Tudor dynasty, much of the freshness and vigour of the monastic way of life had been lost.\nTintern Abbey was surrendered to the king's visitors on 3 September 1536. Apart from Abbot Wyche, there were twelve choir monks and some 35 monastic servants. As they left the abbey in late summer, a way of life which had lasted for 400 years finally came to an end. This time-span was almost as long as that from the Dissolution itself to our own period. With the roofs gone, and windows smashed, the shell of the abbey would have fallen into chronic decay.\nLearn more about the Age of Saints in Wales\nHome | Main Menu | Castle Index | Historical Essays | Related Essays | What's New | Links\nCopyright © 2009 by Jeffrey L.

50	how does sea slug robot move forward speed	The biohybrid robot, which is just under two inches long, moves forward using a buccal muscle from the sea slug's mouth area. This muscle has two arm-like appendages that contract and release to pull the robot forward. In early tests, it moved at a rate of about 0.4 centimeters per minute.	['Case Western Reserve University Scientists Create “Biohybrid” Robots from Sea Slug Muscles and 3D Printed Parts\nIf I were to mention cyborg sea slugs, you’d likely assume I was about to tell you about the latest midnight horror film festival I went to, and you’d be justified in that response – but you’d be wrong. The “biohybrid” robots, created by researchers at Cleveland’s Case Western Reserve University by combining sea slug parts with 3D printed components, are very real, but don’t worry, they’re not the products of a mad scientist intent on zombifying the masses. In fact, they have the potential to do a lot of good for humans and the environment.\nRobots are becoming more and more advanced, but they still have their limitations, so a research group led by PhD student Victoria Webster has developed biohybrids, machines that combine the adaptability and durability of living tissue with the controllability of a robot. The small machines, in their current form, crawl with a movement similar to that of sea turtles on a beach, and in the future, swarms of them could be released into bodies of water to search out the source of toxic leaks or even to find the black boxes from crashed planes.\nEach biohybrid robot is constructed from flexible 3D printed components whose movement is generated by a muscle taken from the mouth of the California sea slug. The muscle is controlled by an external electrical field, but future iterations, according to the researchers, will be organically controlled by ganglia, which are bundles of nerves and neurons that normally transmit signals to the mouth muscle as the slug feeds. Collagen from the slug’s skin will also be tested as an organic scaffold for the robot.\nWhy sea slugs? Well, they’re exceptionally durable creatures, for one thing. Unlike mammals or birds, for instance, sea slugs can handle dramatic changes in temperature, water salinity, and other conditions that the Pacific Ocean’s tides throw at them. And while the idea that sea slugs could be superior to robots may never have crossed your mind, living muscle cells carry numerous advantages: they have their own built-in fuel source in the nutrients surrounding them, they’re compliant, and they’re soft, which, according to Webster, makes them safer and more efficient with a higher power-to-weight ratio.\nOriginally, the researchers tried using muscle cells, but found that the entire I2 muscle from the mouth area, aka the buccal mass, was already the ideal shape and structure for the functions they wanted to create. The buccal muscle has two armlike appendanges that, when the muscle contracts and releases, move the 3D printed polymer robot forward. In early tests, the biohybrid, which is just under two inches long, was able to pull itself forward at a rate of about 0.4 centimeters per minute.\n“(For searching purposes,) we want the robots to be compliant, to interact with the environment,” Webster said. “One of the problems with traditional robotics, especially on the small scale, is that actuators—the units that provide movement—tend to be rigid.”\nThe team expects the robot’s movement to improve, and become more complex, once they integrate the sea slug’s ganglia into the machine. Using either chemical or electrical stimuli to signal the nerves to contract the muscle, they hope to be able to train the robot to move forward in response to one signal and backward in response to another.\n“With the ganglia, the muscle is capable of much more complex movement, compared to using a manmade control, and it’s capable of learning,” said Webster.\nThe researchers’ ultimate goal is to create a fully organic robot; such a creature would be inexpensive to create and also biodegradable so there would be no worry about pollution if it were lost in the ocean or in some other remote location. Ozan Akkus, professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and director of the CWRU Tissue Fabrication and Mechanobiology Lab, worked with his lab to create an organic scaffold for the robot by gelling collagen from the slug’s skin and using electrical currents to align and compact the collagen threads together. The result was a flexible, strong and lightweight scaffold that takes the team a step closer to a completely organic creation.\nThe researchers will also be testing different geometries for the robots in the hopes of producing more efficient movement. Webster will be discussing her research at the Living Machines 2016 conference, which is currently taking place in Edinburgh, Scotland. Additional members of the research team include Roger D. Quinn, the Arthur P. Armington Professor of Engineering and director of Case Western Reserve’s Biologically Inspired Robotics Laboratory; biology professor Hillel J. Chiel; Umut Gurkan, head of the CWRU Biomanufacturing and Microfabrication Laboratory; undergraduate researchers Emma L. Hawley and Jill M. Patel; and recent master’s graduate Katherine J. Chapin.

51	culinary expert here wondering shelf life fresh vs whole melon	According to experts, wrapped winter squash slices can be kept refrigerated for five to six days if wrapped in foil. A whole winter melon can last significantly longer - up to one month when stored in a dry and cool place.	['The winter melon is available all year, but its peak season is in the summer. The name is a mystery. Bruce Cost’s book “Asian Ingredients” explains that the name comes from mature green skin’s “waxy, white blotching.”\nIt looks like a “dusting of snow.” He writes that the melon can also be stored well in winter thanks to cold storage.\nThe winter melon is not a melon but a squash. Deh- Ta Hsiung (author of “The Chinese Kitchen”) compared the texture to honeydew melon flesh. However, he also noted that the flavor is similar to zucchini.\nAlthough the flavor is subtle, the presentation can be spectacular. The whole winter melon can be as big as any jacko’-lantern and is often hollowed out to be used as a soup bowl at Chinese banquets.\nAmbitious chefs will often carve decorative bas reliefs into the skin of the melon. Some carvings are quite complex.\nTips for buying\nWinter squash is often sold by the slice. This is a great option for home cooks who don’t want to deal with the whole fruit.\nIn Asian markets, you will find wrapped wedges in plastic.\nAvoid buying bruised fruit.\nCost states that frozen winter squash slices can be kept refrigerated for five to six days if wrapped in foil. Frieda’s Inc., a California specialty produce company, says that a whole melon can last up to one month in a dry and cool place.\nSome cooking ideas\nThe classic presentation is a soup with winter melon, ham. Winter melon can be peeled and seeded. It can also be cut into pieces or cubed for stir-fries, such as substituting zucchini for zucchini.\nAs it cooks, the flesh becomes transparent. Winter melon can be used to make pastries or pickles.\nSTEAMED WINTER MELON WITH UNAGI\nWinter melon soaks up flavors, making them it’s own.\nIn this dish especially, it is no different. The grilled unagi coupled with the udon soup-based gravy brings forth light, Oriental flavors that are both familiar and comforting.\nIf you are a seasoned cook, this dish takes all of 20 minutes to prepare and cook.\n* 40g of winter melon, peeled and halved\n* 30g of unagi or Japanese eel\n* a dash of starch\n* a pinch of Sanshoko or Japanese pepper\n* 150ml of udon soup\n* one egg, white only\nBoil the winter squash until soft while you grill the unagi and sprinkle starch on its skin.\nThen, on a steaming plate, place the grilled unagi on boiled winter melon, with the unagi skin facing down. Now, steam for 10 to 15 minutes and place on a dining plate.\nWhile steaming, thicken the udon soup with starch and pour in egg white through a sieve on low heat.\nFinally, spoon in thickened sauce onto the unagi and winter squash. Sprinkle Japanese pepper and garnish with spring onions. Now you are ready to serve.\nDEEP-FRIED WINTER MELON WITH YELLOWTAIL FISH\nThis one makes for a lovely appetizer or snack. It is designed to be bite-sized. The fact that it is deep-fried certainly went down well with me!\nNevertheless, the polite crunchiness of the tempura batter complements the firmness of the fish and the softness of the winter squash.\nAll you need is:\n* 40g of winter melon\nPeel winter melon skin and slice into mouth bite size. Then gather up:\n* 30g of yellowtail or hamachi paste\n* half a handful of chopped onion\n* half a handful of chopped Shitake mushroom\n* 1 tsp of mayonnaise, preferably Japanese\n* a pinch of salt and pepper to taste\n* a dash of starch\nNow, mix hamachi paste with all these ingredients. Next, sandwich fish or hamachi paste in between sliced winter melon. You can also replace the yellowtail with ikan tenggiri or ikan parang paste.\nNext, you need:\n* half a piece of nori or dry seaweed\nCut nori into five equal sizes and wrap your sandwiches of winter melon and fish paste into them.\nFinally, deep-fry with normal batter or tempura batter.\nRemove from oil after around a minute or when it is light brown. It is terrific when dipped in salty Japanese mayonnaise!']	['<urn:uuid:410d2ef6-ed49-46d1-9b0a-63360bb179d6>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	10	41	692
52	I work in atmospheric correction and want to know how to correct for atmospheric scattering in satellite images. What's the simple calculation method based solely on image data?	A simple atmospheric correction method involves examining brightness values in shadow areas or very dark objects like large clear lakes to determine the minimum value for each band. This minimum value is then subtracted from all pixel values in each respective band. This method assumes that reflectance from these features should be very small or zero in clear atmospheric conditions, so higher values are attributed to atmospheric scattering.	"['Pre-processing operations, sometimes referred to as image restoration and rectification, are intended to correct for sensor- and platform-specific radiometric and geometric distortions of data. Radiometric corrections may be necessary due to variations in scene illumination and viewing geometry, atmospheric conditions, and sensor noise and response. Each of these will vary depending on the specific sensor and platform used to acquire the data and the conditions during data acquisition. Also, it may be desirable to convert and/or calibrate the data to known (absolute) radiation or reflectance units to facilitate comparison between data.\nVariations in illumination and viewing geometry between images (for optical sensors) can be corrected by modeling the geometric relationship and distance between the area of the Earth\'s surface imaged, the sun, and the sensor. This is often required so as to be able to more readily compare images collected by different sensors at different dates or times, or to mosaic multiple images from a single sensor while maintaining uniform illumination conditions from scene to scene.\nAs we learned in Chapter 1, scattering of radiation occurs as it passes through and interacts with the atmosphere. This scattering may reduce, or attenuate, some of the energy illuminating the surface. In addition, the atmosphere will further attenuate the signal propagating from the target to the sensor. Various methods of atmospheric correction can be applied ranging from detailed modeling of the atmospheric conditions during data acquisition, to simple calculations based solely on the image data. An example of the latter method is to examine the observed brightness values (digital numbers), in an area of shadow or for a very dark object (such as a large clear lake - A) and determine the minimum value (B). The correction is applied by subtracting the minimum observed value, determined for each specific band, from all pixel values in each respective band. Since scattering is wavelength dependent (Chapter 1), the minimum values will vary from band to band. This method is based on the assumption that the reflectance from these features, if the atmosphere is clear, should be very small, if not zero. If we observe values much greater than zero, then they are considered to have resulted from atmospheric scattering.\nNoise in an image may be due to irregularities or errors that occur in the sensor response and/or data recording and transmission. Common forms of noise include systematic striping or banding and dropped lines. Both of these effects should be corrected before further enhancement or classification is performed. Striping was common in early Landsat MSS data due to variations and drift in the response over time of the six MSS detectors. The ""drift"" was different for each of the six detectors, causing the same brightness to be represented differently by each detector. The overall appearance was thus a \'striped\' effect. The corrective process made a relative correction among the six sensors to bring their apparent values in line with each other. Dropped lines occur when there are systems errors which result in missing or defective data along a scan line. Dropped lines are normally \'corrected\' by replacing the line with the pixel values in the line above or below, or with the average of the two.\nFor many quantitative applications of remote sensing data, it is necessary to convert the digital numbers to measurements in units which represent the actual reflectance or emittance from the surface. This is done based on detailed knowledge of the sensor response and the way in which the analog signal (i.e. the reflected or emitted radiation) is converted to a digital number, called analog-to-digital (A-to-D) conversion. By solving this relationship in the reverse direction, the absolute radiance can be calculated for each pixel, so that comparisons can be accurately made over time and between different sensors.\nIn section 2.10 in Chapter 2, we learned that all remote sensing imagery are inherently subject to geometric distortions. These distortions may be due to several factors, including: the perspective of the sensor optics; the motion of the scanning system; the motion of the platform; the platform altitude, attitude, and velocity; the terrain relief; and, the curvature and rotation of the Earth. Geometric corrections are intended to compensate for these distortions so that the geometric representation of the imagery will be as close as possible to the real world. Many of these variations are systematic, or predictable in nature and can be accounted for by accurate modeling of the sensor and platform motion and the geometric relationship of the platform with the Earth. Other unsystematic, or random, errors cannot be modeled and corrected in this way. Therefore, geometric registration of the imagery to a known ground coordinate system must be performed.\nThe geometric registration process involves identifying the image coordinates (i.e. row, column) of several clearly discernible points, called ground control points (or GCPs), in the distorted image (A - A1 to A4), and matching them to their true positions in ground coordinates (e.g. latitude, longitude). The true ground coordinates are typically measured from a map (B - B1 to B4), either in paper or digital format. This is image-to-map registration. Once several well-distributed GCP pairs have been identified, the coordinate information is processed by the computer to determine the proper transformation equations to apply to the original (row and column) image coordinates to map them into their new ground coordinates. Geometric registration may also be performed by registering one (or more) images to another image, instead of to geographic coordinates. This is called image-to-image registration and is often done prior to performing various image transformation procedures, which will be discussed in section 4.6, or for multitemporal image comparison.\nIn order to actually geometrically correct the original distorted image, a procedure called resampling is used to determine the digital values to place in the new pixel locations of the corrected output image. The resampling process calculates the new pixel values from the original digital pixel values in the uncorrected image. There are three common methods for resampling: nearest neighbour, bilinear interpolation, and cubic convolution. Nearest neighbour resampling uses the digital value from the pixel in the original image which is nearest to the new pixel location in the corrected image. This is the simplest method and does not alter the original values, but may result in some pixel values being duplicated while others are lost. This method also tends to result in a disjointed or blocky image appearance.\nBilinear interpolation resampling takes a weighted average of four pixels in the original image nearest to the new pixel location. The averaging process alters the original pixel values and creates entirely new digital values in the output image. This may be undesirable if further processing and analysis, such as classification based on spectral response, is to be done. If this is the case, resampling may best be done after the classification process. Cubic convolution resampling goes even further to calculate a distance weighted average of a block of sixteen pixels from the original image which surround the new output pixel location. As with bilinear interpolation, this method results in completely new pixel values. However, these two methods both produce images which have a much sharper appearance and avoid the blocky appearance of the nearest neighbour method.\nWhat would be the advantage of geometrically correcting an image to geographic coordinates prior to further analysis and interpretation? The answer is ...\nWhiz quiz - answer\nThe advantage of geometrically correcting an image prior to further analysis and interpretation is that it would then allow proper measurements of distances and areas to be made from features in the image. This may be particularly useful in different applications where true measurements are necessary, such as in urban mapping applications. Also, the geographic locations of features could be determined. Once an image is geometrically registered to a known geographic base, it can be combined with other mapped data in a digital environment for further analysis. This is the concept of data integration which is discussed in section 4.8.\n- Date Modified:']"	['<urn:uuid:e1040015-3c69-43a2-a6f1-5b3fba7982b9>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	28	68	1329

Created by a Classics graduate, this site serves as an introduction to those interested in the Roman economy, Roman coinage or looking for guidance when buying ancient coins. If you have any questions on any of the material covered on this website, please contact me and I will be happy to help.\nRoman Currency: Early History\nIt is not until the early Republican period of the third century BC that the Romans began using coinage in the manner that most are familiar with. Prior to this, the coins used for trade were made of bronze and of irregular size and weight. They were known as the Aes Rude. The value of each coin was determined by its weight, rather than by any sort of denomination or identification. It is relatively late that Rome began to use coinage as representative value, rather than bullion.\nThe basic unit throughout a large period of the Roman Republic and Empire was known as the as, a coin made of copper. The sestertius was a brass coin, equivalent to 4 asses. The denarius, made of silver, was worth 16 asses. The rarer aureus, made of gold, was worth 25 denarii. These were common from the late third century BC to the middle of the third century AD. Monetary reforms during the tumultuous late Empire led to the introduction of new coins.\nPlease find a basic table below of the Augustan currency system using the coins discussed in the paragraph above.\n|Sestertius||Brass (or Orichalcum)||4|\nThe difference between the rich and poor was vast. The average legionnaire would earn 225 denarii per year (increased to 300 during the reign of Domitian). During the period 200-150BC a legionary soldier could purchase a year’s worth of bread with 2 months’ salary. Relatively speaking, the Roman soldier was a well-paid member of society. Praetorian guards received even better pay, at 720 denarii per year.\nEvidence in Pompeii shows that the average worker in the city during the period 50BC-79BC earned an average of 5 to 16 per day, with employment being seasonal and thus irregular. Miner in Dacia during the second century AD earned around 6-10 asses per day in addition to included housing and food.\nThe average Roman spent much of his income on food and the Roman diet was heavily dependent on grain. Purchasing power can be roughly calculated using the prices of this commodity (similar to the Big Mac Index!). The standard measure for wheat was the modius. One unit would provide enough to make 20 loaves of bread (of one pound each). Considering that the average Roman consumed two pounds of bread per day, this covered 10 days of consumption. Due to its importance in the Roman diet, the price of grain was an important topic in Roman politics. Wealthy ambitious politicians would often purchase large amounts of grain and make it available on the market to sell at a loss to gain favour amongst the populace.\nClothing was very expensive and often a luxury the average citizen could barely afford. In 240AD 22 denarii would buy a soldier a pair of army boots.\nRoman Money for Propaganda\nRoman currency gave government leaders a platform for publicity. During the early Republic coins would generally portray images related to the state as a whole. This is understandable, as the Republic was relatively young and still struggling to form an identity and presence in the Italian peninsula. During the late Republic and Roman Empire, individual leaders began to use coins for individual gain. Caesar was the first political figure to choose the representation of his own image on coinage. Other political leaders soon followed suit. They would use the opportunity to portray idealised representations of themselves. They would often link themselves to Roman gods. Religion was an important facet of Roman society and it was therefore important for Roman politicians and emperors to be seen as being subservient to the gods. Emperors would also use images of ancestors or great figures such as Alexander the Great or Romulus and Remus to portray an idea of lineage and thus a right to authority. Want to find out about propaganda in the Roman Empire? Check out BBC History.\nRoman province: Ancient Greek Coins\nThe Romans had previously adopted coinage from the Greeks. Rather than it being due to economic or military reasons, Burnett (1987) argues that the Romans wished to adopt what they considered superior Greek culture. Centuries later, Greece would succumb to their imitators. Greece became a Roman province in 146 BC following the Battle of Corinth, marking the end of autonomous Greek rule. Rome installed a method whereby Roman provinces retained their local coinage as well as being given authority to mint bronze and silver coins. For economic interests, Gold coins were carefully regulated by Rome. If you want to find out more about Greek coins, have a read of the excellent Wikipedia entry.\nPlease remember that this information is to serve as an introductory resource (for now). Roman numismatics (study of ancient Roman coins) is rich and complex, covering a long period of history and many regions. Romans used coins for over 700 years and it is therefore difficult to generalise on various matters relating to coinage and the Roman economy. Nevertheless, I hope that the following has given you a basic understanding on which to build your knowledge of Roman money.']"	['<urn:uuid:f55b5783-8f55-490a-afb6-b247ebb638b3>', '<urn:uuid:60aa61aa-26fc-41d9-bb47-8b797f2dfc21>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	15	92	1598
54	What data preparation is needed for kmeans and why?	K-means requires removing categorical data since it works based on distance calculations. The data must also be normalized to bring all variables within similar ranges - for example, bringing variables like monthly payments (100-400) and income (300-260000) to comparable scales. This normalization is essential because widely different ranges would distort distance calculations and lead to unreliable clustering results.	"['K-Means Clustering through An Example\nUpdated: Jan 16, 2022\nNow that we have understood the basics of K-Means Clustering, let us dive a little deeper today.\nLet us look at one practical problem and the solution\nAn NGO that is committed to fighting poverty in backward countries by providing basic amenities and relief during disasters and natural calamities has got a round of funding. It needs to utilise this money strategically to have the maximum impact. So, we need to be able to choose the countries that are in direct need of aid based on socio-economic factors and health factors.\nLet us use K-Means Clustering to create clusters and figure out the countries that are in greatest need as per the data provided.\nYou may find the data and the entire code in this git repo:\nIf we want only the top 5 or top 10 countries that deserve aid, then we could think of a regression model. But we could also use clustering as a way to find out the cluster of most needy countries. Once we get the clusters, within that we could further analyse and decide where does the aid go.\nI could have done K-Means Clustering or Hierarchical Clustering. I will go with K-Means for now, as we have understood that, in theory so far.\nSo, how and where do I start? I will be following the preliminary steps outlined in my previous post on ""Steps towards Data Science or Machine Learning Models""\nIn this post, I will not explain the code for data analysis or preparation. I will just explain the bare minimum through plots and insights, as this code is pretty repetitive for all analyses. However, the K-Means part alone, I will walk through the code too.\nStep 1: Reading and Understanding the Data\nI have to load the data and understand it first. From the shape, I know that I have data of 167 countries and I have 10 columns of data including the country name. A brief description of the data is here:\nNote that exports, health and imports columns are given as % of GDPP and hence they need to be converted back to absolute values for further analysis. You can refer to the notebook in the git repo to understand how that is done.\nNOTE: The code for this article is fully available in this Github repo as a jupyter notebook. You can look at it in detail and execute it to understand the complete flow.\nStep 2: Data Cleansing and Transformation\nWhen I do a null value check, I do not find any missing data. Hence there is no null value treatment required and no columns or rows to be dropped either. All the data is numerical and so no categorical data encoding is also required.\nHere, I should also do outlier analysis and treatment. However, I am interested in exploring the original data before I treat the outliers if any. Hence I move on to Step 3 consisting of EDA.\nStep 3: Exploratory Data Analysis\nThe main steps here are univariate and bivariate analysis. I plot the distplot for all the data as shown here:\nUnivariate Analysis: Continuous Variables - Distplot\nMost are left-skewed implying a large number of countries probably are in that cluster and there is a small number in the far-right cluster - behaviours of these 6 features:\nLife expectancy, total fertility, income and gdpp show there are visible clusters. For Bivariate analysis, a heat map and pair plot are sufficient as all the data in continuous data\nFrom this, I see that\nThere is a high positive correlation between GDPP and income, life expectancy, exports, health and imports.\nThere is a negative correlation between GDPP with Total fertility, Child Mortality and inflation\nExports, imports and health are highly correlated\nHealth is negatively correlated with Total Fertility, Inflation and Child Mortality\nThere is a strong correlation positive between Total fertility and Child mortality\nAlso a positive correlation between income and life expectancy\nHence, we have a good chunk of correlated data that should help in creating clusters. a scatter plot also helps is see if there are any visible clusters and hence you do a pair plot like this one:\nHaving understood the basic data, we move to the next step of data preparation.\nStep 4: Data Preparation\nOutlier Checks and Treatment\nSince all the data is continuous data, we can look at box plots and see if there are outliers.\nFrom this, we see that child mortality, exports, imports, income and inflation have outliers on the higher end and life expectancy at the lower end. Need to be watchful about capping the high-end values of data like inflation, child mortality and lower-end values of life expectancy as the needy countries should not lose out on aid due to this.\nHowever, it is safe to cap the higher end values of income, exports, imports, gdpp. Hence I have chosen to cap the higher end at 0.99 quantile and the lower end to 0.1 quantile.\nNot capping \'health\' as it has almost continuous values outside the 100th percentile and that itself could contribute to a cluster. Again refer to the notebook in git to view the code for this.\nScale the Variables\nNext, we scale the variables using a StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing library. Here, we do not split data into train and test as we are finding clusters across all of the data. It is not supervised learning and we do not test predictions against any target variable.\nAdditional Step - Check for Cluster Tendency\nIn part 3 of the theory on K-Means, I have spoken about having to check for the cluster-tendency of the given data. So, now we run the Hopkins test to check if this data shows a cluster-tendency.\nA basic explanation for Hopkins statistic is available on Wikipedia and a more detailed level discussion is available here. It compares the data on hand with random, almost uniform data and comes up with whether the given data is almost as uniform or shows a clustering tendency. For this data, as seen in the code, we get a value of anywhere between 0.83 to 0.95 indicating that there is a possibility of finding clusters and hence we go ahead with K-Means Clustering\nStep 5: K-Means Clustering\nThe first step in modelling is to figure out what is correct K for our data since we want to initialise the model with K. Again as mentioned in part 3, this is done using the elbow method or the silhouette analysis.\nFirst, let\'s see the code for KMeans clustering with a random k. The code for clustering itself is literally 2 lines.\nWe have to import the KMeans library from sklearn.\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nIf we choose to go with any arbitrary number for K and create the cluster, here\'s how the code would look:\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, max_iter=50) kmeans.fit(country_scaled)\nWe instantiate an object of KMeans class as kmeans. There are 2 args we pass: one is k i.e. the number of clusters we want to create. Here it has been arbitrarily chosen as 4. The second is the maximum number of iterations the algorithm has to go through. Recollect that 2 steps of calculating distance and reassigning points to a centroid happen iteratively. These two steps may not always converge. So, in such a case, stopping after 50 iterations is what the max_iter stands for and returning the clusters formed at the last iteration. There are a lot more arguments that you can look at help and understand. But this is the bare minimum for invoking the KMeans algorithm. Then you just take this kmeans instance and fit it against the scaled country data and four clusters are formed. It is as simple as that!!\nHowever, deciding the value of K is a very important aspect and let us see how we decide the optimal number of clusters.\nOptimal Number of Clusters\n1. Elbow Curve\nWe create multiple clusters starting with k=2, and going on with 3, 4, 5 and so on. When adding more number of clusters is not beneficial, we stop at that point. We start with using K-Means clustering with K=2 to say 10. Here\'s how the code looks.\nK-Means algorithm used is from the library sklearn.cluster\nssd =  for k in range(2, 10): model= KMeans(n_clusters = k, max_iter=50, random_state=100).fit(country_scaled) ssd.append([k, model.inertia_]) plt.plot(pd.DataFrame(ssd), pd.DataFrame(ssd)) plt.xlabel(""Number of Clusters"") plt.ylabel(""Total Within-SSD"") plt.show()\nAnd the plot we get is:\nNow, let us understand what we are doing in the code.\nmodel= KMeans(n_clusters = k, max_iter=50, random_state=100).fit(country_scaled)\nHere we call the fit method on KMeans for each k value ranging from 2 to 10 and create the model. And then we use an attribute from the model to understand which value for K gives good clusters.\nKMeans algo has an attribute called intertia_ which you can see in the sklearn documentation or by executing the command help(KMeans) in your jupyter notebooks. inertia_ is defined as the ""sum of squared distances of sample to their closest cluster centre"". So, if you have 3 clusters centres and each point is associated with one of them, then the squared distance of each of the points with their respective centres is given by inertia_. In fact, this is the cost function that we want to minimise as discussed in part 2 of my series on KMeans Theory.\nSo, we capture this for every k value in the range - in a list variable called ssd:\nAnd the next set of statements plot the value of inertia_ against the k value. So, wherever we get a significant dip in inertia_, we take that as the k value of choice. After a particular k the inertia_ does not show any significant improvement.\nSo, we see that there is a sharp dip in ssd from K=2 to K=3. Then the rate of fall slows down from K=4. It further slows down with higher Ks. Because of the shape of the curve at K=3, it is called an elbow curve. Given this insight, we could choose K as 3.\n2. Silhouette Score\nNow let us look at Silhouette Score too.\nBroadly speaking, It is a measure of the goodness of the clusters created. We have understood in Part 1 of the series on KMeans that we want the maximization of the inter-cluster distance and the minimization of the intra-cluster distance. This is what is encapsulated in the silhouette score.\nIn other words, a metric that measures the cohesiveness of a cluster and the dissimilarity between clusters is called the silhouette score.\nIt is represented as follows:\np is the average distance to the points in the nearest cluster that the data point is not part of.\nq is the average intra-cluster distance to all the points in its own cluster.\nLet us understand the intuition behind this. By definition of maximization of inter-cluster distance, p should be as large as possible and by minimization of intra-cluster distance q should be as small as possible. If q is very small, the ratio is almost p/p and hence 1. If q is very large, the ratio is -q/q and hence -1\nTherefore, the silhouette score combines the two (p and q) and ranges from -1 to 1. A score closer to 1 indicates that the data point is very similar to other data points in the cluster and a score closer to -1 indicates that the data points are not similar to other data points in its cluster.\nThis is calculated for every point and for every K. Then the same is plotted on a graph for every k.\nSo, whichever K has the maximum silhouette score is the one with the best inter-cluster heterogeneity and intra-cluster homogeneity. The silhouette scores seem to be very similar for k = 3, 4 or 5.\nHere is the code that is written to calculate and plot the silhouette score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score ss =  for k in range(2, 10): kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = k, max_iter=50, random_state=100) kmeans.fit(country_scaled) silhouette_avg = silhouette_score(country_scaled, kmeans.labels_) ss.append([k, silhouette_score(country_scaled, kmeans.labels_)]) plt.plot(pd.DataFrame(ss), pd.DataFrame(ss)) plt.xlabel(""Number of Clusters"") plt.ylabel(""Silhouette Score"") plt.show()\nHere we use the silhoutte_score from sklearn\'s metrics library. We create the KMeans clusters for each K in the range 2 to 10. And to the silhouette_score, we pass the scaled country data and the labels returned by KMeans to help in calculating the intra and inter-cluster distance averages for every point in this line:\nsilhouette_avg = silhouette_score(country_scaled, kmeans.labels_)\nFinally, we gather the score against each k in the list named ss to help in plotting the graph.\nBased on both of these tests, looks like 3 seems to be the right number of clusters. So, we will go ahead with this value of K and create 3 clusters.\nkmeans3 = KMeans(n_clusters=3, max_iter=50, random_state=100) kmeans3.fit(country_scaled)\nThen we do the cluster analysis to see what direction or insight we get out of it. This cluster Profiling or analysis can help us finally say which are the countries that are in direst need of aid.\nStep 6: Cluster Profiling for KMeans\nLet\'s now start with understanding how many countries are in each cluster:\nFrom the above code, you can see that there are 90 in cluster 2, 29 in cluster 1 and 48 in cluster 0.\nLet us now plot a scatter plot with the 3 most important variables: income, GDPP and Child Mortality, for each cluster:\nYou can see the countries represented in red dots have low GDPP, low income and high child mortality. They would be the countries that would best benefit from aid.\nWe can plot a bar graph and box plots to understand whether these clusters are truly distinct in their characteristics.\nThe bar graph shows that the gdpp and income are quite different for the 3 clusters. The box plots show how the mean of gdpp and income is very low for cluster 0 while the child mortality is very high. This makes the profile of the countries very clear.\nSince we want only the top 10 countries, we can sort by gdpp, child mortality and income in the ascending, descending and ascending orders respectively and take the top 10 countries for providing aid:\nIf the budget was able to support, the entire list of 48 countries in this cluster could have been considered as each is only slightly better than the other. However, with budgets constraints, the top 5 to 10 needy nations could be considered so that the impact is at least felt and a difference is made to the people receiving the aid.\nFinding K for K-Means is an important pre-step for clustering. There are multiple methods to find the appropriate K. Cluster Profiling helps us derive more insights. However, data understanding, data preparation and transformation before clustering are also important steps that cannot be overlooked.\nDeveloping a model is mostly the easiest step. However, again deriving insights from the model to get actionable results requires a deep enough understanding of the problem on hand and the implications at the ground level.\nThe entire code for this is available in the git repo whose link is given above. With more details in comments and explanations at each step. This is a fairly simple problem that was addressed through KMeans clustering.\nHope this was a useful code walkthrough with a significant example.', 'Unsupervised Learning using KMeans Clustering\nCan you group similar customers in the churn data? Hmm... maybe, but similar in what way?\nWhen choosing a telecommunication service provider, customers usually have many choices. They can choose any service provider and may move away from the current provider. The percentage of customers moving out and disconnecting the service is known as “churn”. It is very important to reduce churn for business growth and customer retention. If the churn is high, the business will continually be in search of new customers without a stable customer base. The performance of the business will be very unpredictable. Businesses try to keep the customers satisfied, to retain them as long as possible. However, in the real world, the customer churn can be as high as 25% annually in the telecommunication industry. Also, the cost of acquiring a new customer is 10 times more than the cost to retain an existing customer. This poses a serious challenge to business owners.\nWe will use customer churn data to apply unsupervised learning methods and will group them or clustering them into groups. Machine learning algorithm with determined these clusters and which customer lands in which group.\nData used for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle. The data ranges from demographic information to types of services being provided. Using this data clusters or groups of customers can be identified. We will then try to understand if those groups can be tied to some real-world characteristics and figure out in what way are those customers in a particular group similar, which leads the algorithm to group them together.\nNote: Data for this analysis is available at https://github.com/microbhai/CustomerChurnAnalysis/blob/master/telecommunication_customer_churn.csv\nUnsupervised learning models are usually used on data when data scientists don’t have prior knowledge about the categories in the data. Any information pertaining to how the data can be grouped is not present. It is just data with several rows and columns with numerical values, but no information about what rows belong to what group, if any.\nBased on the description of the customer Churn data, we know that our data is perfectly labeled. And we have prior knowledge about different categories in the data. For example, we know the customers who churned out, we know the customers who have fiber-optic internet, we know the customers who opted for streaming services for TV and Movies, customers who have tablets, customers who pay their bills by checks, etc. Our data is as labeled as it can be. Although the data provided to us is labeled, in this exercise we will be exploring an unsupervised learning mechanism to figure out clusters in the data.\nUsing unsupervised learning, solely based on how data points align themselves by the virtue of their values for different fields, we will determine clusters or groups in the data, if any. We may not know the reason behind the clusters and any properties associated with them until we do further analysis. However, the unsupervised learning model will give us multiple clusters and how our data points are labeled into those clusters.\nThe overall scope of the analysis can be summarized as:\n1. Creation of an unsupervised learning model using the available customer churn data to label the data into multiple clusters\n2. Analyze the clusters to determine if they align with any customer churn behavior\nBased on the problem summary, we need to implement an unsupervised learning algorithm and use it to label unlabeled customer churn data. One of the very popular clustering techniques is “KMeans” and is frequently used to solve clustering problems. In the section below, we will know how the KMeans algorithm works. Let’s start with a visual example to understand the basics. If the data is 2 dimensional, it is easy to plot it on charts and visually identify if certain points can be grouped or labeled in clusters based on the distance between the points. In this scenario, there could be a few points clustered together (being near to each other) with some space around it and the next cluster located nearby. So, based on the proximity we can visually label the points.\nThe images below show the visual grouping of data points in a 2-dimensional space.\nKMeans is a popular unsupervised clustering algorithm designed to group data into clusters and label data points. It is widely used in applications such as market segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation, and image compression, etc. The algorithm is based on the distance between the points in N-dimensional space and relies on finding centroids for each of the numbers of clusters, we want to identify in the data. It shuffles and randomly chooses as many points as the number of clusters required to be identified and assign them as cluster centers. Afterward, iteratively, it calculates the distance between these cluster centers (or centroids) and data points to group the data points into clusters.\nWith each iteration, it reassigns the centroids by taking the mean of the points assigned to clusters and progressively calculates a better representation of cluster centers until no further improvement can be made in choosing cluster centers. Once the model is created, and labels are assigned to the existing points, the unsupervised learning model can then be used to label new data points, based on their distance from the centroids of the identified clusters.\nFor explanation and demonstration, I will generate data for clustering and apply the KMeans algorithm to label clusters and their centroids, in 2D and 3D space. We will generate 50 data points, such that the points inherently belong to 3 clusters. Then we will use KMeans to identify 4 clusters in the data and find their centroids. We will plot for in 2D and 3D space for visual presentation. In the charts below, the red points represent the cluster centers.\nAs can be seen that we started with a bunch of random points in 2D/3D space as input data. The data was biased to have 3 clusters inherently. I did this for demonstration. After running the KMeans, we ended up getting our random points labeled into 4 different clusters. Each of those 4 clusters has its center. And those were marked with red dots on the plots. We could visually see the centers being identified and data points being plotted with different colors to mark the cluster labels. However, in higher-dimensional space, such visualization is not possible. The concept remains the same, the computation logic and algorithm remain the same, but it works over many more dimensions than can be plotted on a chart.\nData preparation starts with an understanding of the available data for analysis. Customer churn data has 40 fields. One of the important tasks is to determine which fields can be used for KMeans analysis. There are categorical data fields like Martial, Gender, etc., and continuous numeric data fields like Tenure, Age, etc. Some of these fields may not be important for analysis such as customer ID, interaction, and UID (which are related to customer service interactions). Some other fields which are not important for analysis are the Latitude and Longitude of the customer, case order (used as a serial number). We will also check data for null values and if found they will need to be handled appropriately.\nIn our Customer Churn data, a large number of columns are categorical such as gender, internet service, phone service, etc. don’t provide any values when it comes to the KMeans algorithm. As we can see that the KMeans algorithm is based on the distance between points, categorical data doesn’t fit the model well. We can convert the categorical data into 0 and ones, but it won’t add any meaningful value to an algorithm with works on the distance between points. Hence, we will drop all the categorical data fields from our analysis.\nKMeans algorithm is based on distance, and we need to normalize the values of data fields before these distances are computed. Normalization will bring the field values within a similar range for different dimensions. For example, if monthly payment for telecom service is between 100 and 400, age of the customers is between 10 and 90, bandwidth consumed per month is between 100–700 and income is 300 to 260000, all these fields are widely at different ranges of values and an attempt to compute the distance between such points will give distorted results. If we normalize the data and bring it to a similar range of values, computation of distance would make a lot more sense in this high dimensional space, and corresponding KMeans clustering will be more reliable and usable. The accuracy of prediction increases when these points are plotted using similarly scaled dimensions, instead of dimensions that vary greatly (orders of magnitude).\nWe have the following variables in customer churn data after the initial data cleanup. All categorical variables have been removed.\nContinuous Numeric variables:\n‘Population’, ‘Children’, ‘Age’, ‘Income’, ‘Outage_sec_perweek’, ‘Email’, ‘Contacts’, ‘Yearly_equip_failure’, ‘Tenure’, ‘MonthlyCharge’, ‘Bandwidth_GB_Year’\nIn supervised learning models, the usual practice is to take the available data and split it into training and testing sets. The model is trained on the training set, then predictions are made on the test set. Afterward, to check the accuracy of the prediction, the predicted values and actual values on the testing set are compared. If possible, tuning of the model is executed to increase the accuracy of prediction.\nContrary to supervised learning models, in unsupervised clustering models, there are usually no labels present in the data. It is the algorithm that will label the data with cluster labels. So, there is nothing to compare against for determining the accuracy. So, the step of splitting data into training and testing sets and comparison to assess the accuracy doesn’t hold good. It makes the task of clustering relatively simple. However, the basis of clustering is the distance between the points in N-dimensional space, and it may be hard to characterize these clusters in the real-world sense. For example, if you feed the customer data to the KMeans algorithm, and we get the clusters labeled, the real-world significance of those customers clustered together may be hard to determine. It will be hard to take actions based on these clustered customers without understanding the characteristics associated with them.\nLuckily, our customer Churn data is not unlabeled. Even though we have dropped the data columns for analysis, we can use them to understand how customers in the created clusters may be related and if these clusters mean something with respect to the real-world categorization.\nTo cluster this data using a KMeans classification algorithm:\n1. Choose a range of number of clusters (k)\n2. Create a model for each choice of the number of clusters\n3. Computer inertia for each of the models\n4. Create a plot of inertia values and number of clusters\n5. Determine the right number of clusters using the Elbow method\n6. For the chosen number of clusters create the KMeans model and label the data\n7. Additionally, run exploratory analysis to check if the cluster labels assigned by KMeans correspond to the existing label in the data (the labels which existed by were dropped for the purpose of KMeans analysis, the categorical variables)\nAnalysis of the Model\nWe chose a range of 1 to 10 for the number of clusters. For each of these, we created a KMeans model. And for each of models, we computed the inertia of the model. The inertia of the model is the sum-of-squares within the clusters. The inertia is at its maximum when the number of clusters is one (all the points grouped under a single cluster, not clustering of data into separate groups). And the inertia is 0 when we have as many clusters as the number of data points, such that each data point gets to be in its cluster and there is 0 sum of squared distance between the points with the cluster.\nBetween the maximum and minimum value of inertia, we can compute inertia for each of the intermediate number of clusters and plot them on a chart. This chart shows how inertia drops when the number of clusters increases. At a point somewhere on the chart, the increase in the number of clusters starts having a progressively lower impact on the drop of the value of inertia. At this point, we see an elbow-like shape of the curve being formed. This is what determines an optimum number of clusters that KMeans can find with the data points provide for fitting the model.\nThe k vs inertia plot for our customer churn data is provided below.\nAs can be seen from the plot, the elbow-like shape occurs at k=2. This means that KMeans is optimally able to find 2 clusters in the data. We can find more clusters but the drop in the inertia is most significant from k=1 to k=2, and if goes down gradually afterward.\nModel Summary and Implications\nThe elbow method showed us that the KMeans algorithm suggests 2 distinctive clusters in the data. We can find the cluster centers and inertial values using the model. We can also find the cluster labels for various points in the data. Considering that we are dealing with unsupervised machine learning here, we don’t know what these 2 clusters correspond to. They have been found by the algorithm based on the proximity of the points. And an number of clusters is determined by the drop in inertia with respect to the number of clusters. How do they relate to the customers in the real world?\nThis is where domain knowledge of the data can shine some light. Knowing the data and the background, we understand that the data belongs to customer churn records. If KMeans tell us that there are 2 distinct clusters in the data, it is intuitive to try and correlate these 2 clusters with the customer churn, a cluster of customers who churned out, and another cluster of customers who stayed with the telecom company. To verify, if these clusters correlate with the customer churn, we will have to use the “Churn” data field which was previously dropped from the data. Taking the labels as predicted by KMeans, we can add them to the original data set, and run some queries to check how the correlation of label values with Churn field value presents itself.\nThe KMeans labels have values of 0 and 1. A quick query on the data shows that there are 2650 customers in the data who have a churn value of Yes. These are the customer who chose to change the telecom provider and moved out of the company. Another query tells us that there 2366 customers which have a Churn value of Yes along with a KMeans cluster label of 1. This shows that majority of the customers who churned out of the company were labeled by the KMeans clustering algorithm under cluster 1. This shows a strong correspondence of cluster 1 customers and their churn behavior. With this correspondence established, we can consider that the labels are predictions of customer churn behavior. Label value of 0 is the prediction for the customer to stay with the company and label 1 is the prediction to move out. Churn column values of Yes or No are the actual values to compare against and come up with prediction accuracy.\nUsing sklearn.metrics functions, we find that KMeans is accurately able to predict 70.81% of the churn behavior. If the focus of the analysis is the customers who are move out of the current service provider, KMeans predicted 2366 out of 2650. This gives us a churn prediction accuracy of 89.28%.\nThe KMeans clustering analysis of customer churn data shows, that this unsupervised learning method with no prior knowledge about the data was able to identify 2 distinct clusters in the data. One of the clusters closely corresponded with the customers who left the company changed their service provider. Another cluster corresponded largely to those customers who chose to stay with the company. Even without any churn-related information provided, the data told its own story when passed through this unsupervised machine learning algorithm. As such, this algorithm can be used for predictive analysis on customer churn data.\nLimitations of KMeans\nWhile KMeans is intuitive, easier to implement, and computationally faster compared to some other clustering mechanisms, it comes with some limitations. The KMeans clustering technique is an unsupervised learning mechanism (no prior labeling of the data). It identifies the clusters in the data based on the distance of points from each other. One of the important limitations of this method is that it doesn’t make use of categorical variables. We know from previous analysis on the customer churn data that some of the categorical variables have been very important in predicting churn behavior, such as StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, Contract, etc. All that information is lost when using Kmeans as the categorical variable plotted as 1s and 0s in N-dimensional space provides no valuable information. Understandably enough, Kmeans never promised to created clusters based on customer churn behavior.\nAs the number of dimensions in the data increase, the ratio of standard deviation to the mean of distance decreases. This makes Kmeans less effective at distinguishing between data points and consequently the assignment of cluster labels.\nAlso, centroids can experience have a high impact on the determination of their values, due to a few high deviation outliers. Additionally, KMeans makes assumptions about the data:\n1. Clusters are spatially grouped — or once cluster can be confined within a sphere\n2. Clusters are of a similar size\nIf any of the assumptions are violated, KMeans fails to create the right clusters.\nThe 2 images above show incorrect clustering (shown by color) by KMeans because the points are not spatially grouped.']"	['<urn:uuid:1e8f7544-a071-4fe0-b2ee-08f6af9dab4c>', '<urn:uuid:91b1a86f-c683-40a8-8fd3-f4873d3e1643>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	9	58	5523
55	How do modern hospitals handle high-risk pregnancy care in terms of both local community access and specialized transport capabilities for emergency situations?	High-risk pregnancy care is provided both locally and through specialized transport systems. At the local level, specialists like those from BIDMC visit community hospitals such as Anna Jaques three times monthly to provide high-risk pregnancy care, allowing patients to receive care without traveling to major cities. For emergency situations requiring higher levels of care, services like IU Health LifeLine provide specialized maternal-fetal transport using aircraft and ambulances equipped with fetal monitors. These transport teams monitor both mother and fetus during transfer to ensure safe arrival at facilities with appropriate care levels.	"[""Clinical Affiliation with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center\nAnna Jaques Hospital is proud to be clinically affiliated with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a Boston academic medical center and major teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School.\nThe collaboration between the institutions and physicians means patients can more often be seen in their own community when clinically appropriate, but with coordinated access to complex care in Boston. More efficient integration of services between Anna Jaques and BIDMC also means that duplicative treatments and testing will be reduced. If a patient needs to go to BIDMC for tertiary care, the affiliation enables the patient to return to the community for care as quickly as possible.\nBIDMC and AJH share a relationship in multiple clinical areas, giving patients easy access to BIDMC's Harvard-affiliated teaching hospital specialists. These areas include:\nSince opening its doors in February of 2015, the Anna Jaques Cancer Center affiliated with BIDMC has continued to raise the bar of comprehensive cancer care offered to patients locally. Together, the two institutions offer a full array of community-based cancer services in Newburyport and when needed, advanced treatment options and specialists at BIDMC in Boston. The program offers a committed team that works together to diagnose and direct the treatment of all types of cancers. Patients no longer have to travel to Boston to have world-class cancer specialists on their care team.\nAnna Jaques and Beth Israel Deaconess HealthCare now have two primary care office locations in the area, one is Amesbury and in Haverhill. With five physicians to choose from, it's easier than ever to find one who’s close by when you need care, with access to top hospitals.\nEmergency Department Transfers\nThe coordination between Emergency Departments at Anna Jaques and BIDMC enabling seamless transfers to BIDMC for trauma and other clinical conditions that require tertiary care. Before a transfer our emergency physicians speak to a BIDMC emergency physician to discuss the patient’s condition, emergency treatment, and the best method of transfer (ground ambulance or MedFlight air transport). BIDMC accepts virtually all patients from AJH with no delay in the transfer, which is not universally the case at Boston teaching hospitals. Anna Jaques physicians are able to stay apprised of their patient’s condition and progress through communication with BIDMC physicians and access to their patients’ data via electronic medical records.\nExpectant mothers who need advanced care for high risk pregnancies can now receive that care at Anna Jaques, rather than having to travel into Boston. A BIDMC Maternal and Fetal Medicine specialist comes to Anna Jaques three times a month to provide high risk pregnancy care to the patients of Women’s Health Care.\nBIDMC provides our Emergency Department (ED) physicians with around the clock access to board certified neurologists, particularly with an emphasis on stroke patients. When patients at Anna Jaques are suffering stroke-like symptoms, AJH Emergency Department physicians and the neurologists at BIDMC talk to one another face-to-face over a high speed internet connection and “Skype-like” video technology to examine the patient together and discuss the best course of treatment. It is particularly helpful in the time-sensitive decision of whether or not a patient with stroke symptoms should be given the clot-dissolving medication tPA. Access to 24/7 tele-stroke care is helping us improve outcomes for patients and save lives.\nThe Thoracic Clinic at Anna Jaques Cancer Center, affiliated with BIDMC, brings BIDMC specialists to the AJH campus to treat diseases that affect the organs in the chest – including the lungs, esophagus and heart. This clinic delivers the advanced care you’d expect from a major Boston teaching hospital, with a convenient, personalized approach right here in your community - the best of both worlds."", 'The Maternity & Newborn Health program at Riley at IU Health combines the expertise of experienced providers at a Level IV obstetrical setting with one of the nation’s top-ranked children’s hospitals according to U.S.News and World Report.\nFrom low-risk deliveries to the most complex maternal and/or fetal condition, our team of physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses and other healthcare professionals provide the highest level of obstetric and pediatric care in Indiana.\nMaternity & Newborn Health at Riley at IU Health, in partnership with the Indiana University School of Medicine, is home to the largest group of maternal-fetal medicine physicians in Indiana.

57	compare noodle eating etiquette chinese italian traditions similarities differences	Chinese and Italian traditions have distinct approaches to eating noodles. Italians twirl long pastas into a 'small nest' with their fork to capture sauce ingredients like capers and pine nuts. While they traditionally used both spoon and fork, in recent years most have stopped using the spoon. In contrast, Chinese use chopsticks without twirling the noodles. For noodle soups, they use chopsticks in one hand and soup spoon in the other, either placing noodles in the spoon with broth or eating noodles directly with chopsticks while alternating with broth. Slurping is common and encouraged in Chinese dining to cool hot food, while it's not mentioned as part of Italian noodle customs. Additionally, according to Confucian philosophy, Chinese specifically avoid using knives and forks as they represent violence, preferring chopsticks which align with values of gentleness.	['Historical Preparation and appreciation of food has been developed to the highest level in the country of China. Cooking is considered an art in Chinese culture whereas all other philosophies consider it a craft. The two main philosophies of the Chinese culture are Confucianism and Taoism. Both influenced China’s history and the Culinary Arts. Confucianism stressed the importance of enjoyment of life involving the art of cooking. If you have a gathering, there must be food. If there is not the gathering is considered incomplete and improper.\nConfucius loved and respected the art of cooking. He established table etiquette and culinary standards. Most of which are still considered to be the standards of today. The cutting foods into small pieces during preparation and not at the table is exclusive to the Chinese culture. The use of knives at a Chinese dinner is considered “offensive. ” Taoism was responsible for establishing the hygienic parts of foods and cooking. The main part of this philosophy was for the nourishment of the body and the search for longevity.\n(Long life) In comparison to Confucianists who were interested in the taste, texture and appearance, Taoists concentrated on the life-giving aspects of various foods The Chinese have investigated many plants, roots, fungi, herbs and seeds to discover life giving ingredients. They discovered that many items had medicinal value such as Ginger which is beneficial to sooth stomache aches. They also found out that by improper cooking the nutritional value could be destroyed. Unlike the majority of eastern cuisines most Chinese dishes are low-calorie and low-fat.\nFood is cooked using poly-unsaturated oils, and milk, cream, butter and cheese are not a. part of the daily diet. Cultural Factors Our countries cuisine is deeply enriched with China’s history. If you visit a Chinese restaurant or a Chinese home you will see that culinary manners and etiquette are extremely important and a main factor of dining. When you sit down to eat, you must respect all sitting with you, whether they are elderly, children or disabled people. Chinese people stress the factor of presenting the best food first to the senior members of the table and has been done this way for many years.\nMost Chinese hosts are pleasant and hospitable you must show them respect. Sometimes before beginning dinner, your host may say a few words of greeting. Make sure you do not start to eat until they have done so otherwise it is seen as rude. On Chopsticks Chopstick’s are a miracle among the creations of Chinese food culture. This utensil helps the dinner to really relish his or her food. Once you have mastered how to use chopsticks, they will help you to savour your food and really enjoy the flavour. An important part of a Chinese person’s life is their birthdays.\nWhen a person is young, he or she is most likely to eat noodles before his birthday which indicate Longevity and Immortality. On a person’s wedding day, it is traditionary to serve Chinese dates, peanuts and chestnuts together which ensures that the couple will soon have a baby. For most Chinese people, upon returning home after a long trip is significant and sp there are also food customs associated with this. The person returning home is greeted with noodles and a person who is about to farewell family and friends is offered dumplings.\nThere are superstitions associated with chopsticks. Eg, If you find an uneven pair of Chopsticks at your table setting, it means you are going to miss a boat, plane or train. They believe that dropping chopsticks will also bring bad luck. Crossed chopsticks are, however, permissible in a certain restaurants. The waiter will cross them to show that your bill has been settled and you can do the same to show the waiter that you have finished you meal and are ready to pay the bill.\nThe reason Chinese people use chopsticks as their cutlery instead if a knife and a fork is because according to Confucius, a Knife and a Fork represent a style of violence, as they resemble cold weapons which is the complete opposite of Conuficius’ whole philosophy of gentleness and compassion. Geographical Located in Southeast Asia along the coastline of the Pacific Ocean, China is the world’s third largest country, after Russia and Canada, with an area of 9. 6 million square kilometres and a coastline of 18,000 kilometres.\nEight Regional Variations- Chinese cuisine has many different areas but the most public and well known by the Chinese population are named the “Eight Cuisines”. These are; Shangdong Cuisine, Sichuan Cuisine, Guangdong Cuisine, Fujian Cuisine , Jiangsu Cuisine, Zhejiang Cuisine, Hunan Cuisine, and Anhui Cuisine. The main factors that form an area are very detailed, include history, cooking styles, climate, resources, geography and life styles. Sometimes cuisines from different regions are so differently distinctive even though the two areas are geographical neighbours! Religious.\nDifferent Religions have different dietary needs according to their rules and geographical zones. Below is one of the main Religions that require special foods. Hui Cuisine- Muslim The Hui ethnic group contains the most Muslims. This influences the cuisine greatly and makes it the representative of the Chinese Muslim food. Their diet doesn’t involve pig meat or fierce animals and their blood. But the meats that are allowed and which have been prepared under the special way can be made into delicious dishes. Muslims are not allowed to smoke or drink wines, but encouraged to enjoy tea.\nWhen Muslims have guests visiting, they would welcome them with tea together with fruits and fried cakes. The tea cup can include there sugar, white sugar, Chinese wolfberry, sesame, red Chinese date, longan, and raisins. All of which are rich in nutrition. There are four main characteristics of Hui Cuisine. Most of the main foods are made of flour instead of rice. Hui people like eating beef and mutton which are good for the appetite and are nourishing to the body. One of the typical meals for Hui People is roast mutton. Sociological aspects.\nFood plays an extremely important part when it comes to a Chinese person’s social functions. As Confucius said something along the lines of, “People need to be happy and relaxed, and when they are with friends and eating, they will be happy”. So if your function is laden with foods for your guests it is very good and polite. If you have a gathering with friends and family and don’t prepare food for your guests to eat, it is considered extremely rude and inappropriate. Traditional foods or ingredients and any other related information When cooking, the Chinese use a lot of herbs and spices to enrich their foods.\nThe main foods that are eaten in China are; Rice, Noodles, Chicken, Dumplings, Sweet Corn, Vegetables, Wheat, Fish (Including crayfish etc), Pork (Although not for the Muslims), Beef, and BBQ Lamb. Chinese cooking makes use of quick stir fry at high temperature to seal in the flavor of the food and it also ensures that the food is not too unhealthy. Certain foods are Traditional to eat at certain times of the Year, for example, Chinese New Year which plays a very big part in Chinese culture and life.\nHere are a list of foods commonly found being cooked and eaten at Chinese New Year; * Lotus seed – signify having many male offspring * Ginkgo nut – represents silver ingots * Black moss seaweed – is a homonym for exceeding in wealth * Dried bean curd is another homonym for fulfilment of wealth and happiness * Bamboo shoots – is a term which sounds like “wishing that everything would be well” * Fresh bean curd or tofu is not included as it is white and unlucky for New Year as the color signifies death and misfortune.\n* Platters of fresh fruit (tangerines and oranges symbolize good luck and wealth) When cooking, Chinese people mainly use Woks, Steamers, and Boilers.\n1. http://www. chinastyle. cn/cuisine-drink/cuisines/\n2. http://asiarecipe. com/chiculture. html\n3. http://asiarecipe. com/chicookinghistory. html\n4. http://www. nicemeal. com/foodculture/\n5. http://www. educ. uvic. ca/faculty/mroth/438/CHINA/traditional_foods. html\n6. http://www. thetasteofasia. com/traditional_foods. asp.', 'From the comments on “Leftovers: The Career Killer:\nI think Helena should start focusing on real “table manners” issues instead of fringe nonsense and manners only affordable to the well-off, as is the case here. As it stands, I currently continue to read this article for its entertainment value rather than for any useful information. I can think of some topics that it would be great to see covered: for example … [a] comparative cross-cultural study of the proper way to enjoy noodles. —vorpal\nYou asked, so I’ll answer. I investigated noodle etiquette in five great noodle cuisines: Italian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, and Japanese. Here’s what I found out.\nItalians twirl long pastas like spaghetti and linguine, making a “small nest” with their fork, says Enrico Bazzoni, a native Italian and a chef with the Italian Culinary Institute for Foreigners, a nonprofit institution that promotes Italian culinary traditions. Viana La Place, author of My Italian Garden: More than 125 Seasonal Recipes from a Garden Inspired by Italy and other books on Italian cooking, explains that twirling helps “capture the little pieces in the sauce” like capers and pine nuts. Unlike some Americans, Italians nowadays typically don’t place the tines of the fork against the bowl of a spoon as they coil up their pasta, Bazzoni says. “Traditionally people did use a spoon and fork, but in the last five or ten years, most people have stopped using the spoon. They realized it wasn’t necessary, or it just fell out of fashion.”\nThe Chinese pick up noodles with their chopsticks, but they don’t bother twirling, says Corinne Trang, author of Essentials of Asian Cuisine: Fundamentals and Favorite Recipes. When eating noodle soups, you hold your chopsticks in one hand and your soup spoon in the other, Trang says. Take a spoonful of broth and pick up some noodles with your chopsticks. Deposit the noodles in your spoon with the broth, and then eat the contents of the spoon, using your chopsticks to help the noodles into your mouth. That way you can enjoy the broth and noodles simultaneously. (If you wish, you can also deliver the noodles straight to your mouth with your chopsticks, alternating mouthfuls of noodle with slurps of broth.) Slurping is de rigueur among the Chinese, for practical reasons. “It’s a way of introducing cool air into your mouth to cool off the noodles and the broth if it’s a noodle soup. … Chinese food is generally served hot, often served piping hot.” Noodle dishes vary by region, but, Trang says, “as far as eating them goes, it’s all the same.”\nThe Vietnamese eat noodles with chopsticks. When the noodles are in soup, they are eaten with the two-handed approach described above. Andrea Nguyen, author of Into the Vietnamese Kitchen: Treasured Foodways, Modern Flavors, adds that with Vietnamese noodle soups like pho (noodles in beef broth), the one faux pas is to “squirt in gobs of hoisin or sriracha” (hot chile sauce) before tasting the soup. “A well-crafted soup broth has simmered for hours or even overnight. If you add the other stuff as if it were ketchup, the soup becomes too sweet and too salty. It loses the delicate qualities of pho.”\nNoodles are traditionally “street food, fast food,” says David Thompson, author of Thai Food, and are not consumed with “any sense of needing to be elegant or impress your neighbor.” Use the two-handed approach with noodle soups and slurp if you need to, but don’t make too much noise. According to Thompson, vigorous slurping is not the norm in Thailand. “Thais have an intrinsic elegance that prevents them from slurping too loud.” Thais use a spoon and fork for noodle dishes other than soups.\nUse the two-handed approach, and slurp with gusto. However, you won’t insult the restaurant if you don’t slurp, says Kumao Arai, manager of Ramen Halu, a renowned noodle joint in San Jose, California. Some of his non-Japanese customers are shy about slurping, but when he explains its cooling effect, “they start practicing.” And if you can, drain the last drops from the bowl. “We like to see customers pick up the bowl,” says Arai, “because that’s when they’re drinking all of the soup.”']	['<urn:uuid:468f731e-a4cd-43c8-b985-d712719be6d7>', '<urn:uuid:356f1e30-873a-4bc0-91a4-732896e2122b>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	9	135	2054
58	compare software maintainers role versus construction workers efficiency focus in industrial projects	While construction workers' efficiency is primarily measured by their direct task time (which typically amounts to less than 50% of total time, with the rest spent on unproductive activities like waiting for materials or equipment), software maintainers focus on post-delivery activities including maintenance, deployment, and configuration management of software. The key difference is that construction productivity improvement focuses on reducing off-task time, while software maintenance encompasses ongoing activities like corrective maintenance (fixing faults), preventive maintenance (addressing vulnerabilities), perfective maintenance (improving efficiency), and adaptive maintenance (adapting to different environments).	"['In an industry as labor-intensive as construction, few things can hurt a contractor’s profitability more than unproductive workers. Here are eight tips for improving productivity.\n- Don’t blame your workers. While it’s tempting to blame poor productivity on lazy workers, late starts and excessive breaks, the fact is that most construction workers strive to be productive. More often than not, poor productivity is the result of waste and inefficiencies that are within management’s control.\n- Focus on unproductive time. Research by the Construction Industry Institute shows that craft workers typically spend less than half of their time on tasks. The remaining time is spent on unproductive activities, such as waiting for equipment and materials, waiting for instructions or waiting for work areas to be ready. If, for example, workers spend only 30% of their time on direct work, your greatest opportunity for productivity gains is to focus on the 70% of worker time spent off task. In other words, reducing the amount of time workers spend off task will produce greater benefits than attempting to improve their efficiency during the time they spend on task.\n- Conduct an activity analysis. Spend some time monitoring activities on jobsites and analyzing the results. Often, this process will reveal opportunities to improve productivity. For example, better scheduling and logistics can reduce delays that result when workers have to wait for materials or equipment, or for other workers to complete their work. In many cases, solutions are surprisingly simple, such as finding a way to store materials, equipment or tools closer to the areas where they’re needed, or storing materials on wheels so they can be moved more easily. Strategies for reducing personal time — such as locating portable toilets closer to work areas — can also have a significant impact on productivity. On one high-rise project, a structural contractor reduced the amount of time it took for workers to have lunch by arranging for a sandwich shop to operate alongside the structure.\n- Improve communications. Poor communication between supervisors and workers can result in unnecessary mistakes and redo work, causing productivity to suffer. With proper training, supervisors can learn how to communicate assignments to workers and ask the right questions to ensure they get it right the first time.\n- Take advantage of technology. Web-based project management applications, scheduling software, and other technological innovations can boost productivity by speeding up communications, providing workers with the latest project information in real time and making the construction process more efficient.\n- Set realistic goals. Performance-based incentives can be an effective tool for motivating workers and improving productivity. But it’s critical to set realistic goals. If workers feel that performance targets aren’t achievable, productivity may actually decline.\n- Pay attention to safety. The most important reason to have a strong safety program is to prevent injuries. But good safety practices also reduce the delays and downtime associated with accidents on the job site.\n- Manage overtime. Excessive overtime can result in fatigue, higher accident rates, absenteeism and worker turnover, all of which can hurt productivity. Proper planning, scheduling and supervision can help keep overtime to a minimum.\nImproving productivity is one of the most effective strategies a contractor can employ to boost its bottom line.\nIf you have any questions, please contact John Boykas.', ""This action might not be possible to undo.

59	What happens during professional water damage restoration?	During professional water damage restoration, contractors first respond quickly to remove standing water from the property. They then conduct a comprehensive damage assessment and begin restoration services including: sewer removal, disinfecting/sanitizing, dehumidifying, and complete structural drying. The process also involves mold remediation where specialists identify the extent of mold, clean contaminated areas using specialized equipment like HEPA vacuums, and apply biocides and encapsulants to prevent regrowth. They will also check for and repair any structural damage to walls, flooring, and ceilings. Additionally, they typically work directly with insurance companies to handle claims and ensure repairs are covered under your policy.	['Whether it’s a severe rainstorm or a faulty drainage system, waterlogging may cause damage to your house and its furniture and upholstery. Waterlogging can also lead to the formation of molds and bacterial growths from floors and the walls thereby leading to an unhealthy environment from the insides. People believe it to be an unnecessary cost and ignore damps within their walls. On the other hand, the more the water remains in flooring and the walls, the more is the odds of decays, damages, and a mold infestation. It is ideal to call for a service supplier for complete water removal. Palos Hills has been found to harbor some of the water removal providers in the country. So, if you are a resident of this area, you know you’re among those ones that are privileged!\nBefore calling to get a water removal support, you should take into consideration certain factors like the insurance coverage of your house, the level of harm, the expense of repair, and also the furniture replacements you need to make once the water is out of your interiors. Here’s a listing of the factors you must make.\n* Before the damage to your home is repaired, you need to remember to have a photograph of the damaged area. This could be helpful as evidence during your talks.\n* It is time to call to get an electrician following completion of the undertaking of water removal. Palos Hills-based home improvement service providers often are well equipped to deal with problems that may result from walls and floors. This restoration company would be in a position to do the job that is electric in this way so that your home is safe from the problems of circuits.\n* Be sure to eliminate all soggy upholstery, carpets and soft padding from the insides. If needed you have to replace the floorings and the wallpapers if any hint of damp can be found in those. You should also be sure if a mold expansion is found, your service provider is cleansing the furniture, and even the atmosphere of any mold spores to prevent additional growth.\nWhat An Water Removal Contractor Does\nWhen water damage occurs in a home or business, many instantly panic and attempt to solve the problem themselves due to financial troubles. By not contacting a certified professional, the harm will get worse, which will lead to an even more costly outcome for the land. When it comes to water removal, the very first step one should consider would be to call an expert restoration repair agency to take care of the situation immediately and thoroughly.\nMost services respond to floods the most since they could happen in just about any place as a result of too much snow, rain, or even a pipe bursting within the wall. A flood is the rising of a body of water and it’s overflowing onto the normally dry soil. Homes located in low areas or close to the sea are more prone to experience a flood and emergency water damage compared to those greater elevated or further inland. A majority of the time, this may ruin all possessions which it comes across.\nAcute weather is the principal source of water removal solutions as any flooding or major storm has the potential to place a house in danger. If anything or flood does occur, it requires a quick call to a specialist who provides a comprehensive damage assessment and will arrive in one’s house.\nIf a person does not do anything about this major issue, damage can ruin dry rot, flooring, ceiling, drywall, floorboards, and basements. Hiring a removal will be a setback. It’s ideal to simply accept and come to terms with the possible money that will be lost and deal with the issue immediately rather than attempting to figure out this problem yourself.\nFortunately, the majorities of restoration specialists are sensitive to every victim’s situation and attempt to keep the repair costs at the bottom minimum. It is necessary to keep in mind that whatever wrecked can virtually be restored. Firms deal with basements from any water disaster such as floods, hurricanes, leaks or even an emergency.\nThe common services which exist are sewer removal, disinfecting/sanitizing, record restoration, mold remediation, dehumidifying and complete structural drying. Remediation is the most crucial task as it is an important technique in occupational health. It goes through an appraisal which is the process of identifying the location and extent of the mold threat at a construction.\nThe remediation process then occurs, that’s the cleansing and removal in an indoor environment. The majority of the time the damage of mold is evident on carpet and drywall after the water removal process occurs. Experts will use cleaners and disinfectants to destroy them and prevent additional growth and development.\nDehumidifying is another major support as the practice of decreasing the degree of humidity in the atmosphere. It works by reducing the vapor in air by cooling the air below the dew point. This will remove the vapor from air by refrigeration and chemical means.\nWhy You Need To Find Help\nFor homeowners, water damage may be quite a painful experience. Additionally, water damage may pose a health risk due to mildew and mold and have to be taken care of immediately. It’s very important to eliminate all of the standing water as fast as you can and then to begin the process of recovery as soon as possible thereafter.\nOccasionally, the water damage is so severe that it is hard to know where to get started. First of all, it’s critical that all the water be eliminated whenever possible. Based upon your house, this could indicate coping with water which has saturated carpeting, furniture, clothes, appliances, walls, etc.. Whatever it’s… fast action is necessary. If allowed to stand for more than 48 hours it is highly probable that the water damage will result in irreversible structural damages to the house. Additionally, the growth of mold and mildew will begin immediately upon the removal of their standing water so it is imperative to move as fast as possible before the restoration process.\nDue to the possible health hazards in working in regions that have suffered water damage in addition to the practical issue of how much time it can take to accomplish the essential work, it is always advisable to obtain the services of professionals that focus on scenarios of water damage. This will make sure that the recovery and cleanup procedure is completed successfully.\nThere are many companies that offer water damage removal solutions at economical prices. It is important to note that the services provided will differ from company to company. As a customer, you are going to need to make sure to know what types of services the company provides so as to make certain they can meet your requirements. Be sure to ask for and check the references of any company before hiring them to complete any job for you. Also, make sure that the company that proposes to perform the job for you will provide you a written quote of what services they offer, how long it will take for the job to be achieved and what the price of this job will be.\nIt is also an excellent idea to make sure the organization you select is going to deal directly with your insurance carrier. This will make sure that your repairs are managed within the terms of your insurance coverage and that you will get an appropriate settlement on your claim.\nInexpensive water damage elimination companies aren’t tough to discover. Don’t delay in finding and hiring a company. The longer you wait, the more water damage will become more severe and costly to manage. And keep in mind, the process of removing standing water from your house and then dealing with the further activities of eliminating ruined materials such as carpets and furniture in the home or repairing structural damage is a lot harder and time-consuming than you may think. Professional water removal firms with the right equipment and expertise can do the work quickly and efficiently and make certain you get the last outcome which you require. They will work together with you and your insurance company to ensure you are able to recover from the damage successfully and come back to enjoying the conveniences of your home when possible.', 'Mold removal and mold remediation are sometimes used interchangeably, but these two terms are significantly different. Many restoration companies promise the complete removal of mold from your property, but this achievement is an impossible feat. It is advisable to hire mold technicians who appreciate the nature and causes of mold. With mold remediation, a reputable restoration company will determine the cause of your mold problem and reduce the mold levels to harmless, natural levels.\nWhat is Mold?\nIf you have a mold problem, your best bet is a restoration company that understands mold properties. Mold is a fungus that flourishes on moisture, and this affinity for water is why you are most likely to see it in damp places like bathrooms and kitchens.\nIt is essential to call professionals to look for all sources of moisture in your home. For example, the mold could have spread to a room’s drywall, in which case you need to cut the affected parts and add fresh drywall.\nMold exists indoors and outdoors, and it can enter your home through doorways, HVAC systems, and windows. Pets can also bring the fungi into the house, or the mold can attach itself to shoes and clothing. Once inside your home, the mold spores will quickly grow if they land on a damp surface. The common causes of mold in homes include:\n- Persistent humidity in a poorly-ventilated home\n- Leaky pipes\n- Leaking ceiling\n- Cracks in foundation\n- Flooded basement\n- Damp clothing\n- Damp shower curtains and bathroom doors\nUnderstanding Mold Removal\nTotal mold removal is not possible as mold exists everywhere as spores. The spores will remain dormant if there is no moisture, but they will quickly grow if their living area becomes damp. However, mold removal is an essential step in the more comprehensive remediation process, where an expert restoration company will reduce the mold levels to more natural levels.\nThe Mold Remediation Process\nMold remediation is a more thorough approach towards dealing with mold. Experts will identify the mold’s source, contain it, and perform treatments like cleaning and demolitions. A reliable restoration company will also implement preventative measures to discourage future mold growth. These steps are explained below:\nThe first thing step when tackling a mold problem is to call an experienced restoration company. The professionals will thoroughly inspect your home and determine the contamination levels. They need to determine the contamination’s extent to figure out the best approach towards removal and clean up.\nThe restoration company also needs to identify the source of the moisture to avoid mold re-growth. Mold removal technicians will check your bathroom, kitchen, attic, and basement for leaky plumbing or cracks.\nHomeowners are discouraged from dealing with extensive mold contamination on their own because of the health risks involved. However, you can facilitate the process by fixing the water problem that encouraged mold growth. You can also clear the path for the mold removal crew and remove any cars in the garage and driveway. Keep pets away from the working area.\nThe restoration company will park their vehicles as close as they can to your house. The staff will suit up in their protective clothing and lay plastic sheeting from your doorway to the contaminated area.\nThe team will use a hose to spray the contaminated area with biocide, which is approved by the FDA for killing mold spores. The biocide is left to work overnight. The crew will return the next day to spray an encapsulant to enclose any remaining mold spores. Experienced mold technicians will spray beyond the contamination area to discourage future mold re-growth.\n- Air Filtration and Clean Up\nThe crew will use powerful air filters to remove any mold spores from your home’s HVAC unit. If your home’s moisture levels are excessive, dehumidifiers will come in handy during the drying process.\nA reputable restoration company will also be equipped with HEPA-filtered vacuums to remove any surface mold on building materials. The technicians will remove any damp, contaminated, and porous materials and scrub all moldy surfaces. They will use anti-microbial disinfectants and sanitizers to remove any remaining mold. It may also be necessary to demolish and remove parts of the affected area.\nClothing, furniture, blinds, curtains, and other materials near the contaminated area will need to be cleaned. The final step involves the use of an efficient HEPA vacuum to remove any residual spores.\nYou can do a visibility check to ensure your home is free from dirt and debris before putting back your house together. Cleaned items should be left to dry completely to avoid re-introducing moisture.\nThe company will perform a follow-up inspection to ensure that the remediation was successful. You should also ensure that the moisture problem has been sorted to discourage mold re-colonization.\nIf done correctly, the above steps will make your home hospitable again by drastically reducing mold levels. The remediation process will be more successful if done by a restoration company with specialized equipment and knowledge']	['<urn:uuid:6f6a5850-8902-4906-966a-ea718e7dde1b>', '<urn:uuid:786af58e-9cc5-44eb-b8eb-df9d4943d3d3>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	7	100	2230
60	parts body paragraph essay structure	A body paragraph consists of three main parts: 1) A topic sentence that introduces the main idea and relates to the thesis, 2) Supporting sentences that provide evidence, examples, and details to develop the main idea, and 3) A concluding sentence that summarizes the paragraph or transitions to the next one. These components should flow logically and be cohesively connected to ensure the reader can follow the writer's thoughts clearly.	"['What is the body of a paragraph. What Should Your First Body Paragraph Include? 2022-10-15\nWhat is the body of a paragraph Rating:\nThe body of a paragraph is the main part of the paragraph that develops and supports the main idea or topic sentence of the paragraph. It is the portion of the paragraph that provides evidence, examples, or details to support the main idea.\nA paragraph typically consists of three parts: the topic sentence, the body, and the concluding sentence. The topic sentence is the first sentence of the paragraph and introduces the main idea or point that the paragraph will be discussing. The body of the paragraph is where this main idea is developed and supported through the use of examples, evidence, and details. The concluding sentence, also known as the closing sentence, is the last sentence of the paragraph and summarizes the main points of the paragraph or provides a transition to the next paragraph.\nThe body of a paragraph is an important element of writing as it provides the reader with the information and details needed to understand and support the main idea of the paragraph. Without a strong and well-developed body, the paragraph can be incomplete and unclear. Therefore, it is essential that writers take care to include sufficient and relevant evidence, examples, and details in the body of their paragraphs.\nIn addition to supporting the main idea of the paragraph, the body of the paragraph should also be cohesive and coherent. This means that all of the sentences in the body should flow smoothly and be related to one another in a logical and meaningful way. This helps to ensure that the reader can easily follow the writer\'s thoughts and understand the points being made.\nOverall, the body of a paragraph is a crucial element of writing that helps to develop and support the main idea of the paragraph. It is the portion of the paragraph where the writer provides evidence, examples, and details to support their ideas and ensure that the paragraph is complete and well-developed.\nWhat Is a Two\nTo further understand the body paragraph, review the basic format of an essay. Do not cram too much information into a single body paragraph. A body paragraph usually begins with a topic sentence and then continues with supporting text that supports that topic sentence. They come after the introduction and before the conclusion. You are guaranteed to meet the writing objectives when the paragraphs flow with ideas and points. The only best reward you can get is high scores since you have displayed maturity in your writing. ? Advice Everyone should exercise regularly to obtain these amazing health benefits.\nEach part of the body helps to build upon the last one, giving the reader confidence that what follows is relevant to the topic and will help them understand it better. Works consulted We consulted these works while writing this handout. Body Paragraph Structure A good body paragraph needs a solid body paragraph structure. Part of Hamburger Part of Body Paragraph it Denotes Purpose and Explanation The top bun Topic Sentence or argument sentence 1 Explains what the paragraph is about and how it relates to the thesis It contains only one idea or one main point It proves the thesis or argument of your essay or paper It is your mini-thesis The Veggies Explanation sentence sentence 2 Expounds on and contextualizes the topic sentence. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.\nRead the example body paragraph below to complete this exercise on a piece of paper. Lesson Summary What is a body paragraph? In general, paragraphs consist of three parts: the topic sentence, body sentences, and the concluding or the bridge sentence to the next paragraph or section. A good body paragraph contains three main sections: a topic sentence or key sentence , relevant supporting sentences, and a closing or transition sentence. There are three types of sentences in each body paragraph: topic sentences, supporting sentences, and concluding sentences. A little longer is acceptable, but too long is worthless. The topic sentence sets the stage for the rest of the sentences in the paragraph. Go chronologically, from start to finish.\nUse as many sentences as possible, but be brief to avoid confusion. Find the topic sentence. They should make a strong case that it is important enough to deserve more than a couple of paragraphs of discussion. Fixing these issues might require some more research to clarify your position and give convincing evidence for it. What Is a Body Paragraph? Unlike formal academic essays that generally require extensive research to support your arguments and provide evidence for your claims, three-paragraph essays can be written about anything that doesn\'t require exact figures or details provided by other people. Step 2: Unload the topic sentence After listing the topic sentence, develop the claims in it by expounding, explaining, and expanding all the individual components.\nOne of the best ways to identify the main point of a paragraph is to put the paragraph into your own words paraphrase it or to sum up the basic idea of the paragraph summarize it. In order to write effective three-body paragraphs, you need to know how each one works. It will also help in removing unnecessary sentences in the body paragraph. Now, you need to finish the body paragraph by moving onto the conclusion. Although not essential, it is recommended to include a reference to the beginning of the paper within your closing sentence. There are many different ways to organize a paragraph.\nFor guidance on formatting citations, please see the Lunsford, Andrea. Supporting evidence can include paraphrased ideas, summaries of ideas, direct quotes, and specific details such as statistics from your scholarly reference or source. Sometimes it comes just before the topic sentence, while you can incorporate it as part of the closing sentence. What are the 3 components of the paragraph? How To Write A Body Paragraph Of An Essay? The topic or emphasis of the paragraph is conveyed in the topic phrase which is generally the initial sentence. Topic Sentence: Eating pancakes for breakfast saves time and money. Your goal with this first sentence is to grab the reader\'s interest so she will continue reading. First, you need a topic sentence to begin the conversation; maybe something like: You wouldn\'t believe how beautiful the birdsongs are this year, or My gosh, there must be at least a million flies coming in through the kitchen window or The trees and the bushes are bursting with green.\nWhat are the three paragraphs in the middle of an essay called? For example, if the first paragraph introduces the idea that Michael Jordan was a great basketball player and the second paragraph discusses other things that make Michael Jordan great, then the conclusion of the essay would say something like this: ""Michael Jordan is great because he had an ability to play basketball perfectly, was very competitive, and cared about his reputation. Present the paragraph\'s main idea and set the stage for the rest of the paragraph. They use this element when they want to provide information about something within the paragraph or essay. Is the first body paragraph the introduction? Concluding sentences can restate the main idea of your paragraph, state an opinion, make a prediction, give advice, etc. Look at the illustration for one graphic organizer that shows how to start a body paragraph.\nIt is important for writers to remain focused when drafting a body, because if they start discussing unrelated issues then they risk making their piece incoherent. It states one of the topics related to your thesis and bears assertions about how the topic supports the central idea. If you constantly make mistakes, try these hacks or tips when writing the body paragraphs next. It comes after the introduction and before the conclusion of an essay or article. Some writers like to include a fourth part: a list or description. Effective conclusions are based on logic and analysis rather than simple repetition. However, do not use more than five augments.\nWhat is the difference between introduction and body paragraph?\nA good topic sentence will be broad enough to allow for explication but narrow enough that it does not require a paragraph that is too long. Avoid using vague terms such as ""mostly"" or ""sometimes. Above that, you have a long paragraph that is probably a disservice to your essay. Notice that the example and explanation steps of this 5-step process steps 3 and 4 can be repeated as needed. Essential Parts or Elements of a Good Body Paragraph The body of your essay or paper is referred to as developmental paragraphs in the sense that it is the arena where all the action takes place. Many of the same characteristics apply to topic sentences that apply to theses.\nNote your sources Students often make work for themselves by forgetting to keep track of sources when writing drafts. Choose a convenient time to work out during Ramadan, either just before Iftar or two to three hours after Iftar. Supporting sentences Your body paragraph needs to explain why or how your topic sentence is true. Step 3: Present Evidence To prove the claim or argument in your topic sentence, use facts, arguments, illustrations, data, statistics, quotes, paraphrased ideas, and evidence from reputable scholarly sources. For example, if an essay is laying out an argument, the topic sentence of the body paragraph should reveal which point in the argument will be discussed in that paragraph. What is the main part of the paragraph? Similarly, the paragraph should include enough evidence to support its topic sentence. Following is a body paragraph from this essay: \'\'The novelists are the worst offenders.', '- identify appropriate rhetorical pattern for the topic and the task\n- identify components of an effective thesis statement\n- identify components of an effective logical argument\n- identify components of an effective paragraph\n- identify components of an effective essay body\n- identify components of an effective introduction\n- identify components of an effective conclusion\nYou may hear the terms structure and organization used interchangeably when it comes to essay writing. Both are important aspects, but they do have an important distinction.\nStructure refers to the function a particular piece of your essay serves in the essay. Elements like introductions, body paragraphs, and conclusions are structural components of an essay. It’s similar to the structure of a house: certain spaces are designated as a bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen, and so forth.\nAs we know, houses appear in many different shapes and sizes, even though they contain all of these similar features. You might say that the structure of a house can be organized in many different ways. In writing, organization is where your unique approach as an author comes into play. In what particular order are body paragraphs placed? Why?\nIn short, structure is the what, and organization is the why.\nAs a writer, you’ll identify what pieces are necessary for your essay to include. Then you’ll determine what order those pieces will appear in, and how they connect together.\nHow to Write a Thesis Statement\nWhether you are writing a short essay or a doctoral dissertation, your thesis statement will arguably be the most difficult sentence to formulate. An effective thesis statement states the purpose of the paper and, therefore, functions to control, assert and structure your entire argument. Without a sound thesis, your argument may sound weak, lacking in direction, and uninteresting to the reader.\nStart with a question — then make the answer your thesis\nRegardless of how complicated the subject is, almost any thesis can be constructed by answering a question.\n- Question: “What are the benefits of using computers in a fourth-grade classroom?”\n- Thesis: “Computers allow fourth graders an early advantage in technological and scientific education.”\nQuestion: “Why is the Mississippi River so important in Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn?”\n- Thesis: “The river comes to symbolize both division and progress, as it separates our characters and country while still providing the best chance for Huck and Jim to get to know one another.”\nQuestion: “Why do people seem to get angry at vegans, feminists, and other ‘morally righteous’ subgroups?”\n- Thesis: “Through careful sociological study, we’ve found that people naturally assume that “morally righteous” people look down on them as “inferior,” causing anger and conflict where there generally is none.”\nTailor your thesis to the type of paper you’re writing\nN ot all essays persuade, and not all essays teach. The goals of your paper will help you find the best thesis.\nAnalytical: Breaks down something to better examine and understand it.\n- Ex. “This dynamic between different generations sparks much of the play’s tension, as age becomes a motive for the violence and unrest that rocks King Lear.”\nExpository: Teaches or illuminates a point.\n- Ex. “The explosion of 1800’s philosophies like Positivism, Marxism, and Darwinism undermined and refuted Christianity to instead focus on the real, tangible world.”\nArgumentative: Makes a claim, or backs up an opinion, to change other peoples’ minds.\n- Ex. “Without the steady hand and specific decisions of Barack Obama, America would never have recovered from the hole it entered in the early 2000’s.”\nEnsure your thesis is provable\nDo not come up with your thesis and then look it up later. The thesis is the end point of your research, not the beginning. You need to use a thesis you can actually back up with evidence.\nGood Theses Examples:\n- “By owning up to the impossible contradictions, embracing them and questioning them, Blake forges his own faith, and is stronger for it. Ultimately, the only way for his poems to have faith is to temporarily lose it.”\n- “According to its well-documented beliefs and philosophies, an existential society with no notion of either past or future cannot help but become stagnant.”\n- “By reading “Ode to a Nightingale” through a modern deconstructionist lens, we can see how Keats viewed poetry as shifting and subjective, not some rigid form.”\nBad Theses Examples:\n- “The wrong people won the American Revolution.” While striking and unique, who is “right” and who is “wrong” is exceptionally hard to prove, and very subjective.\n- “The theory of genetic inheritance is the binding theory of every human interaction.” Too complicated and overzealous. The scope of “every human interaction” is just too big\n- “Paul Harding’s novel Tinkers is ultimately a cry for help from a clearly depressed author.” Unless you interviewed Harding extensively, or had a lot of real-life sources, you have no way of proving what is fact and what is fiction.”\nGet the sound right\nYou want your thesis statement to be identifiable as a thesis statement. You do this by taking a very particular tone and using specific kinds of phrasing and words. Use words like “because” and language which is firm and definitive.\nExample thesis statements with good statement language include:\n- “Because of William the Conqueror’s campaign into England, that nation developed the strength and culture it would need to eventually build the British Empire.”\n- “Hemingway significantly changed literature by normalizing simplistic writing and frank tone.”\nKnow where to place a thesis statement\nBecause of the role thesis statements play, they appear at the beginning of the paper, usually at the end of the first paragraph or somewhere in the introduction. Although most people look for the thesis at the end of the first paragraph, its location can depend on a number of factors such as how lengthy of an introduction you need before you can introduce your thesis or the length of your paper.\nLimit a thesis statement to one or two sentences in length\nThesis statements are clear and to the point, which helps the reader identify the topic and direction of the paper, as well as your position towards the subject.\nA text structure is the framework of a text’s beginning, middle, and end. Different narrative and expository genres have different purposes and different audiences, and so they require different text structures. Beginnings and endings help link the text into a coherent whole.\nBEGINNINGS: HOOKING YOUR READER\nWhere to begin is a crucial decision for a writer. Just as a good beginning can draw a reader into a piece of writing, a mediocre beginning can discourage a reader from reading further. The beginning, also called the lead or the hook, orients the reader to the purpose of the writing by introducing characters or setting (for narrative) or the topic, thesis, or argument (for expository writing). A good beginning also sets up expectations for the purpose, style, and mood of the piece. Good writers know how to hook their readers in the opening sentences and paragraphs by using techniques such as dialogue, flashback, description, inner thoughts, and jumping right into the action.\nWHAT’S IN THE MIDDLE?\nThe organization of the middle of a piece of writing depends on the genre. Researchers have identified five basic organizational structures: sequence, description, cause and effect, compare and contrast, and problem and solution.\nSequence uses time, numerical, or spatial order as the organizing structure. Some narrative genres that use a chronological sequence structure are personal narrative genres (memoir, autobiographical incident, autobiography), imaginative story genres (fairytales, folktales, fantasy, science fiction), and realistic fiction genres. Narrative story structures include an initiating event, complicating actions that build to a high point, and a resolution. Many narratives also include the protagonist’s goals and obstacles that must be overcome to achieve those goals.\nDescription is used to describe the characteristic features and events of a specific subject (”My Cat”) or a general category (”Cats”). Descriptive reports may be arranged according to categories of related attributes, moving from general categories of features to specific attributes.\nCause and Effect structure is used to show causal relationships between events. Essays demonstrate cause and effect by giving reasons to support relationships, using the word “because.” Signal words for cause and effect structures also include if/then statements, “as a result,” and “therefore.”\nComparison and Contrast structure is used to explain how two or more objects, events, or positions in an argument are similar or different. Graphic organizers such as venn diagrams, compare/contrast organizers, and tables can be used to compare features across different categories. Words used to signal comparison and contrast organizational structures include “same,” “alike,” “in contrast,” “similarities,” “differences,” and “on the other hand.”\nProblem and Solution requires writers to state a problem and come up with a solution. Although problem/solution structures are typically found in informational writing, realistic fiction also often uses a problem/solution structure.\nENDINGS: BEYOND “HAPPILY EVER AFTER”\nAnyone who has watched a great movie for ninety minutes only to have it limp to the finish with weak ending knows that strong endings are just as critical to effective writing as strong beginnings. And anyone who has watched the director’s cut of a movie with all the alternate endings knows that even great directors have trouble coming up with satisfying endings for their movies. Just like directors, writers have to decide how to wrap up the action in their stories, resolving the conflict and tying up loose ends in a way that will leave their audience satisfied.\nThe type of ending an author chooses depends on his or her purpose. When the purpose is to entertain, endings may be happy or tragic, or a surprise ending may provide a twist. Endings can be circular, looping back to the beginning so readers end where they began, or they can leave the reader hanging, wishing for more. Endings can be deliberately ambiguous or ironic, designed to make the reader think, or they can explicitly state the moral of the story, telling the reader what to think. Strong endings for expository texts can summarize the highlights, restate the main points, or end with a final zinger statement to drive home the main point to the audience.\nComponents of an Effective Paragraph\nEvery paragraph in the body of an essay consists of three main parts: a topic sentence, some supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence. Transition words and phrases provide links between individual paragraphs, and so are important to consider, as well.\nOf these elements, the topic sentences are the most important to building a strong essay, and deserve the most attention.\nA clear topic sentence in each paragraph will assist with essay organization. Consider writing topic sentences early in the process, while you’re working on an outline. You can return later to fill in the rest of the paragraph. Having these single sentences figured out early makes the rest of the essay much easier to write!\nDevote each body paragraph of an essay to discussing only the point of its topic sentence. If something is interesting to you, but not directly related to the topic sentence, save it for elsewhere in the essay (or hang on to it for a future writing task!). This will help keep your essay focused and effective.\nEnsure that your topic sentence is directly related to your main argument or thesis.\nMake sure that your topic sentence offers a “preview” of your paragraph’s discussion. Many beginning writers forget to use the first sentence this way, and end up with sentences that don’t give a clear direction for the paragraph.\nFor example, compare these two first sentences:\nThomas Jefferson was born in 1743.\nThomas Jefferson, who was born in 1743, became one of the most important people in America by the end of the 18th century.\n- The first sentence doesn’t give a good direction for the paragraph. It states a fact but leaves the reader clueless about the fact’s relevance. The second sentence contextualizes the fact and lets the reader know what the rest of the paragraph will discuss.\nSupporting & Concluding Sentences\nThis video walks through all three components of an effective paragraph, giving good examples of what supporting statements and concluding sentences might look like.\nYou spend so much time thinking about the ideas of an academic essay that the way these ideas connect makes perfect sense to you. Keep in mind, though, that readers of your essay aren’t nearly as familiar with the subject as you are, and will need your guidance.\nTransitional phrases, usually found at the beginning of body paragraphs, will allow your reader to follow your train of thought. Phrases like “likewise” or “in contrast” are key indicators as to what relationship different paragraphs have to one another.\n- Transitions help underline your essay’s overall organizational logic. For example, beginning a paragraph with something like “Despite the many points in its favor, Mystic Pizza also has several elements that keep it from being the best pizza in town” allows your reader to understand how this paragraph connects to what has come before.\n- Transitions can also be used inside paragraphs. They can help connect the ideas within a paragraph smoothly so your reader can follow them.\n- If you’re having a lot of trouble connecting your paragraphs, your organization may be off. Experiment with different paragraph order, to see if that helps.\nThe Toulmin Model\nThe following video introduces the components of a particular type of persuasive writing, The Toulmin Model. It can be useful to think about claims and evidence in your writing, and what unstated assumptions (warrants) might be influencing you.\nThis image shows how conclusions are reached, using the Toulmin model of arguments.\nIn essays using the Toulmin model, warrants aren’t usually stated explicitly in writing. They are often shared beliefs between a reader and the writer, however.\nConsider what assumptions you make about your chosen subject, that your reader likely also agrees with. What assumptions do you have that your readers may not share?']"	['<urn:uuid:b36bc2ee-836e-47a8-be7c-6d550ea128f1>', '<urn:uuid:25f7af16-e607-448a-8c17-6a71194c6483>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	5	70	3963
61	As a social worker implementing Practice First, I'm interested in understanding how this model encourages more time with families, and what are the burnout risks associated with high family engagement?	Practice First encourages practitioners to spend more time with families through activities like taking them to appointments and joining family activities, which leads to stronger safety assessments and genuine relationships that support change. However, this high level of family engagement carries burnout risks, as research shows that chronic use of empathy with traumatized populations can lead to compassion fatigue and emotional exhaustion. Three-quarters of social workers experience burnout during their careers, often manifesting as reduced compassion for clients and feeling depleted after work.	['What is Practice First?\nFamily and Community Services (FACS) developed Practice First as a model for child protection service delivery in 2011. Its approach is unique to NSW, and draws on the best of national and international models and contemporary research.\nThe focus of Practice First is on changing the practice culture across the spectrum of work with families including assessment, intervention and collaboration with partner agencies. Practice First aims to achieve safety for children and families through skillful child protection practice, shared management of risk and building genuine relationships with families and the community.\nThe model is based on 10 principles of practice that are evidence-based and reflect contemporary research. The principles influence our systems, culture and people. They unite the organisation around the shared goal of making long-term improvements to children’s lives and where safe, keeping families together. Anchored by structured and rigorous Group Supervision and emboldened by leadership that encourages more time with families to build meaningful relationships, Practice First is changing the foundation of child protection in NSW.\nWhat are the Practice First principles?\n- Ethics and values are integral to good practice\n- Families have a right to respect\n- An appreciation of context strengthens practice\n- Language impacts on practice\n- Good practice is built on both knowledge and skills\n- Practitioners do best in a culture that fosters learning, hope and curiosity\n- Reflection leads to better outcomes\n- Sharing risk leads to better decision making\n- The quality of the relationships makes a significant impact on effectiveness\n- Relationships have a cascade effect.\nHow does Practice First change our work with partner agencies?\nPractice First values collaboration with families, the community, government and non-government sectors. Our relationship with partner agencies has always been important - Practice First now embeds this into practice.\nGroup supervision is at the heart of Practice First. Caseworkers, Managers, Psychologists, Casework Specialists and support staff meet each week to discuss cases and reflect on practice. We talk through, scrutinise and challenge our thinking and decisions. Group supervision also helps staff manage any emotional response to their challenging work, by creating the space to share their worries and hopes about their work with families. Caseworkers can draw on multiple viewpoints, research and practice expertise to support their practice – saving time and sharing the risk.\nWe regularly invite partner agencies to group supervision sessions. This genuine partnership creates faster and more effective referrals and information sharing, more purposeful wrap-around services and case plans, greater transparency around decisions, and ultimately, better outcomes for children and families.You will also notice more practitioners, know more information about each client. Practice First builds a team around a family, meaning you are more likely to be able to talk to multiple practitioners or support staff about a case you share.\nGreater communication with partner agencies helps us create a clearer picture about a child’s safety and their family’s situation. Practice First encourages FACS to seek feedback from partner agencies on its work and areas for improvement. Regular communication also creates opportunities for innovative and responsive support for families, tailored specifically to their needs.\nMore time with families\nPractice First encourages practitioners to spend more time with families. This could be taking them to appointments or joining in family activities that lead to stronger safety assessments and genuine relationships that support change. We may invite partner agencies to join us on home visits or family activities more regularly to work together to build trust and support clients.\nDetermined effort to keep families together\nPractice First requires practitioners to explore all avenues to keep a family together, where it is safe for the children involved. This means we will be collaborating with, and relying on the expertise of our partners more than ever, to support families through change and create safe homes for children.\nWhat is the evidence?\nPractice First operates at 36 of the 82 FACS Community Services Centres (CSCs) in addition to 3 specialist units.\nThe Social Policy Research Centre (SPRC) at the University of NSW, together with the University of Melbourne and the Parenting Research Centre, has conducted an evaluation of Practice First before its eventual implementation in all CSCs.', 'Given the emotional and demanding nature of social work, burnout is a significant problem among social workers.\nAs burnout often results in negative emotional and occupational repercussions, it is essential for social workers to recognize the warning signs, practice prevention, and engage in adequate self-care.\nThis article will delve into these topics, while also describing helpful resources from PositivePsychology.com. In doing so, it will provide social workers with the tools and information needed to carry out their invaluable work.\nBefore you start reading, we thought you might like to download our three Stress & Burnout Prevention Exercises (PDF) for free. These science-based exercises will equip you and those you work with, with tools to manage stress better and find a healthier balance in your life.\nThis Article Contains:\nBurnout in Social Work Explained\nSocial work is a noble profession. It is often entered into by those who wish to help vulnerable populations to achieve justice and receive vital support and services.\nGiven the nature of the job, social workers are often exposed to various aspects of human cruelty (e.g., abused or neglected children, domestic violence, etc.). As such, social work requires a high level of empathy and compassion.\nAdditionally, a career in social work is generally highly demanding, with large caseloads and minimal compensation. Imagine, for example, performing a job in which your caseload outweighs your time, your clients are victims of chronic abuse, and you barely earn enough money to pay your mortgage.\nYou may also have a supervisor who is overworked and cannot recognize your accomplishments or needs. This situation may cause compassion fatigue, which involves stress and emotional fatigue that results from the chronic use of empathy to help those suffering from trauma (Figley, 1995).\nThe concept of social work burnout is well exemplified in an article by Smullens (2012, p. 1), who noted how her social work supervisor often came home from work exhausted, telling his wife “They [his clients] feel better, but I surely do not.” This experience has also been referred to as ‘secondary or vicarious trauma,’ which occurs when social workers take on their clients’ stress and vulnerabilities (Wilson, 2016).\nOf course, those who enter helping professions are often highly empathetic, caring individuals. As such, being exposed to their clients’ chronic challenges and health disparities becomes emotionally and physically taxing. This is especially likely when workloads and resources are mismatched to the degree that making a meaningful change is unlikely.\nWhen this happens, social workers are at a heightened risk for feeling frustrated, depleted, and, ultimately, burned out. Indeed, the research literature supports a connection between high levels of burnout and stress among social workers relative to other occupations (Lloyd, King, & Chenoweth, 2002).\nIndeed, in a study including 751 social workers, three-quarters of participants experienced burnout during their careers (Siebert, 2005). Considering these correlations, it is essential that social workers know the warning signs of burnout and take necessary steps toward preventing it.\n16 Warning Signs of Burnout in Social Workers\nIf you’re a social worker who is concerned about potential burnout, here are several research studies that have identified warning signs to keep in mind:\n- Lack of enthusiasm about work\n- Reduced compassion or empathy for clients\n- Mismatch between job rewards (e.g., compensation and recognition) and performance\n- A non-collaborative workplace\n- Feeling a lack of job control, which minimizes autonomy\n- Depression symptoms\n- Job cynicism\n- Sense of resignation about work\n- Quick-temperedness with colleagues or family\n- Self-medicating behavior\nKim, Ji, and Kao (2011)\n- Role ambiguity\n- High work challenges\n- Lack of autonomy\n- High role conflict\nSchaufeli, Leiter, and Maslach (2009)\n- Poor fit between values of the social worker and those of the organization\n- Workload responsibilities out of balance with the social worker’s needs and priorities\nOverall, if you find you dread going to work each day and are exhausted when you return home, you may be suffering from burnout. If this is a concern, it may be helpful to ask yourself the following questions as outlined by the Mayo Clinic (2021):\n- Are you feeling disillusioned about your career?\n- Are you having difficulty concentrating?\n- Do you no longer find satisfaction in your achievements?\n- Are you having trouble sleeping?\n- Are you trying to numb or distract yourself from your feelings?\n- Are you irritable with clients or coworkers?\n- Are you experiencing physical symptoms such as headaches or digestive problems?\nAlong with recognizing the red flags above, it also is important to remember that increased burnout is associated with fewer years of social work practice (Weekes, 2011).\nTherefore, if you are dedicated to social work, but new to the job, hang in there. As long as you know the warning signs and practice plenty of self-care, you will probably feel better as you accumulate experience and confidence in your role.\nPreventing Burnout: The Importance of Self-Care\nHave patience with all things. But, first of all, with yourself.\nFrancis de Sales\nEngaging in adequate self-care is essential among social workers, as it helps to protect against the stress that accompanies repeated exposure to traumatized populations.\nAccording to Salloum, Kondrat, Johnco, and Olson (2015, p. 54), trauma-informed self-care (TISC) involves “being aware of one’s own emotional experience in response to exposure to traumatized clients and planning/engaging in positive coping strategies.”\nBy engaging in TISC, social workers benefit from coping strategies that help to moderate the negative impact of working with highly vulnerable clients (Salloum et al., 2015). Research has indicated that TISC is related to higher levels of compassion satisfaction and reduced burnout among child welfare case managers (Salloum et al., 2015).\nSimilarly, Weekes (2011) assessed 185 members of the National Association of Social Workers for both burnout and self-care. The results showed that depersonalization and emotional exhaustion were significantly lower among those who engaged in higher levels of self-care.\nEngaging in self-care represents an important way for social service workers to experience greater job satisfaction with a diminished likelihood of burnout.\n30 Self-Care Activities for Social Workers\nAs important as it is to have a plan for doing work, it is perhaps more important to have a plan for rest, relaxation, self-care, and sleep.\nResearchers investigating the role of self-care in preventing the likelihood of burnout among social workers have reported many effective self-care approaches, with over 30 presented below.\n- Engage in physical or behavioral strategies (e.g., dancing, hiking, sports, deep breathing, etc.)\n- Engage in relational strategies (e.g., spend time with pets; talk about feelings with colleagues, significant others, supervisors, etc.)\n- Engage in cognitive strategies (e.g., distract yourself with music, movies, etc.; avoid exposing yourself to stress or trauma when outside of work, etc.)\nSalloum et al. (2015)\n- Seek supervision\n- Attend trainings on secondary trauma\n- Balance your caseloads\n- Ensure work–life balance\n- Seek continuing education on the effects of trauma\n- Take advantage of agency resources\n- Set realistic goals\n- Attend therapy as needed\n- Engage in stress management activities, such as meditation\n- Be cognizant of your emotional response to traumatized clients\nHere are 17 more self-care suggestions:\n- Don’t bring work home. Home should be your respite from the day’s stress. Keep it that way by avoiding discussions or reminders of work once your shift is over.\n- Take advantage of vacation days. Always, always use your vacation days. It is a wonderful way to restore your emotional wellbeing, along with your connection with significant others. Besides, you earned that time off.\n- Talk to friends and family. Sharing with others is a great way to get a reality check, as well as to generate ideas about how to avoid burnout.\n- Find an artistic release. Whether it’s music, drawing, working with clay, or any other artistic endeavor, engaging in art enhances a sense of flow and happiness.\n- Get plenty of sleep. Adequate sleep is essential to emotional and physical health. Do not skimp on it.\n- Reward yourself. Whether it’s a vacation or simply a cup of tea, take the time to reward yourself for your hard work.\n- Read a good book. Reading is a healthy way to escape from a stressful day. By taking the time to read, you will feel more relaxed and might even sleep better.\n- Avoid self-medicating. If you find yourself craving a drink or some other drug at the end of the workday, this could escalate into a problem. Try to find healthier coping mechanisms, such as exercise or talking to a friend.\n- Get a massage. If you enjoy massages and they are feasible, then go for it. Massage helps with both physical and emotional tension, and it is also a great way to reward yourself.\n- Go on outings. Simply getting away for the day or the weekend is often highly restorative.\n- Make your health a priority. If you are putting your health last, both your work and your health will deteriorate. Always make time for sleep, exercise, doctor visits, and healthy meals.\n- Don’t be too hard on yourself. Social workers deal with terrible trauma. And while they make a huge impact, they can’t save everyone. Know that you aren’t a miracle worker, but are doing the best you can.\n- Spend time in nature. Many people feel invigorated by a hike in the woods, canoeing, bird watching, going to the beach, or being around animals. If you enjoy nature, get outside and reap the rewards.\n- Pamper yourself. Remember: You are performing a highly demanding job that takes a lot out of you. Be kind to yourself.\n- Go for walks. Along with the benefits of exercise, walking may take your mind off of your workday while providing fresh air.\n- Take on a new hobby. Regardless of your skill level or interests, doing something hands-on (e.g., woodworking, knitting, gardening, etc.) is always good for the soul.\n- Ensure that the job is the best fit for you. If you are feeling burned out despite experiencing an adequate work–life balance and engaging in plenty of self-care, it may be time to examine whether you are in the right field. Your job should be rewarding and not leave you emotionally depleted. Remember, there is no shame in exploring other opportunities if you are consistently stressed and dissatisfied.\n15 Minutes a day to prevent burnout – Paul Koeck\nPositivePsychology.com’s Helpful Resources\nWe have many terrific resources here at PositivePsychology.com that help to identify, prevent, and cope with burnout among social workers.\nTo get you started, here are three useful articles from our blog:\n- Warning Signs of Burnout: 13 Reliable Tests & Questionnaires\nIf you are worried that you might be experiencing burnout, this article will help you identify key warning signs.

The inflammation is primarily triggered by cytokines like IL-1 or TNF-α, which are produced by monocytes/macrophages. Additionally, oncostatin M, another product of macrophages and activated T cells, is elevated in the synovial fluids of RA patients.

ELISA respectively. Proteins phosphorylation of rheumatoid synoviocytes was ETP-46464 evaluated by Traditional western blot using phospho-specific antibodies. Outcomes OSM was discovered to be always a powerful inducer ETP-46464 of IL-6 in FLS. OSM arousal elicited speedy phosphorylation of STATs recommending activation from the JAK/STAT pathway in FLS. CP690 550 pretreatment totally abrogated the OSM-induced creation of IL-6 aswell as OSM-induced JAK/STAT and activation of mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs) in FLS. Conclusions These results claim that IL-6-type cytokines donate to rheumatoid synovitis through activation from the JAK/STAT pathway in rheumatoid synoviocytes. Inhibition of the pro-inflammatory signaling pathways by CP690 550 could possibly be important in the treating RA. Introduction Arthritis rheumatoid (RA) is normally a chronic inflammatory disease that’s seen as a the activation and proliferation of synovial tissue with linked degradation of articular cartilage . Synovial fibroblasts are thought to play a significant function ETP-46464 in rheumatoid synovitis through the creation of a number of inflammatory mediators . Activation of synovial fibroblasts is normally mediated in huge component by cytokines such as for example IL-1 or TNF-α that are made by monocytes/macrophages . Nevertheless other cytokines most likely participate in the procedure of synovial cell activation. From ETP-46464 the IL-6-related cytokines oncostatin M (OSM) is normally another item of macrophages and turned on T cells that’s raised in the synovial liquids of RA sufferers [4 5 Furthermore OSM stimulates chemokine and matrix metalloproteimase (MMPs) creation suggesting its essential results in synovial irritation . IL-6-type cytokines exert their results via the indication transducer gp130 resulting in the activation from the Janus kinase (JAK)/indication transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) cascade . In short the ligand-receptor connections elicits the set up of cytokine receptors receptor-associated JAKs which recruit and activate STAT protein. Phosphorylated STATs then dimerize translocate towards the immediate and nucleus transcription of the mark genes . Lately JAK inhibition provides been shown to truly have a prominent influence on autoimmune illnesses . CP690 550 can be an orally obtainable JAK antagonist that’s in advancement for the treating RA and various other autoimmune circumstances [10 11 Furthermore a recently available clinical trial showed that CP690 550 is normally efficacious in RA leading to speedy significant reductions in the signs or symptoms of RA [12 13 The function of oncostatin M in illnesses is normally less well described but recent research suggest that it could be involved with inflammatory cell recruitment and cartilage devastation in RA . In today’s study we utilized primary individual rheumatoid synoviocytes and showed the induction of multiple signaling cascades and a crucial role from the JAK/STAT pathway in the oncostatin M-mediated IL-6 synthesis. Furthermore we demonstrated that interference from the JAK/STAT pathway using CP690 550 a JAK kinase inhibitor totally abrogated the OSM-induced IL-6 creation in rheumatoid synoviocytes.

64	What percentage of Americans don't get enough physical activity, and how much exercise time is actually needed to get health benefits?	60% of Americans don't get the recommended amount of physical activity, and 25% of adults aren't active at all. However, just 20 minutes of being active is all that's needed to get benefits like prolonged life and reduced disease risk, which is where happiness and productivity in everyday life peaks.	"['By Ashley Jouhar on July 03, 2019\nThe definition of wellbeing is given as ‘The state of being comfortable, healthy, or happy’. The synonyms associated with it are ‘Welfare, Health, Good Health, Happiness, Comfort, Security, Safety, Protection, Prosperity, Profit, Success, Good Fortune and Advantage.\nFrom this we can see that wellbeing encompasses more than simply exercising and eating a balanced diet. Wellbeing also includes good mental health, a sense of security, friendship, some financial security and contentment with your lot in life.\nSo wellbeing is no longer limited to a healthy body; today’s vision is more holistic.\nIndeed, emotional health is now on par with physical health as more and more people find life satisfaction and a greater sense of purpose in the balance of mind, body and spirit.\nNic Marks of the New Economics Foundation says, “Well Being is not only about the individual but also about values grounded in a broader, shared understanding of how the world is and should be.”\nOver the last 50 years, the population of Great Britain has become richer - but despite this, evidence shows that mental wellbeing has not improved.\nMany of the things people often aspire to and believe will improve their mental wellbeing - such as possessions or more money for luxury holidays - on their own, do not lead to a lasting improvement in the way they feel about themselves and their lives.\nStills and video that convey not only physical fitness but also communicate a healthy mind, a positive approach to life, mindfulness, tranquility and a sense of being at one with your surroundings are popular. These images have many uses in marketing too, communicating key concepts around Health, Wellness, Escapism, Freedom, Getting Away from it all, Tranquility, Care, Fitness and Purity.\nBeing aware ofthe present – to your own thoughts and feelings right now, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. This is particularly difficult to achieve, however in our tech-driven world, where a moment doesn’t pass, it seems, without us reaching to check our smartphones; our attention directed to a screen, rather than the world around us.\nMindfulness is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as a way to prevent depression.\nRichard Davidson, one of the early pioneers, scholars and teachers of mindfulness in the US believes that working with kids and teaching them about mindfulness early on as part of their education is going to be really important. He explains, “Teaching kids these kinds of skills early in life can have multiplicative effects as the kids develop. Being able to practice these skills at a very early age can set a child up for a much more positive developmental trajectory.”\nThis mental wellbeing, self-esteem and self-confidence are very important to young people, along with good relationships, and a positive engagement with the world. As Sarah Stewart-Brown, professor of public health at the University of Warwick says, ”It\'s useful to start with the idea that overall wellbeing involves both the mind and the body. And we know that physical and mental wellbeing are closely related.""\nNutrition is another very topical piece in the jigsaw of our overall wellbeing. This includes not only our health but the health of the planet too. The provenance of our food is very important nowadays. How the food was produced, where it’s from and whether it is sustainable are questions that are not going away any time soon. Take for instance beef and its impact on our health as well as the impact of its production on the environment. The demand for beef worldwide is resulting in the destruction of a delicate ecological balance on earth – and this is now a big problem that needs reversing.\nThe knock on effect is that more and more people are choosing plant-based diets and among young people in particular, there is an increase in veganism.\nThe benefits of a plant-based diet are many and varied as such foods are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. This can result in a decrease in both blood pressure and in low-density lipoproteins (bad cholesterol) that in turn reduce the risk of diabetes and help maintain a healthy weight. All of these can result in lessening the chances of heart disease.\nHowever, obesity is a huge global problem that is steadily increasing. In the USA, for example, obesity affects 78% of Hispanics, 76% of Blacks and around 66% of Whites over the age of 20. For the under 20’s the figure is 31%.\nThis is down to an imbalanced diet coupled with inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle where work (and leisure) involves sitting for hours on end looking at a screen. 60% of Americans don’t get the recommended amount of physical activity and 25% of those adults aren’t active at all.\nIn light of the rise in obesity amongst youngsters, a wellness movement called Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta launched a campaign they called ‘Strong4Life’, which makes improving family nutrition and physical activity habits fun and engaging. It also provides parents and caregivers the support they need to accomplish their goals.\nGretchen Reynolds of The New York Times says of physical activity, “You get prolonged life, reduced disease risk — all of those things come in in the first 20 minutes of being active. This is all that’s needed to reach the level where happiness and productivity in every day life peaks.”\nTop concepts associated with stills and motion showing a physically active lifestyle are Competition, Speed, Fun, Vitality, Adventure, Strength, Success, Skill, Determination and Effort.\nPeople are equating happiness with good health more than ever, as good physical and emotional health allows us to do the things in life that we’d like to do. This is the motivation to keep minds and bodies healthy\nIn a study of more than 10,000 participants from 48 countries, psychologists, Ed Diener of the University of Illinois and Shigehiro Oishi of the University of Virginia found that worldwide, people rate happiness as being more important than any other life outcome - including living a life with meaning, become rich, and getting into heaven!']"	['<urn:uuid:c7f1aefd-dcda-41ca-bfde-189ef04d50cb>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	21	50	1022
65	How do clinical practice costs compare between teletherapy and traditional neuropsychological settings?	Traditional neuropsychological practices face high overhead costs and reduced reimbursement levels that demand high clinician productivity. In contrast, teletherapy can be more cost-effective, particularly when considering reduced travel expenses and other operational costs. It eliminates the need for physical office space while still allowing practitioners to maintain professional services, though it requires investment in secure technology infrastructure for videoconferencing and addressing privacy concerns.

With this kind of detailed evaluation info, the design of interventions is prone to give consideration to compensatory and environmental strategies to maximize consideration, combined with cognitive retraining exercises that help the patient establish primary concepts and key details. This is in distinction to simply making an attempt to write every thing down, a method the particular person had been using pretreatment with limited success. However, for people to do this successfully, they first have to know the way to maintain psychological focus and the way to decide what are the important concepts to memorize for later recall. They also need strategies for slowing the speed of incoming information whenever attainable. For instance, he may be encouraged at work to approach a prolonged technical guide by breaking it down into discrete sections, to take temporary summary notes on key procedural features, and then use these main points to create an outline or move chart for simpler future reference. Instead, the emphasis of therapy might have been upon memory compensatory methods, when and what this man wanted first were clear methods to enhance the course and duration of his attention focus and his capability to understand and capture main ideas. Then it was fantastic to transfer on to higher methods for him for memorization and double-checking needed details. His identity as a person and as someone who needs to regain feelings of confidence and luxury within the social sphere might rest closely on this facet of his self-definition and self-esteem. While acknowledging his want to give consideration to bodily remedy, his house train program, and numerous gym-based actions, the therapy staff also can understand that his memory impairments and his issue in discerning major concepts would be the bigger impediments to his successful psychosocial adjustment. The speech therapist can choose assignments whose content material is meaningful to the affected person, whereas still serving to him to improve his abstract reasoning and note-taking skills to help later recall. He can also be asked to put together a 5-min speak for his fellow sufferers, on any topic of his choice. In this style, needed skills are targeted, practiced, and improved, whereas still increasing the range of knowledge and interests the affected person finds important. This added content also offers him with updated conversational material that he can later focus on with family and friends. This contributes to his sense of being a reliable supply of latest info and helps him reestablish his value within the interpersonal world.

Once again cholesterol test blood donation purchase lasuna 60 caps with mastercard, both good planning and a willingness to think outside of the box could be critical for good research. First of all, establish an excellent information abstract sheet, including demographics, and make certain you complete it for each patient. You can simply hold a grasp, secured listing of affected person names and easily enter numbers on the data abstract sheet to defend affected person identification, but in any other case the graduate student has access to pertinent information. You can also incorporate an annual evaluation of such analysis questions and data assortment by linking it to something essential, such as end-of-the-year ultimate tax preparation.

In addition, sitting in on a neuroanatomy or neuropathology seminar could be a useful source for both review and consolidation of fundamental science info. Many medical middle and university departments have lectures which are open to all interested professionals. Pursuing adjunct clinical faculty standing at an area establishment can deliver with it teaching and clinical supervision opportunities, in addition to collaborative research projects, prone to provide impetus for continued reading, considering, and lecturing. Submitting workshop ideas or taking part in displays on an everyday basis at professional conferences is an apparent but generally missed option for private practitioners. You could have an attention-grabbing collection of case research that might challenge an current analysis finding or that may extend our understanding of a neuropsychological issue. It would also be a great discussion board for presenting the outcomes of your information collection.

You may wish to be part of assets with other neuropsychologists and hire a part-time one who is skilled at preauthorization, billing, and collections. Or you might wish to pay a psychometrist a further fee to do preauthorization on an interim foundation till your apply can afford to make these exterior arrangements. These workshops usually provide a quantity of direct and oblique advantages: earnings and advertising, introductions to native colleagues, and development of your teaching skills. In addition, should you live in a city that has widespread enchantment at explicit seasons or instances of the 12 months, the placement then has an added appeal for practitioners wishing to mix professional depart and training with trip time. With respect to workshop subjects, over time you could have accrued many sufferers with a particular drawback that may curiosity different psychologists. It is also completely appropriate for psychologists to conduct and issue psychological stories that include some testing, which is nicely inside our basic coaching.

As a result, many psychologists and psychotherapists may wonder whether teletherapy is as effective as traditional, in-person therapy. In this blog post, we will explore the research on the effectiveness of teletherapy and consider its benefits and limitations.\nThe Research on Teletherapy\nResearch on the effectiveness of teletherapy has been growing in recent years, and the findings suggest that it can be as effective as traditional, in-person therapy for many clients. A meta-analysis of 39 studies on the effectiveness of teletherapy for the treatment of mental health conditions found that it was as effective as traditional therapy for a range of disorders, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD (Cuijpers et al., 2019).\nSimilarly, a randomized controlled trial comparing in-person therapy to teletherapy for the treatment of depression found no significant differences in treatment outcomes between the two groups (Hubley et al., 2016). Additionally, a systematic review of the use of teletherapy for the treatment of PTSD found that teletherapy was an effective treatment option for this condition, with no significant differences in treatment outcomes between teletherapy and in-person therapy (Simpson et al., 2018).\nBenefits of Teletherapy\nTeletherapy has a number of benefits for both clients and therapists. These benefits include:\n1. Accessibility: Teletherapy can increase access to mental health services for those who live in rural or remote areas, have mobility issues, or have other barriers to accessing traditional, in-person therapy.\n2. Convenience: Teletherapy eliminates the need for travel, reducing the time and expense associated with attending in-person appointments.\n3. Flexibility: Teletherapy allows for greater flexibility in scheduling appointments, making it easier for clients to fit therapy into their busy schedules.\n4. Comfort: Many clients feel more comfortable participating in therapy from the privacy of their own homes, reducing anxiety and stress associated with attending in-person appointments.\n5. Cost-effectiveness: Teletherapy can be more cost-effective than in-person therapy, particularly when travel and other expenses are factored in.\nLimitations of Teletherapy\n1. Despite its benefits, teletherapy has some limitations that may impact its effectiveness for some clients. These limitations include:\n2. Technical difficulties: Teletherapy requires a reliable internet connection and the necessary technology (e.g., computer, smartphone, or tablet). Technical issues can disrupt therapy sessions and impact the quality of the therapeutic relationship.\n3. Limited nonverbal cues: Teletherapy can make it more difficult for therapists to pick up on nonverbal cues, which can impact the therapeutic relationship and the accuracy of clinical assessments.\n4. Limited therapeutic modalities: Some therapeutic modalities, such as touch-based therapies, are not possible through teletherapy, limiting the range of therapies available to clients.\n5. Privacy concerns: Teletherapy raises privacy concerns, particularly if sessions are conducted in public places or if the technology used is not secure.\nIn conclusion, the research suggests that teletherapy can be as effective as traditional, in-person therapy for many clients, and has a range of benefits. However, it also has some limitations that may impact its effectiveness for some clients. As such, psychologists and psychotherapists may want to consider teletherapy as an option for their clients, particularly for those who have difficulty accessing in-person therapy or who prefer the convenience and comfort of teletherapy. However, it is important to carefully consider the benefits and limitations of teletherapy and to ensure that clients have access to the necessary technology and support to participate in therapy effectively.']"	['<urn:uuid:b9b40e39-c725-4be9-ac32-6ee61f1334ed>', '<urn:uuid:9a953d8b-776c-4bb3-b1ee-2bbfa826492a>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	12	63	2864
66	What affects tick populations and how reliable is Lyme testing?	Tick populations are strongly influenced by the presence of large-bodied vertebrate hosts, with loss of wildlife causing cascading effects through local host-parasite coextinction. Regarding testing reliability, the standard two-tiered serology approach has only 46.3% sensitivity for early-stage Lyme disease but reaches 99.4% sensitivity for late-stage cases, with about 99% specificity across all stages.	['Projects per year\nThe ongoing loss of global biodiversity is unprecedented in both magnitude and pace, raising urgent questions as to how this loss will affect ecosystem functioning and human well-being. Control of infectious diseases has been proposed as an important ecosystem service that is likely to be affected by biodiversity loss. A negative relationship between biodiversity and disease risk could offer a win-win situation for nature conservation and human health. However, the generality of this relationship remains the subject of contentious debate. The aim of this thesis was to contribute to a better understanding of the interactions between ticks and their vertebrate hosts in a biodiversity hotspot, and how loss of biodiversity affects these interactions and ultimately, tick-borne disease risk. My study was unique in that I simultaneously considered and directly assessed broader communities of Neotropical wildlife, ticks, and tick-borne pathogens across an anthropogenic disturbance gradient.\nDetermining whether and how biodiversity loss affects tick-borne disease risk in tropical forests requires a thorough understanding of tick-host associations, which are a function of tick-host specificity as well as host biological and ecological traits. In chapter 2, I therefore quantified the degree to which adult ticks are host-specific in my study region: Panama. Using quantitative network analyses and phylogenetic tools with null model comparisons, I found that the adult life stages of most tick species were specific to a limited number of host species that were phylogenetically closely related. In Chapter 4 I showed that species assemblages of adult ticks became increasingly diverse on larger-bodied host species, indicating that adult ticks in Panama tend to select for large reproduction hosts.\nIn contrast to adult ticks, understanding the ecological interactions between immature ticks and their hosts in the tropics has long been hampered by a lack of morphological identification keys. Therefore, in Chapter 3, I describe the development of a DNA barcode reference library for the molecular identification of larvae and nymphs. This reference library was highly effective in species-level identification of immature ticks collected from birds (Chapter 3) and small mammals (Chapter 4 and 6). Several avian ecological traits were positively associated with tick parasitism, but the potential role of wild birds in tick-borne disease transmission seems to be limited in Panama. Immature ticks did not show any specificity to particular bird species or avian ecological traits (Chapter 3), and species assemblages of immatures ticks were equally diverse across a large number of host taxa (Chapter 4). This suggests that larvae and nymphs may feed more opportunistically than their adult counterparts.\nHigh host specificity in adult ticks implies high susceptibility to tick-host coextinction, even if immature ticks feed opportunistically. In chapter 5, I tested this hypothesis by surveying tick and vertebrate host communities across a forest fragmentation gradient. Forest fragments consisted of previously connected islands and peninsulas in the Panama Canal and ranged 1000-fold in size. Abundance and species richness of ticks was positively related to that of wildlife, which in turn was related to the size of the forest fragment. Specialist tick species were only present in fragments where their specific reproduction hosts were captured by camera traps. Further, less diverse tick communities were dominated by a generalist tick species. These results indicate that loss of wildlife had cascading effects on tick communities through local host-parasite coextinction.\nIn Chapter 6, I studied how communities of wildlife, ticks, and tick-borne microbes changed along a more ‘typical’ disturbance gradient, in which forest fragments were embedded in an agricultural and sub-urban landscape, rather than surrounded by water. I found that wildlife community disassembly either diluted, amplified, or had no effect on infection prevalence in ticks, depending on the pathogen and degree of disturbance. However, hyperabundance of medium- to large-sized frugivores and herbivores (important reproduction hosts for adult ticks) in sites that lacked apex predators was related to exponential increases in tick density, negating any effect of reduced pathogen prevalence. Moreover, high tick species richness in these sites was related to high microbial and pathogen richness. High parasite diversity is thus a source of infectious diseases. When medium- to large-sized frugivores and herbivores also disappeared, densities of infected ticks declined, suggesting a non-linear relationship between biodiversity loss and tick-borne disease risk, in which initial loss of apex predators increases disease risk, but further loss of species decreases disease risk again.\nIn this thesis, I have quantified host-feeding relationships of adult and immature Neotropical ticks, many of which (in the case of larvae and nymphs) were largely unknown. I have shown that adult ticks tend to be highly host-specific, particularly to larger-bodied vertebrates, whereas immature ticks appear to have broader host-use patterns. I found that ticks are susceptible to local host-tick coextirpation, and that the relationship between biodiversity loss and tick-borne disease risk is non-linear. My results emphasize the importance of directly assessing host community composition and suggest that the presence of specific (reproduction) hosts are a more important factor than species richness per se for tick population and tick-borne disease dynamics.\n|Qualification||Doctor of Philosophy|\n|Award date||9 Oct 2017|\n|Place of Publication||Wageningen|\n|Publication status||Published - 2017|\n- host specificity\n- host parasite relationships\n- species diversity\n- community ecology\n- tickborne diseases', 'Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is an increasingly prevalent illness caused by several bacteria in the Borrelia genus. Lyme disease is an increasingly common bacterial illness that exists throughout the world. Current diagnostic methods for Lyme disease are ineffective at detecting the illness during its early stages - when it is easiest to treat; thus, the improvement of Lyme diagnostics is a popular area of research in many scientific fields.\nWhile several species can cause Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi is the predominant pathogenic species in North America; B. garinii and B. afzelii are responsible for most infections in Europe and Asia. The transmission of Borrelia is facilitated by ticks within the Ixodes genus, which serve as the primary vector and reservoir host for the bacterium. Borrelia is transferred to a mammalian host when an infected tick attaches to and feeds on the blood of the host. During blood-feeding, Borrelia, located in the salivary glands of the tick, enter the mammalian host via the tick’s saliva, transmitting the Lyme bacteria and causing the disease. By exploiting the natural feeding relationship of ticks on mammals, Borrelia is easily transmitted to deer, livestock, and humans.\nSince Burgdorfer’s seminal paper realizing Borrelia as the causative agent of Lyme disease, the wide range and inconspicuous nature of the disease have become clear. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are approximately 30,000 reported cases of Lyme disease in the United States each year; however, more recent estimates place this number as high as 300,000, owing to frequent misdiagnosis and under-reporting. Not only is Lyme disease the most common vector-borne illness in the US, but recent studies suggest that it is on the rise in other locations as well. With climate change leading to the northern expansion of temperate conditions, reservoir and vector hosts of Lyme disease stray further and further from their original habitats. Because of this, B. burgdorferi is expected to expand its territory northward by 250–500 km in the next 30 years. Increases in Lyme disease incidence are already occurring in many parts of Canada and are expected to continue into the next decades. As well, Lyme disease continues to rise steadily throughout Europe (e.g., Germany, Sweden, Austria) and is beginning to take hold in Asia, particularly in regions of China.\nThe earliest manifestation of Lyme disease is the appearance of a typically bullseye-shaped rash, known as an erythema migrans, at the site of infection. While this rash is generally sufficient for Lyme diagnosis, it only occurs in 70–80% of cases, making it unreliable as a main indicator. Other than the erythema migrans, the most common symptoms are headaches and arthralgia, but these are far too general to indicate Lyme disease. As the disease progresses, Borrelia disseminate from the site of tick attachment and travel throughout the body, causing early disseminated symptoms that can include multiple erythema migrans, carditis, and meningitis. If left untreated for a prolonged period, Lyme disease may progress to a more severe late stage that can include encephalitis and arthritis, among other serious symptoms. While Lyme disease is easily treated with antibiotics if caught early, delayed diagnosis and/or treatment can prove more difficult to treat and lead to more serious health effects.\n2. Current Methods of Diagnosis\nIn cases where an erythema migrans is not present or proves inconclusive, a global consensus of guidelines recommends the use of a standard two-tiered (STT) serology approach for the diagnosis of Lyme disease. This approach involves an initial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to measure antibody response to Borrelia antigens — often in the form of a whole-cell Borrelia sonicate. If this EIA/IFA returns a positive or equivocal result, then a follow-up Western blot is used to verify the presence of antibodies for a panel of specific Borrelia proteins. A meta-analysis of thirteen two-tiered serology studies across North America estimated the sensitivity of the approach at 46.3% for those with early-stage Lyme disease (symptoms for less than 30 days), 89.7% for those with early disseminated Lyme disease (30+ days), and 99.4% for those with late-stage Lyme disease. Specificity estimates for the two-tiered methodology were approximately 99% for all disease stages.\nRecently, a modified two-tiered (MTT) approach, in which the western blot of the STT is replaced with a second immunoassay, was approved for use in the United States. Compared to the STT, the MTT demonstrates increased sensitivity for early Lyme disease, similar or slightly higher sensitivity for later stages of the disease, and similar specificity for all stages. A comparison of the STT and MTT approaches on several collections of sera from patients with erythema migrans and early Lyme disease estimated the sensitivity of the MTT test to be approximately 50%, while the sensitivity of the STT test on the same samples was approximately 40%.\nWhile the sensitivity of the current two-tiered serology approaches is very high for disseminated Lyme disease, it remains quite difficult to detect the disease in its early stages. The development of anti-Borrelia antibodies can take upwards of three weeks to reach sufficient detection levels in the blood. Since the current standard relies on these antibodies, it is evident that a more direct method of detection is necessary to diagnose Lyme disease prior to its dissemination. The necessity of improved diagnostics is underscored by the recent and expected increases in Lyme disease, the potential for serious health difficulties, and the current diagnosis difficulties (e.g., misdiagnosis, false positives).\nThe entry is from 10.3390/bios10100137\n- W Burgdorfer; A G Barbour; S F Hayes; J L Benach; E Grunwaldt; J P Davis; Lyme disease-a tick-borne spirochetosis?.

However, plastic packaging faces significant challenges due to the existence of 27 base polymers with infinite combinations, making sorting and recycling expensive and difficult. Solutions include implementing effective separate collection systems, limiting polymer types used in consumer goods, designing all plastics for recycling, and establishing clear Extended Producer Responsibility frameworks with full cost coverage. Both materials require improved separation-at-source infrastructure at the municipal level to enhance recycling efforts.	['Increasing the amount of metal packaging being recycled is a key focus of MetPac-SA, the newly-formed producer responsibility organisation representing the steel, tinplate and aluminium packaging industries.\nPrecious metals in the recycling stream\n“Aluminium and steel packaging are the world’s most recycled packaging and are literally worth their weight in gold,” says Delanie Bezuidenhout, CEO of MetPac-SA. “Originally, beverage cans were made from steel, and have successfully been collected in South Africa for the past 25 years. In many regards, it can be said that we have lead the way for responsible recovery and recycling of packaging in our country.”\nAccording to Bezuidenhout, aluminium and metal cans are regarded as high value items by recyclers, and therefore has the potential for generating greater income and securing bigger margins across the entire collection chain.\n“Buy-back centres continue to pay well for cans that are collected, thereby providing a much needed income for schools and informal collectors,” she said. “We want to ensure that every can entering the market is collected and recycled, and that everybody in the value chain works together – from the informal collectors pushing their trolleys, through to the scrap dealers.”\nRecycling aluminium cans not only saves on scarce natural resources, such as Bauxite, but also on energy.\n“Twenty recycled cans can be made with the energy needed to produce one new can using primary aluminium ingot,” Bezuidenhout explained. “Similarly, recycling one beverage can save the amount of energy needed to burn a 100w bulb for 4 hours.”\nSpreading the message to the community\nBezuidenhout said that over the past 25 years, the local cans industry has built an impressive track record of recycling accomplishments, thanks to the terrific work done by Collect-a- Can and their shareholders who achieved much success with their recoveries and ongoing education about recycling.\nFounded by ArcelorMittal South Africa and Nampak as a way to proactively address the beverage can industry’s responsibility to the environment, Collect-a- Can has played a major role in the recovery of scrap tinplate generated in the tinplate and can-making processes. This includes cut-offs, misprints, sub-standard fills, and used metal cans.\nOver the years, this initiative has helped improve southern Africa’s used beverage can recovery rate from 18% to around 72%.\nIndustry accountable for its waste\n“We are also fortunate to have important end-users such as Hulamin on our Board of Directors, as they understand the important role recycling plays in ensuring the sustainability of our industry and the environment,” Bezuidenhout says.\nOver the past 75 years, Hulamin has been involved in the recycling of their internally generated process scrap as well as the fabrication scrap generated by customers, Bezuidenhout explained. “They took this commitment a significant step further by investing R300 million two years ago in a recycling plant that process and cleans used beverage cans, thereby enhancing the company’s capability in the recycling of aluminium scrap,” she said.\n“Recycling certainly makes a lot of business sense to us and for this reason we have adopted the principle of ‘extended producer responsibility’ in our business,” says Riccardo Benedetti, commercial manager of metals and recycling at Hulamin. “Simply put, this means that if we make a product, we also take our share of the responsibility for its recycling at the end of its life.\n“Recycling not only supplies us with aluminium raw material, but also ensures that products made from our aluminium are not lost to the precious aluminium resource pool,” he adds.\nScrap with worth\nA key recycling collection channel for the metals sector is the scrap metals industry.\n“We are expecting the amount of aluminium recoveries from beverage cans alone to increase significantly over the next five years,” Bezuidenhout says. “In order to minimise the risk of illegal scrap exports, which ultimately reduces the locally-available scrap pool, MetPac-SA will also be closely monitoring and working with the players in this sector.”\nShe emphasised that significant benefits and synergies can be unlocked by packaging waste streams joining hands and working together. “For example, material collection can greatly be enhanced through reverse logistics in the supply chain,” she said.\nDriving the recycling message home\nAlthough there are numerous recycling initiatives and incentives established in communities around the country, MetPac-SA believes that an inherent recycling culture still needs to be established in South Africa.\n“We are adding our voice to that of other material streams in educating the public around the why, what and how of recycling,” Bezuidenhout says. “Once consumers truly understand the need and value of recycling and the importance of reusing metal packaging, they will stop citing factors such as drop off points or storage space as barriers to recycling.\n“However, we do agree with the repeated calls by more established players in the packaging industry that an effective separation-at-source infrastructure needs to be implemented at municipal level.”', 'Municipal Waste Europe A.I.S.B.L.\nMember: NGO Free\nRue des Deux Eglises 26/5, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium\nMunicipal Waste Europe: EU Strategy on Plastics in a Circular Economy\nEU Strategy on Plastics in a Circular Economy\nPlastics have formed a key component of our 21st century economy and now constitute a major environmental problem.\nPlastic waste causes difficulties to resource and waste management as there are problems with lifespan, repairability, reusability and recyclability which need to be addressed, particularly with packaging, due to the diversity in plastic packaging materials and the number of plastic packages entering the waste stream on a daily basis. This puts a strain on collection systems and in countries without effective waste collection and treatment this plastic packaging all too easily becomes land and marine litter. In effect, plastic packaging in such a situation, even if technically recyclable, is not effectively recyclable because it does not reach a recycling plant. Other products such as synthetic textiles which lose microfibers in the wash, microbeads, oxo-degradable plastics, should be phased out as they have viable alternatives which do not create environmental damage.\nActions needed to rectify the problems:\n1. Effective Separate Collection of packaging. Municipal Waste Europe worked hard, together with fellow stakeholders, to develop and achieve a strong, transparent and goal-oriented framework for Extended Producer Responsibility within the revised Waste Framework Directive. Only through clear roles and full cost coverage by EPR will separate collection attract the necessary investment to achieve clean, recyclable streams. EPR can also be implemented using deposit refund schemes or combined with them in accordance with national preference.\n2. All Plastic should be designed for recycling. Currently there are 27 base polymers1 on the market with infinite combinations and variations thereof, most of which are used in single use products. This variety of polymers and their daily entry into the waste stream is the most expensive aspect of collection, sorting and recycling for municipalities. MWE proposes a limitation of polymer types used in fast moving consumer goods and that all polymers used for such products should be designed for cost-effective sorting and recycling.\n3. CO2 considerations. The generation of primary plastic materials from fossil fuels should be carefully considered in future in view of the excessive quantity of CO2 emitted in their production. Greater focus should be placed on collecting existing plastics from the waste stream for recycling into production cycles, a process which emits a fraction of the CO2 that is emitted by fossil fuel extraction, hence can help towards the achievement of the climate change goals.\n4. Definition of Biodegradable Plastic. There are so many different uses of the term biodegradable plastic currently that the waste treatment experts do not know which, if any treatment method is suitable for different plastic products which have been labelled as biodegradable. Before this term can be further used in practice, a clear definition must be established and implemented.\n5. Recycled Content. Municipal Waste Europe supports the use of minimum recycled content as a requirement for new plastic products as a way of promoting recycling and reducing the use of primary raw materials.\n6. Subsidies. While subsidies still exist on fossil fuels rendering virgin plastics cheaper than recycled plastics, the latter will always be at a competitive disadvantage. This therefore is the first economic barrier which needs to be removed.\n7. Innovation. New sorting and recycling procedures are being developed at a very rapid rate, including depolymerisation which would allow those plastics to be recycled or indeed reassembled into new polymers indefinitely. Therefore, although the number of recycling loops is low currently, perhaps 6 loops for PET, new techniques can change that in the near future.\n8. Non-packaging items: toys, textiles, other household items. The municipal waste stream also contains many nonpackaging plastics which today are addressed under the general title of ‘plastics’ in the Waste Framework Directive with a 50% recycling target. However, many Member States do not have collection and recycling schemes for such plastic waste as more focus is given to those plastics covered by Extended Producer Responsibility Schemes. As a result they often end up in landfill as part of residual waste or even as marine litter. Some of the hard plastics already have a market for recycling and this should be further promoted. Future action on plastics should require that these items are recyclable.\n9. Repair and Reuse. The plastics strategy should focus on facilitating collection for repair and reuse of relevant waste products and on removing barriers to this process where they exist. Either in European or in national legislation.\n10. EU Funding. European Funding, whether grants or loans or a combination thereof, should take great care to support innovation in ecodesign to ensure the recyclability of the next generation of plastic products, innovation in recycling, implementation of new recycling plants in Europe to absorb the large quantities of plastic waste nolonger imported by China, investment in new sorting techniques and transformation of less performing techniques and investment in effective collection methodologies.\n11. Municipal Waste Europe will be working closely with all of its member municipalities as well as other European municipalities to assist them to implement the above as well as the new requirements of the revised Waste Framework Directive. We will be very pleased to work alongside the Commission services to progress the changes needed both to prevent further environmental degradation and to effect a circular and stable economy.\n12. Energy recovery preferable to landfilling plastics. In today’s waste stream, very few plastic polymers are recyclable and truly recycled. This high energy containing waste is lost to the European economy in a landfill and would be better used for energy recovery in a waste to energy plant. In the numerous European cases where landfills are uncovered, energy recovery rather than landfilling will also remove the possibility of these plastics becoming land and marine litter.\n1 Ref: plastics the facts, Plastics Europe']	['<urn:uuid:10edee42-c824-4f18-9d8a-841ea0de773d>', '<urn:uuid:b38bcde6-b5e8-427f-a86a-852481684720>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	10	95	1783
68	looking for info about how long scottish people were not allowed to wear their traditional clothes	After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, clans were banned from wearing tartan for nearly 100 years. The penalty for wearing tartan during this period was severe - anyone caught wearing it could be sent into exile for up to seven years.	"['Scottish clans, historically, were a system of tribal groups, a system which can be traced back to around the 12th century. These clans were led by a chief, who had unlimited power and authority over its members. Clan members bear the surname of their chief, whether related by blood or not.\nHistorians believe that clans evolved in the first to be warriors, with the primary intention of protecting the herds. Clan mottos, such as that of the Stuart clan, ""no one harms me with impunity,"" seem to provide credibility behind this theory. Ancient clans were also quite regimented, creating rules for behaviour, which spurred the reputation of the noble code of Scottish hospitality, which lives on today.\nClans were, even back in the 12th century, known to wear a chequered wool blanket-like cloth, which was called a plaid. In early times, the plaid was worn similarly to that as a Roman toga, wrapped, folded, and pinned in place. By the early 17th century, the cloth became a bit thinner, and was called ""tartane"" (""light wool""). The tartan was belted, the ensemble was known as ""Feileadh Mor,"" or ""great plaid,"" and this was wrapped around the waist and shoulders, over other clothing.\nWith this early progenitor of the kilt, a bonnet was worn. The bonnet was symbolically quite important, as it identified the clan leader where necessary, and clans were distinguised by a differing plant badge worn at the front with the clan crest, especially on the day of a battle.\nA sporran traditionally was made of goat or badger skin, and hung in front, just under where the tartan was belted. Since the Scot had no pockets, this pouch acted as a purse, which had several compartments. Typically a man would use the sporran to hold possessions such as his watch, money, shot for his guns.\nWhen travelling, a knapsack called a dorlach was carried on the right side at times, which would hold food items and other provisions needed for longer journeys. A ""dirk,"" which was basically a knife blade about a foot long in length, would also have been worn, to complete the ensemble.\nThe Kilt Grows Up\nAfter the defeat at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, all clan land was entitled to Royalty. In addition, clans were banned of wearing tartan for nearly 100 years. Anyone caught wearing it faced a heavy penalty - that of being sent in exile for up to seven years!\nOnce the ban on wearing tartan was lifted, there was much renewed interest in Scottish heritage. People started to wear a pattern of tartan that was common to the area in which they lived, so tartans began to become identified as much by area as by family.\nThe modern clansmen dress today is mostly reserved for formal occasions, and those engaged in tradional activities (ever see a piper wear jeans?). The one piece feileadh mor has been replaced by the more practical feileadh beag (""small plaid""), which is about 23 feet of material with a double apron at the front fastened by a pin. The modern kilt is reported, ironically, to have been invented by an Englishman, Thomas Rawlinson, to keep his Highlander employees from harm in his iron works factory.\nWhether or not clansmen wear knickers under their kilts is a complete mystery which should probably remain that way. If you\'re dying to know, though, perhaps you can find out on the following informational web sites:']"	['<urn:uuid:c2b634cc-9bb0-4f2c-87eb-7c3b0616a913>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	16	42	576
69	How do you help students understand the exponential growth of cells through mathematical calculations and visual representation?	Students calculate the number of cells produced when a single cell divides into two cells every hour for 12 hours, assuming no cell death. They calculate cell numbers for each hour up to 12 hours and graph the data in their science journals, with one axis representing the number of cells and the other representing hours. Students compare results with each other to identify mathematical patterns. However, it's important to note that in nature, this exponential growth is limited because cells die, new cells must reach a certain size before dividing, and populations reach a point where death rate equals division rate.	"['Classroom teacher; Art teacher could be helpful\nProducing, Executing and Performing\nIn this lesson, students use calculation to predict the number of cells that result from a series of cell divisions. They then graph the results to represent their findings. Students use this investigation as a starting point for an exploration of pattern and repetition in nature, culminating with an activity in which they create a repeated or random pattern of their own. This lesson will help students gain an understanding of how patterns are reflected in nature.\nIdentify and describe the exponential growth of a hypothetical dividing cell\nCreate a graph showing their results\nExamine examples of patterns in nature\nCreate a patterned drawing\nWhat You\'ll Need\n1 Computer per Small Group\n1 Computer per Classroom\nUnderstand cell reproduction\nBe familiar with the Fibonacci sequence, tessellation, and other mathematical patterning found in nature\nPrior Student Knowledge\nThis lesson builds on prior lessons in the \'The Magic Universe of Cells\' unit, so students should understand basic cell anatomy and function, including mitosis.\nStudents should have some experience with exponents.\nStudents should have experience with drawing and interpreting graphs.\nStudents should be familiar with the use of microscopes.\nLarge Group Instruction\nSmall Group Instruction\nIf microscopes are used, slides with live cells should be prepared.\nStudents with physical disabilities may need modified movements.\nResources in Reach\nHere are the resources you\'ll need for each activity, in order of instruction.\n1. Remind students that living things, including cells, reproduce, and review the process of mitosis if necessary. (See the Point out that different plants and animals take different lengths of time to reproduce and explain to students that different cells also reproduce at different rates, even within the same organism. Some cells take 20 minutes to reproduce, while others may take 24 hours. Some, like skin cells, continually reproduce, while others, like those in the liver, don’t usually reproduce in adult humans at all. Vocabulary handout located within the Resource Carousel if students need to refresh their memories.)\n2. Ask students to calculate the number of cells produced in a hypothetical scenario. Have them imagine a cell that divides into two cells every hour for 12 hours. Assuming no cells die during the 12-hour period, how many cells would exist after 12 hours? While students will probably not have an immediate answer to the question, encourage discussion of possible approaches to the problem.\n3. Distribute the Have students calculate cell numbers for each hour up to 12 hours, then graph the data in their science journals. One axis of the graph should represent the number of cells and the other axis should represent the hours up to the 12th hour. Allow students to compare their results with other students. Ask them if they notice any mathematical patterns. Cell Division Chart handout located within the Resource Carousel to students.\n4. Have students look at cells under a microscope in small groups. If you do not have microscopes available in the classroom, students can look at images of cells at the Nanoworld gallery. As students continue to look at cells throughout the lesson, they should begin to notice patterns within, based on, or comprised of cells.\n1. Discuss patterns in nature. Patterns can be random or repeated. The forest with all its trees is a random repeated pattern, as are waves in an ocean or cars lined up along the street. Have students find ten different patterns in their current surroundings. Compare results and list some examples of both random and repeated patterns.\n2. Show students examples of patterns that artists have captured from nature. View artists’ images of patterns in nature on these websites:\nNikon’s Small World Competition\nZeiss Gallery National Geographic’s\nPatterns in Nature (7 galleries) Bill\nGraham’s Patterns in Nature\n3. Discuss the patterns as works of art. The galleries above show works of photography or microscopy (photography using an electron microscope). These patterns existed in nature but were captured and presented in intentional ways by artists. Ask students to compare the range of images and approaches, noticing the style and creativity of the artists. Explain to students that the artists were creative in their presentation of the patterns, thus creating a vibrant and original piece of art from nature.\n4. As a class, list some of the choices the artists made in their representation of the patterns of nature. Some characteristics that should be included on the list:\nUsing only a portion of the original design\nChanging the angle of vision\nRepeating the shapes from a variety of views\nConnecting patterns together\n5. Look more closely at the natural patterns in cells. As a class, focus on the cells viewed in the microscopes, or on images of cells (such as those in the . Point out how each cell contains a series of lines, which are joined together to create a pattern, and then repeated. The lines can be wavy, thick, thin, circular, zigzag, short or long, tiny or massive. Nanoworld Gallery)\n1. Tell students to choose a cell that they would like to make into a design pattern and copy it on a sheet of drawing paper. Have them refer to their notes from lesson one in this unit, What is Inside a Cell?, regarding the use of color. Allow them to use a microscope or magnifying glass as they copy the cell, encouraging them to use the level of accuracy and detail that a scientific illustrator would use. Remind them to be as accurate as possible with line and color.\n2. Have students create a patterned picture based on their completed cell drawing. Have students take a 12” x 18” sheet of heavy white paper and divide it into 24 equal boxes. They will now have to decide how to display their cell. Discuss some possible approaches:\nRepeat the same cell in each box.\n(You may wish to show how Andy Warhol used this technique in many of his designs.)\nRepeat the cell in each box but vary it by turning it upside down\nRepeat the same cell but flip it in each box\nRepeat the cell but rotate it in a random or regular pattern\nShow different parts of the cell in each box\nOffset the cell images by showing both the top and bottom of the image in a box, but reversing the order in neighboring boxes\n3. Encourage students to be creative in their patterning. Display the finished artworks.\nHave students discuss the following questions about their calculations and their patterned picture:\nHow are the results of this activity different from what would happen in nature?\nHow would the data/numbers be different?\nSome points to introduce:\nCells die as well as dividing.\nNew cells have to reach a certain size before they’ll divide.\nCells reach a point at which the rate of death is equal to the rate of division, so the population of cells doesn’t normally keep dividing indefinitely.\nCells are less tidy than the boxes on the paper.\nAnimal cells have membranes, but plant and some other cells also have cell walls. The patterns created by cells with and without walls differ.\nThroughout the nation, standards of learning are being revised, published and adopted.

70	difference between analytical balance other scales	Analytical weight balances are more delicate and precise compared to other weighing machines. They can measure extremely small weights with accuracy up to 0.01g, though they don't provide readability beyond three decimal places. They are specifically designed for laboratory use and are not suitable for high weight values or commercial purposes. These balances are highly sensitive to changes and are enclosed in glass cabinets to prevent external interference with measurements.	['If you are a student of science, and to be more precise of chemistry, you will be familiar with a variety of scales and balances and similar equipment that are needed for accurately weighing ingredients for any chemical experiment. Available from various top brands in this industry, and analytical weighing balance should be very accurately designed so that the user gets the ultimate accurate results every time. These are highly sensitive equipment and can react to the minimum weight. That is the primary reason why it is being used for measuring things as light as dust. In this post, we will share everything that you should be known about analytical weight balances so that you can make the most of these machines. They are not for domestic and commercial use and mostly seen in laboratories.\nDifferent types of weighing balances\nThere are several types of weighing scales and balances which are used in research work and in the laboratories. Analytical weighing balance is perhaps the most complex of all of them. It is designed to measure the weight of the lightest elements precisely. Apart from this equipment, there are several other types of weighing balance that you will find in the lab:\nAnalytical weighing balance- These balances are used for measuring the mass of elements. They are very useful for chemical analysis works. There is a pan in the balance area and other parts include leveling pan, plump bob, etc. All these are enclosed in a glass container which makes sure that the delicate internal mechanisms are not damaged or affected in any way.\nTrip balance- these scales include two pans on the opposite sides of the lever and are the modern version of the Egyptian scales. The object is placed on one side of the scale and equivalent weights are placed on the other side. The sum of the standard weights will be equal to the mass of the object that is being measured.\nPlatform scales- this type of weighing machine works based on multiplying levers on a load soaring platform. The weight is transferred to a beam that can balance by moving the counter pieces and counterbalances the weight on the platform. These machines are useful for measuring the weights of drums and of animals in the veterinary clinic.\nWhy analytical balances are considered different from others?\nUnlike other weight machines, the analytical weight balance is more delicate and have very unique features that make it much different from the others. They can deliver very precise results as low as 0.01g to 1g. They are highly sensitive to any kind of changes and hence they are very accurate and are sealed inside a glass cabinet so that the weighing procedure is not affected by any external elements. However, they do not provide readability more than three decimal places. They are best suited for labs where such a small amount of weights can make a big difference. These machines are not meant for high weight values.\nFeatures of the analytical weighing balance\nThere are several features and functions of the analytical weighing balance. They come with counting and check counting application features. They are very useful for counting pills, small animals, ingredients, and unstable elements like anything liquid. Some of them also have percentage weighing which allows more efficient and accurate formulation and useful is chemistry and pharmaceutical application. You can also accumulate all the elements and get their combined weight which is very useful for finding out doses.\nGLP/ISO reports are essential in various laboratory work and these balances can easily help you find all these values. This means the researchers can get more time for their actual experiment and do not have to calculate and formulate the results which are already being done through these machines. However, these balances take a longer time to stabilize compared to precision balances.\nThese weigh are also seen in school labs for demonstration and application for science students. Compared to other types of weights these are more expensive and you will not find any daily application for these machines. Nonetheless, they are very useful and elemental when seen from the perspective of experimentations and science projects.\nIf you are buying any of these, make sure the balance is stable and accurately designed. You should go to a reputable manufacturer and not comprise the cost if you are looking for high quality. The analytical weighing scales are among the most indispensable laboratory equipment which you cannot do without especially if you are a student or practitioner of chemistry or pharmaceutical science.\nWhen you know about the various nuances associated with these weighing scales, you will be able to choose the best one which is suitable for the laboratory set-up. Moreover, you will also be able to understand its application better and put it to good use.']	['<urn:uuid:054bd3fe-f0c5-4970-a08d-ab270ae6587b>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	6	70	804
71	What's CVRF's framework purpose and vendor policy importance?	CVRF is an XML framework enabling organizations to share vulnerability information in a machine-readable format, while vendor management policies are crucial for minimizing third-party risks and ensuring vendors properly handle sensitive data access and security requirements.	"['CVRF is an XML-based framework that enables stakeholders across different organizations to share critical vulnerability-related information in an open and common machine-readable format. This format replaces the myriad of current nonstandard reporting formats, thus speeding up information exchange and processing. CVRF is available to the public free of charge, along with additional information, at ICASI.org/cvrf.\n""CVRF represents a true milestone in industry efforts to raise and broaden awareness of security vulnerabilities,"" said Linda Betz, president of ICASI and director of IT Policy and Information Security at IBM. ""With the use of CVRF, the producers of vulnerability reports will benefit from faster and more standardized reporting. End users will be able to find, process and act upon relevant information more quickly and easily, with a higher level of confidence that the information is accurate and comprehensive. Consumers will ultimately benefit with safer systems and applications.""\nAlthough the computer security community has made significant progress in several other areas in recent years, including categorizing and ranking the severity of vulnerabilities in information systems, there has been no standard framework for creating vulnerability report documentation. Methods such as embedding security metric and vulnerability data inside response reports are all vendor-specific, non-standard and time consuming to decipher manually.\nThrough its CVRF Project, ICASI undertook to remedy this lack of standardization, using the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) draft Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) as a starting point. The project team – including contributors from ICASI Founding Members Cisco Systems, Intel Corporation, International Business Machines, Juniper Networks, Microsoft Corporation and Nokia, along with representatives from Oracle and Red Hat – also surveyed enterprise users about similarities and differences in current vulnerability reporting, asking them what future reporting methods should address. The team then expanded existing security documentation formats and integrated a best-of-breed solution into a common, open XML-based framework CVRF that brings consolidation and consistency to the security vulnerability documentation space, and is expected to grow organically among stakeholders.\nThe XML-based framework of CVRF predefines a large number of fields, with extensibility and robustness in mind. These fields are consistent in naming and data type, so that any organization that adopts and understands CVRF can easily produce documents or read the ones that another CVRF-equipped organization has produced. Independent discoverers of bugs, large vendors, security coordinators and end users of security response efforts worldwide can all write CVRF documents to share critical vulnerability-related information. Widespread use of CVRF will accelerate information dissemination and exchange and incident resolution as a result.\nICASI\'s intention is that CVRF be a living framework that will be enhanced and revised as necessary. ICASI plans to continue supporting CVRF to ensure that it will remain both stable and free for use by all. Implementers are encouraged to submit their suggestions for improvements to [email protected]\nThe Industry Consortium for Advancement of Security on the Internet (ICASI) provides a unique forum of trust through which global companies can collaborate to actively address complex, multi-product security threats to better protect the critical IT infrastructures that support the world’s enterprises, governments and citizens. ICASI was founded by Cisco Systems, Intel Corporation, International Business Machines, Juniper Networks, Microsoft Corporation and Nokia. For more information, visit ICASI.org.', ""The purpose of a vendor management policy is to identify which vendors put your organization at risk and then define controls to minimize third-party and fourth-party risk. It starts with due diligence and assessing whether a third-party vendor should have access to sensitive data.\nThese internal controls could include rewriting vendor contracts to ensure vendors meet a certain level of security, implementing an annual inspection or replacing existing vendors with new vendors who meet security service level agreements (SLA) and SOC 2 security requirements. Make sure you evaluate new and existing vendors again by putting out RFPs at the end of each contract life cycle.\nWhy Your Organization Needs a Vendor Management Policy\nWhile many organizations have internal security policies in place, they often lack a clear understanding of the risks that stem from third-party vendors. Pair this with the growing number of legal, regulatory, financial and reputational reasons to have a vendor management policy.\nRegulators have recognized that third-party data breaches and data leaks represent significant cybersecurity risk. This has led to increased regulatory scrutiny on third-party risk management, information risk management and vendor risk management, particularly around vendors who have access to personally identifiable information (PII).\nOutside of regulatory and legal issues, the cost of a data breach has never been higher at $3.92 million. Data breaches involving third-parties increased the average costs by more than $370,000 to $4.29 million. These costs exclude some of the biggest data breaches like Equifax and Facebook.\nHow Do Third-Party Relationships Introduce More Potential Risks?\nEvery organization should be concerned with third-parties that have access to sensitive data, intellectual property or corporate network. The more third-parties you are working with the higher the number of cyber attacks potential attackers can exploit.\nOutsourcing is becoming more common, organizations look to their vendors to frequently save costs or capitalize a vendor's expertise. This is often the right business decision but it's important to understand the more vendors you have, the more cyber threats you create.\nSenior management should take into account information security, data security, network security, disaster recovery, information security policies and access control as well as cost, information technology and vendor expertise as part of the vendor selection process.\nWhy Continuous Monitoring is a Must For Any Vendor Management Program\nMany organizations enter vendor relationships not fully understanding how the vendor is managing and processing theirs and their customers' data.\nIn many cases, organizations have not set out requirements for how their vendors should be securing data. And even if they do, they often struggle to operationalize monitoring.\nPair this with the fact that new vulnerabilities are added to CVE on a daily basis and that your vendors likely have vendors (fourth-party risk) who may have access to your data and monitoring vendor risk by hand becomes near impossible.\nThis is why you should investing in tools that automatically monitor and rate your vendors' security performance and automate security questionnaires.\nIt's not enough to only monitor your organization for data exposures and leaked credentials. You need a holistic view of first, third and fourth-party risk.\nWhat are the Consequences of Not Having a Vendor Management Policy?\nA quick Google search will show thousands of results for data breaches that resulted from third-party vendors. Each one of these is a concrete example of what can happen as a result of poor vendor management. Organizations need to prevent first and third-party data breaches.\nIf your organization does not have a vendor management policy, you are being negligent. Negligent to your customers, shareholders and employees.\nUnfortunately, not having a policy in place means there is a high chance that your organization's sensitive data and your customers' personally identifiable information (PII) is being handled by someone who shouldn't have access.\nWhether a data breach is a result of a third-party vendor, cyber attack or mistake is generally irrelevant to your customers. Data breaches have a massive negative impact on customers' trust in your organization. The average data breach leads to $1.42 million in lost business and 3.9 percent of customers churning.\nHow to Create a Vendor Management Policy\nBefore creating a vendor management policy, gather a list of your vendors. Keep in mind, the definition of a vendor is broad. A vendor is every third-party, contractor or associate your organization does business with.\nIt's not enough to have a vague idea of who your vendors are, you need to know exactly who are your vendors are in order to effectively monitor them.\nOnce the list is compiled, determine which vendors:\n- have access to sensitive data or personally identifiable information (PII)\n- have access to your internal network\n- your organization relies on for important business activities\nVendors that meet this criteria should be categorized as critical and are where you should spend the majority of your time learning about, monitoring and where necessary requesting remediation.\nIf one of these vendors is compromised, it could lead to a damaging data breach.\nWhat Should a Vendor Management Policy Include?\nYour vendor management policy should include:\n- Service level agreements (SLAs)\n- Vendor compliance standards\n- Acceptable vendor controls\n- Vendor liability in the event of a data breach\n- Vendor review (SOC 2 report, site visits and auditing requirements)\n- Termination of contract when security requirements aren't met\n- Board or senior management oversight where needed\n- Disaster recovery and established redundancies for important business functions\nDuring this process, determine whether the level of access each vendor has makes sense. Not all vendors require the same level of access to sensitive data, network and information technology systems to do their job.\nHow to Assess New Vendors With a Vendor Management Policy\nFor new vendors, a robust vendor management policy will allow you to determine whether to do business with them in the first place. The purpose of this policy is to ensure all vendors are managing sensitive information correctly.\nMost importantly, don't stop vendor management after due diligence.\nTraditional vendor risk management assessments are subjective, unverifiable, unactionable and at a point in time. You need a way to continuously monitor and verify that a third-party's security posture hasn't changed and be alerted if new risks and vulnerabilities occur.\nHow UpGuard Can Help You Manage Your Vendor Risk\nVendor management policies can be hard to operationalize. From sending security questionnaires to collecting data, it's a laborious process.\nUpGuard Vendor Risk can minimize the amount of time your organization spends managing third-party relationships by automating vendor questionnaires and continuously monitoring your vendors' security posture over time while benchmarking them against their industry.\nEach day, our platform scores your vendors with a Cyber Security Rating out of 950. We can even alert you if their score drops.\nFor first-party risk, UpGuard BreachSight can continuously scan for and discover data exposures and leaked credentials related to all parts of your business.\nBook a demo today to start preventing first and third-party data breaches.""]"	['<urn:uuid:05f8d85c-990d-457c-a37f-60eebde0909a>', '<urn:uuid:77f5c12e-c433-41a7-843e-85aedd8104fa>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	8	36	1684
72	why can people hear quiet whispers and how do doctors repair torn earlobes	The human ear is incredibly sensitive, able to detect sounds ranging from 0 dB SPL to 140 dB SPL, with the ear drum vibrating less than a molecule's diameter for faint sounds. Torn earlobes can be surgically repaired by creating matching flaps from the torn tissue, fitting them together, and stitching them, with the procedure typically performed in a doctor's office.	"[""The human ear is an exceedingly complex organ. To make matters even more difficult, the information from two ears is combined in a perplexing neural network, the human brain. Keep in mind that the following is only a brief overview; there are many subtle effects and poorly understood phenomena related to human hearing.\nFigure 22-1 illustrates the major structures and processes that comprise the human ear. The outer ear is composed of two parts, the visible flap of skin and cartilage attached to the side of the head, and the ear canal, a tube about 0.5 cm in diameter extending about 3 cm into the head. These structures direct environmental sounds to the sensitive middle and inner ear organs located safely inside of the skull bones. Stretched across the end of the ear canal is a thin sheet of tissue called the tympanic membrane or ear drum. Sound waves striking the tympanic membrane cause it to vibrate. The middle ear is a set of small bones that transfer this vibration to the cochlea (inner ear) where it is converted to neural impulses. The cochlea is a liquid filled tube roughly 2 mm in diameter and 3 cm in length. Although shown straight in Fig. 22-1, the cochlea is curled up and looks like a small snail shell. In fact, cochlea is derived from the Greek word for snail.\nWhen a sound wave tries to pass from air into liquid, only a small fraction of the sound is transmitted through the interface, while the remainder of the energy is reflected. This is because air has a low mechanical impedance (low acoustic pressure and high particle velocity resulting from low density and high compressibility), while liquid has a high mechanical impedance. In less technical terms, it requires more effort to wave your hand in water than it does to wave it in air. This difference in mechanical impedance results in most of the sound being reflected at an air/liquid interface.\nThe middle ear is an impedance matching network that increases the fraction of sound energy entering the liquid of the inner ear. For example, fish do not have an ear drum or middle ear, because they have no need to hear in air. Most of the impedance conversion results from the difference in area between the ear drum (receiving sound from the air) and the oval window (transmitting sound into the liquid, see Fig. 22-1). The ear drum has an area of about 60 (mm)2, while the oval window has an area of roughly 4 (mm)2. Since pressure is equal to force divided by area, this difference in area increases the sound wave pressure by about 15 times.\nContained within the cochlea is the basilar membrane, the supporting structure for about 12,000 sensory cells forming the cochlear nerve. The basilar membrane is stiffest near the oval window, and becomes more flexible toward the opposite end, allowing it to act as a frequency spectrum analyzer. When exposed to a high frequency signal, the basilar membrane resonates where it is stiff, resulting in the excitation of nerve cells close to the oval window. Likewise, low frequency sounds excite nerve cells at the far end of the basilar membrane. This makes specific fibers in the cochlear nerve respond to specific frequencies. This organization is called the place principle, and is preserved throughout the auditory pathway into the brain.\nAnother information encoding scheme is also used in human hearing, called the volley principle. Nerve cells transmit information by generating brief electrical pulses called action potentials. A nerve cell on the basilar membrane can encode audio information by producing an action potential in response to each cycle of the vibration. For example, a 200 hertz sound wave can be represented by a neuron producing 200 action potentials per second. However, this only works at frequencies below about 500 hertz, the maximum rate that neurons can produce action potentials. The human ear overcomes this problem by allowing several nerve cells to take turns performing this single task. For example, a 3000 hertz tone might be represented by ten nerve cells alternately firing at 300 times per second. This extends the range of the volley principle to about 4 kHz, above which the place principle is exclusively used.\nTable 22-1 shows the relationship between sound intensity and perceived loudness. It is common to express sound intensity on a logarithmic scale, called decibel SPL (Sound Power Level). On this scale, 0 dB SPL is a sound wave power of 10-16 watts/cm2, about the weakest sound detectable by the human ear. Normal speech is at about 60 dB SPL, while painful damage to the ear occurs at about 140 dB SPL.\nThe difference between the loudest and faintest sounds that humans can hear is about 120 dB, a range of one-million in amplitude. Listeners can detect a change in loudness when the signal is altered by about 1 dB (a 12% change in amplitude). In other words, there are only about 120 levels of loudness that can be perceived from the faintest whisper to the loudest thunder. The sensitivity of the ear is amazing; when listening to very weak sounds, the ear drum vibrates less than the diameter of a single molecule!\nThe perception of loudness relates roughly to the sound power to an exponent of 1/3. For example, if you increase the sound power by a factor of ten, listeners will report that the loudness has increased by a factor of about two (101/3 ≈ 2). This is a major problem for eliminating undesirable environmental sounds, for instance, the beefed-up stereo in the next door apartment. Suppose you diligently cover 99% of your wall with a perfect soundproof material, missing only 1% of the surface area due to doors, corners, vents, etc. Even though the sound power has been reduced to only 1% of its former value, the perceived loudness has only dropped to about 0.011/3 ≈ 0.2, or 20%.\nThe range of human hearing is generally considered to be 20 Hz to 20 kHz, but it is far more sensitive to sounds between 1 kHz and 4 kHz. For example, listeners can detect sounds as low as 0 dB SPL at 3 kHz, but require 40 dB SPL at 100 hertz (an amplitude increase of 100). Listeners can tell that two tones are different if their frequencies differ by more than about 0.3% at 3 kHz. This increases to 3% at 100 hertz. For comparison, adjacent keys on a piano differ by about 6% in frequency.\nThe primary advantage of having two ears is the ability to identify the direction of the sound. Human listeners can detect the difference between two sound sources that are placed as little as three degrees apart, about the width of a person at 10 meters. This directional information is obtained in two separate ways. First, frequencies above about 1 kHz are strongly shadowed by the head. In other words, the ear nearest the sound receives a stronger signal than the ear on the opposite side of the head. The second clue to directionality is that the ear on the far side of the head hears the sound slightly later than the near ear, due to its greater distance from the source. Based on a typical head size (about 22 cm) and the speed of sound (about 340 meters per second), an angular discrimination of three degrees requires a timing precision of about 30 microseconds. Since this timing requires the volley principle, this clue to directionality is predominately used for sounds less than about 1 kHz.\nBoth these sources of directional information are greatly aided by the ability to turn the head and observe the change in the signals. An interesting sensation occurs when a listener is presented with exactly the same sounds to both ears, such as listening to monaural sound through headphones. The brain concludes that the sound is coming from the center of the listener's head!\nWhile human hearing can determine the direction a sound is from, it does poorly in identifying the distance to the sound source. This is because there are few clues available in a sound wave that can provide this information. Human hearing weakly perceives that high frequency sounds are nearby, while low frequency sounds are distant. This is because sound waves dissipate their higher frequencies as they propagate long distances. Echo content is another weak clue to distance, providing a perception of the room size. For example, sounds in a large auditorium will contain echoes at about 100 millisecond intervals, while 10 milliseconds is typical for a small office. Some species have solved this ranging problem by using active sonar. For example, bats and dolphins produce clicks and squeaks that reflect from nearby objects. By measuring the interval between transmission and echo, these animals can locate objects with about 1 cm resolution. Experiments have shown that some humans, particularly the blind, can also use active echo localization to a small extent."", 'Can Ear Deformities Be Corrected?\nFormation of the ear during development is a complex choreography of moving skin and adjacent soft tissue to give rise to the different parts of the ear. If this process is interrupted, various differences in ear shape can occur, with the most severe being absence of the ear (and possibly the ear canal) called microtia, to mild folding differences of the ear. The ""fold"" of hard, raised cartilage that gives shape to the upper portion of the ear does not form in all people. This is called ""lop-ear deformity,"" and it is inherited. The absence of the fold can cause the ear to stick out or flop down (see below). Some infants are born without an ear canal and hearing can be restored with a bone-anchored hearing aid or it can be surgically opened, and the outer ear reshaped to look like the other ear. Those who are born without an ear (microtia), or lose an ear due to injury, can have an artificial ear surgically attached for cosmetic reasons. These are custom formed to match the patient\'s other ear. Alternatively, rib cartilage or a biomedical implant, in addition to the patient\'s own soft tissue, can be used to construct a new ear.\nSurgical Correction of Prominent Ears That Lack Folds\nTo correct this problem, the surgeon places permanent stitches in the upper ear cartilage and ties them in a way that creates a fold and props the ear up. Scar tissue will form later, holding the fold in place. Corrective surgery, called otoplasty, should be considered on ears that stick out more than 4/5 of an inch (2 cm) from the back of the head. It can be performed at any age after the ears have reached full size, usually at five or six years of age. Having the surgery at a young age has two benefits: the cartilage is more pliable, making it easier to reshape, and the child will experience the psychological benefits of the cosmetic improvement. However, a patient may have the surgery at any age.\nThe surgery begins with an incision behind the ear, in the fold where the ear joins the head. The surgeon may remove skin and cartilage or trim and reshape the cartilage. In addition to correcting protrusion, ears may also be reshaped, reduced in size, or made more symmetrical. The cartilage is then secured in the new position with permanent stitches which will anchor the ear while healing occurs.Typically otoplasty surgery takes about two hours. The soft dressings over the ears will be used for a few weeks as protection, and the patient usually experiences only mild discomfort. Headbands are sometimes recommended to hold the ears in place for a month following surgery or may be prescribed for nighttime wear only.\nCan Torn Earlobes Be Corrected?\nEar lobe trauma can occur related to tearing related to injury from small children grabbing the earring or having it caught on clothing or other objects. These tears can be easily repaired surgically, usually in the doctor\'s office. In severe cases, the surgeon may cut a small triangular notch at the bottom of the lobe. A matching flap is then created from tissue on the other side of the tear, and the two wedges are fitted together and stitched. Earlobes usually heal quickly with minimal scarring. In most cases, the earlobe can be pierced again four to six weeks after surgery to receive light-weight earrings.\nDoes Insurance Pay for Cosmetic Ear Surgery?\nInsurance usually does not cover surgery solely for cosmetic reasons. However, insurance may cover, in whole or in part, surgery to correct a congenital or traumatic defect. Before cosmetic ear surgery, discuss the procedure with your insurance carrier to determine what coverage, if any, you can expect.\nOtolaryngology (pronounced oh/toe/lair/in/goll/oh/jee) is the oldest medical specialty in the United States. Otolaryngologists are commonly referred to as ENT physicians.\nOne stop shop for continuing education, patient information, coding resources, member connections, and more.']"	['<urn:uuid:74397cf9-2813-42b1-b3a8-2727800c93fc>', '<urn:uuid:d3d0feec-83ea-4b50-8363-d698ad3afca6>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	13	61	2158
73	hand tools for planting best choice nutrients fertilization method garden soil	For planting, essential hand tools include a hand trowel with curved blade for planting and weeding, and a transplanting trowel (narrower than standard) with depth gauge for bulbs and seedlings. For soil fertilization, water soluble fertilizers are recommended for herbaceous transplants at planting and possibly two and four weeks after planting. These fertilizers, like root stimulators, promote growth through their nitrogen content and readily available phosphate in cool springtime soils.	"[""A pruner, secateurs or lopper with a sharp upper blade cutting downward onto a flat lower blade which is known as the anvil; in a knife action rather than a scissor action. Anvil pruners are best utilised to cut thicker stems of dead, woody materials and are better suited for heavy-duty use than tools with a bypass action as they are less likely to distort or 'spread' when cutting thicker stems.\nDigging tools are traditionally manufactured in two sizes, with the smaller sized heads usually known as border spades and border forks. The smaller head size makes these tools more suited for work amongst plants, borders and confined spaces. In addition, border spades and forks are lighter and often smaller than digging spades and forks, making them a sensible choice for individuals who find digging spades and forks too large or cumbersome.\nA pruner, secateurs or lopper with a scissor like cutting action. Bypass pruners give a cleaner cut than anvil types and are easier to sharpen; however, bypass pruners can distort or 'spread' if asked to cut too thick a stem. Bypass secateurs are an essential part of a gardener's tool kit.\nA simple pointed tool, usually with a 'T' handle, used to make a hole for a seedling to be planted in.\nDigging tools are traditionally manufactured in two sizes, with the larger sized heads usually known as digging spades and digging forks. Digging spades and forks are designed for general tilling and cultivation in medium to heavy soil and should not be used to lever or prise objects such as paving stones or root systems.\nDutch hoes typically have a long handle and a short, flat blade fixed at an angle to the shaft with an edge on both sides of the head. It is pushed and pulled back and forth just beneath the surface of the ground, breaking up compacted soil and slicing off weeds.\nShears with a long handle allowing the user to trim the grass at the edges of a lawn that is often missed by a lawn mower.\nA long-handled tool with a sharp half moon curved blade, used to cut a fine edge to the edge of a lawn, such as where it meets a flower bed.\nGrass Shear (single handed):\nA small shear which can be operated with one hand and is designed for trimming grass and soft foliage. This type of shear often features blades that swivel to allow cutting at any angle.\nA small digging tool for one handed use, with a curved blade designed for planting and weeding. A hand trowel is an essential part of a gardener's tool kit.\nA light rake with a long handle and a broad head of sprung tines, primarily designed for raking grass cuttings, dead leaves and hedge clippings. Additional uses include clearing weeds from garden ponds and scratching out moss from lawns.\nA soil rake is a multi-purpose tool and is usually used to break up soil into a fine tilth so as to be suitable for sowing seeds and to create seed drills (shallow trenches for seed sowing. Additional uses include earthing up potatoes and clearing general garden debris.\nA transplanting trowel is narrower than a standard hand trowel and is generally used for transplanting bulbs and seedlings. Some transplanting trowels are marked with a depth gauge on the head to enable for accurate planting.\nA small fork, usually with three tines which is used to cultivate soil and dig out weeds in confined spaces such as borders and containers. A weedfork is an essential part of a gardener's tool kit."", '- Fertilizer or soil amendment?\n- What’s in a fertilizer?\n- Analysis or grade\n- Nitrogen applications\n- Phosphate and potash applications\n- Specialty fertilizers\nFertility is only part of the soil management process. Colorado soils are naturally low in organic matter. To maximize productivity, our soils also need routine applications of organic matter to improve soil tilth. For flower and vegetable gardens, it is desirable to raise the soil organic content, over time, to 4 to 5%.\nManufactured fertilizers are popular with gardeners because they are readily available, inexpensive, easy to apply, and generally provide a quick release of nutrients for plant growth. Application rates depend on the nutrient need of the soil and the percent of nutrients in the specific fertilizer. In products containing multiple nutrients, the application rate is always based on the nitrogen content.\nBy legal definition, the term fertilizer refers to a soil amendment that guarantees the minimum percentages of nutrients (at least the minimum percentage of nitrogen, phosphate, and potash).\nAn organic fertilizer refers to a soil amendment derived from natural sources that guarantees the minimum percentages of nitrogen, phosphate, and potash. These should not be confused with products approved for use by the USDA National Organic Program. The federal Certified Organic Label, USDA Organic, allows only certain regulated products as listed by the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI). For additional information on certified organic soil amendments and fertilizers, refer to the web site at www.omri.org.\nThe term soil amendment refers to any material mixed into a soil. Mulch refers to a material placed on the soil surface. By legal definition, soil amendments make no legal claims about nutrient content or other helpful (or harmful) effects they will have on the soil and plant growth. In Colorado, the term compost is also unregulated, and could refer to any soil amendment regardless of active microorganism activity.\nMany gardeners apply organic soil amendments, such as compost or manure, which most often do not meet the legal requirements as a “fertilizer” but add small amounts of nutrients.\nBy law, all products sold as fertilizer require uniform labeling guaranteeing the minimum percentage of nutrients. The three-number combination (fertilizer grade or analysis) on the product identifies percentages of nitrogen (N), phosphate (P2O5), and potash (K2O), respectively. For example, a 20-10-5 fertilizer contains 20% nitrogen, 10% phosphate, and 5% potash.\nNote: Phosphorus, P, is a primary nutrient in plant growth. The word phosphate, P2O5, refers to the ionic compound containing two atoms of phosphorus with five atoms of oxygen. The phosphorus content of fertilizers is measured in percent phosphate.\nNote: Potassium, K, is a primary nutrient in plant growth. The word potash, K2O, refers to the ionic compound containing two atoms of potassium with one atom of oxygen. The potassium content of fertilizers is measured in percent potash.\nThe product may also identify other nutrients, such as sulfur, iron, and zinc, if the manufacturer wants to guarantee the amount. This may be done by placing a fourth number on the product label and identifying what nutrient was added in the ingredients.\nFertilizer ratio indicates a comparative proportion of nitrogen to phosphate to potash. For example, a 15-10-5 fertilizer has a ratio of 3-2-1, and an 8-12-4 fertilizer has a ratio of 2-3-1. Fertilizer recommendations from a soil test are given in ratios.\nWhen shopping for a fertilizer, select a product with a ratio somewhat similar to that desired. For example, if a soil test recommended a 2-1-0 ratio, the ideal fertilizer would be something like 8-4-0, 10-5-0 or 20-10-0. However, if you cannot find that exact fertilizer, an 8-4-2 would be similar. If a garden soil test calls for a 1-0-0 ratio, a 21-0-0 or 24-2-2 fertilizer would be similar.\nThe formulation tells what specific kinds of fertilizer are in the product. Table 1 gives examples of manufactured fertilizers that could be mixed to derive any specific analysis, ratio, or brand name.\nExamples of Manufactured Fertilizers\nProduct Nitrogen % Phosphate % Potash % Ammonium nitrate 34 0 0 Ammonium sulfate 21 0 0 Urea 48 0 0 Ammoniated super-phosphate 3-6 48-53 0 Di-ammonium phosphate 11 48 0 Mono-ammonium phosphate 11 48 0 Super-phosphate 0 18-50 0 Triple super phosphate 0 46 0 Potassium chloride 0 0 60 Potassium nitrate 13 0 44 Potassium sulfate 0 0 50 Potassium-magnesium sulfate 0 0 22\nWhat else is in the fertilizer? In a manufactured fertilizer, the grade does not add up to 100% because the fertilizer also contains other elements like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, iron, zinc, etc. For example, ammonium nitrate (NH4+ NO3-) has a grade of 34-0-0 with 34% of the content from nitrogen and 66% from hydrogen and oxygen. Ammonium sulfate (NH4+ SO2- has a grade of 21-0-0 with 21% from the nitrogen and 79% from the hydrogen, sulfur and oxygen.\nTime release or slow release fertilizers contain coating materials or are otherwise formulated to release the nutrients over a period of time as water, heat, and/or microorganisms break down the material. [Table 2]\nExamples of Quickly and Slowly Available Nitrogen\nQuickly available nitrogen\nLasts 4-6 weeks\nSlowly available nitrogen\nAvailable over weeks to months\nRegulated by solubility or microorganism activity\nIsobutylidene diurea (IBDU)\nIn an “organic” type fertilizer, the base is decomposed or processed plant and/or animal by-products. For example, fish emulsion is ground and processed non-edible fish or fish scraps. Its nutrient content would be around 8-4-2, with 8% from nitrogen, 4% from phosphate, and 2% from potash.\nSome manufactured and “organic” fertilizers contain fillers, which are used to prevent caking, control dust, derive the desired grade, or to facilitate ease of application.\nComplete fertilizer is a term used to identify fertilizers that contains nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. In the national home garden trade, most fertilizers are complete. However, in Colorado the majority of gardens do not need phosphorus or potassium. It is advisable to avoid heavy applications of phosphate and potash when unneeded as they contribute to soil salts.\nNitrogen is the nutrient needed in largest quantities as a fertilizer. Nitrogen is annually applied by manufactured fertilizer, organic fertilizers, and/or organic soil amendments. Application rates are critical, as too much or too little directly affect crop growth.\nApplication rate is based on the soil organic content. As the organic content increases, nitrogen will be slowly mineralized (released) by the activity of soil microorganisms. Standard application rates for gardens are given in Table 3.\nNitrogen fertilizer can be broadcast and watered in, or broadcast and tilled into the top few inches of soil. It can be banded 3-4 inches to the side of the seed row. Do not place the fertilizer in the seed row or root injury may occur.\nFor additional information on fertilizers refer to the CMG GardenNotes #234, Organic Fertilizers, and #711, Vegetable Garden: Soil Management and Fertilization.\nStandard Nitrogen Fertilizer Application Rate for Gardens\nSoil Organic Content\nTypical garden soil low in organic matter\n(0-1% organic matter)\nModerate level of organic matter\n(2-3% organic matter)\nHigh levels of organic matter\n(4-5% organic matter)\n0.2 pounds actual N per 100 sq. ft.\n0.1 pounds actual N per 100 sq. ft.\nAmmonium sulfate 21-0-0\n1 pound fertilizer\nper 100 square feet\n(approximately 2 cups)\n0.5 pound fertilizer\nper 100 square feet\nAmmonium nitrate, 34-0-0\n0.6 pounds. fertilizer\nper 100 square feet\n(approximately1 1/3 cup)\n0.3 pounds. fertilizer\nper 100 square feet\n0.4 pounds. fertilizer\nper 100 square feet\n0.2 pounds fertilizer\nper 100 square feet.\nA soil test is the best method to determine the need for phosphate and potash. When a fertilizer contains a combination of nitrogen with phosphate and/or potash, the application rate is always based on the nitrogen percentage, because nitrogen levels are most critical to plant growth. Phosphate and potash fertilizers are best applied in the spring or fall when they can be tilled into the soil.\nPhosphate levels are adequate in the majority of Colorado soil. With annual applications of compost or manure, phosphorus levels will likely be adequate. Deficiencies are most likely to occur in new gardens where the organic matter content is low and in soils with a high pH (7.8 to 8.3).\nExcessive phosphorus fertilizer can aggravate iron and zinc deficiencies and increase soil salt content.\nWhere phosphate levels are believed to be low, the standard application rate without a soil test is ¼ to 1 pound triple super phosphate (0-46-0) or ammonium phosphate (18-46-0) per 100 square feet.\nWhen a phosphate fertilizer is applied to a soil, the phosphorus is quickly immobilized in the soil profile. It typically moves only about an inch. Therefore, it needs be tilled into the rooting zone to be most effective.\nPhosphorus and Water Quality\nIn surface water, low phosphorus levels limit the growth of algae and water weeds. However, when the phosphorus content of surface water increases, algae and water weeds often grow unchecked, a process called eutrophication. This significant decrease in water quality is a major problem related to manure management in production agriculture and the handling of yard wastes from the landscape environment.\nPopular press articles often incorrectly point to phosphorus-containing lawn and garden fertilizers as the major source of phosphate water pollution. Actually, phosphate fertilizers are rather immobile when applied at correct rates to lawn and garden soils. Phosphate is so immobile in the typical soil that it generally moves less than one inch after application and thus needs to be tilled into the rooting zone to be effective.\nHowever, high rates of manure applied year after year will build soil phosphorus content where leaching becomes a water quality problem. On sandy soils coupled with high rainfall/irrigation, excessive application rates of organic or manufactured fertilizers may also lead to water quality concerns.\nAccording to research at the University of Minnesota, the primary source of water polluting phosphorus in the landscape environment is the mowing, sweeping or blowing of lawn clipping and leaves onto the gutter and street. When mowing, mow in a direction to blow the clippings onto the lawn rather than onto the sidewalk or street. Also sweep any grass on the sidewalk/driveway onto the grass. When dealing with autumn leaves, avoid blowing them into the street! [Figure 1]\nFigure 1. Grass clippings and leaves mowed or blown into the street are the major source of phosphate pollution from the landscape environment. Mow in a direction to discharge clippings back onto the lawn and not into the street.\nPhosphate in fertilizer is immobilized upon contact with soil and is not a source of phosphate pollution when applied to a lawn (or garden) soil. However, fertilizer over-spread onto the sidewalk, driveway, and street moves with surface runoff into local lakes, streams and ponds. Exercise caution when fertilizing to keep the phosphate out of the street.\nIt is also important to leave an unmowed buffer strip edging all lakes, streams, ponds and wetlands rather than mowing plant residues into the water.\nFigure 2. Do not mow grass clipping into lakes, streams or ponds. Rather leave a unmowed buffer strip around the edge.\nSecond to yard waste management, over-spreading fertilizers onto hard surface (sidewalks, driveways and streets) adds to surface water pollution. When applying fertilizer, avoid spreading the fertilizer onto hard surfaces where it will wash into local surface water through the storm sewer system. Sweep any fertilizer that landed on the sidewalk/driveway onto the lawn area.\nAnother very important source of phosphorus pollution in the landscape setting is erosion of soil from new construction sites, unplanted slopes and poorly maintained landscapes. When the soil moves, it takes the soil bound phosphorus with it. For water quality, sloping ground needs to be planted with year-round plant cover to prevent soil erosion.\nFigure 3. Soil erosion for construction sites is another major source of phosphorus pollution from the landscape environment.\nPotassium levels are naturally adequate to high in most Colorado soils. With annual applications of compost or manure, potassium levels will likely be adequate. Deficiencies occasionally occur in new gardens low in organic matter and in sandy soils low in organic matter. A soil test is the best method to determine the need for potassium.\nExcessive potash fertilizer can increase soil salt content.\nWhere potash levels are believed to be low, the standard application rate without a soil test is ¼ to ½ pound potassium chloride (0-0-60) or potassium sulfate (0-0-50) per 100 square feet.\nMovement of potassium in soils is dependent on soil texture. As the clay content increases, movement decreases. For most soils, it is important that applied potash be tilled into the root zone. In sandy soils, potassium could leach down past the root zone.\nFor specific uses, specialty fertilizers may be preferred. For example, on lawns slow release fertilizers are recommended, (see lawn care information for details). Slow release or time release fertilizers give out small quantities of nutrients over a time period. The release may be controlled by water, temperature, or microbial activity. On trees and shrubs, use only slow release products.\nIn planters and hanging baskets, two popular specialty fertilizers include time release fertilizer (e.g., Osmocote) and water solubles (e.g., MiracleGro and Peters).\nTime release fertilizers (e.g. Osmocote) are designed for indoor and outdoor potted plants. Each time the soil is watered, a small amount of nutrients are released. Depending on the specific formulation, it would be applied to the soil once every 3 to 9 months. In outdoor pots watered daily, it releases faster, having about half the life span of the product used on indoor plants. Gardeners sometimes see the Osmocote pellets in potted plants and mistake it for insect eggs.\nNumerous brands of water solubles are popular in the home garden trade, (e.g., MiracleGro, Peters, Schultz Plant Food, Fertilome Root Stimulator, etc.). Water soluble fertilizers are mixed with the irrigation water, typically giving a blue or green color. This can be done in a bucket or hose-on fertilizer applicator. It is important to water the soil with the fertilizer water, not just wet the leaves.\nNote: Hose-on fertilizer applicators and hose-on pesticide sprayers are not the same thing. Fertilizer applicators apply a heavier volume because the purpose is to water the soil. Pesticide applicators release a lower volume, because wetting the leaf is the objective.) Water solubles are the standard in greenhouse production where the fertilizer is injected into the irrigation water.\nFor herbaceous transplants (flowers and vegetables), water soluble fertilizers are recommended at planting and possibly two and four weeks after planting (depending on soil organic matter content). These are often marketed as root stimulators. It is the nitrogen content that promotes growth rather than any hormones or vitamins in the product. On cool springtime soils, the readily available phosphate may also be helpful. Woody plants (trees and shrubs) do not respond to water soluble fertilizer at planting.\nCMG GardensNotes on fertilizers\nCMG GardenNotes on soil amendments\n- Cover Crops and Green Manure Crops, #244\n- Making Compost, #246\n- Soil Amendments, #241\n- Using Compost in the Home Garden, #243\n- Using Manure in the Home Garden, #242\nCMG GardenNotes on soil management\n- Asking Effective Questions about Soils, #251\n- Earthworms, #218\n- Estimating Soil Texture, #214\n- Introduction to Soils, #211\n- Iron Chlorosis, #223\n- Managing Soil Tilth, #213\n- Mulches for the Vegetable Garden, #715\n- Mulching with Wood/Bark Chips, Grass Clippings and Rock, #245\n- Soil Compaction, #215\n- Soil Drainage, #219\n- Soil pH, #222\n- Soil Tests, #221\n- The Living Soil, #212\n- References and Review Questions: Soils, Fertilizers and Soil Amendments, #210\n- Homework: Soil, Fertilizers, and Soil Amendments, #253\n- Worksheet: Soil Texture and Structure Lab, #252\n- CMG GardenNotes are available online at www.cmg.colostate.edu\n- Colorado Master Gardener/Colorado Gardener Certificate Training is made possible by a grant from the Colorado Garden Show, Inc.\n- Colorado State University, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and Colorado counties cooperating\n- Extension programs are available to all without discrimination.\n- No endorsements of products mentioned is intended nor is criticism implied of products not mentioned.\n- Copyright. 2011-2014.

74	What's the best way to communicate my dietary needs to restaurant staff?	You should talk to your server about your needs and mention Celiac disease. While some servers may be unfamiliar with Celiac disease and gluten-free eating (in which case you should ask to speak with a manager), others will be knowledgeable and can provide information about restaurant policies and recommend suitable entrees. It's always better to be cautious - if you have any doubts about a meal, it's wiser to choose something else.	['If you suffer from Celiac disease or if you just want to become healthier, you may be living on a gluten-free diet. Living this way requires a complete change of diet, which involves eliminating any foods that contain gluten. When you eat at home you can select the foods you want to use to make meals, but eating at a restaurant provides entirely new challenges. Here are some tips you can use to help you develop the ability to eat out while sticking with your gluten-free way of living.\nComplete Research Before Visiting a Restaurant\nIf you want to reduce the amount of time it will take for you to select and order a meal at a restaurant, there are several ways you can research restaurants to find out if there will be options for you to order from the menu. Here are a few of the ways you can do this:\n- Find out if the restaurant is registered with the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness – restaurants can receive training from this organization to learn how to offer safe and delicious gluten-free meals.\n- Find out if the restaurant has the Celiac Support Organization seal – this is another type of training restaurant owners can receive to help them offer gluten-free meal options.\n- Look up the menu – many restaurants post their menus online, and this is a great way for you to research an establishment before you go.\nYou may want to visit a restaurant’s website first to see if you can find the information you are looking for. If this does not offer the necessary information, you may want to call the restaurant and ask to talk to a manager or a chef.\nAsk for a Gluten-Free Menu or Nutritional List of the Meals\nIf you cannot get the answers you need, you can still go to the restaurant that you have selected. When you arrive, you should ask the server if they offer a gluten-free menu.\nMany restaurants today are beginning to offer menus that are entirely devoted to people living the gluten-free lifestyle, and you may be surprised to find out that they have a menu that contains a lot of different options.\nIf they do not have a gluten-free menu, you could always ask if they have a list of nutritional facts for the meals offered on the menu. A list like this will tell you what ingredients are used in each of the meals, and this will help you make the right choice. In order to do this, you must thoroughly understand what ingredients you cannot consume.\nTry starting your search by looking for wheat, rye, and barley on the ingredient list. If you see any of these things, you should not order that meal. You can find more information about ingredients to avoid by visiting the website of the Celiac Disease Foundation.\nTalk to Your Server\nFinally, to stay safe, you should talk to your server about your needs. If you mention Celiacs to your server, there are two likely outcomes:\n- The server will be unfamiliar with this – some servers and restaurants still do not know about Celiac disease and gluten-free eating. If your server appears to not understand what you are talking about, ask to talk to a manager to ensure your safety.\n- The server will offer suggestions and information – if this is something the server knows about, he or she is likely to give you a lot of information about the restaurant’s policies about this. The server may also be able to recommend various entrees for you to choose from, and this may help you feel more confident with your decision.\nIt is always better to be safe than sorry. If you do not feel comfortable ordering something, or if you even have a small amount of doubt, it might be wiser to choose a different meal to order.\nLiving without consuming gluten can be difficult, especially when dining out, but it is not impossible. If you look for restaurants that understand the gluten-free living, you will have an easier time ordering something that will not cause medical problems or discomfort to you.']	['<urn:uuid:cbd6a434-8054-4b64-b2f7-bf22c374ff76>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	12	72	699
75	my ac unit broke does inside fan running but outside fan not run what fix and what certification needed for repair	If the blower is running but the fan on the outside unit is not, you should check for wire connection damage and repair if necessary. You should also check wire connections in the compressor terminal box. For repairs involving refrigerant, EPA certification is legally required. The EPA 608 Type II certification specifically covers residential air conditioners and high-pressure refrigerant systems. This certification requires passing an exam with at least 72% score in both core questions and Type II specific questions.	"[""Air Conditioning Repair Troubleshooting\nIs there air coming out of the floor or ceiling registers?\nIf there is not, then, check to see if the fan on the outside unit is running. If the fan on the outside unit is not running either, check to make sure that the breakers for the furnace/air handler and the air conditioner are on.\nIf the breaker is not tripped, then the problem may be your thermostat, the furnace/air handler control board, or the wires between the furnace/air handler and the thermostat.\nIf your unit has a condensate pump, check to make sure the reservoir is not full. If the reservoir is full, a limit switch will normally stop the air conditioner from running. You will need to repair or replace the pump.\nIf the breaker is tripped, you can reset it by shutting it off and then turning it back on. If it trips again, then check the wiring in the furnace/air handler for signs of damage and repair as necessary.\nIf the blower is running but the fan on the outside unit is not, then continue your air conditioner troubleshooting at the outside unit.\nIs the fan on the outside unit blowing out hot air?\nIf the blower isn't running but the fan outside is, the problem could be the blower motor, it's run capacitor, or the furnace/air handler control board.\nIf the fan motor is not running, then shut the power off to the unit. Then check all wire connections for signs of damage such as burning and repair as necessary. You should also check the wire connections in the compressor terminal box and repair if necessary.\nYou can use our capacitor testing guide to check the unit's capacitors and replace as necessary.\nContinue your air conditioner troubleshooting by turning the power back on to the unit and observe whether the contactor closes or not. If the unit does not start, look for a reset button. Some units have a high pressure cutout switch that can be reset. Then, use a voltmeter to check to see if you have power to the unit and 24 vac to the contactor's coil. If you do not have power to the unit, you should check the wiring between the electric panel and the unit. If you do not have 24 volts to the contactor's coil, check the thermostat and the low voltage wires from the furnace/air handler to the condensing unit. If you have power to the unit and the coil on the contactor but the unit does not start, the unit's contactor may be bad.\nIf the compressor starts but the fan does not, the condenser fan motor could be the problem.\nIf the condenser fan starts but the compressor does not, the unit may be low on refrigerant, the compressor might be too hot, or the compressor might be bad.\nDo you see ice on the lines connecting the indoor and outdoor units or is there water around the furnace?\nIf the blower on the furnace is running, check to see if you see any frost or ice around the units. You might also notice water around the furnace. Is there ice on the copper lines going outside? If yes, then shut the outside unit off for a couple of hours but let the blower on the furnace run. This will allow the ice to melt.\nAfter two hours, you can continue your air conditioner troubleshooting. Turn the ac back on and let it run for about five minutes. Now feel the larger copper line at the outdoor unit. This should be cold and have condensation on it. If it is not cold or if frost is forming on the line, it is probably a freon problem. You will need to call a repairman because of federal refrigerant usage regulations.\nIf there is no ice or frost, then continue troubleshooting at the outside unit.\nAir Conditioner Troubleshooting, Insufficient Cooling?\nIf the condenser fan and the compressor both run but the cooling effect is not adequate, you should check the temperature drop of the system. **NOTE** The unit should be operating for 10-15 minutes prior to taking temperature measurements. To measure the temperature drop, measure the air temperature leaving the air handler and subtract it from the temperature of the air entering the air handler. The result should be about 15 degrees for a high efficiency unit and about 18 to 20 degrees for an older unit (SEER less than 10). If the temperature drop is significantly lower than that, the problem may be the refrigerant charge.\nIf the temperature drop is significantly higher than that, then your air conditioner troubleshooting should focus on the system's air flow. The evaporator coil, filter, or blower wheel could be dirty. This is usually the result of not performing routine maintenance on the system. It could also be caused by a duct system that is too small. This is usually the result of improper design or installation. You may be able to increase the blower's cooling speed or replace your existing blower motor with a variable speed motor to overcome that problem."", 'How to Get HVAC Certification\nAre you trying to decide whether you should pursue a career in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)? If you have good customer service skills, understand math and science, and work well with wires, pipes, power tools, and building plans, this may be a great field for you. So, what training or certification is required?\nHow Do You Become a Certified HVAC Technician?\nBefore you even start the HVAC certification process, check what your state requirements are and if there are any perquisites needed for the HVAC certification you want. Generally, you need to at least have your high school diploma or GED. Also, if you have the opportunity to take math, science, shop, and computer classes at your high school, these courses can better prepare you for HVAC training.\nApprenticeship vs. Going to School\nIf at all possible, find an apprenticeship program that allows you to be trained while on the job. That means you will gain field experience while also earning money. While these programs usually last three to five years, if you learn best by doing the experience is invaluable.\nHowever, as the demand for HVAC technicians rises, many jobs are requiring certification from a technical or trade school. So, be sure to check with employers in your area to see which training program is the best choice for you. Some school training programs can be as short as a few months, which may fit your needs better. But remember to calculate the cost of going to school and potentially not being able to work much during that time.\nTypes of Certification\nWhile a few states do not require you to have a license to work as an HVAC technician, if you are going to be handling refrigerant, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires you to be certified. To successfully begin your career as an HVAC technician, it is important to understand what types of certification are available and how to become certified. Even if a certification is not required, it may help you get better paying jobs.\nThere are various types of HVAC certifications to pursue, but the following three are among the most helpful:\n- EPA 608 Certification—If you will be handling refrigerant, the EPA requires you to be EPA 608 certified. This certification includes four types. Depending on what HVAC work you plan to do, you may only need to obtain one type of EPA certification.\n- Type I (Small Appliances)—This type of certification covers the installation and repair of small appliances like window air conditioners, home refrigerators, and vending machines.\n- Type II (High Pressure)—This type of certification covers the installation, repair, and disposal of appliances and equipment that contain high-pressure refrigerant (heat pumps, process and commercial refrigeration, and residential air conditioners).\n- Type III (Low Pressure)—This type of certification covers the installation, repair, and disposal of appliances and equipment that contain low-pressure refrigerant, which is typically common in more complex industrial equipment.\n- Universal—Achieving this top-level EPA 608 Certification proves that you are capable of installing, repairing, and disposing of all types of equipment and appliances, for all refrigerant types.\n- North American Technician Excellence (NATE) Certification—This nationally recognized certificate is the gold standard for technicians. To obtain it, you must pass a knowledge-based test that has been developed by industry experts. The exam helps prove you are adept at handling difficult scenarios. Typically, NATE certified technicians earn more and remain in the industry longer.\n- HVAC Excellence Certification—Technicians certified in HVAC Excellence can attain various levels, the two most prestigious being Professional and Master Specialist. This certification tests for experience over mere book smarts.\n- Professional Level—To achieve this level, you must have a minimum of two years’ field experience and a high score on the comprehensive exam.\n- Master Specialist Level—To reach this level, you must have a minimum of three years’ field experience and already be certified at the Professional Level.\nFrequently Asked Questions\n- How long does it take to get HVAC certification? It varies depending on the type of certification, but some can be completed in as little as six months. As previously stated, however, achieving higher levels within a certification sometimes requires several years of field experience (HVAC Excellence Certification). And, if you choose the apprenticeship route, it can take up to five years (but you are working and getting paid in the meantime).\n- What does the EPA 608 Universal Certification exam include and how much does it cost? The universal test is made up of 100 multiple choice questions split into four sections—25 core questions, 25 Type I questions, 25 Type II questions, and 25 Type III questions. To pass the exam, you must achieve a score of 72 percent on each section, which means you have to answer 18 out of each set of 25 questions correctly. If you at least pass the core section plus one of the other sections, you can achieve a certificate for the section type you passed. (For example, if you passed the core section and the Type III section, then you will achieve a Type III Certification.) If you just want to test for Type I, there are online tests for under $25. Exams for Types II, III, and Universal must be taken in a proctored classroom setting, and prices vary according to location.\n- How much does an HVAC Excellence Certification exam cost, and how often do you have to recertify? HVAC Excellence offers a total of 11 different exams, each of which costs $25. Once certified, technicians only need to recertify after five years. The electrical exam is the prerequisite to taking any of the other 10 exams, which include air conditioning, commercial air conditioning, commercial refrigeration, heat pumps, gas heat, electric heat, geothermal heat, oil heat, and hydronics.\n- How much does a NATE Certification exam cost, and how often do you have to recertify? NATE certifies both installation and service technicians. The core exam for either costs $65. After passing the preliminary exam, you can test in five different specialties (air conditioning, air distribution, air-to-air heating, air-to-air heat pump, and air-to-air oil heating) for an additional $85 each. To be certified in a specialty, you must pass the 50-question core test and the 100-question specialty exam with a 70 percent score. NATE certified technicians do not have to recertify for five years.\n- Do you have to get a state license? It varies state to state. Regardless, a state license can provide peace of mind to any employer or client you have, proving that you have been professionally trained and declared qualified according to state requirements. If you move states, remember to check what the licensing requirements are for your new home state. If you live near a state line, it could be beneficial for you be licensed in the nearby state, as well.\n- What is the typical salary of an HVAC technician? The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that most HVAC technicians make between $42,000 and $67,000 each year. Certifications can help you get higher paying jobs and be promoted to supervisory positions.\n- Is the HVAC industry a smart career field to choose? The growth rate for the HVAC industry, according to the BLS, is expected to reach 34 percent by 2020. This average is a much higher growth rate than a lot of other occupations, so it is definitely worth considering. Plus, with the fairly low cost of training/certification and the high salary range, choosing to be an HVAC technician could set you up to enjoy a long, successful career.']"	['<urn:uuid:5f3a7b41-8c80-4f87-b892-1b84e7bb6fa0>', '<urn:uuid:b8c58cd8-fa6d-4260-a7f7-fd95329056e1>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	21	80	2123
76	gracenet project nitrogen emissions mitigation results findings	The GRACEnet project, initiated by USDA-ARS in 2002, has significantly contributed to greenhouse gas mitigation science with over 250 research articles published by 70 scientists. The project found that current methods for estimating nitrous oxide emissions from nitrogen fertilizer usage may underestimate actual emissions by up to five-fold. Research has shown the need for better models to quantify greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in tropical and subtropical wheat- and maize-based cropping systems. The project aims to reduce nitrous oxide emissions by 20% from cereal-based systems in India and Mexico through improved estimation methods and efficient nitrogen management practices.	"['SOIL AND GAS FLUX RESPONSE TO IMPROVED MANAGEMENT IN COLD, SEMIARID AGROECOSYSTEMS\nLocation: Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory\nTitle: Managing agricultural greenhouse gases: Coordinated agricultural research through GRACEnet to address our changing climate\nSubmitted to: Book Chapter\nPublication Type: Book / Chapter\nPublication Acceptance Date: April 25, 2012\nPublication Date: June 8, 2012\nCitation: Liebig, M.A., A.J. Franzluebbers, and R.F. Follett (Editors). 2012. Managing agricultural greenhouse gases: Coordinated agricultural research through GRACEnet to address our changing climate. San Diego, CA:Academic Press. 547 pp.\nInterpretive Summary: In 2002 the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) developed a coordinated national research project called GRACEnet (Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network) to provide information on soil carbon (C) dynamics and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agricultural systems in different agroecological regions throughout the US, and evaluate how conservation management practices in these regions could reduce net GHG emissions. ‘Managing Agricultural Greenhouse Gases: Coordinated Agricultural Research through GRACEnet to Address our Changing Climate’ synthesizes recent research findings generated from more than 30 ARS locations participating in the GRACEnet project. The book, consisting of seven sections and 29 chapters, addresses major themes associated with current soil C sequestration and GHG mitigation research from across the US. Although GRACEnet is an ARS project, the reported findings have broad natural resource implications on a national level, as well as important international applications given the similarity of environmental conditions to other parts of the world.\nGlobal climate change presents numerous challenges to agriculture. Concurrent efforts to mitigate agricultural contributions to climate change while adapting to its projected consequences will be essential to ensure long-term sustainability and food security. To facilitate successful responses to climate change, relevant and timely research will be critical to ensure appropriate application of novel management practices and technologies on agricultural lands throughout the U.S. Such research should provide a mechanistic understanding of underlying processes affecting natural resources, be scalable to provide useful predictions for select management scenarios, and be translated in such a way that it effectively supports informed decision making. It is under this broad rubric of research goals that the USDA-ARS GRACEnet (Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement Network) project is based. Since 2002, 70 ARS scientists involved in GRACEnet have published over 250 research articles, and in doing so, have significantly expanded greenhouse gas mitigation science. Incumbent to disseminating GRACEnet information is the need to provide integrative syntheses to foster the communication of research accomplishments in a broad context. ‘Managing Agricultural Greenhouse Gases: Coordinated Agricultural Research through GRACEnet to Address our Changing Climate’ addresses this need. The book consists of 29 chapters that provide regional syntheses of soil organic carbon and greenhouse gas dynamics across a broad portfolio of agricultural land uses, as well as summaries addressing key activities central to GRACEnet (e.g., modeling, method development, economic outcomes, adaptation research, and international collaboration). The book is envisioned to support ARS’s goal of providing knowledge and information to better implement scientifically-based agricultural management practices from field to national policy scales.', 'Improving estimation of nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture\nMitigating climate change requires accurate and spatially explicit estimates of greenhouse gas emissions that take into account variable soil, climate and management conditions. Research has revealed that the current methods used to estimate nitrous oxide emissions from nitrogen fertilizer usage may underestimate actual emissions by up to five-fold and fail to identify hotspots. In addition, no scalable model exists that can estimate nitrous oxide emissions, and the data needed to develop suitable models for GHG emissions in tropical and subtropical wheat- and maize-based cropping systems are lacking. Thus, mitigation policies and priorities are based on poor data and estimates of the impacts of nitrogen fertilizer on nitrous oxide emissions.\nWith the increase in national reporting associated with the Paris Agreement, demand for better emissions data and evidence-based mitigation options is increasing. This project met these demands by investigating the following questions:\n- How can models better quantify smallholder greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mitigation options associated with nitrogen, especially agricultural fertilizers?\n- How do data requirements, scale, and end-user objectives influence model selection to provide appropriate policy analysis and decision support tools for assessing mitigation priorities?\n- What are the critical trade-offs and synergies between GHG mitigation practices and other smallholder objectives, including reduced poverty, nutrition, and gender equity?\nAt the local level, the project worked with extension actors to focus on demonstrating the economic benefits resulting from more efficient nitrogen use. And at national and regional levels, the project analyzed nitrogen fertilizer subsidies and related policies.\nThe project met demands for information from stakeholders and decision-makers at all levels, including the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture (GACSA), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), public and private sector institutions involved with the provision and distribution of nitrogen fertilizers and subsidies, and both governmental and non-governmental agricultural extension.\nOutputs from this research are used to refine climate-smart practices that aim to increase productivity for smallholders (women and men), while minimizing negative environmental outcomes, including emissions. Decision-makers will use improved data and methods to support policies that reduce greenhouse emissions and influence policies on nitrogen fertilizer subsidies at international and national levels. Project partners, including local governments, non-governmental organizations, the private sector and other bilateral projects, are then empowered to scale up evidence-based mitigation practices that also contribute to food security, with a particular focus on efficient nitrogen management and soil management recommendations.\nThe project also aimed to contribute massively to mitigation plans globally by informing the IPCC with more accurate recommendations for nitrogen management in wheat- and maize-based systems and adjusting targets for nitrogen management.\nImproving the estimation of nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture aims to reduce nitrous oxide emissions by 20% from cereal-based systems in India and Mexico.\nResearch activities and results from this project are informing the ""Cost-effective cropland mitigation"" project beginning in 2019.\n- Albanito, F., Lebender, U., Cornulier, T., Sapkota, T., Brentrup, F., Stirling, C., and Hillier, J.

77	innovative methods repair aging underground pipes without digging	The repair is being accomplished using trenchless technology, which avoids excavation. The process involves installing a cured-in-place liner in the old pipe (CIPP method). After bypassing the sanitary sewer flow, steam is injected through the pipe to cure and harden the resin, forming a new structural pipe within the existing pipe. This method extends the infrastructure's life without putting a shovel in the ground.	['Project underway to repair and rehabilitate New England city’s aging wastewater infrastructure; some pipeline as old as 100 years\nCity of New Britain contracts with Green Mountain Pipeline Services to employ trenchless technology designed to extend the life of the sanitary sewer system and thereby protect public health\n[October 2018 – New Britain, Connecticut]: Here’s a question most of us rarely think about: Where does the water go when you flush?\nWe’re fortunate in this country to have modern conveniences and systems that allow us to live without having to worry about the answer to that question. Unless something goes wrong, that is.\nLike in many municipalities across the Northeast and around the country, it’s what happens between the moment you flush and the time that the wastewater makes it all the way to the wastewater treatment plant that’s causing concern in the City of New Britain, Connecticut.\nThat’s because the sanitary sewer collection system – that is, the underground sewer pipeline, manholes, and other wastewater infrastructure – is more than 100 years old in some places, having been built in the early 1900s, 20s, and 30s. The useful life of a pipeline is typically only about half that.\n“In New Britain, the sanitary sewer collection system consists of more than 209 miles of sewer pipeline, some as deep as 20 or 30 feet. That’s over 1 million feet of pipe ranging from 8-inch pipes to 48-inch brick sewers, built by hand,” said Ray Esponda, PE, ME, deputy director of public works, utility division.\n“The system also consists of manholes and laterals – the pipes that connect to dwellings, offices, and other buildings,” he explained.\nAging pipelines can have cracks, open or leaking joints, and other defects that impact the wastewater making it to The Mattabassett District’s Water Pollution Control Facility in Cromwell, where strict guidelines set by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection must be met for treating the water – an average of 12 to 21 million gallons per day.\nTreated water is then discharged into the Connecticut River and eventually ends up in Long Island Sound.\n“We have a responsibility to our citizens and our environment. That’s why the City of New Britain is investing in the upgrade of key areas of our infrastructure, which will provide many more years of useful life and make the waters of the Connecticut River and Long Island Sound healthier,” said Esponda.\nThe project is being accomplished without putting a shovel in the ground. The City’s consulting engineering firm, CDM Smith, put together the bid documents and awarded a contract to Green Mountain Pipeline Services.\nFounded in 2003 and based in Bethel, Vermont, GMPS is utilizing no-dig techniques to perform the pipeline and manhole repair and rehabilitation.\n“Green Mountain Pipeline Services specializes in trenchless technology,” said Tim Vivian, the company president. “That is, the majority of pipes is being repaired with a method that avoids the disruption of excavation.”\nVivian said they bypass the sanitary sewer flow and install a cured-in-place liner in the old pipe, a method known in the industry as CIPP (cured-in-place pipeline).“Once it’s in place, we inject steam through the pipe to cure, or harden, the resin. This forms a new structural pipe within the existing pipe.”\n“The sanitary sewer pipelines are the lifeblood of the City’s health system,” said Esponda. “Just like a person’s veins carrying blood throughout the body, the sanitary sewer pipelines are running under the streets in New Britain, 24/7/365.

78	I keep hearing about sustainable farming and food security being connected to climate change. What are experts saying about how these issues are linked?	At the G8 summit on Food Security, it was established that food security, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture must be addressed together with climate change adaptation and mitigation measures. This includes sustainable management of water, land, soil, and other natural resources, as well as protecting biodiversity. Productivity is crucial for sustainability because it enables the agricultural sector to compete internationally, and only a viable and productive sector can support the science needed to use fewer resources and reduce the environmental footprint for each unit of production.	['How science facilitates productivity in the agricultural sector\nWe live in an era of connections. The far reaches are a plane trip away; the virtual world is at our fingertips; and we amplify our own intellectual powers through an increasing connectivity with artificial intelligence.\nThe big issues in the agricultural sector can only be addressed by multi-disciplined research teams working with industry to better understand the critical connections between productivity and sustainability.\nAt the G8 summit on Food Security in July 2009, the statement noted:\nFood security, nutrition and sustainable agriculture must remain a priority issue …. Effective food security actions must be coupled with adaptation and mitigation measures in relation to climate change, sustainable management of water, land, soil and other natural resources, including the protection of biodiversity.\nProductivity is critical to sustainability because it’s improved productivity that underpins the sector’s ability to compete internationally; and it’s only a viable and productive sector that can support the science needed to understand how best to use less resource and leave a smaller footprint for each unit of production.\nScience improves productivity by first addressing the causes of inefficiencies in existing production systems which mean that biological yield potential is rarely reached. Think about the impact that a serious new wheat disease would have on food security if it suddenly emerged in an important food bowl like the Indo-Gangetic plains or in the Australian wheat crop. Wheat feeds two billion people, or a third of the world’s population.\nTake the example of Ug 99, a new strain of stem rust identified in Ethiopia in 2007. It was characterised at the genomic level and its spread tracked across northern Africa and the Gulf states. Using this information, scientists modelled its future spread, and identified sources of resistance from ancestors and wild relatives of wheat. This resistance will now be included in breeding programs using conventional approaches, accelerated through the use of genetic markers. The whole process will take about 10 years and is a great example of science is being deployed now to protect productivity and food security in the future.\nScience also works to facilitate productivity through incremental increases in the biological potential yield. Examples draw on many disciplines but include changing crop architecture to increase the harvest index, the proportion of the biomass which is the valuable harvested product. The “dwarf” cereals of the green revolution are an example of this. It also includes increasing the efficiency of water use. The recent substantial increases in the yields of marketable product per mega litre of water for both rice and cotton, is a great example. In aquaculture, scientists have worked to select more rapidly growing and maturing prawns from naturally occurring populations.\nA third area of research looks at transformative steps to create new products, new industries or new forms of value from agricultural production. This research sees agricultural scientists connecting with other specialist disciplines to address issues such as major global human health problems caused by nutrient deficiencies. Working in partnerships with human nutritionists, this research aims to increase essential nutrient levels in forms able to be absorbed from staple foods.\nTechniques to efficiently extract waste materials from agribusiness processing for conversion to new products for energy and pharmaceutical uses are being developed in partnership with chemical and environmental engineers. Agricultural scientists are working with the spatial sciences to improve the ability to assess soil production potential by looking into the soil profile using satellite remote sensing. This will enable industry to better identify areas of risk and opportunity as climate change progressively shifts productive land suitability.\nAnd finally close to my heart is the research to understand the chemical basis of the sensory appeal of wine and to find out how this appeal can be accurately reproduced through the right selection of genetic, management and processing approaches. This work builds on understanding the design principles of the sensory systems of insects.\nNot quite turning water into wine; but the contribution of science to growing agricultural productivity is a miracle which depends on attracting and resourcing talented scientists to connect with colleagues across disciplines to address some the big issues of our time.\nThis article was written by Professor Beth Woods, Assistant Director-General, Innovation; Queensland Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation.\nProfessor Beth Woods, OAM\nProf Beth Woods worked in North Queensland before completing her D Phil in Agricultural Economics as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. She then worked with DPI as an agricultural extension officer in southeastern Queensland and North Queensland in the dairy, broad acre cropping and potato industries, as Manager Farming Systems, and as Acting General Manager Horticulture. She was the inaugural director of the Rural Extension Centre (UQ) and became the Suncorp Metway Professor of Agribusiness at the University of Queensland Gatton Campus in late 1997.\nBeth Woods’ academic interests include the concept of supply chain management as a tool to improve innovation and competitiveness of agribusiness, and the rapid change occurring in supply chains of developing countries with which Australia has major trade interests. In May 2004 she took up a secondment as Executive Director R&D Strategy in the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries. She has served on committees of the Grains R&D Corporation, the Policy Advisory Council of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), the CSIRO Board, the Gatton College Council, the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council and the Queensland Planning Group for FarmBis. She was Chair of the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and ACIAR, and chaired the National Drought Review in 2004. She has been on the Board of the International Rice Research Institute since 2005 and was elected Chair from January 2008.

80	aerospace engineer wanting to know aircraft speed measurement bernoulli principle application	Bernoulli's equation is used in aircraft speed measurement through a device called a pitot-static tube. This instrument measures both static and total pressure, and then uses Bernoulli's equation to compute the velocity of the aircraft.	"['In the 1700s,\ninvestigated the forces present in a moving\nThis slide shows one of many forms of Bernoulli\'s\nequation. The equation appears in many physics,\nfluid mechanics, and airplane textbooks.\nThe equation states that the\nps in the flow plus the\none half of the density r times the velocity V squared,\nis equal to a constant throughout\nthe flow. We call this constant the total pressure pt of the flow.\nAs discussed on the\npage, there are two ways to look at a fluid; from the large, macro scale\nproperties of the fluid that we can measure, and from the small, micro scale\nof the molecular motion and interaction.\nOn this page, we will consider Bernoulli\'s equation from both standpoints.\nMacro Scale Derivation\nis the branch of science which describes the macro scale properties\nof a fluid. One of the principle results of the study of\nthermodynamics is the\nconservation of energy;\nwithin a system, energy is neither created nor destroyed but may be converted from\none form to another. We shall derive Bernoulli\'s equation by starting with\nthe conservation of energy equation.\nThe most general form for the conservation of energy is given on the\npage. This formula includes the effects of unsteady flows and\ninteractions. Assuming a steady, inviscid flow we have a simplified\nconservation of energy equation in terms of the\nenthalpy of the fluid:\nht2 - ht1 = q - wsh\nwhere ht is the total enthalpy\nof the fluid, q is the\ninto the fluid, and wsh is the\nuseful work done by the fluid.\nAssuming no heat transfer into the fluid, and no work done by the fluid, we\nht2 = ht1\nFrom the definition of total enthalpy:\ne2 + (p * v)2 + (.5 * V^2)2 = e1 + (p * v)1 + (.5 * V^2)1\nwhere e is the\np is the\nv is the\nspecific volume, and\nV is the velocity of the fluid.\nfirst law of thermodynamics\nif there is no work and no heat transfer, the internal energy remains the same:\n(p * v)2 + (.5 * V^2)2 = (p * v)1 + (.5 * V^2)1\nThe specific volume is the inverse of the fluid density r:\n(p / r)2 + (.5 * V^2)2 = (p / r)1 + (.5 * V^2)1\nAssuming that the flow is incompressible, the density is a constant. Multiplying the energy equation by the constant density:\n(ps)2 + (.5 * r * V^2)2 = (ps)1 + (.5 * r * V^2)1 = a constant = pt\nThis is the simplest form of Bernoulli\'s equation and the one most often\nquoted in textbooks.\nIf we make different assumptions in the derivation, we can\nderive other forms of the equation.\nIt is important when applying any equation that you are aware of\nthe restrictions on its use; the restrictions usually arise in the\nderivation of the equation when certain simplifying assumptions about\nthe nature of the problem are made. If you ignore the restrictions,\nyou may often get an incorrect ""answer"" from the equation. For\ninstance, this form of the equation was derived while assuming that\nthe flow was incompressible, which means\nthat the speed of the flow is much less than the speed of sound. If\nyou use this form for a supersonic flow, the answer will be\nMolecular Scale Derivation\nWe can make another interpretation of the equation by\nof the gas molecules. The molecules\nwithin a fluid are in constant random motion and collide with each\nother and with the walls of an object in the fluid. The motion of the\nmolecules gives the molecules a linear momentum\nand the fluid pressure\nis a measure of this momentum. If a gas is at rest, all of the motion\nof the molecules is random and the pressure that we detect is the\ntotal pressure of the gas. If the gas is set in motion or\nflows, some of the random components of velocity are changed in favor\nof the directed motion. We call the directed motion ""ordered,"" as\nopposed to the disordered random motion.\nWe can associate a ""pressure"" with the momentum of the ordered\nmotion of the gas. We call this pressure the\nThe remaining random motion of the molecules still produces a\npressure called the static pressure. At the molecular level,\nthere is no distinction between random and ordered motion. Each\nmolecule has a velocity in some direction until it collides with\nanother molecule and the velocity is changed. But when you sum up all\nthe velocities of all the molecules you will detect the ordered\nmotion. From a conservation of energy and momentum, the static\npressure plus the dynamic pressure is equal to the original total\npressure in a flow (assuming we do not add or subtract energy in the\nflow). The form of the dynamic pressure is the density times the\nsquare of the velocity divided by two.\nApplications of Bernoulli\'s Equation\nThe fluids problem shown on this slide is low speed flow through a\ntube with changing cross-sectional area. For a streamline along the\ncenter of the tube, the velocity decreases from station one to two.\nBernoulli\'s equation describes the relation between velocity,\ndensity, and pressure for this flow problem. Since density is a constant\nfor a low speed problem, the equation at the bottom of the slide\nrelates the pressure and velocity at station two to the conditions\nat station one.\nAlong a low speed\nthe flow is incompressible and the density remains a\nconstant. Bernoulli\'s equation then reduces to a simple relation\nbetween velocity and static pressure. The surface of the airfoil is a\nSince the velocity varies\nalong the streamline, Bernoulli\'s equation can be used to compute the change\nin pressure. The static pressure integrated along the entire surface\nof the airfoil gives the total aerodynamic\nforce on the foil. This force can be broken down into the\nlift and drag of the airfoil.\nBernoulli\'s equation is also used on aircraft to provide a speedometer\ncalled a pitot-static tube. A pressure is quite\neasy to measure with a mechanical device. In a pitot-static tube, we measure\nthe static and total pressure and can then use Bernoulli\'s equation\nto compute the velocity.\nBasic Fluid Dynamics Equations:\n- Beginner\'s Guide Home Page']"	['<urn:uuid:59ef96d6-0338-4cc4-8b7e-536b42225035>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	11	35	1046
81	What navigation challenges and equipment failures occurred at sea?	The Argo encountered multiple equipment failures including a snapped boom cap, broken anchor rope, and spreader damage. Similarly, the Chicago Express case revealed issues with voyage data recorder failures and highlighted the need for better understanding of vessel stability, particularly for container ships in adverse weather conditions.	['Voyage of the Argo Begins:\nWe Sailed from Captain’s Cove Marina in Quincy Massachusetts to Olverson’s Lodge Creek Marina located along the Potomac River in Virginia aboard a 1975 Irwin 30 Competition Sailboat. Over the 680 nautical mile journey we took 27 days and encountered equipment failure and bad weather but the little Argo plugged along making it to her summer home on May 26th 2015.\nOverall the Argo is in fair condition but I plan to bring her back to a fully operational sailboat. She will need a complete electrical overhaul, cleaned, painted, wood restoration and some rigging work done. My initial estimates to get the boat where I would like her will cost about $5,000 more and will take most of the summer to complete.\nThe Dream Becomes Reality:\nOn April 22nd 2015 I bought a 1975 Irwin 30 Competition Sailboat. The boat was located in Quincy Massachusetts and needed to be out of her slip by May 1st. She is 30 feet in length and has a Fin keel and skeg mounted rudder with a 27 foot waterline, 10 foot beam and 5 1/2 foot draft. She has a Universal Atomic 4 gas engine which runs like a top. When I bought her she only had one mainsail and now we have 3 sails. One main, one Genoa, and one Spinnaker sail. The Genoa is not the correct size for this boat so that will need to be replaced. The Spinnaker poll has some minor damage that must be repaired also.\nOn April 26th I flew into Philadelphia to gather the equipment, supplies and crew necessary to make the 680 nautical mile journey. On April 28th I arrived in Quincy Massachusetts at Captain’s Cove Marina to take command of the Argo. With me was my brother Stephen, Quartermaster of the Argo, and my father. After securing gear, equipment and supplies on-board, my father departed for home and we settled in for the night. We took the next day to organize the boat and review charts and plans.\nThe Odyssey Begins:\nApril 30th 2015 at 7:30 AM we sailed out of Captain’s Cove Marina and headed out to the Atlantic to begin the first unofficial voyage of the Argo. Our primary port of call for that night was Sandwich Marina on the east side of the Cape Cod Canal.\nMay 1st we set sail through the Cape Cod Canal at 8:45 AM after refueling and waiting for the Slack Ebb to begin. The wind was in our favor and we deployed the main sail achieving an average of 6 knots and a high of 7 knots. At 2:30 PM the boom cap snapped forcing us to remove the boom and mainsail. We found a marina in the Westport Point inlet and pulled in for repairs. That stop cost us a 4 day delay waiting on the boom repair. We picked up some necessary supplies and equipment at F.L. Trip & Sons Marina, a dinghy, headsail and repaired the engine blower.\nMay 6th we set sail at 7:00 am and headed west to Point Judith where we refueled and spent the night.\nMay 7th we set sail for Shinnycock Marina. We arrived at Shinnycock Marina at 2:30 am and tied up for the remainder of the night.\nMay 8th we refueled and set sail at 8:30 am for Moriches Bay Inlet. The fog was so thick that we navigated by instruments alone. We arrived at the inlet at about 5:00 pm and tried to make it to the Windswept Marina however the Chanel was too shallow for our boat so we anchored for the night. Stephen took the dinghy to the marina for supplies and advice on how to get into the marina. He was not able to make it back to the boat before sundown and spent the night at the marina while I spent the night on the boat. At 5:30 am the anchor rope broke and I was awoke to the boat hitting a rock wall on the port side of the boat. I was able to start the engine and motor off without any problem and no damage was sustained. I spent the rest of the morning until about 10:30 motoring around until Stephen was able to arrange a guide boat to guide us into the marina. We replaced the anchor, chain and anchor rope while docked and refueled the boat.\nMay 10th we set sail at 2:00 pm because we were waiting for high tide. Even with high tide we still hit bottom leaving the bay. We sailed to Fire Island for our next stop arriving at 11:00 pm. We set anchor for the night. We could not get into the refueling dock because of depth so we spent another day at anchor. On May 12th the anchor pulled loose from the bottom and we drifted into the bridge pillion at 2:00am. The current was so strong we could not get off the bridge and required a tow off the pillion. We docked in the park docks and was able to secure fuel for the boat. We stayed another 2 days to rest and repair the boat before setting out again.\nMay 15th We set sail at 5:30 am for Shark River but adjusted our route to Monasquan Inlet. We tied up at marina at 5:00 pm, refueled and tied up for the night.\nMay 16th We set sail at 9:30 am for Barneget Inlet and arrived at 4:00 pm. Refueled and tied up for the night.\nMay 17th We set sail at 6:20 am and sailed for Atlantic City. We arrived at 4:30 pm refueled and tied up for the night.\nMay 18th We set sail at 6:30 am and sailed for Cape May. We arrived at 3:30 pm and switched crew members. Stephen needed to get off to attend sailing school in Florida and I took on Helen of Troy as a replacement crew. We also resupplied ship stores and picked up 2 additional anchors.\nMay 19th We set sail at 8:15 am for Ocean City. We arrived at 10:30 pm and tied up for the night. We took an extra day of rest and refueled the boat.\nMay 21st We set sail at 6:15 am for Norfolk, a 27 hour run. We arrived at 9:15 am May 22nd. We spend the next day at dock because of the weather.\nMay 24th We set sail at 6:15 am for the Rappahannock River. Progress up the Chesapeake Bay was slow at first but picked up as the tide turned and we picked up as the day continued. We arrived 9:30 pm and anchored for the night. On May 25th we refueled the boat and tied up for the night to catch up on sleep.\nMay 26th We set sail at 6:00 am and set sail for Olverson’s Lodge Creek Marina. We arrived at 7:30 pm and docked the boat. We secured the boat and offloaded the personal equipment and headed for home arriving at 2:00 am.\nOverall I did not do well when it came to driving the boat. The Argo drifted into a rock wall at Moriches Bay Inlet due to the anchor rope breaking. I hit another boat on the way out of Moriches Bay. I scraped bottom several times leaving Moriches Bay. I bumped a buoy while navigating into Fire Island Inlet in the fog and after dark. I sustained spreader damage when the anchor gave way and we drifted into the bridge at Fire Island NY. She took quite a beating on the trip south to her summer home.\nImages from Our Voyage:', '- Damage caused during the fall in the dark\nAn AB died and a master remains unable to work a year later because they didn’t have enough to hold onto when their containership, Chicago Express, rolled by up to 44 degree in a typhoon. Germany’s Federal Bureau of Maritime Casualty Investigation, BSU, has also expressed concern that “on the basis of the current state-of-the-art alone, the establishment or energetic promotion of a clear, internationally binding framework is needed, which facilitates greater recognition and practical utilisation of available scientific findings in relation to the vulnerability of vessels at sea”.\nThe report on the incident also discusses the issue of voyage data recorder failures.\nSays the BSU synopsis: “At about 0245 in the morning on 24 September 2008, a very serious marine casualty occurred on board the 8749 TEU container vessel Chicago Express in which a Philippine crew member was fatally injured, the German Master of the vessel suffered serious injuries, and four more German seamen suffered minor injuries.\nAt about 1730 on the previous day, the vessel put to sea from Hong Kong and sailed for Ningbo following instructions to shipping from the local port authority because of the approaching Typhoon Hagupit. At about 1945 , immediately after\nreaching the open sea, Chicago Express encountered heavy winds and swell from a south-easterly direction; this exposed the vessel to rolling motions of up to approximately 32 degrees.4 The ship’s command therefore decided to deviate from the intended general north-easterly course towards Ningbo and weather the storm, which at the time of the accident had reached a wind force of 10 with gusts of up to 12 Bft, by steering variable courses against the direction of the wind and swell. This led to the roll angle being reduced to values of about 20 degrees.\n- Hardly a handhold in sight, especially in the dark\nAt about 0245 h, the vessel, which at the time was under the control of the Master and steered by the Helmsman manually, was suddenly hit by a particularly violent wave coming from starboard just as she rolled to starboard. Following that, Chicago Express keeled over severely several times, at which the inclinometer registered an uncorrected maximum roll angle of 44 degrees for an estimated 10 seconds.\nDue to the enormous accelerative forces on the bridge, the Master, the Helmsman and the Lookout also present lost their footing and were thrown across the bridge. The Officer on Watch, who was the only person on the bridge able to hold on to the chart table, hurried to the helm and stabilised the vessel’s course.\n- Is enough known about containership stability in bad weather?\nThe uninjured Helmsman was able to regain his footing relatively quickly and after a short period of orientation, he and the Officer on Watch found both the Master and the AB lying unconscious on the floor with bleeding wounds. While the Master regained partial consciousness shortly after, in spite of immediately initiated first aid measures carried out with the assistance of other summoned crew members and guided by medical consultations by radio, they were unable to save the unconscious AB. At 0417, resuscitative measures were discontinued.\nDuring the ensuing weeks, the Master, who was in acute danger of losing his life for an extended period because of the severity of his internal injuries, initially received medical care in Hong Kong and was flown back to Germany after his fitness to travel was restored. Thanks to the excellent medical treatment his initial acutely life-threatening condition was stabilised after several weeks.”\nLook around your bridge and imagine rolling to an equivalent angle, in the dark, and figure out what you, and others on the bridge are going to hold on to and how to address such a hazard before it becomes, literally, painfully apparent.\n- A solution for the helmsman\nThe other issue is that those on watch did not have enough information on how a ship of this kind behaves in such a situation. Says the report: “A central question requiring clarification within the framework of the expertise was whether the crew would have been able to recognise the danger and whether the accident would have thus been avoidable. It was also a matter of ascertaining whether the vessel’s high level of stability caused the accident and if so whether, at reasonable expense, such a high level of stability ought generally to be avoided with this type of vessel…\n“…It is clearly possible to explain such accidents using currently available calculation technology. To some extent, this may be interpreted as progress. However, with the regulatory documentation and instruments generally used in the construction, approval and operation of vessels it is currently not possible to formulate recommendations for action or guidelines that would definitely help the crew to avoid such accidents. In this context, the expert makes reference to the still existing need for developing dynamic stability criteria for the intact stability of vessels, which are physically correct as regards mapping the swell-related stability effects.”']	['<urn:uuid:b101f9b4-b804-475f-abf5-60556e96e507>', '<urn:uuid:f29afdcd-2a41-4002-b0da-89f3489c3783>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	9	47	2111
82	How do small farms deal with unpredictable weather nowadays?	Small farmers are adapting to unpredictable weather through multiple approaches. They utilize Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) techniques and sustainable farming methods, access digital platforms for knowledge sharing on climate adaptation, and employ precision agriculture tools including weather monitoring systems. They also have access to innovative technologies like flood-resistant hybrid seeds to protect their harvests.	"['A new, leading-edge book is demonstrating how resilient food systems are developed using Climate Smart Agriculture, agroecology and conservation agriculture to address climate change in different regions of the world.\nClimate Change and Agricultural Development, edited by Udaya Sekhar Nagothu, Research Professor and Director for International Department at NIBIO (the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research), synthesizes practical on-the ground studies of practices and innovation in agriculture from around the world.\nIt covers a broad spectrum, including Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA), agroecology and conservation agriculture from less developed countries in Africa and Asia, and highlights how crucial it is to adapt to climate change through innovative and sustainable farming approaches.\nPerspectives on Climate Smart Agriculture\nTwo of the greatest current global challenges are climate change and food security. Feeding nine billion people by 2050 will require major efforts aimed at climate change adaptation and mitigation. One approach to agriculture has recently been captured by the widely adopted term of ""Climate Smart Agriculture"" (CSA).\nCSA is however not a completely new science. A number of its recommended technologies have been used for some time by local farmers all over the world. What is relevant and new is ‘the approach’ to exploit their adaptation and mitigation potential. However, a major limitation is the lack of evidence-based knowledge that is necessary for policy makers to prepare strategies for adaptation and mitigation.\nIn this peer-reviewed book, professor Nagothu has assembled knowledge of CSA, agroecology and conservation agriculture, the ongoing debate between the different schools, and perspectives from different regions of the world, to build resilient food systems.\nA global perspective\nThe first part of the book analyses the concept, opportunities and challenges facing climate change and agriculture, and provides a global perspective supported by cases from China, India and the Sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe second part of the book showcases results from various studies linked to soil, water, crop and pest management measures from the successful NIBIO-coordinated ClimaAdapt program, which is currently ongoing in India.\nThe third section assesses the needs for an enabling policy environment, capacity building, and mainstreaming gender for up-scaling and/or out-scaling innovations.\n“The book has gathered a selection of cases that demonstrates the use of diverse approaches to agriculture and climate adaption. It also looks at the current debate in relation to these challenges and the different scientific opinions and ideologies,” professor Nagothu explains.\nDrawing on the experience from scientists from a variety of disciplines and regions of the world within in one peer-reviewed book, is an effective approach to showcase evidence based technologies and their relevance to support smallholder-friendly and sustainable agriculture systems to address the global climate challenges.\nIn total, more than 30 scientists from a range of institutes and disciplines have contributed to the book, including international organisations such as IWMI, CIMMYT, Cornell University, University of Maryland, CAAS, and ILRI-BecA.\nUdaya Sekhar Nagothu is a Research Professor and Director (International Deaprtment) at NIBIO (Norsk institutt for biookonomi /Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research), As, Norway. He is also the editor of Food Security and Development: Country Case Studies (Routledge, 2014).\nTekst frå www.nibio.no kan brukast med tilvising til opphavskjelda.

Farmers In different parts of the world have been affected by unpredictable and extreme weather conditions such as floods, drought, global warming, and shifting climatic trends. Unexpected weather changes pose challenges to farmers as they grow crops to sustain the growing population. These days, farmers are using cutting-edge tools and sustainable farming practices to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere from their farms. Climate-smart solutions such as improved plant breeding technologies and digital tools are being used to mitigate the effects of climate change and to help create a carbon-zero future.\nAgriculture’s role in minimizing climate change\nAgriculture is addressing a changing climate in various ways such as:\nPrecision agriculture practices and digital tools enables farmers to monitor and familiarize on what is happening in their farms. For instance, sensors equipped with high-resolution cameras can help farmers monitor pesticide application and help them ensure that they are applied more efficiently. This will help reduce pesticide runoff into the soil and greenhouse emissions. Precipitation alerts notify farmers on when to expect rainfall, strong winds or high humidity. This can help the devise an effective irrigation and pest-control program and minimize unnecessary fossil fuel use at this time. When farmers have more control over their crops, they can grow more food on a less piece of land which can translate into more profits.\nWith numerous and better weed-control solutions, farmers can minimize tillage in their gardens. Use Less soil disruption minimizes fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions. The soil is also able to store carbon, nutrients, and water when there is less tillage.\nMinimizing chemical fertilizer is a powerful step towards creating a carbon-zero future. Using microbes and regular manuring can help in reduce fertilizer use in the farm. Microbes absorb nitrogen from the air which is then use by the plants.\nDraining of wetlands and massive deforestation is the largest contributor of climate change. As people clear forests to create land for farming, the ability of the natural ecosystem to absorb and store carbon reduces. Planting profitable fruit trees can be lucrative venture that promotes biodiversity and mitigates the impact of climate change.\nManaging weather changes\nSmallholder farmers are the most affected by unexpected weather changes. Extreme weather conditions such as drought and floods can have devastating effects to the crops and can ruin the entire harvest. To manage their crops even when the unexpected occurs, farmers need access to insights, tools, and resources that can help them mitigate the impact of climate change.\nSmallholder farmers are particularly dependent on climatic conditions to grow their crops. With an increasingly unpredictable climate, extreme weather conditions could threaten their entire harvest.\nCrops need water to flourish. However, too much water can damage the crops. Flooding is a challenge to most farmers during the rainy seasons. Innovative technologies such as hybrid seeds has made it possible for crops to survive for up to two weeks of being submerged. Fruit farmers should, however, avoid setting orchards in regions prone to flooding.']"	['<urn:uuid:499a194a-cc54-45ca-9621-7335cbe7ebe8>', '<urn:uuid:cb5b6fcb-9232-4992-a61b-e94468bcf39b>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	9	54	1104
83	How is the price premium for a standard forex option determined, and what are its two main components that traders should consider?	Option premiums are calculated by adding an option's intrinsic value to its time value. The intrinsic value is the difference between the strike price and the current price of the underlying market, while time value can be calculated by subtracting the intrinsic value from the premium.	['Forex options are derivative contracts that allow the bearer the right, but not the commitment, to buy or sell an asset by the close date for the strike price\nThe traditional (“vanilla”) call or put option\nA vanilla option is a call or put option with no special or exceptional characteristics. If such options are traded on an exchange, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange, they are standardized.\nThey furnish the bearer with the right, but not the commitment, to purchase or sell an underlying asset.\nA currency call option grants the bearer (buyer) the right, but not the commitment, to purchase the contractual currency at a preset amount or exchange rate on a predetermined close date.\nA seller must fulfill the terms of the contract if compelled by the buyer.\nWhen you sell a foreign exchange put option, you are selling the right to sell currency-you become the buyer of currency and have no other choice.\nYou collect the premium and must account for the buyer’s choice to exercise his option. The put option buyer has the power to sell you currency.\nForward contracts are more commonly used to cushion against risk arising from regular foreign currency inflows and outflows, while currency calls are useful for hedging contingent business occurrences.\nTraditional options example\nLarsen International believes that the current USDINR spot rate of 73 can reach a maximum of up to Rs 74 against the dollar in the next three months and decided to profit from such a move by buying a call option of USDINR.\nTraditional options pricing theory\nOption pricing theory offers an appraisal of an option’s fair worth, which investors integrate into their tactics. Suppose you want to value an option theoretically; you will need variables such as strike price, volatility, interest rate, and time to expiry.\nCalculating traditional options premium\nOption premiums are calculated by adding an option’s intrinsic value to its time value.\nThe intrinsic value of an option is the difference between the strike price and the current price of the underlying market. For call options, it is computed by subtracting the strike price from the underlying price.\nFor put options, the intrinsic value is deducted from the actual price.\nSay you have an option to buy ABC stock for £44 when it is trading at £50. If ABC stock dropped below £44, the option’s intrinsic value would be £0.\nAn option’s price is conditioned by its strike price and time to expiry. The more time the underlying market has to pass the strike price, the longer an option has until it expires.\nYou may choose to pay extra for an option with a longer expiry date since it offers you more time to exercise at a profit.\nYou can calculate an option’s time value by subtracting its intrinsic value from its premium.\nFor example, if Alphabet Inc. stock is priced at $1,044 per share and the Alphabet Inc. $950 call option is trading at $97, the option has an intrinsic value of $94 ($1,044 – $950) and a time value of $3 ($97 – $94)\nReasons for using traditional options\n- They are extremely inexpensive to trade.\n- They are available for exchange or purchase.\n- The risk is limited to the premium (if you are a buyer).\n- Potential rewards versus risks are quite large.\n- There are several techniques for speculating on volatility and price fluctuation.\nTraditional options shortcomings\n- A probable loss of the entire premium paid.\n- An option will not trade in a one-for-one match with the underlying. Depending on the put option you purchase, if the underlying asset moves $1.00 in price, your call option may only move 70 cents, depending on the delta, which is determined by the strike price.\nSpot option is a binary options broker’s “platform supplier.” This implies that they supply the software, banking, and much else that binary options brokers give to their consumers.\nOnly a few platform suppliers develop the systems that most brokers utilize, and the spot option is one of the largest.\nTrades may be placed with a single click, with pre-specified stop-loss and take-profit objectives and exceptionally high leverage ratios of up to 1,500.\nDespite the fact that the platform lacks sophisticated capabilities, it works admirably in a variety of trading situations. Trades are completed in a matter of seconds, with no requotes or slippage.\nThe guaranteed stop-loss and take-profit orders eliminate the negative impacts during news trading.\nSpot options pros and cons\nPremiums on spot options are significantly greater than those on classic options models. If a trader correctly predicts an exchange rate, they will profit more from most traditional options contracts.\nDifferences between spot and options forex trading\nSpot trading in the FX market entails the physical exchange of currency pairs on settlement.\nIf you trade the AUDUSD currency pair on the spot market, you will be asked to deliver physical Australian dollars in exchange for US dollars at the time of settlement.\nForex options trading entails the creation, purchase, and sale of a contract that binds two parties to trade a specific quantity of a currency pair at a predetermined exchange rate.\nOptions can be purchased and sold on a Forex options website or through a forex broker.\nIn many respects, spot forex and forex options trading are identical. Both include exchanging currency pairs on the FX market.\nBoth markets are concerned with anticipating future changes in currency values. And both tend to be concerned with short-term fluctuations in currency pairings.']	['<urn:uuid:0ed59f9e-b0f8-4350-ad2e-bfce47bc3728>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	22	46	918
84	what satellites study magnetic explosions near earth	The Magnetospheric Multiscale mission (MMS) consists of four satellites that study magnetic reconnection near Earth. Each satellite weighs 3,000 pounds and when fully deployed, has extending booms that make it about 94 feet tall and 396 feet wide - about the size of a major league baseball field. These satellites fly in a pyramid formation to study magnetic reconnection events in three dimensions, and they collect data 100 times faster than any previous mission that has observed this phenomenon in space.	"['NASA satellites to study magnetic space explosions\nA quartet of Earth-orbiting satellites will study magnetic reconnection, a process by which magnetic field lines rearrange themselves, releasing energy.\nA cosmic phenomenon in Earth\'s magnetic field that is both dazzling and potentially dangerous for people on the surface is the focus of a new scientific mission, scheduled to launch into orbit on Thursday (March 12).\nThe Magnetsopheric Multiscale mission, or MMS, consists of four satellites that will study a process called magnetic reconnection: the explosive phenomenon that can send powerful bursts of particles hurtling toward Earth, potentially damaging satellites. But magnetic reconnection is also responsible for the auroras — the northern and southern lights — near Earth\'s poles. A new NASA video explains the MMS mission in detail.\nMMS is the only dedicated instrument studying magnetic reconnection, and scientists say it could finally reveal how this phenomenon occurs. The mission requires an elaborately choreographed arrangement of four separate satellites in an orbit around Earth, placing them in the path of the magnetic reconnection events taking place right on Earth\'s doorstep. [NASA\'S Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission in Pictures]\n""[MMS] is going to actually fly in Earth\'s magnetosphere, this protective magnetic environment around the Earth,"" Jeff Newmark, interim director of NASA\'s heliophysics division, said in a Feb. 25 briefing. ""We\'re using this environment around the Earth as a natural laboratory. Rather than building one on Earth, we\'re going to where magnetic reconnection actually occurs in space so we can understand it.""\nYou can watch the MMS satellite launch Thursday, with NASA\'s webcast beginning at 8 p.m. EDT (0000 March 13 GMT). Liftoff is set for 10:44 p.m. EDT (0244 a.m. March 13 GMT) atop an unmanned Atlas V rocket. Today at 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT), NASA will hold a science briefing webcast to discuss the mission.\nWandering magnetic field lines\nWhile past space missions have also recorded some data on magnetic reconnection, MMS is the first space mission dedicated solely to studying this phenomenon, according to a statement from NASA. It will collect data 100 times faster than any previous mission that has observed magnetic reconnection in space. The $1.1 billion MMS mission was built and tested at NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\nMagnetic fields can be found all over the universe. Planets, stars, galaxies, black holes and many other bodies create magnetic field lines that can wrap tightly around their parent bodies like vines, or wander loosely into space.\nWith one end attached to the positive side of a magnet, and the other end attached to the negative side, magnetic field lines are typically looped. Occasionally, a magnetic field line will snap, like a rubber band, before quickly reforming a loop. The snapping and reconnecting of magnetic field lines, also known as magnetic reconnection, releases great bursts of energy, sometimes accelerating nearby particles close to the speed of light.\n""Exactly how magnetic energy is destroyed in a reconnection event is completely unknown,"" Jim Burch, MMS principle investigator, said in a news briefing on March 10.\nWhen magnetic reconnection occurs in the sun it creates solar flares that explode off the surface. It can also cause coronal mass ejections, in which the solar flare belches up a storm of particles that hurtle outward into space — sometimes straight toward Earth. The planet\'s own magnetic field protects people on the ground from these particle storms, but orbiting satellites are at risk of being damaged.\nMagnetic reconnection also happens closer to Earth: the sun\'s magnetic field lines stretch and wander all the way out past Mercury and Venus (where they are sometimes called interplanetary field lines), right to Earth\'s doorstep. The field lines bump up against the Earth\'s protective magnetic field — the magnetosphere — causing a few lines to break and reconnect.\nIn some instances, magnetic reconnection near the magnetosphere can send particles hurtling toward Earth\'s atmosphere, and generate one of the most stunning natural phenomena on Earth: the auroras. But magnetic reconnection can also create geomagnetic storms that send electric surges down to the surface and into power grids, potentially shorting out those grids and causing blackouts. These showers of intense particles can also pose a radiation hazard for astronauts in orbit.\nScientists working on MMS want to understand how this beautiful yet dangerous phenomenon occurs.\nA satellite dance\nMMS consists of four satellites, each of which weighs 3,000 lbs. (1,360 kilograms). In preparation for launch, the 4-foot-tall, 12-foot-wide octagonal satellites have been stacked on top of one another, and placed inside a protective shell atop the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. [How NASA\'s MMS Satellites Work (Infographic)]\nOnce the satellites enter into their orbit, each one will unfurl a series of booms or antennas, the longest of which are 196 feet (60 meters) wide. With their metal arms fully extended, each satellite will grow to about 94 feet tall and 396 feet wide — giving each satellite a ""footprint"" the size of a major league baseball field.\nIn orbit, the four satellites will set up in a pyramid formation, so that together they can study magnetic reconnection event in three dimensions. The satellites also have a GPS system, so engineers on the ground can know where the satellites are to within 100 meters, as well as to keep the satellites to within 10 kilometers of each other.\nThe satellites will pass between the Earth and the sun in a region called the magnetopause: where the magnetic field lines of the two bodies meet. After two swings through the magnetopause, the MMS satellites will take a wider orbit around to Earth, to the night side, and pass through a region called the magnetotail. These two areas are where scientists hope the MMS satellites will encounter magnetic reconnection events.\n""Reconnection happens at a very small region in space […] but it impacts a huge region of space, of the whole magnetosphere, which is a million miles long,"" said Paul Cassak, an associate professor at West Virginia University, at the Feb. 25 NASA briefing. ""This makes it extremely difficult to study. Like a cosmic version of finding a needle in the haystack.""\nMagnetic reconnection events are somewhat rare. Burch, the principal investigator for the MMS instrument suite science team, said in an interview with Space.com that the MMS scientists do not expect to see one every day.\n""We don\'t really know how often we\'ll see it,"" Burch said. ""Our requirement is we see 16 quality events and we expect to see well more than those. Maybe on the order of every week.""\nAt the news briefing today, Burch said he was ready for MMS to find ""some surprises,"" as it collects data. Speaking for the MMS team, he said, ""We think we have the definitive experiment on magnetic reconnection.""\n- \'Don’t Cross The Streams!\' NASA Studying Magnetic Explosions | Video\n- How 4 NASA Satellites Will Study Magnetic Fields of Earth & Sun (Infographic)\n- Four Probes to \'Catch\' Gigantic Energy Bursts In Space | Video\n- The Sun\'s Wrath: Worst Solar Storms in History\nCopyright 2015 SPACE.com, a Purch company.

86	I'm looking into insurance options for my mom and heard about alternative care plans. What exactly is an Alternative Plan of Care in long term care insurance?	An Alternative Plan of Care benefit means the insurance carrier will pay for new or emerging services that are not specifically defined under the Long Term Care plan if they later become available and are a reasonable substitute under the individual's plan of care.	['LTCI Terminology (Glossary)\nADLs (Activities of Daily Living)\nADLs are specific activities with which most senior care company caregivers provide assistance. Most companies that provide care define ADLs very broadly, describing them as any non-medical activity needed in the home. For example, a company may say they provide assistance with the ADLs that provides assistance with cooking, cleaning, bathing, dressing, meal preparation, continence care, transportation, exercise assistance, medication reminders, light housekeeping and companionship. Long-Term Care Insurance policies, however, frequently define ADLs more narrowly.\nAdult Day Care\nProvides social and other personal services including supervision and assistance with some ADLs in a community setting. Day care can be provided at anytime of the day but care is always less than 24 hours. Adult day care communities are often used in combination with home and family caregivers to give the primary caregiver a break.\nAlternative Plan Of Care\nOn policies with an Alternative Plan of Care benefit, the carrier will pay for new or emerging services that are not specifically defined under the Long Term Care plan if they later become available and are a reasonable substitute under the individual’s plan of care.\nAssisted Living Facility (AL)\nAssisted Living Facilities are senior care communities that are licensed by the state to provide room, board, medication management and care. Assisted living facilities are usually large, hotel-like buildings with many rooms and many common areas (i.e. a dining room, game room, libraries, and other common activity areas). Many times AL facilities have a base rate per month and different levels or tiers of care on top of that. For example, Level One may be bathing three times per week and light housekeeping services once a week. Level Two may include all of the Level One care in addition to mobility assistance to the dining room. Level Three may include all of the Level One and Two services, in addition to assistance with continence care medication management.\nBed Reservation Benefit\nPays the cost of reserving your place in a facility should you need or want to leave for an extended period (e.g. for a hospital stay or extended visit with relatives).\nQualifying events to become eligible to receive the benefits of your Long Term Care insurance policy. In a tax qualified policy, this will be the requirement to need assistance for at least 90 days with 2 of the 6 activities of daily living or having a severe cognitive impairment.\nIn Long Term Care the concept of co-insurance refers to the amount that the insured must pay out-of-pocket to make-up the difference between their actual costs and the amount the policy covers. The greater the amount the insured is willing and able to “co-insure,” the lower the policy benefits must be and therefore policy premiums.\nA deterioration and loss of intellectual capability that affects a person’s memory, language, personality and ability to reason, communicate and understand. Severe cognitive impairment is a symptom of Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.\nOne of the six Activities of Daily Living defined in a Tax Qualified Long Term Care plan. It refers to the ability to control bladder and/or bowel movements.\nA rider where your benefits increase by a rate that is compounded each year. For example, if your Maximum Daily Benefit (MDB) was $100 and you had a 5% compound inflation rider, the Maximum Daily Benefit would increase by 5% per year. In year two it would be $105, in year three $110.25, in year four $115.76, etc. The difference between a compound and simple inflation rider is not significant in earlier years, but becomes greater as time goes on. It is recommended that you talk to a Long Term Care Insurance specialist to determine which inflation rider would be best for your circumstances.\nAn LTCI policy that covers care in multiple settings, including various types of assisted living facilities and home care.\nSee Maximum Daily Benefit.\nAlso known as a deductible or waiting period. This is the number of days after the insured qualifies for and begins receiving services before the policy begins to pay benefits. While some policies have no deductible periods and pay benefits from the first day, the most common waiting periods are 30 days, 60 days, or 90 days.\nFacility Only Policy\nPolicy where benefits are only covered if the policyholder is receiving care in a licensed Long Term Care facility, e.g. a Nursing Home or Assisted Living Facility.\nFree Look Period\nA provision which allows a policyholder to cancel their policy for a full refund within 30 days of receiving it.\nFuture Purchase/Guaranteed Purchase Option\nThis means the policyholder’s premium doesn’t increase when they increase coverage under this option as compared to an automatic compound or simple inflation, where coverage would increase each year automatically without a concurrent increase in premium.\nGuaranteed Renewable means that the insurance company cannot cancel a policy or change any of the benefits, unless a policyholder fails to pay the premiums. Insurance companies are only allowed to increase premiums for a “class” of policies, but not for an individual personally for any reason including a change in health or age.\nThe physical assistance of another person without which you would be unable to perform one of the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Some insurance carriers define the inability to perform an ADL without hands-on assistance as a trigger for policy benefits. This is a more stringent measure than merely requiring “stand-by” assistance.\nAssistance with various activities of daily living provided in the home.\nHome Health Aide\nHands-on custodial care provided in the home. Home health aides may be licensed but do not provide medical care. Typically they will help with activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing and transferring. Since Home Health Care agencies are usually certified by Medicare, they are more expensive than those that choose not to get certified.\nHospice Care is designed to give supportive and palliative care to people in the final phase of a terminal illness. It can be provided at home or in a hospice facility, and encompasses physical, emotional and spiritual support for the patient and their family.\nInflation Protection or Inflation Rider\nA rider you can add on to your Long Term Care Insurance (LTCI) plan that adjusts the benefits over time to account for inflation. Inflation protection riders can adjust benefits annually based on a simple or compound fixed rate (e.g. 3.2 or 5%) or based on the consumer price index (CPI). Alternatively some plans have a Future Purchase Option where you have the option to increase benefits in the future.\nCare provided by family and friends of a loved one. While, unlicensed and generally unpaid, informal care makes up the majority of in-home care and has been termed the “back-bone” of our national Long Term Care system. In residential settings formal, paid care is often used to supplement the informal care provided by family caregivers.\nInstrumental Activities Of Daily Living (iADL)\nSkills necessary to live independently but not necessary for fundamental functioning. IADLs for instance would include shopping, preparing meals, taking medications, paying bills etc. Inability to complete Instrumental Activities of Daily Living is not a trigger to start receiving benefits under a Long Term Care insurance policy. However, many policies will cover these services for someone who is eligible for benefits due to inability to perform a specified number of the Activities of Daily Living.\nBenefits for covered services received outside the United States. Some policies have international benefits included others do not. If this benefit is important to you, let your Long Term Care insurance specialist know so they can find a plan that includes this coverage.\nTermination of a policy due to the policyholder’s failure to pay the premium.\nPolicyholder’s can pay past-due premiums and reinstate their policies up to 5 months after they have lapsed if the failure to pay was the result of cognitive or functional impairment.\nLifetime Maximum Benefit\nThe maximum amount an insurance carrier will pay over the life of a policy. For a policy with a maximum Daily Benefit and set benefit period it is equal to the current Maximum Daily Benefit times the Benefit Period in days.\nMaximum Daily Benefit\nThe maximum amount the LTCI policy will pay for covered services in any single day.\nMedicaid (Medical in California) is a joint federal and state program that provides health care services for people with low incomes and limited assets. Each state sets its own limit on the amount of income/assets a person can have and still qualify for Medicaid. MediCaid will cover qualified Long Term Care expenses (often limited to a Medicaid qualified nursing facility) for people that are legally impoverished.\nA federal program to provide hospital and medical insurance to people age 65 and older and to certain ill or disabled persons. Benefits for Long Term Care are very limited.\nThis is an optional rider on Long Term Care insurance policies that allows the policyholder to retain some limited policy benefit (usually equal to the amount of premiums paid-in) if you lapse your policy.\nA Long-Term Care insurance policy approved by your state for participation in the partnership program. This program allows you to receive benefits from Medicaid for Long Term Care services without spending-down all of your assets if you have previously purchased and depleted the benefits in a partnership-certified policy. This program is not currently available in every state.\nNon-medical care and assistance needed to help a person perform activities of daily living and/or supervision and assistance for someone suffering from a severe cognitive impairment. Most health insurance plans do not cover custodial or personal care but are limited to acute or rehabilitative skilled-care. Long Term Care insurance plans were therefore designed to cover these services.\nPlan Of Care\nA documented, individualized plan of Long Term Care services prepared by a Licensed Health Care Practitioner (LHCP). Typically a Plan of Care would include the types and frequency of care needed and whether the care was to be provided by family care-givers or through formal paid care providers. If formal care is required the care plan should include a list of potential providers including whatever community services are available in the area.\nMedical conditions that existed, were diagnosed, or were under treatment before the policy was issued. If the application is approved by underwriting, most Long Term Care insurance policies will cover pre-existing conditions as long as they were revealed at the time of application.\nRespite care refers to temporary or short-term care provided to the patient so that the primary informal care-giver can take a break or rest. Respite care can be provided at home or in a facility and allows the primary care-giver a temporary relief from care-giving.\nA rider where the benefit increase by a fixed amount per year. For example if your Maximum Daily Benefit (MDB) was $100 and you had a 5% simple inflation rider, the Maximum Daily Benefit would increase by $5.00 per year. Therefore in year two it would by $105, in year three $110, in year four $115 etc. The difference between a compound and simple inflation rider is not significant in earlier years, but becomes greater as time goes on. It is recommended that you talk to a Long Term Care specialist to determine which inflation rider would be best for your individual circumstances.\nSkilled Nursing Facility/Nursing Home\nThe highest intensity level of Long Term Care. A skilled nursing facility is defined as a health facility or a distinct part of a hospital that provides 24 hour a day nursing care on an inpatient basis. Skilled nursing facilities will have a registered nurse or LPN on duty at all times and a licensed physician on call at all times.\nThe presence of another person within arm’s reach required to prevent injury during the performance of an ADL. For example, if you need somebody standing by to catch you in case you fall getting in and out of the bath. This is a lesser requirement for triggering of policy benefits than the requirement for hands-on assistance.\nA policy feature which allows a policyholder to reduce coverage in exchange for a lower premium. For instance, a policyholder can reduce the Daily Benefit, or the total number of years the policy will pay or increase the elimination period. A policyholder has the right to step down policy benefits anytime after the first year and should always be considered before lapsing coverage.\nContinual monitoring of a cognitively impaired person.\nIn 1996, Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Under this bill there are federal tax advantages for LTC policies that are designated “tax-qualified” (TQ). For instance, on a tax-qualified policy you may be able to deduct part of the policy premium from your taxes as a medical expense if you qualify for a medical expense deduction. Likewise, insurance benefits from a Tax Qualified policy, in general, are not taxable as income. To be defined as “tax-qualified” the Long Term Care policy must meet the provisions of the federal guidelines defined in HIPAA. Policies purchased on or after January 1, 1997 may or may not be tax-qualified. All Long Term Care insurance policies purchased before January 1, 1997 are “grandfathered in” and are considered qualified for tax-favored status.\nOne of the six defined Activities of Daily Living in a federally tax-qualified Long Term Care insurance policy. Refers to the ability to get on and off the toilet and perform hygiene related tasks.\nOne of the six defined Activities of Daily living in a federally tax-qualified Long Term Care insurance policy. Refers to the ability to move in or out of a bed, chair or wheelchair.\nThe process whereby the insurance carrier reviews an individual’s health status prior to issuance of a policy in order to determine if they are eligible for coverage. Underwriting for Long Term Care generally involves one or more of the following: completion by applicant of medical questionnaire, review of applicants medical records, a telephone interview by a nurse or health aid including a cognitive test, an in-home physical and cognitive assessment by a nurse or health aide.\nWaiver Of Premium\nA common provision in Long Term Care insurance policies that waives the requirement to pay premiums while the insured is receiving benefits.']	['<urn:uuid:4403b917-e1f6-4797-ae3a-5a78d975b78c>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	27	44	2378
87	basic speaker care tips maximize lifespan proper positioning	To maximize speaker lifespan and performance, several measures are important: Proper placement is crucial - home speakers should be at ear level and angled toward listening position, subwoofers should avoid walls/corners. For maintenance, monitor foam rings which need replacement every 15-20 years, check for voice coil issues, and ensure proper wire connections. If problems occur, repair rather than replace since speakers are designed to last and only certain parts are subject to wear.

Please feel free to bring them for us to make a diagnostic.\nRECONING AND MOBILE COIL REPLACEMENT\nL The voice coil is connected to the fix structure of the loudspeaker and to the cone in order to be precisely positionned. The fixed magnet creates a magnetic field so that the voice coil moves when subjects to an alternatif signal. The oscillation is in the same time transmitted to the cone to create the acoustic signal that we hear.\nA voiceless loudspeaker is often encountering a voice coil default, whether it has suffered an overpowered signal, a choc or only aging.\nThe most simple solution can be to replace it directly but it often reveals to be eather more expensive than repairing or simply impossible. The two other solutions that may be worth considering are :\nReplacing the whole moving equipment of the loudspeaker, or only the voice coil. This last solution pmay be considerated if the other parts are irreplacable(especially the cone).\nREFOAMING OF A SPEAKER\nThe ring of a speaker is the peripheral bead disposed around the cone.\nThis ring deforms itself to control the movements of the mobile unit of the loudspeaker.\nThe rings are usually made of polyurethane foam and may decompose itself naturally - you must have noticed these small cracks that are generated and grow from year to year.\nThey usually need to be replaced every 15-20 years when they are made of foam, and every 30-40 years for rubber, paper or fabric suspensions.\nRECOVERY OF PASSIVE FILTERS\nThe filter's mission is to distribute the signal between the different HPs according to the frequencies.\nIt therefore avoids an HP reproduction of frequencies that it can not accept or for which it is not suitable.\nThis filter also prevents the same frequencies from being reproduced by several HPs. There are three types of filtering: low pass for a boomer, pass band for a medium and finally high pass for a tweeter.\nA passive filter is mainly composed of capacitors, self and resistors.\nThe filter components of a speaker can wear out over time or fail to sustain overpower or prolonged high-level listening.\nOnce used, these components no longer pass the signal and one or more speakers are likely to be mute.

In order to get the best possible sound, you'll want to spend some time ensuring that the speakers are installed and configured correctly. Whether your setting up a home theater, a desktop computer, or installing new speakers in your car, proper installation is the key to quality sound.\nMethod 1 of 3: Installing Home Theater Speakers\n1Place the speakers. Speaker placement is very important for home theater audio quality, and speakers should be placed before you start measuring out wire. Speaker placement is highly dependent on where the primary viewing spot is. This is typically your main couch or sofa. Your speakers will work best when focused on this location. Below are some tips for placing your various speakers:\n- Subwoofer - The subwoofer's sound is omnidirectional, which means it doesn't need to be pointed in a specific direction. You can achieve good subwoofer sound from most locations in your living room, but try to avoid placing it near a wall or corner. It's often easiest to place it near the entertainment center for easy connecting.\n- Front Speakers - Place the front speakers to each side of the TV. Typically you will want the front speakers about 3 feet (0.9 m) between the side of the TV and the speaker. Angle each speaker so that it is pointed towards the center of the listening location. For optimal audio quality, raise the speakers so that they are ear-level when sitting.\n- Center Channel/Soundbar - The center channel bridges the gap between the front channels. Place the center channel either above, below, or in front of the TV. placing the center channel behind the TV will result in muffled sound.\n- Side Speakers - These speakers should be placed directly to the sides sides of the listening area, pointed at the listener. The speakers should be ear level.\n- Rear Speakers - Place the rear speakers behind the listening area, angled towards the center of the couch. Like the other speakers, these should be ear level for the best sound possible.\n2Place the receiver near the TV. The receiver can go underneath your TV in the entertainment center or off to the side, as long as it is close enough for cables to easily reach the TV. Make sure the receiver has room to circulate air on all sides.\n3Run wire from the speakers to the receiver. After all of your speakers are placed and the receiver has been set up, you can start running your speaker wire to connect it all. Make sure to leave some slack on each end so that you have room to move the speakers around and make adjustments.\n- For floor mounted speakers, you may be able to conceal the speaker wire along the base boards or under the carpet if you do not go by a door opening or fixed cabinet along the wall.\n- For ceiling mounted speakers, you will have to either drill through the ceiling and fish speaker wires down to the speakers, or recess the speakers into the ceiling itself. Recessing speakers into the ceiling may compromise the attic insulation and will make it difficult to aim the acoustic cone of the speaker.\n4Connect the speakers to the receiver. After you've laid out your wire, you can start hooking everything up. Some speakers will come with wire already attached, while others will require you to connect the wiring yourself. If you need to connect the wires yourself, you may need a wire stripper to peel back some of the coating.\n- Hook the speaker wires to the terminals on the back of the speaker box, being careful to observe the polarity (+ or -) of the connections. Many speaker wires are color coded, black being positive (+) and white being negative (-). Clear insulated wires have a copper conductor in the positive (+), and a silver colored conductor in the negative (-).\n- You may have to connect bare wire to the back of the receiver as well. Double check to ensure that you are connecting the right speakers to the right inputs on the receiver.\n5Connect the TV to the receiver. In order to get the sound from your TV to come out of your receiver, you will need to connect the TV to the receiver. HDMI is usually the easiest way to do this, though many setups use optical cables to transfer the sound to the receiver.\n6Connect other devices to the receiver or TV. Depending on how you are routing your sound, you can connect your other devices such as DVD players, Blu-ray players, and cable boxes to either the TV or the receiver. See the device's documentation for detailed instructions.\n7Test and calibrate your speakers. Now that everything is hooked up, it's time to test! Many receivers and TVs have sound tests that you can perform, and some modern receivers have automatic calibration tools. Experiment with music and movies and adjust the levels for each channel until you find a suitable mix.\nMethod 2 of 3: Installing Computer Speakers\n1Determine the speaker setup. You may have a single speaker, two satellite speakers, a subwoofer and two speakers, or a full surround system. Computer speaker setups are often less involved than a home theater, but full-surround systems can still have a lot of pieces.\n2Find the speaker connectors on your computer. Most computers have speaker jacks on the motherboard connector panel, located on the back of the tower. If you are using a laptop, your only speaker port may be the headphone jack, or there may be ports located along the back of the laptop. The location will vary depending on the computer, so refer to your documentation if you are having difficulty locating the plugs.\n- If you are using an older computer, you may need to install a sound card in order to connect speakers. This usually isn't required for anything built within the last ten years.\n3Understand the color codes. Nearly all computer speaker ports are color coded. These colors will help you determine which plug goes where. Most speaker cables will be color coded to match these jacks.\n- Pink – Microphone\n- Green – Front speakers or headphones\n- Black – Rear speakers\n- Silver – Side speakers\n- Orange – Center/Subwoofer\n4Place your speakers. Make sure that you can identify the Right and Left channel cables. If you are setting up a full-surround system, place your surround speakers to the sides and behind your computer chair, angled towards the chair. If you are just setting up two speakers, placing them to the sides of your monitor angled towards you will result in good sound quality.\n5Connect the satellites and center channel to the subwoofer (if necessary). Different speaker models will connect to each other in different ways. Sometimes, you will need to connect the satellite speakers to the subwoofer which then plugs into the computer, while other times each set of speakers gets plugged into the computer separately.\n6Plug the speakers into the appropriate jacks. Match the speaker cable plug colors to the matching colored jacks on your computer. You may have to twist the plugs if space is tight.\n7Test the speakers. Power on the speakers (if necessary) and then turn them all the way down using the physical volume control. Start a song or video on your computer and slowly raise the volume until you can hear at a comfortable level. Once you've confirmed that the speakers work, find a channel test online. This will help you ensure that your speakers are placed correctly.\nMethod 3 of 3: Installing Car Speakers\n1Determine which speakers your stereo supports. Speakers draw power, and some stereos may not be able to handle too much extra draw. Refer to your stereo's documentation when installing new speakers, especially if you are adding additional speakers or replacing existing speakers with high-power replacements.\n2Make sure the speakers will fit. Some speakers are designed to fit into existing speaker locations, while other will require modifications such as cutting away the panel or installing mounting brackets. Take all of this into consideration when choosing speakers to install.\n3Gather your tools. The tools you need will vary wildly from car to car. The location of the speaker you are installing will also have an impact on the tools you need. In general, however, you will probably need the following:\n- A variety of screwdrivers. Phillips, flat head, offset, and more.\n- Torx driver\n- Drill and bits\n- Allen wrenches\n- Wire cutter/stripper\n- Soldering iron\n- Crimping tool\n- Panel removal tool\n- Electrical tape\n4Disconnect the battery. Before working on anything electrical in your car, it is always recommended that you disconnect the power. Locate your battery and find the appropriate socket wrench that fits the lug on the battery terminals. Disconnect negative (black) terminal and move the cable gently to the side.\n- See this guide for detailed instructions on disconnecting a car battery.\n5Read the included instructions. There are too many different possibilities to be covered effectively in this guide. For specific instructions for your speakers, refer to the included documentation or look up the manual on the manufacturer's website. Always defer to the manufacturer's instructions.\n6Remove the speaker grille. These can usually be pried off, though there may be screws to remove. If you are doing this on the front of the dash under the windshield, you may need an offset screwdriver.\n7Remove the old speaker. Speakers are usually screwed into the panel, so remove all the screws before trying to pull the speaker out. Take care not to rip out the wiring harness that is usually present. The speaker may be glued to the enclosure, so you may have to pry it off.\n- Unclip the speaker from the wiring harness after removing it from the panel. You will be plugging your new speaker into this harness. If there is no harness, you will need to cut the wires.\n8Cut holes (if necessary). Sometimes the speaker you are inserting will not fit exactly into the existing enclosure. If this is the case, use your drill to cut out enough space for the speaker. Make sure to measure the new speaker and mark the enclosure so that you don't cut away too much.\n9Wire the new speaker. Most speakers simply clip into the existing wiring harness. If you don't have a wiring harness, you will need to solder the new speaker to the existing speaker wire. Make sure that the positive and negative wires are properly connected. The positive terminal on the back of the speaker is usually larger than the negative one.\n- Avoid using electrical tape to hold bare wire together, as it will likely warp and lead to a bad connection down the road.\n10Test the speaker. Before mounting the speaker, reconnect your car battery and then test the speaker. Make sure that the sound coming out isn't distorted, and that the speaker is visibly moving at higher volumes. You'll want to ensure that it is properly wired before you finish the mounting process.\n11Mount the speaker. After confirming that the speaker is working properly, mount the speaker using any included mounting brackets and screws. You may want to use an adhesive to help keep it in place. make sure that the speaker is secure so that it doesn't rattle and create excess noise.Ad\nWe could really use your help!\n- If you can temporarily fasten, or hold the speakers in position, you may be able to judge their effectiveness before permanently mounting them.\n- Use the shortest wire recommended by the speaker maker, for the length of run you are working with. Longer distances between the speaker and stereo may require larger wire, as will higher wattage components.\nSources and Citations\n- ↑ http://www.dolby.com/us/en/guide/surround-sound-speaker-setup/index.html?utm_campaign=ce-ht&utm_medium=multi&utm_source=multi&utm_content=ce-ht-sym-speakersetup\n- ↑ http://www.liutilities.com/how-to/install-speakers-on-a-pc/\n- ↑ http://www.ebay.com/gds/How-to-Install-Car-Speakers-or-a-Speaker-System-in-Your-New-Car-/10000000177631401/g.html\n- ↑ http://www.crutchfield.com/S-8rek3Le4nlq/learn/learningcenter/car/speakers_install.html\nCategories: Home Audio\nIn other languages:\nEspañol: Cómo instalar altavoces, Italiano: Come Installare degli Altoparlanti, Русский: установить колонки, Français: Comment installer des haut&, 中文: 安装扬声器, Bahasa Indonesia: Memasang Pengeras Suara, Nederlands: Luidsprekers plaatsen of installeren, Português: Como Instalar Caixas de Som\nThanks to all authors for creating a page that has been read 74,854 times.""]"	['<urn:uuid:918bc3e1-1f6c-43ba-9b6c-4801fb2f0ce8>', '<urn:uuid:ca763a3d-7ecf-4e81-b748-0422e8158b30>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	8	73	3160

89	what advanced cyber threats target corporations how do these attacks steal data	Advanced cyber threats, particularly known as advanced persistent threats, use sophisticated methods to infiltrate corporate networks and remain undetected for long periods. Rather than launching obvious attacks, they often exploit unknown vulnerabilities (zero-day exploits) and bypass traditional security systems like intrusion detection and anti-virus. Once inside, they carefully harvest sensitive data like documents, emails, and network information. These attackers employ multiple techniques to move data out of networks, including USB devices, smartphones, backup tapes, wireless networks, and by compromising DNS systems. They typically conduct thorough reconnaissance of their targets by researching company tools, techniques, and security postures through SEC filings and press releases. The attacks often result in significant financial losses - for instance, cyber threats have particularly increased in the banking and financial sectors in recent years, with even isolated countries like North Korea and Iran successfully targeting major corporations like Sony and Saudi Aramco.	['The Chief Security Strategist in an Age of Uncertainty\nThe world is witnessing the decentralization of power structures from a multipolar world to regional powers. Hard power is being replaced by soft power, sharp power, and geopolitical risks, and due to interconnectedness and globalization, geopolitics has become one of the prime challenges for companies.\nDiverse transnational threats, including organized crime, cyberattacks, illegal immigration, and climate change, are affecting the world community. Regional powers are destabilizing the Middle East. Social unrest is interrupting companies’ investment plans. Terrorists are switching to smaller scale attacks like those on 26 November 2008 attacks in Mumbai, India, using AK-47s and vehicles instead of aircraft attacks.\nEach region has a unique set of risks, which often entangle and overlap with others. These threats create a spectrum of governments from Africa to Asia-Pacific that investors are left to grapple with—from autarkic communism to democracy, with the gaps filled in by capitalist communism, monarchies, aristocracies, and dictatorships. Companies investing in Mexico must mitigate threats like drug wars, kidnappings, extortion, and cartels eroding local governments. The Middle East is mired in anarchy, terrorism, conflicts, social unrest, and insurgencies. Europe is seeing social unrest stemming from illegal immigration. A trade war is brewing between China and the United States. Destabilization based on growing threats and pressure from China is leading to the militarization of the APAC region.\nAltogether, the tectonic shifts within the world community create a common facet for the chief security officer (CSO): dealing with the inextricable risks that tie companies and regions. The 20th century CSO was primarily concerned about protecting the physical assets of an organization from threats like theft, pilferage, and robbery. But as issues like emerging risks, regional instability, and local conflicts affect companies, the contemporary CSO must understand the geopolitical dynamics of the 21st century.\nRisks are no longer restricted to the physical and tangible; they have expanded to geopolitical and cybersecurity realms. Borderless threats—like cyberattacks, terrorism, disinformation, and more—can result in significant losses for companies. The dangers of increasing political instability, authoritarian rule, and bureaucratic meddling are compounding the worsening global business environment. Geopolitical risk is at a post-Cold War high, and everything is moving faster than before.\nAccording to the CFA Institute, 70 percent of investment returns may be compromised by geopolitical uncertainties. A crisis in one part of the world can have profound cascading effects on organizations on the other side of the globe.\nThe Changing Role of the CSO\nIn this rapidly evolving environment, contemporary CSOs must launch themselves into the new role of chief security strategist (CSS). Before investing in a foreign country, a CEO first needs a report on the country’s geopolitical and security climate. Throughout the report, the CSS can provide guidance on risks, vulnerabilities, and mitigation measures. The CSS must analyze the various geopolitical, security, regional, and emerging risks—such as regulatory compliance, disasters, local crime, civil unrest, populism, and terrorism—as well as measure their likely impact on investments and future business plans. The CSS can prepare geopolitical risk analysis scenarios to create and integrate appropriate reactions into the company’s enterprise risk management framework.\nCompared to a traditional CSO, the CSS requires a different skill set for risk assessment and mitigation. The CSS must perform research on trends, issues, and scenarios important to company priorities. The key responsibility is keeping the organization ahead of critical security risks, looking beyond the headlines to comprehend world events and their implications for the safety of its employees, processes, and other assets.\nThe CSS would benefit from a research team, which can provide information on options available to the security department. Skilled in conducting incisive research, providing penetrative insights, and suggesting effective mitigation measures, these analysts should conduct policy analysis at the strategic level and security assessments at the operational level.\nRisks and Consequences\nCompanies face reputational, operational, and legal risks if they don’t have security plans. Non-compliance, negligence, and other risks can lead to fines and revocation of licenses by regulatory authorities, enforcement action by law enforcement agencies, filing of suits by victims and shareholders, loss of profitable business, and loss of employees through death or injury. For instance, in 2019, hundreds of flights were suspended at Gatwick Airport near London, England, due to unauthorized drones near the runway, costing the airlines £28 million and the airport £20 million. Other costs include loss of time as senior management focuses on damage control.\nBeyond regulatory pitfalls, adverse geopolitical conditions can also trigger company losses—major upheavals like terrorist attacks, rampant disease, industrial strikes, and natural disasters can greatly affect operations in national and international markets. In 2019, Indonesia announced it would move the country’s capital from Jakarta to Borneo due to rising water levels and climate change. Before that, a 2011 tsunami and earthquake cost Japan approximately $235 billion USD in economic damage, according to a 2011 World Bank estimate. And across the world in Iceland, volcanic eruptions in 2010 disrupted international airline travel.\nGeo-Governmental Risks and Unrest\nCountries in the Middle East and South America are experiencing political and social instability, some of them for decades. Strains between the government and civil groups in Europe are leading to unrest and mass protests. Around 30 governments or leaders have fallen as a result of about 100 significant antigovernment protests worldwide since 2017, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Anarchists and others seeking to cause property damage are intermingling with protestors and taking advantage of volatile situations, which can threaten company assets and employees and disrupt operations.\nBeyond civil unrest, some other geo-governmental risks that can disrupt or negatively impact businesses include military coups, domestic or political instability, lack of socio-economic governance, and economic crises.\nCompounding the fallout from regional or national issues, foreign companies are in some ways at an even greater disadvantage when competing with public-sector organizations. For example, in China, public-sector companies are provided with subsidies, giving them an edge over foreign companies. Another common problem for foreign businesses operating in socialist democracies is nationalization of assets. In countries like Venezuela, government intervention has resulted in the nationalization of foreign companies, leading to permanent termination of private operations.\nSouth American governmental institutions at the national, regional, and local levels are unable to perform their constitutional and legal functions as they operate in a democratic construct where the president is independent of the legislature. Austerity and low economic growth are producing autocrats like Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro. Companies operating in South America are further affected by risks like political uncertainty, court rulings favoring local companies, a lack of due process of commercial law, governance failure, labor laws stifling growth, and more. These risks are leading to uncertain investment climates.\nMeanwhile, governments in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia exemplify authoritarianism and populist rhetoric to stay in power. Geo-governmental risks arising out of government apathy and inefficiency will continue to increase in the future.\nCorporate Espionage and IP Theft\nAs in decades past, critical industries in the technology sector and their employees—scientists, researchers, and engineers—are prime targets of commercial competitors and foreign governments. While companies and the media focus on high-profile cyberattacks, the traditional methods of corporate espionage remain relevant in the age of cyber warfare, and social networking and engineering still offer vast opportunities for intelligence gathering.\nInternational conferences, conventions, and tradeshows host a wide array of speakers, presenters, contractors, and attendees. Technology can be accessed with ease and social interaction is common in a permissive environment, making these events key recruiting grounds for foreign intelligence agencies. Confidential information and IP must be safeguarded at international events, and a lack of security culture and awareness remain the biggest threat to any company.\nThe CSS can either create new or enhance existing security training for all employees, with briefings that will assist in ultimately protecting valuable information and complying with internal security requirements. Security briefings can be fun and engaging, such as during out-of-the-office meetings or get-togethers, and with games that disseminate security strategies and tactics. Security roundtable discussions can include pertinent topics such as geopolitical issues and global security events. It is vital that the CSS brings management into the security program framework so that the company’s top executives understand and support the programs.\nThe Spanish Flu in 1918 was a global event, and roughly 100 years later another pandemic has disrupted the entire world. Initially, companies were unaware and unable to deal with the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. The business community at large did not have any plan to mitigate pandemic risks. Companies had to protect employees and restart production after a global supply chain disruption while creating SOPs and advisories for employees, vendors, and visitors.\nThe pandemic led to a decline in global GDP and notably caused enormous losses to the manufacturing, airline, and hospitality industries. Rising populism, protectionism, and anarchy—plus decreasing foreign direct investment, cyberattacks, and online frauds—are only some of the compounding risks associated with the pandemic.\nTravel Security and Globalization\nDue to globalization, employees are travelling to high-risk countries like Nigeria, Libya, Algeria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Employees face several risks and threats, like unsafe food and water, travel disruptions from social unrest, disasters, terrorist attacks on soft targets, kidnappings, and local crime. Terrorists have also targeted hot spots and soft targets such as airports, train and bus stations, and stadiums.\nA variety of risks affect different countries and regions. The aftermath of the Arab Spring revolutions destabilized the Middle East. Afghanistan remains a high-risk country due to terrorist and insurgent attacks like car bombings, rocket attacks, kidnappings, and hostage taking. In Mexico, there is widespread violent crime—shootings, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery—thanks to organized criminal organizations.\nThe CSS must customize general principles of protection and formulate specific protective measures to assist in preventing and preparing for emergencies in high-risk areas.\nCyber threats can have a debilitating effect on company finances. Fifth-generation cyber threats are characterized by large-scale, multi-vector attacks using advanced tools. Cyber criminals are targeting companies through phishing, distributed denial of service, and malware attacks. For companies working in the banking and financial sectors, cybercrime and fraud have increased in the past few years. Terrorists and extremists have improved their handle on emerging technology, and several terrorist attacks have been funded through online transactions. Chinese industrial espionage through cyber domain continues to be a major threat.\nEven isolated countries such as North Korea and Iran can attack companies like Sony and Saudi Aramco through cyber warfare, according to The Hacker and the State: Cyber Attacks and the New Normal of Geopolitics by Ben Buchanan. The United States has experienced cyberattacks on its intelligence community and other critical government departments. Technology will replace human beings in promoting disinformation campaigns, causing chaos across industry sectors.\nCompanies rely on security technologies like facial and voice recognition, which can be compromised by sophisticated face-swap technology and voice alteration techniques. For example, a CEO calls the finance manager and asks him to transfer millions of dollars to an anonymous account. The manager duly transfers the amount. But this was a fraud—the CEO’s voice was mimicked by synthetic speech production using advanced software.\nThe proliferation of cyber threats has made technology risk a key challenge across industry sectors. Cybersecurity may be handled by the CISO, but the CSS can provide strategic guidance and training to management and employees by preparing policies, developing SOPs, and disseminating information.\nROI as a Barometer for Security\nDue diligence must be conducted to estimate the potential losses from geopolitical events and security threats. For four days in November 2008, the Pakistani terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba used urban warfare tactics to carry out coordinated attacks with assault rifles and bombs in Mumbai, India, resulting in the deaths of 164 people, 29 of them foreign nationals. Also among the dead was a chairman of a major Indian bank and other top management members of other companies. The attack on the Taj Mahal hotel caused an estimated loss of $38 million. The attacks affected the local industry, including transportation, finance, and hospitality. The cost of assets must be calculated and a security plan should be prepared based on the total cost of potential losses.\nSecurity management should be built into merger and acquisition deals. The lack of a protection plan may result in in lawsuits for a company if a terrorist attack takes place after a merger. The only way to effectively shield an organization from lawsuits and safeguard its reputation is to conduct a security assessment of the target company and a geopolitical risk analysis of the regions in which it is operating.\nThe cost of business disruption should be included while estimating the asset value of the company. A small security review up front might cost a few thousand dollars, but an emergency response to an incident and the fallout could run into the millions. The security plan is the manifestation of all the measures to be taken to prevent damage to the company. The ROI is high for an implemented security plan.\nThe 21st Century CSS\nThe world has entered an age of power shifts and competition. The CSS must address the diverse and interlocking areas of security and business. A successful CSS requires multifaceted competencies in international security, geopolitics, international business, economics, finance, and sociology. Considering the flux and turmoil in international relations, black swan and gray rhino events have to be factored into security planning. In the 21st century, there is no one-size-fits-all security plan.\nStrategic knowledge is a requirement to manage international and national issues vital to companies and national security. Assessing the implications of political, security, travel, compliance, and regulatory risks on the company is crucial. The CSS should be able to grasp complex and fast-changing geopolitical issues and quickly discern key patterns and trends. The CSS must know the likely trajectory of risks in key markets. One of the key responsibilities would be guiding companies in determining how varied risks affect operations in different countries. The security team, as the intellectual engine of company’s security and safety philosophy, should add unequaled value to the cause of organizational security.\nCompanies are operating from secure and stable democracies to volatile regions. An absence of global security strategy will undermine organizational stability and limit the capacity to respond to a crisis. Companies will have to grapple with geopolitical uncertainties and emerging threats which remain at the forefront of international security. Risks and threats to companies will expand and diversify across regions. Companies will be challenged by geopolitical risks. The contours of the world are changing. This requires a new commitment to strategic security.\nMangesh Sawant is a senior vice president at Riskpro. He created and leads the global security, homeland security, geopolitics, political and country risk analysis, and military studies vertical. Sawant has a master’s degree from Columbia University, New York, where he concentrated in international security policy. He is a subject matter expert on global security, military studies, critical infrastructure protection, and country, political and geopolitical risk analysis. His scholarly works have been published in journals like Small Wars Journal, National Interest, Eurasia Review, E-International Relations, and Modern Diplomacy.', 'If I am a major corporation and I feel I may be a target, or know that I have been a target I want to have some idea about reducing my risk to attacks. The consistent hum and noise of the Internet on my backdoor is enough to keep me aware of the threat actors working towards exploiting holes in my defenses, but what about the less obvious actors? What is the class of threat considered an advanced persistent threat?\nThis class of actor is usually described as a nation state, or highly sophisticated actor, who instead of kicking in the door to your network, gains access and remains for a long time. They are not immediately obvious and in doing so they have a tendency to be able to exfiltrate information (documents, records, emails) and data (network topologies, network connections, system configurations) for a long period of time.\nWhat does that actually mean to the regular folk who don’t use exfiltrate in a sentence unless watching James Bond? Instead of being an all out assault against your information systems this is a more subtle method of gaining access. Traditional intrusion detection systems, and anti-virus are not going to be protection against this type of assault. It is likely going to use an unknown zero day vulnerability to exploit a weakness in the information systems. A lot of press has played up the “nation state” factor in the equation of advanced persistent threats. As an example the Stuxnet exploit was said to be only possible by a nation state right up until a young researcher did it in his apartment working with a few other people. It was good enough to get a kindly request from the Department of Homeland Security to pull the presentation on his research.\nConsider that we can assume nation states are involved in sophisticated espionage activities. There is a litany of cyber events that can be traced back to nation states over time. However, nation states resources aren’t necessarily required.\nThere are over 40K vulnerabilities in the CVE and each one of those vulnerabilities was a zero day exploit at some point. There are 25 common programming errors consistently identified as a problem. The window between a vulnerability being disclosed and being patched in corporate and government enterprises can be months. So even if you patched instantly upon approval to operate, when the patch is available, you still might take some amount of time to test and roll out the patch.\nThis creates a much larger picture of the threat landscape to information systems. It doesn’t take a genius to look at the current vulnerabilities that haven’t been patched. There is also a significant difference between the CVE and open source tracking groups like BugTraq. This creates a clearer view of the vulnerability landscape.\nOne of the problems of the mass media reporting is thinking that hackers and criminals are just sitting around swilling Mountain Dew and living in moms basement. Though the mystique of hacking is strong and the lack of deodorant at certain hacker conventions causes some riotous behaviors. The reality is that adversaries utilizing technology are not hampered by societal biases and can adapt to the environment much faster than others. The idea that hacker groups are not capable of doing sophisticated intelligence analysis seems a social bias of the media and government rather than the evidence of current events.\nA large-scale exploitation may start with targeting a particular organization or industry through substantial research. What are the tools and techniques used by an organization will give good insight into a host of attack vectors. Looking through literature of specific companies or their SEC filings will give a good idea of what they are doing. Press releases from companies doing business with them will provide invaluable intelligence. Workers traveling with asset tagged equipment will identify them and provide knowledge of the current platforms.\nKnowing that most companies are going to customize security hardening around NIST STIGs and OEM STIGs gives someone a place to start building an exploit matrix. Examine the tool Stuxnet for some insight on human factors and jumping the air-gap firewall. Basically the reconnaissance phase is about determining the security posture of an organization, determining the available exploit paths, and then choosing the highest likelihood of those paths to a successful exploit.\nNow think about your information assurance and security professional. They are used to doing a risk management approach or thinking about security like this; there are systems; that have vulnerabilities; that are exploitable by threats. The adversary is not constrained by that logic chain. They are the threat and are thinking about what targets fit their exploits. The adversary is in a much shorter observe, orient, decide, act loop than the security administrators. Chance are that the security administrators do not have situational awareness of other environments that might mirror their own. Attack failures may not be correctly attributed, but the adversary now understands what doesn’t work in a very small set of what might work.\nI recently read a blog post by a lawyer who said all the cyber hysteria was phooey. He went on to say that there were no significant threats and basically all the cyber security stuff was a hyped version of y2k. So, he was ignorant of y2k and cyber. Lawyers you can hang them but they breed like rats. The principle of evaluation by the adversary is not much different than the selection process used by a car thief. Skip the ones with alarms, the ugly ones, and the ones owned by the guys with guns and go after the easy targets. This is the principle of asymmetry in motion.\nOnce a target has been selected and an attack initiated the next step is hardening the exploit. Thinking back to a recent posting by LulzSec around their Bethesda exploit it appears another party had entered the systems of Bethesda and LulzSec detected that entrance. In other words they had more situational awareness of the victims systems than the victims system administrators did. It would be interesting to confirm that as a point. Once an exploit has been engineered and triggered the premise is to then protect that exploit. Kind of like a weed growing under the noses of the systems administrators until the roots are nice and firm. Then you (maybe) see it pop above the ground.\nWhat isn’t going to happen is an enumeration attack where every port, and every Internet protocol address is triggered like is taught in most security courses. This is going to be a highly targeted and if done correctly will involve one simple strike that exploits a system and then moves through the network never detectable. Think about the common issue of intrusion detection systems. The false positive sets the filter rate, but the issue is with false negatives. Not knowing what you don’t know will harm you much more than knowing what you do know too much. Human ingenuity is to turn off those constant alarms. I read that this is what may have partially caused the Deep Water Horizon debacle. The alarms going off constantly then got ignored. A significant amount of information security education is toward basically cyber infantry tactics, but the advanced persistent threat is the sniper of cyber conflict.\nAfter hardening the system behind them, infiltrating the network and moving beyond the exterior, or moving from clients to servers. The next principle is moving data out of the network. Wait. How do we jump air gaps again? Well there is always the ubiquitous USB key, the iPod, smartphone, back up tapes, wireless networks, “sometimes” connected systems, and infecting DHCP/DNS systems to help jump from one place to another. An exhaustive list of the exploit paths would also have to include building facility systems such as electrical and “burglar” alarms that may have connections to wireless systems. The fact is a dedicated adversary sitting around brainstorming is going to come up with way more than me on a blog post.\nConsider the adversary now harvesting your data. Like some kind of cyber burglar they are gathering up your data. How do they know what is important? What is your business? What are you working on today? Tomorrow? Your behavior patterns and the file metadata is going to identify likely data objects to get first. Though simply downloading email archives will work too. Encrypting your email archives may help, but where do you store the keys? Look at a fictional business information environment. What do your data objects look like? Drawings, letters, email, receipts, services, or what make the information objects on the systems? Are the information systems centralized into an office productivity suite where the data objects are houses in databases that can be copied in total without the need of the data repository applications? Are email systems secured against wholesale copying by their functional specification, or are you relying on the good graces of a system administrator who was just superseded by an adversarial entity? How many of your systems are protected by the social controls you place on a network administrator? Protecting passwords and information security mechanisms will likely fail when an adversary has gone around all of those traditional mechanisms and has that level of control within the target environment.\nThe final stage will be covering their tracks. It is likely a silent withdrawal will be the current practice. While leaving command and control bots behind just in case. On the surface this pattern of intrusion looks like what most people have been taught to look at in their information assurance courses. However, there is a significant set of differences:\n- Enumeration is dispensed with.\n- The use of zero day exploits is nearly undetectable with traditional tools.\n- The systems and security administrators can do everything correct under current state of the art practices and still be exploited.\n- Current tactics and strategies are wholly unprepared to deal with the threat vector.\n- Most security mechanisms will not detect malicious activity, as it will be discounted as administrator use.\nI don’t like the euphemism advanced persistent threat. The use of the techniques are not new, nor advanced, but most assuredly they are persistent. The fallacy is that in the “old days” APT as described above is how an elegant hack was accomplished. Using the systems as designed for wholly unexpected results was the epitome of elegance. Information security education though has instantiated specific techniques like enumeration as primary techniques for penetration testers. I think what has happened is that tool creators have become so few, and tool users so many that the people who write attack tools have risen above the fray to APT status.\nIn general most attacks that create the noise of the Internet are done by tool users who couldn’t code their way out of a box given visual basic. So, the people who could code up a log file obscuration script on the fly so a log ‘window’ over-writes the log with current time stamps (not detectable on separate hosted log file servers) are fairly rare.']	['<urn:uuid:93bda812-b2bc-4ba1-b785-102e702f6b5d>', '<urn:uuid:935320ef-9c6f-43ad-8ceb-9471bf96ec00>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	12	146	4361
90	I'm fascinated by how dangerous sports were in the past - were there any famous accidents or injuries that happened during jousting tournaments?	Yes, there were several notable injuries and even fatalities in jousting, even among royalty. England's King Henry VIII suffered a severe leg injury when a horse fell on him during a tournament, which ended his jousting career at age 44 and affected his health for the rest of his life. Even more tragically, King Henry II of France died after a jousting accident in 1559 during a tournament celebrating his daughter's marriage. A splinter from his opponent's lance pierced his eye, causing a fatal wound.	"[""While many associate jousting with the idea of chivalric knights and their adoring maidens, the sport's true roots are much closer to the physical, dangerous exploits on display in the show Full Metal Jousting. In fact, jousting was history’s first extreme sport.\nThe First Jousters\nJousting and other forms of weapons training can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the rise of the use of the heavy cavalry (armored warriors on horseback)–the primary battlefield weapons of the day. The feudal system then in place required rich landowners and nobles to provide knights to fight for their king during war. Jousting provided these knights with practical, hands-on preparation in horsemanship, accuracy and combat simulations that kept them in fighting shape between battles. However, what was initially intended purely as military training quickly became a form of popular entertainment. The first recorded reference to a jousting tournament was in 1066 (coincidentally the same year as the Battle of Hastings and the Norman conquest of England), and within a century they had become so widespread that a series of regulations were established limiting the number of jousts that could be held, lest the king’s armies be otherwise occupied when an actual conflict arose.\nThese tournaments, like all courtly celebrations, were highly formal events. Months before a competition, nobles would need to obtain the necessary royal permit, issue challenges to fellow landowners and select their most skilled knights to fight. In some instances, they would hire a jouster who was not committed to any other master (or liege) and was available to fight for the highest bidder. These temporary employees became known as “freelancers,” a term still in use today. It was quite common for successful jousters to become immensely popular. Medieval heralds, quite like today’s sports journalists, promoted the events through poems and songs and helped spread the jousters’ fame. In many ways, these knights were the star athletes of their day. Just like with today’s modern-day athletes and sports franchises, rivalries soon formed as the knights fought each other again and again while travelling the jousting “circuit.” But the knights did not just joust for pride and glory, there was more on the line. The most successful jousters could receive gifts of money, land and titles from a grateful liege.\nJousting’s Evolution and Decline\nKnights were not the only men drawn to the glory of the playing field. By the 14th century, many members of the nobility, including kings had taken up jousting to showcase their own courage, skill and talents, and the sport proved just as dangerous for a king as a knight. England’s King Henry VIII suffered a severe injury to his leg when a horse fell on him during a tournament, ending the 44-year-old monarch’s jousting career and leaving him with wounds that would affect his health for the rest of his life. The most famous royal jousting fatality was King Henry II of France. While participating in a 1559 joust to celebrate the marriage of his daughter to the king of Spain, he received a fatal wound when a sliver of his opponent’s lance broke off and pierced him in the eye, a fatal event some believe to have been prophesized by none other than Nostradamus.\nOne of the most important developments during medieval-era jousting was the creation of the list, the roped off enclosure that serves as the playing field. The list brought order to chaos. Prior to its introduction, early jousters and their horses would charge at each other head-on, with no divider, leading to dangerous and deadly collisions. What was initially just cloth stretching along the center of the field eventually became a wooden barrier known as the tilt.\nThe development of firearms and muskets in the 16th century greatly diminished both the role of the military knight and the importance of jousting as a form of combat training. Competitive jousting soon fell out of favor and the sport evolved into more of a court spectacle, with choreographed routines that provided more entertainment than visceral thrills. As the role of these Renaissance-era jousts changed, so to did the protection worn by its competitors. Initially, jousters wore little more than chainmail or even boiled leather to protect them. Early innovations resulted in the use of heavy helmets and sturdier materials and by the 1500's the full-body suit of armor we recognise today was in use. Known as harnesses, these suits could weigh as much as 100 pounds. As this armor was specifically created for entertainment-style jousting, and not traditional combat, they were designed to provide maximum protection, but limited mobility. However, these designs are still considered so advanced that the armor used in modern-day full contact jousting is based on the same basic design principles put in place 500 years ago.\nBy the middle of the 17th century, traditional jousting tournaments were a thing of the past, though some traces of the sport continued in Europe and were transplanted to European colonies in North America. The ring-tilt, in which men on horseback prove their accuracy with lances and suspended rings, remained popular in the United States, and this form of jousting was named the state sport of Maryland in 1962.\n(1450, The dukes of Brittany (above) and Bourbon clash at a jousting tournament Original Artwork: Rivaud and Racinet,Getty Images)""]"	['<urn:uuid:d27765fc-5e2f-4207-9e02-d3a83b96f80c>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	23	85	885
91	micro air vehicle actuator weight control system and fea structural analysis methods	The micro air vehicle actuator weighs 4.7g and uses a control system with a flexible carbon fiber tissue tail and two independently controlled motors for wing frequency difference. FEA structural analysis determines structure behavior under conditions like loads from gravity and wind, using discretization of geometry into finite elements and solving equations for nodal degrees of freedom.	"['Designing the Wing System of a Micro Air Vehicle – spring 2009\nThe goal for the project was to design and create an ornithopter MAV that is capable of remotely-controlled flying and maneuverability. There were several aspects of this MAV design. They were consisting of Lever system, wing system, and materials selection. Aluminum was used as veins and pet film was used as the membrane for the wings. Piezoelectric actuator system was considered in order to achieve high frequency like dragonfly. Although weight is a concern for the MAV, the weights of these pieces are very small due to small volumes and to the low density of aluminum.\nMAV Design team – Winter 2010\nThe goal was to produce an assembly with a dragonfly’s range of motion as much as mechanically possible. Care must be taken when increasing the range no to cause mechanical binding in the crank arm assembly or induce interference between the left and right sides. Other methods such as making the wings lighter and shorter are being considered to reduce the inertia causing mechanical malfunction in the drive system. Gear modeling was an initial challenge. Originally the gears had too many teeth and did not provide the desired frequency. Some equations used to theoretically calculate torque and angular velocity are seen below. GearTeq software has significantly helped in this process and the gear design improved.\nActuator Design Team Winter-Spring 2010\nDragonfly has unique flight capabilities. Also it has many degrees of freedom during his wing motion. It’s hard to incorporate many degrees freedom in to a micro size mechanical system to mimic real dragonfly motion. In this senior design project main focus of the actuator design team was to make a mechanical quad wing flapping device which can independently control the phase difference between front and back pairs of wings. Right and left arms of each pairs of wings kept fixed. The actuator shown in the movie weighs 4.7g.\nControl System Design Team Winter-Spring 2010\nThe first goal of the control system design team was to develop a new method of bio-inspired flight control for a micro air vehicle. Several ideas were considered to achieve this including a center of gravity change and new tail designs. The team focused on creating the most effective tail modification of a commercially available micro air vehicle toy. Several tail designs were created and actuated by a micro servo. The most effective tail was a flexible carbon fiber tissue tail resembling that of a flying fish. It greatly increased the stability of the toy by eliminating phugoid flight modes and also decreased the turning radius of the vehicle. The second goal of the control team was to control the frequency of the two motors of the actuator design created by the actuator team. This was achieved by using a receiver from a coaxial radio controlled helicopter. The coaxial helicopter has two independently controlled rotors that eliminate the need for a tail rotor to keep the helicopter stable. This receiver controls the two motors of the actuator to achieve the frequency difference between the two pairs of wings. Linear actuators on the receiver were used to flex a small version of the carbon fiber tissue tail developed previously.\nWing Design Team Winter-Spring 2010\nThe characteristics of a dragonfly’s wing differ from other insects in nature. The dragonfly will create a camber during the upstroke and downstroke as well as flap its wings in a figure eight motion. This creates a great design challenge when trying to create a mechanical wing that emulates the dragonfly. Using a combition of hardener, resin, and carbon fiber tow vein like structures can be created and pet film is used for the rest of the wing. These materials created the flexibility needed to emulate the wing, and the vein structure can be altered to change the camber in the wing. The programs ANSYS, SolidWorks, and MAYA were used to determine properties of the wing design and determine what changes are needed. Four wings are attached to an actuator in the video shown.', ""Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is the simulation of physical phenomena using a numerical technique called the Finite Element Method (FEM). Over the past few decades, numerical techniques have been developed to address Partial Differential Equations (PDE). A PDE is a mathematical equation that involves multiple independent variables, an unknown function that is dependent on those variables, and partial derivatives of the unknown function with respect to the independent variables. PDEs are commonly used to define multidimensional systems in physics and engineering. These differential equations are complex equations that need to be solved in order to compute relevant quantities of a structure, like stresses, strains and more, in order to estimate the structural behavior under given circumstances.\nToday, one of the most prominent methods to solve partial differential equations is through Finite Element Analysis (FEA). It gives an approximate solution to the problem using a numerical approach that gets the real result of these partial differential equations. Finite Element Analysis is widely used in many engineering disciplines for solving structural mechanics, vibration, heat transfer, and other real life problems.\nIn a nutshell, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a numerical method (Finite Element Method) used for the prediction of how a part or assembly in your design behaves under real life conditions. It is also used as one of the key principles to develop leading simulation software. Engineers leverage on Finite Element Analysis to run virtual experiments, find weak spots, areas of tension, in their design and reduce the need for physical prototypes which can be quite costly.\nFinite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to predict the behavior of mechanical and thermal systems under their operating conditions, to reduce the design cycle time, and to improve overall system performance.\nThe geometry starts in the CAD environment. Hence, the first step is to migrate the CAD model into a form ready for FEA. Geometric Representation creates the geometric features of the system to be analyzed and stored in a CAD database.\nDiscretization of geometry\nSplits the geometry into relatively small and simple geometric entities, called finite elements. This discretization process is better known as mesh formulation. The elements are called “finite” to emphasize the fact that they are not infinitesimally small, but only reasonably small in comparison to the overall model size.\nDevelops the equations that describe the behavior of each finite element. Material properties for each element are considered in the formulation of the governing equations. This involves choosing a displacement function within each element. Linear and quadratic polynomials are frequently used functions.\nObtains the set of global equations for the entire model from the equations of Individual elements. The loads and support (boundary) conditions are applied to the appropriate nodes of the finite element mesh.\nSolution of equations\nProvides the solution for the unknown nodal degrees of freedom (or generalized displacements).\nObtains visualization plots for quantities of interest, such as stresses and strains.\nThe use of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) originated from the need to solve complex structural analysis problems in civil and aeronautical engineering. Now, its applications span across various areas like computer and industrial applications, Electromagnetic fields, Biomedical, Thermal Analysis, Fluid Flows, etc. Here, we'll discuss the common Finite Element Analysis applications:\nStructural analysis involves determining the behavior of a structure when it is subjected under certain conditions like loads resulting from gravity, wind, or even in extreme cases natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes). Using basic concepts of applied mathematics, any built structure can be analyzed.\nFinite Element Analysis (FEA) is part of a multi-disciplined engineering approach. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) gives a detailed simulation of fluid flows, many engineers still rely on FEA to determine the effects of fluid flows on a piece of equipment being analyzed and how that equipment will hold up over time.\nThe increased demand for high performance machines is making Thermal Analysis a crucial part in their development. When addressing thermal challenges, engineers use a variety of tools and the most common solutions used are Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA).\nHeat transfer analysis with FEA is used in cases where the heat convection coefficient can be assumed constant over the part's surface or when the coefficient is known with sufficient accuracy. Heat transfer between solids such as convection conduction and thermal radiation can be analyzed with FEA along with thermal expansion and structural stresses from thermal gradients in the part.\nThe use of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to solve boundary-value problems in a variety of engineering fields could be a powerful technique. Similarly, FEA has been widely used for simulating electromagnetic fields in antennas, radar scattering, microwave and RF engineering, high speed and frequency circuits, wireless communication, electromagnetic compatibility, photonics, remote sending, biomedical engineering and space exploration.\nThe most crucial aspects when choosing an analysis software are its accuracy and reliability. How do you ensure that results from a particular FEA software can be trusted? Fortunately, there is an independent group that inspects the credibility of a simulation software. The National Agency for Finite Element Methods and Standards (NAFEMS) tests simulation software against benchmark Static, Thermal, Nonlinear, Frequency, and Linear Dynamic studies with known results that have been validated mathematically and empirically.\nSOLIDWORKS Simulation is a user friendly analysis tool that enables designers and engineers to simulate and analyze design performance through the use of Finite Element Analysis (FEA). All study types available in SOLIDWORKS Simulation have been tested and validated by NAFEMS.\nSOLIDWORKS Simulation is fully integrated in your SOLIDWORKS CAD. The great thing about the SOLIDWORKS software is that it lets you carry out the tests and evaluations in the same environment letting you determine and analyze product performance early in the design process. This reduces the cost for physical prototypes and takes away the time to alternate between filed tests and modifications.\nSOLIDWORKS Simulation offers three simulation solutions design to meet the needs of different users:\nSOLIDWORKS Simulation Standard is a famous FEA software amongst mechanical engineers and product design engineers.

92	As an urban development researcher, I'm curious about how cities in different regions tackle infrastructure challenges. How does Recife's approach to improving walkability and mobility compare to Istanbul's initiatives, and what are their distinct strategies for promoting active lifestyles?	Recife and Istanbul demonstrate different approaches to urban mobility and active lifestyles. Recife focuses on improving walkability through initiatives like 'More Life in the Hills,' which has enhanced stairways, alleys and public spaces in over 40 neighborhoods, benefiting 15,000 homes. They also implement children's priority zones to improve connections between homes and key services, and plan a 15km linear riverside park with 30km of pathways. Istanbul, meanwhile, is pursuing an ambitious cycling infrastructure plan, pledging to build 1,050km of cycle lanes by 2023 to combat congestion and poor air quality. The city is working to integrate cycling with public transport, though current bicycle parking at ferry ports and transit stations remains inadequate. Both cities face similar challenges with their initiatives - Recife deals with slow progress and community resistance in some areas, while Istanbul struggles with unconnected bike lanes and safety concerns, with 50% of cyclists feeling unsafe and 90% reporting problems with cycling infrastructure.	"['Is child-friendly urban planning and design a ‘rich city’ pursuit? Or can it gain traction in the global South, where most of the world’s urban children will soon be living? I spent a week in Recife, Brazil exploring this question.\nWhy Recife? Because mayor Geraldo Julio has made early childhood a defining theme – and central to his vision is making the physical fabric of the city work better for families.\nRecife: an introduction\nRecife, a tropical, coastal city of around 1½ million people (with another 2½ million in the wider metropolitan area), is the fifth largest city in Brazil. Originally a colonial outpost, it is now a hotspot for Brazil’s tech and medical industries, with tourism and agriculture also important. Its central parts are low-lying former marshland, sliced up by rivers and channels. Surrounding this, hilly regions make up the majority of the city’s land area.\nRecife has high levels of income inequality even for Brazil, and problems with violence. Its neighbourhoods are sharply segregated by socioeconomic status. The middle classes live in low-lying areas, mostly in modern, high-rise apartment blocks (sometimes 20 or more storeys high) with secure, gated parking. Their car-dependent lifestyles insulate them from close contact with poorer neighbours. Public transport (a bus network and four rail lines) is largely used by low-income people.\nThe majority of the population live in low-income neighbourhoods, where levels of sanitation are poor (although most homes have water and electricity supplies). Most live in hillside favela communities in cramped, one-to-three storey housing. Many homes are perched precariously close to steep slopes and at real risk of collapse (tragically, seven people died in a landslip just a week after my visit). Getting around is especially hard. A journey home may involve a slow bus ride along steep, twisting roads and then a walk through narrow alleyways and up lengthy, steep, uneven flights of steps.\nA second type of favela, made up of similar housing but with at least some wider, straighter roads (though also narrow, often unpaved alleys) is found in some low-lying areas closer to downtown. In these low-lying favelas cycling is common (at one nursery I visited, around 70% of children arrived on bikes).\nThis engaging video (entitled ‘Children’s Place’) gives a playful, child’s-eye-view of one low-lying Recife favela.\nThe third and most economically disadvantaged group of neighbourhoods are clusters of flimsy, stilted homes (called palafitas) built right alongside the riverbanks.\nRivers and channels are usually polluted, and low-lying parts of the city are at risk of flooding.\nAs a readable 2019 report from Princeton University shows, the catalyst for Recife’s child-friendly urban planning initiatives came in 2017, when the mayor, his wife Cristina Mello (a paediatric cardiologist) and Guilherme Cavalcanti (at the time CEO of ARIES, the city’s independent strategic planning NGO) all attended an executive leadership program at Harvard University.\nThe fortnight-long program (supported by Bernard van Leer Foundation and other partners) explored the potential impact of early childhood interventions on a whole range of social issues including education, employment and crime. And one of the featured initiatives was Bernard van Leer Foundation’s Urban95 initiative (where I was one of the speakers).\nAs a result, the mayor put together a high-profile, cross-departmental work programme and strategy, working in partnership with Urban95 and coordinated by the newly-created post of secretary of early childhood. It includes legislation, internal and externally funded capital projects, and programming around public awareness, engagement and education.\nRecife’s child-friendly urban planning initiatives include:\n- Two pilot ‘children’s priority zones’\nTwo as-yet incomplete schemes aim to improve public spaces and connections between homes and ‘anchor institutions’ including schools, childcare and other key public services, based on Urban95’s key intervention model. One pilot, in hilly Alto Santa Terezinha, centres around the city’s first COMPAZ, an imposing new building (with public and sports spaces around it, including a swimming pool) that is home to a wide range of leisure, educational and anti-violence projects as well as municipal services. The second, in low-lying Iputinga, will link several small public spaces with two local schools and a daycare facility.\n- An ongoing favela improvement initiative\nThe Mais Vida nos Morros (‘More Life in the Hills’) initiative was created to tackle problems with domestic waste, drainage blockages and unstable slopes. In response to the mayor’s early childhood agenda, it has expanded to include improvements to stairways, alleys and public spaces. It also embraces eye-catching paintwork and murals for homes and walls. It is supported by dedicated participation workers whose methods include walkabouts with local children.\n- A major new park\nThe city has ambitious plans for a new 15 km long linear riverside park, Parque Capibaribe. It aims to physically and figuratively stitch the central neighbourhoods of the city together. The masterplanned scheme, which the EU is supporting financially, includes 30 km of riverside pathways, new greenways and redesigned streets connecting to other green spaces, and 12 new planned river crossings. Almost all of these will be car-free and many will cross from poorer to wealthier neighbourhoods (a controversial idea; one planned crossing has been put on hold after protests from affluent communities worried about security). A couple of small sites have been completed, including the Jardim do Baobá (‘Baobab Garden’, named after the massive tree that is its centrepiece). This is being enjoyed by both lower and higher income people (much like the city’s lively beachfront and its flagship public park, Parque da Jaqueira).\n- New outdoor play spaces in municipal housing projects\nThese are planned as part of a daycare facility construction programme within the municipality’s housing stock. This should see around 20 new facilities over the next year or two.\n- Street programming and parties\nVarious kinds of street programming takes place, including a tourism-oriented ciclovia [pdf link] every Sunday, and community-organised sessions and events in both low and high income neighbourhoods.\nA positive impact\nThe mayor’s early childhood focus is clearly having an impact on the built form of the city. For example, the ‘More Life in the Hills’ initiative has reached over 40 neighbourhoods so far, benefiting an estimated 15,000 homes. It is a low-cost, high-impact scheme, according to planning secretary Jorge Vieira (an early champion of the city’s early childhood focus). Revealingly, urban innovation secretary Tullio Ponzi (who manages the initiative) told me that one trigger for his team’s growing interest in children’s play was their discovery, after one early playground improvement project, that children were travelling between 1 and 2 km simply to play there.\nI spoke to residents in several ‘More Life in the Hills’ communities who were clearly overjoyed at the impact of the initiative. Jaciara Alves, a mother and resident of hilly Lagoa Encantada, told me “it’s not safe for the drug dealing to be here any more.” She added, “all the families come out between 4 and 5 and play with their children on the playing verandas. It’s so beautiful I’m almost crying.” (And she was.)\nPointing across the housing visible from where we were standing, 12-year-old Ana Kelly Batista Da Silva said, “I can play all around here.” She explained, “before the improvements, children wouldn’t play here, and as no children were here, I wasn’t allowed to come out. Now I can come and play and I can take pictures.” (Tech is part and parcel of life, even for low income families.)\nResident surveys bear out this picture, with some neighbourhoods showing a complete turnaround in the levels of outdoor play. In Ana Kelly’s neighbourhood, Burity, 76% of children now play out, compared with only 11% before the initiative.\nIt appears that, after some initial scepticism, communities from across the city are now keen to get involved. I was told that at least 15 neighbourhoods, rather than waiting for municipal action, have run with the ‘More Life in the Hills’ idea themselves.\nVoices of frustration\nThe picture is not entirely positive, and progress can be slow (as with the pilot children’s priority zones). In the low-lying neighbourhood of Arruda, I met activists including young people from a community video project run by the Shine A Light NGO (partly supported by the Bernard van Leer Foundation) who were pushing for environmental improvements and regular road closures. The campaign, called A Rua Também é Nossa (“the street is ours too”) brings together children from both poor and rich communities (the children of the rich are often trapped by society too; one academic I met stated that many were “walled within their apartments”).\nThe community activists in Arruda are calling for a law which would allow road closures for play, inspired by Jundiaí municipality in São Paulo state (which has already enacted legislation) and have been talking to municipal leaders.\nSome progress had been made, including six street parties on the same day, and the group had organised an evening street party that was in full swing when I called by. However, they were frustrated by some of the local politics that in their view were frustrating their efforts.\nLessons and insights\nBrazil’s children face many environmental, social and health challenges. Some, including access to education, violence, road danger, environmental hazards, infectious diseases and perinatal risks, are typical of global South contexts – and low-income populations are hardest hit. But the country is also transitioning towards problems that higher income countries also see, including air pollution and growing rates of child obesity.\nRecife’s response to these challenges shows that the policy rationale for child-friendly urban planning is in some respects even stronger in low income cities. Improving neighbourhood walkability, for example, can bring all-important health, childcare and education services within reach of more families, as well as opening up spaces for active outdoor play and relieving the pressure on families living in challenging circumstances. Moreover, children’s everyday freedoms are a real concern for families in Recife, just as in high-income cities like Ghent, Rotterdam and Freiburg.\nRecife’s early childhood focus, led from the front by the mayor and his secretariat, shows the potential of an energetic combination of sheer municipal willpower, opportunism, piloting and review. Greater engagement with communities could dramatically amplify its impact.\nThe progress it has made, while modest, is admirable given the unfavourable economic climate, with Brazil still emerging from a 2014 economic crisis. If the city’s ambitious plans – not least the proposals for Parque Capibaribe – are successful, the transformation could bring it global acclaim.\nAcknowledgements and references\nThanks to Fernanda Vidigal at Bernard van Leer Foundation and Ana Roberta de Souto from ARIES for their help before and during my visit, and to Bernard van Leer Foundation for its financial support.

Biking on the Asian side of Istanbul. Photo by bicyclemark.\nGrowing physical inactivity at a global scale is causing more people to suffer from chronic diseases every day. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 31 percent of adults 15 years old and older were insufficiently active in 2008, leading to 3.2 million deaths worldwide. Furthermore, the top five leading chronic diseases linked to physical inactivity cost the global economy $6.2 trillion in 2010.\nHowever, an active design approach to architecture and urban planning has the potential to make daily physical activity an ingrained feature of city life. By focusing on the role that parks, sidewalks, and walkable public spaces play in healthy communities, active design encourages physical activity. Cities that adopt active design have been shown to increase residents' physical activity and improve public health.\nIstanbul Embraces Cycling for an Active City\nMany cities have recently focused on integrated transport planning, walking, and cycling as elements of active design. In Turkey, both the central government and local governments have been supporting cycling culture and infrastructure. For example, in recent years, cycling projects have become more important and popular in Istanbul.\nWith 14 million people living in dense communities, the city has faced intense traffic congestion and low air quality. To improve livability and public health, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IMM)—the agency responsible for cycling projects— is turning to active design targets, pledging to build 1,050 km of cycle lanes in Istanbul by 2023.\nA Comprehensive Manual for Decision Makers\nEMBARQ Turkey's Safe Cycling Design Manual for Istanbul addresses the challenges of cycling planning in Istanbul and provides guidelines for improvements. The report gathers input from NGOs and cyclist associations, creates standardized tools for developing safe and accessible cycling infrastructure, and provides recommendations for how district agencies can improve cross-coordination.\nOne challenge of cycling in Istanbul is a lack of integration with other modes of transport. While there is bicycle parking at several ferry ports, subway, and bus rapid transit (BRT) stations, they are not adequate, given Istanbul's size. Furthermore, overcrowding makes it prohibitively difficult to carry a bike on public transport. There are 20 buses currently equipped with bike racks, but bike space needs to be expanded across all modes of transportation.\nThe exact number of cyclists in Istanbul is not known, and collision data is unreliable. This can make planning difficult. To decide on the route of a bike lane, planners and designs need know about the estimated number of cyclists in a given area, their preferences and safety expectations, as well as the slope, width, and conditions of the street.\nSince the IMM rarely has this granular information, district agencies and NGOs need to come together to work on cycling projects, as they are more familiar with the experiences of local cyclists.\nAccording to surveys in the Manual, cyclists in Istanbul prefer to ride short distances (5-6 km). The majority of respondents stated that their bicycle trips were no longer than 60 minutes and that their trips generally end within the same district or an adjacent district. 90 percent of respondents believe that there are major problems with cycling infrastructure. 50 percent feel unsafe, as unconnected bike lanes can lead to dangerous contact between cyclists and cars. Lastly, 35 percent of cyclists think that there is a lack of signs on the road, making it difficult to navigate the city safely.\nBike lanes should be designed with this data in mind. They should both serve neighborhood life and integrate with public transit systems. Additionally, routes for cyclists should be coherent, direct, and continuous. Improvements to current roads and safe bike parking are necessary to ensure convenience and safety.\nMaking Istanbul a City Designed for Cycling\nIn order to combat a growing rate of physical inactivity, local decision makers need to raise awareness about cycling as a viable transport option and implement accessible infrastructure across Istanbul. This will require better coordination between the IMM, district authorities, NGOs, and cyclist associations.\nThe manual, which was awarded an Excellence Honorable Mention from the Center for Active Design in New York, provides valuable guidance for local authorities, planners, and designers to create integrated, connected, and accessible bike infrastructure throughout the city. With strong management and active design, Istanbul can make cycling safer and more convenient for all residents.""]"	['<urn:uuid:852e29f3-f685-46d0-88c6-693e7463def0>', '<urn:uuid:33fe2995-f489-4ffe-a612-b73d0a613aa2>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	39	155	2575
93	barriers for disabled people healthcare access and legal challenges implementation medical facilities	People with disabilities face reduced access to preventive care due to inaccessible provider exam rooms and diagnostic equipment. To address this, initiatives like the Provider Accessibility Initiative aim to increase the percentage of practitioner locations meeting disability access standards through funding and accessibility reviews. Regarding legal challenges in medical facilities, key issues include licensure portability (the right of medical practitioners to practice in different states), information disclosure (patient privacy rights), and mandated testing (institutional regulations for health screening and vaccinations). These legal aspects must be carefully managed to ensure both accessibility and compliance with regulations.	['Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) announced today that it has partnered with the National Council on Independent Living (NCIL) on an initiative to increase the accessibility of provider medical offices and services for people with disabilities. The Provider Accessibility Initiative (PAI) will kick off with the “Barrier Removal Fund” (BRF) in three pilot states, Illinois, Texas, and Ohio, as well as educational and compliance components which will be implemented in all Centene markets nationwide.\nCentene is committed to providing equal access to quality healthcare and services that are physically and programmatically accessible for our members with disabilities and their companions. The goal of the PAI is to improve member access and health outcomes by increasing the percentage of practitioner locations and services in Centene’s network that meet minimum federal and state disability access standards.\n“Studies have shown that Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities receive less preventive care due to inaccessible provider exam rooms and/or diagnostic equipment. Through this partnership, Centene and NCIL aim to solve a vital national problem and key social determinant of health for people with disabilities and their companions,” said Dr. Ken Yamaguchi, Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer for Centene.\n“NCIL is proud to partner with Centene to address the critical issue of increasing the accessibility of medical offices and services for people with disabilities,” said Kelly Buckland, Executive Director for NCIL.\nThe PAI will have several components including:\n- Educating health plan staff in Centene’s markets nationwide about disability access requirements and available tools to assist with compliance and enforcement;\n- Improving the accuracy, completeness, and transparency of disability access data in our provider directories; and\n- Offering Centene participating providers in pilot states with competitive access to a national Barrier Removal Fund. Providers chosen for awards will receive an on-site disability accessibility review completed by a local Center for Independent Living (CIL) and funding to remediate priority disability access barriers.\nAbout Centene Corporation\nCentene Corporation, a Fortune 100 company, is a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides a portfolio of services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. Many receive benefits provided under Medicaid, including the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), as well as Aged, Blind or Disabled (ABD), Foster Care and Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS), in addition to other state-sponsored programs, Medicare (including the Medicare prescription drug benefit commonly known as “Part D”), dual eligible programs and programs with the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Financial and other information about Centene is routinely posted and is accessible on Centene’s investor relations website, http://www.centene.com/investors.\nThe National Council on Independent Living (NCIL) is the longest-running national, cross disability, grassroots organization run by and for people with disabilities. Founded in 1982, NCIL represents thousands of organizations and individuals including Centers for Independent Living (CILs), Statewide Independent Living Councils (SILCs), and others that advocate for the human and civil rights of people with disabilities.', 'The development of health policy can be challenging but actually implementing policies, once they become law can be even more challenging. This is due to the numerous legal, ethical, and financial management challenges associated with the implementation of various types of health policies. In addition to these challenges, conflicting ideas concerning what constitutes best management practices for successfully resolving those challenges can also complicate matters. Legal challenges include licensure portability, information disclosure, and mandated testing (Rutkow, Gable, & Links, 2011); ethical challenges include right of treatment, availability/accessibility of treatment, disclosure of knowledge concerning side effects, and ramifications of treatment (Mansour, 2011); and financial challenges include cost of treatment to patients and cost incurred by medical institutions (Richard, Witter, & Brouwere, 2010). This brief analysis will describe these eight legal, ethical, and financial challenges associated with the successful implementation of new policies regarding the delivery of healthcare as well as management practices that can help smooth the transition during the integration of the new policies into functioning practices.\nLegal challenges like licensure portability, information disclosure, and mandated testing (Rutkow, Gable, & Links, 2011) are all complex issues that arise through the instigation of new healthcare policies and procedures. Licensure portability involves the right of medical practitioners to practice in states that they are not licensed in, especially in the event of an emergency (Rutkow, Gable, & Links, 2011). Information disclosure pertains to the patient’s right to privacy in regards to the details of their health status, especially when regarding the particulars of their mental health (Rutkow, Gable, & Links, 2011). Mandated testing includes institutional regulations necessitating regular practices like mental health screening or mandatory vaccinations for first response workers or healthcare workers. Best management practices for the implementation of procedural regulations without the threat of obstructions due to legalities can be achieved through programs designed to afford medical practitioners the opportunity to participate in emergency licensure portability programs, ensuring patient’s have a right to privacy and that their information remains secure, and that mandated testing is not invasive and does not violate the worker’s rights or that their results are not disclosed.\nEthical challenges pertaining to the patient’s right of treatment, the availability and accessibility of treatment, disclosure of knowledge concerning side effects, and the ramifications of treatment (Mansour, 2011) are all details pertaining to the safety of the patient. The patient’s right to treatment pertains to the obligatory aspects of pharmaceutical production and whether companies have a moral duty to make vital medications available to all people. This ethical dilemma also directly correlates to the availability and accessibility of treatments to patients and whether medical practitioners have an obligation to make sure the benefits of life-saving treatments are available to all that need it. Informing patients about the true nature of any side effects or ramifications that may follow treatment is also an issue of grave ethical concern within the medical community due to the many complications that can arise from the adverse effects of numerous pharmaceutical products. Organizational issues can either enhance or jeopardize the safe administration of patient treatment, which is why it is important for administration to enforce stringent procedural practices that stipulate full patient disclosure regarding the benefits and detriments of all medications prescribed and also enforce practices that include programs that makes vital medications or treatments available to all that may need it.\nThe financial challenges associated with cost of treatment to patients and cost incurred by medical institutions (Richard, Witter, & Brouwere, 2010) is a huge challenge facing many institutions. The cost of treatment to patients includes the fees patients pay to insurance companies as well as fees required by the medical facility providing the treatments. The cost incurred by the medical institution relates to costs of treatment development or obtaining the treatment from the companies that have developed it, fees paid to medical practitioners, and general costs of operation. The significant costs associated with medicinal practice makes the establishment of regulations intended to make treatment available to all a difficult process since such policies could mean billions of dollars in lost revenues resulting from the research and development of medical treatments. This would impose a substantial stumbling block in the path of the future development of effective treatment.\nHowever, to augment the cost of life-saving medications and treatments to patients, many institutions have established policies that allow them to reduce the cost of treatment to patients that cannot afford it and medical practitioners have the option to practice in areas where the people do not have easy access to medical care. Fully resolving the legal, ethical, and financial challenges related to the implementation of policies and procedures in the healthcare industry is not something that can be achieved in a one solution fits all method and many institutions have to reevaluate methods and procedures to find strategies that work best with their employees and procedures.']	['<urn:uuid:edf417c1-b7b7-40f3-8c86-9d370a734385>', '<urn:uuid:74dbd240-df97-46fb-9da2-b91100cb95ae>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	12	95	1399
94	drowning deaths vs shark attack fatalities stats	Statistically, drowning is much more likely than dying from a shark attack. In 2017, 116 people drowned at beaches and coastal areas in Australia, while globally only approximately 10 people are fatally bitten by sharks annually. In fact, the likelihood of having a close encounter with a shark is about 1 in 11.5 million.	['no body of water is safe without a lifeguard\nNo Body Of Water Is Safe Without A Lifeguard\nWhen lifeguards get on patrol, the best place to swim is between the red as well as yellow flags. The flags are put at either end of the areas of the sea the lifeguards take into consideration to be secure to swim in. Swimmers need to prevent these locations unless you intend to police officer a board to the head. When at patrolled beaches, the very first point to do is take note of any signs, especially if the indications state the beach is shut.\nAlthough playing in the water is a terrific kid-friendly task, it is very important to know that swimming can be dangerous. Do not undervalue an unsafe situation in the water, such as if a person is sinking or being drawn by a present. Treat these possibly deadly situations with urgency and severity. If you are an unskilled swimmer yourself or you are with individuals who are unskilled swimmers, U.S. Coastline Guard-approved life jackets need to be put on around the water. A dog swims much like a meal to a shark as well as will certainly attract attention.\nBe positive in your safety and security as opposed to jumping in the water without recognizing just how deep it is. Surf Life Saving Australiaconsiders slits to be the primary threat on Australian beaches (yes, it’s not sharks in spite of the media hype). Many individuals have actually died or come close to fatality by panicking or attempting to swim versus the split attempting to get back to coast. Make it easier for lifeguards to maintain so many people secure by following their instructions.\nTake into consideration selecting coastlines, rivers, pool and water parks that utilize lifeguards and also have them at work. Prior to you enter the pool, lake or sea, examine the deepness of the water in the location you intend to swim in.\nThe primary step to staying safe from shark assault while swimming is to stay out of the water throughout the sharks feeding times. Many species of shark are understood to come closer to shore during sunset, dawn, and night time hours. Do not swim or surf throughout these high threat time frames. In a swimming pool, you’re always aware of what the exact deepness is, where the sides are, as well as the water in it is not moving, as well as not transforming. Find out just how to stay shark risk-free while swimming in Australia. And also, we breast the misconceptions and also type reality from fiction around the real risks. While an Australian summer season will do wonders for your tan, several tourists take too lightly the harshness of the Australian sun.\nRed, roasted Brits and also Europeans on Australian beaches are an usual view, yet this can be avoided. Constantly slip, slop, put; slip on a t shirt, slop on a waterproof, broad-spectrum sun block (at the very least 30+) and also slap on a hat. Worldwide annually, approximately 10 individuals are fatally bitten by a shark. Statistically, you are more likely to sink at a coastline than be bitten by a shark. in 2017, 116 people sank at coastlines and coastal locations in Australia. Most of Australia’s beaches have slits, effective currents that can drag a swimmer bent on sea. Splits can behave in many different means and are affected by the morphology, swell, waves as well as various other variables.\nThose are all bacteria that you do not want to show other people that are swimming in the water. It is your responsibility to see to it your youngsters are refraining from doing things they ought to not be doing but in public areas or in your own backyard pool. Swimming is one of the best exterior activities that you can do during the summertime.\nThey will certainly utilize whistles, sirens, speaker news, hand signals and also verbal instructions to keep beach-goers secure. Australia is understood for its unbelievable shoreline as well as magnificent, pristine beaches. And with 85% people living within 50km of the coast, Aussies enjoy the coastline as long as visitors. Every person will certainly be much more secure and have a a lot more fun time if they understand just how to swim. Instructing kids to swim as well as how to have secure fun in the water is just one thing every moms and dad should carry out in their life time. Bathing thoroughly with soap before swimming can help remove perspiration, body oils, cosmetics and also traces of pee and fecal matter on the body.\nMake certain that you leave the pets at home for your beach trip or at the very least maintain them out of the water. Make certain that the coastline you are going to swim at is patrolled by lifeguards.\nThis is not due to the fact that the lifeguards are on strike, it’s since the water is considered as well harmful. This can be because of rips, shark sighting, jellyfish etc . Do not disobey any kind of signage or instructions from lifeguards, they are there for your safety and security. If you remain in a public place, it is essential to swim in designated locations where lifeguards can quickly be accessed.', '13 Things You Didn’t Know About Shark Attacks\nWomen are safer from sharks than men, punching a shark isn’t the best defense, and most shark attacks occur during non-summer months. Surprised? Read on for more scintillating facts about shark attacks.\nShark attacks are rare, and almost never deadly\nThe real-life likelihood that you’ll have a close encounter with a shark is about 1 in 11.5 million, according to the International Shark Attack File. In fact, you’re more likely to be injured in a boating accident or bike wreck than you are in a shark attack. More good news: death by shark hardly ever happens. In 2017, for example, there were no fatalities from shark attacks in America. These are the tips that could save your life in the event of a shark attack.\nThe safest people in the water are snorkelers\nAccording to the Florida Museum of Natural History, surfers and other people participating in board sports accounted for 65 percent of shark attack victims in 2014, followed by swimmers and waders (32 percent), and snorkelers (3 percent). These are the water safety tips lifeguards wish you knew.\nPunching a shark may not be your best defense\nPieter De Pauw/iStock\nSwinging your arm through water can be difficult, so, if you’re attacked by a shark, “grab at the eyes and gills, which are very sensitive,” Andrew P. Nosal of the Scripps Institutions of Oceanography the New York Times. Here’s what happened when this surfer punched a shark to try to save his friend.\nVery few species of sharks attack humans\nOf the nearly 500 species of shark, only about 30 have ever attacked a human, and three species—great white, tiger, and bull—are responsible for the majority of human fatalities.\nMost shark attacks are on men\nAccording to Nat Geo Wild, 93 percent of shark attacks from 1580 to 2010 were on boys or men. The explanation comes down to numbers: More men than women surf, boogie board, and SCUBA dive—all sports that come with a risk of attack.\nAttacks spike in September\nIn Florida, the U.S. state with the most shark attacks, September is the most dangerous month to be in the water, according to the International Shark Attack File. From 1926 to 2012, 103 attacks occurred in that month, compared to 61 in June, 73 in July, and 84 in August. Can’t get enough of sharks? Check out these fascinating facts about the filming of Jaws.\nJust like us, sharks eat breakfast and dinner\nSharks feed around dawn and dusk, so it’s best to stay out of the water or be especially careful then.\nSharks don’t attack on purpose\nBut they sometimes mistake humans for food in murky water. Imagine the white flashes of the underside of a person’s feet as they are kicking through the water or the sparkle of jewelry on ankles or wrists. “A shark may confuse it with its natural prey,” John Carlson, a research biologist at the Southeast Fisheries Science Center, told the New York Times. Reduce your (already slim) chances of a shark encounter by leaving your jewelry on the beach. Here are some far more dangerous (and much smaller!) creatures to watch out for this summer.\nThe world’s shark population is decreasing\nLest you think the ocean is “teeming” with sharks: “The shark population in the U.S. and around the world are at perhaps all-time lows,” George Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History, told NPR. “On the other hand, the human population continues to rise every year. Fundamentally, the number of shark attacks every year is driven by the number of people in the water, not the number of sharks.” Here are some more wild animal species you had no idea were endangered.\nYou can track sharks online\nScientists and conservationists tag a small population of sharks, usually with dart guns or through slightly more dangerous methods, to gather information on their migratory patterns, size, and growth. Using that data, tracking the animals online has also become somewhat of a hobby for some beachgoers, who can follow tiger sharks in and around Hawaii, and several shark species in Western Australia and in much of the northern hemisphere. One popular great white named Mary Lee has more than 120,000 followers on Twitter.\nSharks follow the (non-human) food\nScientists have reported high numbers of herring and sea turtles in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, which may have explained the unusually high number of shark attacks in that area in recent years.\nFew shark attacks happen in fresh water\nAlthough bull sharks, one of the most aggressive and attack-prone species of sharks, can survive in rivers, lakes, and even streams, in addition to the ocean, few freshwater human-shark encounters have been recorded. Next, check out these tips that can keep you and your family safe on a beach vacation.']	['<urn:uuid:91fddb2d-bb52-4fef-a129-29a7a9f1cc93>', '<urn:uuid:1297209b-b2de-40e8-9b9f-6681f9f2348a>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	7	54	1699
95	As someone studying historical approaches to ethics, I'd like to know how ancient Greeks practically tracked their moral development on a day-to-day basis?	Ancient Greeks kept track of their ethical progress by maintaining daily behavior journals, where they would record specific behaviors such as how many times they lost their temper or got too drunk. This allowed them to monitor if they were truly improving their behavior or just going in circles.	"['I\'ve met and interviewed hundreds of people who have used ancient Greek and Roman philosophies to help them live their lives better, including soldiers, astronauts, politicians and business leaders. They all used philosophy to help them achieve ""eudaimonia"", by which the Greeks meant ""flourishing"" or ""the good life"". Here are seven techniques, from seven philosophers, which businesses can use to become more eudaimonic.\nSocrates: dare to disagree\nSocrates, one of the first philosophers, insisted on our right to think for ourselves. Too often, he warned, humans sleepwalk through life, simply going along with the crowd.\nThis is dangerous in questions of morality, and particularly in corporate governance. When corruption is uncovered, too often people say ""everyone else was doing it"". But our characters are our responsibility. Socrates was prepared to die rather than go against his conscience. Does your organisation encourage independent thinkers, and people who follow their conscience? Does it allow people to give critical feedback to managers? Does it create opportunities for good people to blow the whistle on bad behaviour?\nAristotle: let people seek fulfillment\nAristotle was a great biologist as well as a great philosopher. He based his ethics on a psychological theory of human nature, insisting that we are naturally virtuous, rational, social and happiness-seeking. Governments and organisations need to build the best systems to let humans fulfill their natural drives.\nAristotle\'s philosophy was an influence on Edward Deci and Richard Ryan\'s Self-Determination Theory, which suggests that employees will work harder for you, and perform better, if you give them tasks they find meaningful and morally worthwhile.\nHumans want to believe in something and to serve it. Appeal to your employees\' best nature and they will answer that call.\nYour employees will also be more motivated if you give them the opportunity to feed their natural curiosity through learning opportunities. That could be vocational training, but it could also simply be learning about the world, ideas, culture. Does your company have an evening or lunch-time lecture series, such as Google Talks? Could it give credits for evening adult learning classes, as companies such as Cadbury and Ford once did?\nPlutarch: be a good role model\nPlutarch, the ancient Greek historian and educator, understood that humans are incredibly social creatures, who constantly observe the people around them and imitate them.\nUnfortunately, people often grow up surrounded by bad role models. However, we can steer people, by providing them with better patterns to imitate. That\'s what Plutarch tried to do with his famous work, Parallel Lives, which offered biographical sketches of some of the great Greek and Roman heroes – Cicero, Caesar, Alexander the Great, Pericles – to give young people something to emulate.\nIn organisational terms, that means what you say to your employees is less important than what you do. They will watch how you behave, how you treat others, how you cope with pressure and whether you follow through on your promises. And they will imitate you. If you talk about ethics and then cut corners at the first opportunity, they will follow your lead.\nSet a good example and they will follow it. Plutarch would also warn that your best young employees will use you as a bar to aim for and exceed. That\'s natural. Let them compete with you and encourage them to go further.\nEpictetus: build a resilient mind-set\nEpictetus grew up a slave in Rome, and then became a Stoic philosopher. Both of these positions were incredibly precarious – slaves could be abused or killed by their owners, while Stoic philosophers were constantly falling foul of the imperial authorities (Epictetus himself was eventually exiled). Epictetus coped with this insecurity by constantly reminding himself what he could control and what he couldn\'t. We can control our thoughts, beliefs and attitudes, but everything else is to some extent out of our control – other people\'s perceptions and behaviour, the economy, the weather, the future and the past. If you focus on what is beyond your control, and obsess over it, you will end up feeling helpless. Focus on what you can control, and you will feel a measure of autonomy even in chaotic situations.\nThis insight is now part of the US Army\'s $125m resilience training course, which teaches soldiers the Stoic lesson that, even in adverse situations, we always have some choice how we react. We can learn this resilient thinking, and it will make our organisation and employees more capable of reacting to crises. The environment may be worsening, the economy may be double-dipping. Focus on doing what you can, on the practical steps you can take to improve the situation.\nRufus: keep track of your ethical progress\nMusonius Rufus was known as the Socrates of Rome. He was another Stoic, who taught that philosophy cannot just be theoretical. If you want to be an ethical individual or an ethical company, you can\'t just study ethics, you have to practise it, every day, to get into good habits. The ancient Greek word for ethics is actually the same word for habit.\nYou also need to keep track of your progress, to see how you\'re doing. You can\'t just rely on your intuitions, because they\'re often wrong. So the ancient Greeks learned to keep accounts of themselves. They would track their daily behaviour in journals, keeping account of how many times they lost their temper, for example, or got too drunk. Then they could see if they were really improving their behaviour, or just going round in circles.\nIn organisational terms, keeping track of ourselves means trying to take an evidence-based assessment of our performance. We might say we\'re a green company, but how do we know if we\'re making progress? We might say we\'re a eudaimonic organisation, but how do we know? We can keep track of this, for example by asking our employees (anonymously) how worthwhile they feel their job is. Then see if, in a year, we have managed to enhance their sense of purpose.\nEpicurus: the art of happiness\nEpicurus was a fourth century Greek philosopher who taught, rather scandalously, that the aim of life was simply to be as happy as possible here on Earth, before we die and dissolve back into the atomic universe. He warned that humans are very bad at being happy, and very good at inventing reasons to be miserable. Philosophy should teach us how to be happy, he suggested. For example, it could teach us how to bring our attention to the present moment, to savour it. It could also teach us to limit our desires to what is easy to get, not inflating our needs with endless artificially stimulated desires.\nToday, some companies are embracing Epicurus\' philosophy, and trying to teach their employees the art of happiness. Tony Hsieh, the CEO of American shoe company Zappos, is so committed to the company\'s courses in happiness that he sold the company to Amazon on the agreement it would be able to continue with its unique happy culture.\nI\'m not personally an Epicurean, and think companies should be careful about forcing all their employees to follow one philosophy of the good life. As we\'ve seen, there are many different approaches to achieving eudaimonia. Perhaps companies could create an ethical culture that embraces all these different ways of living.\nJules Evans is the author of Philosophy for Life and Other Dangerous Situations. He has written or spoken about well-being for organisations including the Rockefeller Foundation, the RSA, the Institute of Public Policy Research, the Wall Street Journal, The Times and Wired magazine.

96	jordan river migratory bird reserve breeding species	The Jordan River Migratory Bird Reserve hosts several breeding neotropical migratory birds, including Common yellowthroat, Bullock's oriole, lazuli bunting, western flycatcher, Audubon's warbler, yellow warbler, cliff swallow, barn swallow, and northern rough-winged swallow.	"['Wharton: This urban South Jordan property is for the birds\nSouth Jordan • Tucked in the middle of strip malls, townhouses and sprawling office towers, the 120-acre Jordan River Migratory Bird Reserve is a place that\'s for the birds.\nThe not-open-to-the-public reserve is a work in progress. Hundreds of local volunteers continue to work on planting native trees such as cottonwoods and box elders each year, while removing invasive species such as Russian olives, phragmites and tamarisk.\nRestoration ecologist Karri Smith has documented 91 species of birds on the property during the past several years. Eighty-seven-year-old Keith Johnson, a volunteer with Great Salt Lake Audubon, said foxes and mule deer use the open space that runs from about 9800 to 11400 South on the east side of the Jordan River.\nOwnership of the bird reserve is mixed. Great Salt Lake Audubon, which celebrates its 100th anniversary this year, owns a portion, as does South Jordan City. The Utah Reclamation and Conservation Commission purchased a large chunk as mitigation for the Central Utah Project. And the Harrison family owns 5 acres.\nTy Harrison, an emeritus professor of biology at Westminster College and an avid conservationist, is a member of that family and has been involved in the project from its outset.\nAccording to Harrison, the roots of the preservation effort began in 1991 when the U.S. Department of Interior received a $2.3 million damage settlement for injuries to natural resources along the Jordan River near Midvale. This was the Sharon Steel Superfund cleanup site.\nIn 1995, Harrison, Great Salt Lake Audubon, TreeUtah, IHI Environmental and other organizations proposed using some of the Superfund money to create the reserve upstream from the mill site to avoid any toxic sediment contamination.\nThe groups\' vision included, according to Harrison, ""recreating a riparian gallery forest as a sizable stopping and nesting place in the middle of the Salt Lake Valley for spring-migrating song birds on the Pacific Flyway. The presettlement riparian ecosystem along the Jordan River had been destroyed over the last 100 years by domestic animal grazing and flood control channelization of the river.""\nThe original 31 acres included an area near the mouth of Little Willow Creek where it enters the Jordan River. As the project developed, that would be important because the creek was channeled to meander and to create some ponds.\nThese days, volunteers such as Johnson join Tyler Murdock, an Americorps intern who is ecological restoration coordinator for the project, in working to improve the property and teaching students that they won\'t always see immediate results from their work.\n""Ecological restoration work is not an immediate-satisfaction endeavor,"" Murdock said. ""Significant visual results only come with time and patience.""\nJohnson put it another way.\n""These kids are out planting seedlings as big as your thumb,"" said the Audubon volunteer. ""You tell them that in 20 years when you get older you will appreciate this stuff, because of the change in vegetation and landscape.""\nPublic access to the area is closed, though the managers often lead field trips into the area and are always looking for volunteers. That said, the big, lush area can be viewed from the Jordan River Parkway trail west of the river, and it makes for an island of green in a sea of development surrounding it.\n""This is the last bit of open space that will ever be preserved along the Jordan River,"" Harrison said.\nMurdock echoed that sentiment.\n""In urban environments, we always talk about saving and preserving land outside of cities,"" he said. ""But it is critical to have open space and ecosystem and land we can preserve. We need to be getting youth involved in these projects. It\'s critical. The Jordan River is a unique river. We\'ve done a lot of damage to it, but I don\'t think it\'s gone. It\'s got a lot of life left.""\nTwitter: @tribtomwharton Jordan River Migratory Bird Reserve\nBreeding neotropical migratory birds • Common yellowthroat, Bullock\'s oriole, lazuli bunting, western flycatcher, Audubon\'s warbler, yellow warbler, cliff swallow, barn swallow, northern rough-winged swallow.\nOther birds of interest, some resident, some migratory • Caspian tern, song sparrow, American goldfinch, brown-headed cowbird, red-winged blackbird, Virginia rail, yellow-headed blackbird, great egret, killdeer, great blue heron, American avocet, double-crested cormorant, American white pelican, ring-necked pheasant, American robin, house finch, European starling, mourning dove, black-billed magpie, Canada goose, California quail, mallard.\nSource: Rob Wilson, Great Salt Lake Audubon\nSee more about comments here.']"	['<urn:uuid:4ca6723c-b352-4aa0-945d-b429d9586bd0>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-12T16:08:47.455727	7	33	739
97	How do modern labs prevent mistakes when making drugs?	Modern labs prevent mistakes through multiple approaches. They utilize systematic problem-solving methods for investigating deviations, including proper documentation of events, timeline creation, and thorough analysis of all possible causes. Additionally, they implement automation and modern technology in quality control labs, which speeds up testing processes and reduces human error. Many facilities also use pre-sterilized closed systems and automated filling equipment to minimize contamination risks. These practices are supported by robust documentation systems and clear, written procedures for each operation to ensure consistent quality and compliance with regulations.	"['OR WAIT null SECS\nSusan J. Schniepp is a fellow at Regulatory Compliance Associates, Inc. and a member of Pharmaceutical Technology\'s Editorial Advisory Board.\nGetting to the root of the cause can prevent future problems, says Susan Schniepp, executive vice-president of post-approval pharma and distinguished fellow, Regulatory Compliance Associates.\nQ: I am a quality professional in charge of investigations. Sometimes our company has trouble coming up with the root cause for some of our investigations. Can you provide some advice on how to effectively determine root causes for our investigations?\nA: You aren’t alone in your concerns regarding the inability to identify the root cause when performing an investigation. The regulations for the United States and the European Union require investigations to be performed when deviations occur in the manufacturing process. The ultimate goal of these investigations is to determine why something went wrong, what caused it to go wrong, and how to address the issue and prevent its recurrence. Root-cause analysis is simply a systematic problem-solving approach used for determining the cause of a deviation that occurred during processing and identifying solutions to prevent recurrence.\nThe following are a few general considerations to keep in mind while conducting investigations:\nOnce you have recorded the basics of the deviation, you can begin the root-cause analysis portion. Many tools can assist you in this process. Choosing the right root-cause analysis tool is crucial in assuring the process is effective and ensuring the true root cause has been identified. Keep in mind there is no one right tool to use for root cause analysis, and the tool you choose does not need to be complex to achieve its purpose. Some of the available tools include brainstorming, the 5 Whys, flowcharting, and fishbone diagrams. Using some or all of these tools in combination during an investigation is practical and necessary. Most investigation teams start off with the brainstorming technique. This technique is ideal for flushing out theories about the deviation but may not be ideal for compiling the data needed to prove the correct root cause has been identified. Using the 5 Whys or the fishbone diagram in conjunction with brainstorming adds assurance that you have found the true root cause and have gathered the supporting data. Root-cause analysis tools can be detrimental to the outcome of an investigation if they are improperly used, so it is important to train people in their proper use.\nThe information needed to determine the root cause for any investigation should be appropriately documented. The first piece of information to be recorded should be a thorough and precise description of the event. A timeline that discusses the process up to the time the deviation occurred should be established. Once the event and timeline are properly recorded, a number of questions should be asked and information collected to ferret out the root cause. To make sure the true root cause is identified, each investigation must address the following elements:\nWhatever tool/tools you use to identify the root cause of an issue, they need to be supported by a robust, well-documented investigation. Some of the critical elements needed to be addressed in the investigation to support the root cause include a clear, concise description of the issue that delineates what happened, when it happened in the process, and an accounting of who was involved or observed the incident. Other information that should be addressed in the investigation is a record of the immediate action that was taken to minimize or contain the situation.\nThe investigation should be broad so that all possible causes of the deviation can be captured and evaluated as the possible root cause. Avoid jumping to conclusions and investigate all possible causes so they can be properly eliminated, thus exposing the true root cause. Also, remember that there could be more than one possible root cause to a deviation. If you keep these investigational elements in mind, properly apply your root cause tools, and thoroughly document the investigation, you should have no trouble identifying the true root cause of a deviation and defending it during an inspection.\nVol. 43, No. 2\nWhen referring to this article, please cite it as S. Schniepp, “Effective Root Cause Determination,"" Pharmaceutical Technology 43 (2) 2019.', 'OR WAIT null SECS\nOrganizations involved in aseptic and sterile processing activities must make an effort to comply with current good manufacturing practices.\nEditor’s Note: This article was published in Pharmaceutical Technology Europe’s May 2020 print issue.\nTaking the proper steps to comply with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) for aseptic and sterile processing in an efficient and effective manner is necessary for pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities and labs. Pharmaceutical Technology Europe spoke with Ulrich Herber, senior global product specialist manager for Microbial Solutions, Charles River, and Sade Mokuolu, group product compliance manager, Watson-Marlow Fluid Technology Group, about best practices for GMPs in aseptic and sterile manufacturing and in quality control laboratories.\nPTE: Why is it important for organizations engaged in aseptic/sterile processing activities to practice GMPs?\nHerber (Charles River): First and foremost, practicing GMPs ensures a safe, efficacious, and high-quality product that preserves the safety of the end-user: the patient. However, practicing GMPs also ensures that the risk of contaminating the product is reduced or detected and controlled quickly. This ultimately maximizes operational efficiency, eliminates waste, and improves an organization’s bottom line.\nMokuolu (Watson-Marlow): cGMPs are important to ensure that pharmaceutical products meet high quality standards and are safe and effective. As producers of high-value medicinal products, non-compliance with regulations could risk consumers’ health, failing to achieve regulatory approvals, and significant loss of revenue. It is therefore important to not just comply with cGMP regulations, but also be able to demonstrate that you have. GMPs are necessary to demonstrate that there are good control procedures built in during the manufacturing process to prevent errors that cannot be eliminated through quality control of the finished product. Without GMPs, it is impossible to be sure that every unit of medicine is of the same quality as the units of medicine tested in the laboratory.\nPTE: How challenging or difficult is it to comply with GMP regulations?\nMokuolu (Watson-Marlow): GMP regulations are well defined and focus essentially on the five P’s: People, processes, procedures, premises, and products. Once there are appropriate controls and ongoing verification of these aspects has been established, it should not be difficult nor challenging to comply to the GMP regulations. The heart of GMP is the establishment of well-written procedures for each operation. These written procedures give us the controls necessary to minimize the chance of mix-ups and errors in manufacturing a product. By carefully following written procedures, it serves to provide evidence of compliance with the GMP regulation, but more importantly, it helps to ensure the consistent quality of drug products. Even though the GMP regulations are well defined, following them precisely can be a challenge for a number of companies, as frequently highlighted in the warning letters (known as 483s) that FDA [the US Food and Drug Administration] publishes regularly.\nHerber (Charles River): By and large, GMP regulations are not new to the pharmaceutical industry. Many companies not up to date with current best practices can mistakenly find it overly challenging to comply, but this is not necessarily the case; in fact, it is often easier to exceed minimum requirements very simply.\nFor example, many new GMP requirements focus on improving the integrity of quality testing data while also reducing subjectivity in analysis and reporting. Many labs are quick to accept the first, most simple option as a solution: applying the ‘four eyes principal.’ Unfortunately, while straightforward to implement, it is not scalable nor is it a true solution. What if the lab performs more tests of the assays requiring two analysts to score the result, and thus, require more time from not one, but two analysts? What if the analysts get different results? What if both analysts get the answer wrong? In many cases, the cause for non-GMP compliance is the test method itself being outdated. These can often be solved by modernizing the traditional test method with rapid or alternative methods and using instrument-based analyses.\nAdditionally, microbial identification techniques continue to evolve as more information becomes known due to advances in science. Many traditional, bench-based methods for identification, such as gram-stain or phenotypic identification, have been proven to be incapable or error-prone in identifying certain species or groups of closely related species, such as Burkholderia cepacia complex. Many labs feel that they must continue to use outdated techniques because implementing a new technology can be cost-prohibitive and resource intensive, even though outsourcing their identification to a specialized identification lab is a proven, reliable, and more cost-efficient option.\nPTE: What equipment/instruments does your facility rely on when coordinating aseptic/sterile processing activities?\nHerber (Charles River): Utilizing rapid and/or alternative test methods can be a solution that labs can rely on for aseptic/sterile processing. These instruments allow a lab to automate many processes including the assay, the results analysis, and data reporting. Many alternative and rapid methods can replace traditional methods that can pose a risk of non-compliance with GMPs. These include the use of FDA-licensed, cartridge-based LAL [Limulus amebocyte lysate] test methods and instruments to replace antiquated gel-clot methods, or using ATP [adenosine triphosphate] bioluminescence to replace visual turbidity analysis in final product sterility testing. Both of these technologies replace traditional, error-prone assays with automated technology.\nMokuolu (Watson-Marlow): A recent amendment to European guidelines for the manufacture of sterile products, Annex 1 includes the requirement to reduce contamination sources in aseptic processing (1). It details that wherever possible, interventions should be performed aseptically and how the risk of product contamination could be reduced by the use of pre-sterilized closed systems.\nPTE: How do you suggest other organizations improve/enhance their aseptic/sterile processing activities (specifically, workflow, day-to-day operations, etc.)?\nHerber (Charles River): Day-to-day improvements to lab workflows are easily achievable through implementing more automation in the microbiological quality control lab. This speeds the time to result of many assays, which creates higher throughput in the lab’s general operation. It also reduces stress and anxiety on your lab’s staff by reducing the chances of error, the need for retests, and the potential burden of performing investigations for root cause. These alone can greatly improve the overall value, utility, and employee satisfaction in an organization.\nMokuolu (Watson-Marlow): The draft version of Annex 1 has placed a significant emphasis on applying appropriate contamination controls during drug product manufacturing. It describes how contamination risks could be minimized through the use of pre-assembled sterilized equipment.\nA further way of enhancing aseptic/sterile processing is to reduce risk through automation. A particular critical unit operation during biomanufacturing is the final filling of the drug product. To this end, equipment such as an automated vial filler and capping unit could be used to provide an aseptic environment and control of process steps.\nPTE: Are there any best practices you can recommend for new organizations (e.g., at a start-up), specifically on how to practice and comply with GMPs?\nMokuolu (Watson-Marlow): For new companies, there are a number of ways to comply with GMP regulations. The increasing use of pre-sterilized systems such as single-use assemblies offers a number of advantages that include: no cleaning validation; easy product changeover, particularly for multi-product facilities; and no cross contamination. Additionally, working with a reliable and trusted supply partner with knowledge of GMP regulations means that prevalidated components are easily incorporated into processes and they can also provide effective support and verification of their supply chain.\nHerber (Charles River): Startup organizations often mistakenly feel they don’t have the expertise or capacity to implement rapid methods in the beginning and trust the ease and comfort of traditional methods. However, they fail to realize that as a startup, they have the perfect opportunity to innovate and use modern methods in the beginning, rather than try to overcome inertia and reliance on these methods later. Investing the time to gain the knowledge and experience of using the best available methods early will set up startups for success for years down the road. Using rapid, alternative methods not only ensures GMP compliance right out of the gate, but ensures successful business operations by optimizing production, improving product quality, and reducing risks.\nEuropean Commission, EudraLex, Volume 4, EU Guidelines to Good Manufacturing Practice Medicinal Products for Human and Veterinary Use, Annex 1, Manufacture of Sterile Medicinal Products, December 2017.\nPharmaceutical Technology Europe\nVol. 32, No. 5\nWhen referring to this article, please cite it as L.

There are several types of miso: rice miso is made primarily from soybeans and rice, wheat miso is made primarily from soybeans and wheat, and soybean miso is made using only soybeans. All types of miso are made with salt and koji mold (aspergillus oryzae).	"[""06.29.2021 (Tue.) - 09.30.2021 (Thu.)\nToday, fermentation is the hottest buzzword of the food and wellness worlds, but it has been an essential part of Japanese culture for millennia. This summer, JAPAN HOUSE Los Angeles presents a special focus on the diverse delights of fermented foods - as healthy as they are delicious. To kick off the program, we’re proud to present a special Master Class cooking series exploring fermentation, featuring the chef, cookbook author, restaurateur and Food Network star Giada de Laurentiis, and chef Shinji Ishida, of the Michelin-starred Tokyo restaurant Nogizaka Shin. In this two-part video series, Giada and Chef Ishida share classic fermented dishes as well as information on the ingredients that might surprise even those familiar with Japanese cuisine.\nEpisode 1 | Chirashi Sushi\nIn the first episode, Chef Ishida guides Giada in creating chirashi sushi, a dish where subtle flavors of vinegar, rice, and raw fish come together in various combinations.\nEpisode 2 | Pickled Vegetables and Miso Fish\nIn this second episode, Chef Ishida introduces Giada to preparing classic Japanese pickles, as well as a healthy and delicious way to marinate fish with fermented miso. First, Ishida lays out the basics of the pickling process, from the variety of vegetables that can be used, to the sweet vinegar (called amazu) used to ferment them. Amazu not only enhances flavor, but also longevity through fermentation’s sterilizing effects. While Chef Ishida includes a Japanese vegetable called myoga, he also demonstrates how pickles can be made from a variety of diverse local ingredients, such as cauliflower, tomato, and cucumber that are easily found in the U.S.\nSimilarly, the miso-marinade can be used on a wide variety of fish, from Chef Ishida’s kinmedai (golden eye snapper) to one of Giada’s favorites, wild caught salmon. Giada follows Chef Ishida’s process of preparing the marinade from miso, sake, and mirin, and making small cuts in the fish filet to allow absorption of the flavor and ensure the skin cooks evenly when fried. After each chef plates their colorful creations, they enjoy a first taste and discuss the digestive benefits of fermentation. In closing, the two chefs toast in celebration with a refreshing fermented fruit drink.\nThe fermentation Master Class series was filmed on location simultaneously at JAPAN HOUSE LA’s demonstration kitchen in Hollywood, and at Nogizaka Shin in Tokyo.\n*To watch the video in full screen, please click on the image above, then click on the YouTube icon on the lower right-hand corner.\nDiscover More about the Ingredients\nThere are about 4,000 varieties of vinegar in the world, and vinegar can be made by fermenting any kind of alcohol. Grain vinegars and fruit vinegars are two typical examples. Wine vinegars use grapes instead of rice, and can be made from wine, similar to how rice vinegar is made from sake.\nMiso is made from soybeans, rice or wheat, salt and kōji mold (aspergillus oryzae). There are various types of miso, such as rice miso, made primarily from soybeans and rice; wheat miso, made primarily from soybeans and wheat; and soybean miso, which is made using only soybeans.\nKoji mold, a living microorganism that helps break down other materials in the process of fermentation. Known as the “national fungus,” koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae) feeds on grains, often rice (partially or fully cooked), barley, or soybeans, key ingredients in Japanese foods.\nExtra Miso Pickling Tips!\nYou can pickle vegetables, meat, fish, egg, tofu, etc. in miso. The miso-pickled ingredients will be nicely flavored and with excess moisture removed, the umami will increase. When pickling, put all ingredients in a resealable bag, and press out as much air as you can.\nThe pickling miso sauce can be used a couple of times if there is no excess water within the sauce. Vegetables and tofu should be pickled separately from meat and fish, to prevent cross-contamination.\nAbout the Chefs\nShinji Ishida | Chef & Owner, Nogizaka Shin\nChef Ishida opened Nogizaka Shin in June 2016 together with Yasuhide Tobita, who serves as head sommelier and general manager. Within six months of opening, the restaurant was awarded its first star on the Michelin Guide Tokyo 2017. Nogizaka Shin has won a star every year since then.\nSince 2011, Chef Ishida worked for a Japanese restaurant in Ginza, Tokyo, which was a 3-star Michelin restaurant at the time. He was promoted to head chef at a sister restaurant in August 2011, and in 2013, he moved to France to help open a Paris location as sous-chef. He served as the head chef for the group’s main restaurant after his return to Japan in 2015.

99	force types and effects on objects	Force is defined as a push or pull on an object. Forces can affect objects in several ways: they can change both direction and speed of motion, they may cause motion, or they may slow, stop, or change the direction of objects that are already moving. For example, a soccer player can control a ball's direction without changing its speed, and a tennis player can change both direction and speed when returning a serve.	['The force that pulls things to the ground on Earth (and other planets) is called gravity.\nGravity also holds Earth and the other planets in their orbits around the Sun.\nGravity is a very useful force – It keeps us on the Earth, and keeps the Earth and the other planets revolving around the Sun. It holds everything together, which is why it has been called ‘The Universal Glue’.\nAlthough the force of gravity also exists on the Moon it is not as strong as it is here on Earth. This is because the Moon is much smaller than the Earth it is not as heavy as the Earth, and so gravity is much weaker there.\nIn the past people thought that heavier things fell faster than light things. Galileo, an Italian scientist from the 1600’s, conducted some experiments and found that things with different weight fell at approximately the same speed.\nFriction is a force between two surfaces when they are moving or sliding across each other. For example, when you try to push your hand across a table. Friction will make this difficult.\nFriction works in the opposite direction to which the object is moving. Friction always slows a moving object down, and may even stop an object from moving.\nThe amount of friction depends the two surfaces.. The rougher the surface, the more friction, the smoother the surface, less friction.\nFriction also produces heat. If you rub your hands together quickly, can you feel them get warmer?\nThe ways friction can help include:\npreventing our shoes from slipping on the footpath when we walk\nstopping car tyres from skidding on the road\nallowing bicycle brakes to grip and slow or stop a turning wheel\nSometimes we want to reduce friction. For example, we use oil to reduce the friction between the moving parts inside a car engine. The oil holds the surfaces apart and can flow between them. The reduced friction means there is less wear on the car’s moving parts and less heat produced.\nIce causes very little friction, which is why it is easy to slip over on an icy day.\nHowever, this is a good thing for ice skating and sledging.\nWhat makes our bikes go? what makes them stop when we brake? Why do apples fall from trees?\nAfter our experiments today watch this video and read through the following information.\nYou have probably heard the word “force” before. Here are a few examples: “the rocket had a lot of force at blast off” or “the force of the storm blew the roof off the building.” What is force? Force is defined as a push or pull on an object.\nWhen your foot pushes against the pedal of your bike the push makes the wheels of the bike move. When an apple falls from a tree, it is pulled to the ground by gravity.\nForces affect how objects move. They may cause motion; they may also slow, stop, or change the direction of motion of an object that is already moving.\nForce can change a number of things about an object. They include:\nboth direction and speed\nSome examples of force changing the direction of an object.\nA good soccer player can control the motion of a soccer ball by applying a force that changes the ball’s direction but not its speed.\nSwinging a ball on a string around your head.\nSome examples of force changing the direction and speed of an object.\nA tennis player returning a very fast serve.\nStarting on a swing.\nSome examples of force changing the shape of an object.\n‘The Macedonian recipes are very diverse.

100	iso 27001 isms vs iso 27034 application security purpose	While ISO 27001's ISMS provides a general framework for information security management and protecting information assets, ISO 27034 specifically focuses on application security. ISO 27001 helps with overall security management but has limitations in identifying which applications need protection. ISO 27034 fills this gap by providing clear guidance on identifying, defining and verifying security specifically for sensitive applications.	['Companies are dealing with many security efforts to protect their information. One of their biggest challenges is to have a security system that is operational, simple, organized, efficient and timely effective.\nAlong with an information security management system (ISMS), companies should implement other processes and controls or comply with guidance guidelines that will ensure a secure information flow on their information systems and applications. Companies implementing ISO/IEC 27001, and companies who do not because of not seeing it as the priority on their agenda, ultimately still have to protect sensitive information, such as information collected, computed, stored and communicated by their applications. As a result of any breach or lost concerning organization’s sensitive information, it can produce an unacceptable impact and make a difference between profitability and loss. Organizations’ should make an investment to train their staff on standards such as ISO/IEC 27034 which specifically deals with application security. Furthermore, application security is not only about protecting an application, but rather about protecting sensitive information involved by the use of an application. Yet, not all applications have to be protected except those for manipulating sensitive information. Significantly, ISO/IEC 27034 provides clear guidance on why and how companies can identify, define and verify the security on a sensitive application. It also shows their conformance towards a measurable level of trust defined by ISO/IEC 27034.\nWhat are the benefits of application security?\nISO/IEC 27034 Application Security provides a framework that helps organizations to identify and protect specific application’s sensitive information. Nonetheless, it is difficult and costly to try to protect all organization’s applications. Likewise, using a risk management approach, the ISO/IEC 27034 framework proposed components such as Application Security Controls (ASC) and processes to ensure that sensitive applications meet the Targeted Level of Trust (i.e. the required security level). This is done so that no sensitive information can be accessed, modified or lost by neither any unexpected event nor unauthorized person, internally or externally. Therefore, when ISO/IEC 27034 is well implemented and managed by an organization, it will not only help to provide expected and verifiable evidence to demonstrate that adequate protection of sensitive applications is in place, but it will also help to support the organization’s ISMS and the ICT security. However, while trying to implement application security at a large organization, it might seem expensive and time-consuming. Still, using the ISO/IEC 27034 framework to implement Application Security will be an assurance for optimizing security implementation and the benefits are irreplaceable. Importantly, a well-managed application security process will provide you required evidence that you can trust your applications as adequately protected to face any incident (accepted risks) that may happen at that time.\nThe ISO/IEC 27034 framework will provide you clear guidance on how to handle the application security issues, taking in account your specific Business, Regulatory and Technological contexts. Moreover, implementing ASCs identified by your Level of Trust is a set of processes that are not only well integrated on the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), but also to your day-to-day operational processes.\nRequired ASCs can be implemented internally by the company employees or externally by outsourcing the companies that deal directly with the specified security matters. In both situations, these ASCs are verifiable and expected results can be provided to prove their adequate implementation. Without this evidence, a company cannot verify any successful security implementation.\nManaging application security is not trivial. It’s not only a code review process and vulnerability testing anymore. Application security is not only for organizations’ developing application but also for organizations that need to use and operate applications to make a successful business. Application security has to be planned, defined and managed in respect of organization’s priorities and resources. Too much security is a waste of money, but not enough security can be a threat to the organization’s survival. Looked that way, it’s maybe better to invest in the necessary training and certification to make sure application security will be understood and well managed by your experts.\nISO/IEC 27034 as guidance for application security\nThinking of deeper security implementation implies that more procedures and standards should be considered. The proper implementation of ISO/IEC 27001 and its ISMS provide good assurance for information security matters on the company. But, ISMS’ limitation is to identify what applications should be protected, and will not tell you what to do and that’s where ISO/IEC 27034 gains all its value.\nISO/IEC 27034 Application Security standard content\nApplication Security: Overview and concepts (published)\nPart 1 presents an overview of application security. It introduces definitions, concepts, principles and processes involved in application security.\nApplication Security: Organization Normative Framework (published)\nPart 2 presents an in-depth discussion of the Organization Normative Framework, its components and the organization-level processes for managing it. This part explains the relationships among these processes, the activities associated with them, and the means by which they support the Application Security Management Process. It presents how an organization should implement the standard and integrate it into its existing processes.\nApplication Security Management Process (expected for 2017)\nPart 3 presents an in-depth discussion of the processes involved in an application project: determining the application requirements and environment, assessing the application security risks, creating and maintaining the Application Normative Framework, realizing and operating the application, and validating its security throughout its life cycle. This part explains the relationships among these processes, their activities and interdependencies, and how they introduce security into an application project. It presents how an organization should implement the standard on an application project level and integrate it into its existing processes.\nApplication Security Validation (work in progress)\nPart 4 presents an in-depth discussion of the application security validation, audit and certification process for organizations, applications, and people. It presents what and how the implementation of this IS should be verified and audited on three (3) levels, as:\n- Organization level – where it will frame and guide auditors to validate the organization’s AS objectives and audit/verify how an organization complies with its AS objectives and criteria.\n- Application level – where it will frame and guide auditors to measure the application’s Actual Level of Trust and compare it with the application’s Targeted Level of Trust previously selected by the organization, to certify this application as secure as expected.\n- Peoples level – where it will frame and guide the development and the implementation of an ISO/IEC 27034 AS professional certification.\nProtocols and application security control data structure (expected for 2017)\nPart 5 presents the minimal set of essential attributes of ASCs and further details the Application Security Life Cycle Reference Model, in order to facilitate the implementation of the 27034 AS framework and the communication and exchange of ASCs.\nPART 5.1 – Protocols and application security control data structure – XML Schemas (expected for 2017)\nPart 5 presents and explains an XML Schemas example, describing the Application Security Control (ASC) and the Application Security Life Cycle Reference Model (ASLCRM) components.\nCase studies (expected for 2017)\nPart 6 provides case studies and examples of ASCs tailored for specific application security requirements.\nApplication Security Assurance Prediction Model (expected for 2017)\nPart 7 codifies the requirements and framework for making predictive security claims statements to replace ASC in an AS project when allowed. Each part is entitled to bring explanations on how to treat every aspect on Application Security. Organization security plans should be in accordance with the application security.\nNote: Because of the ISO/ IEC 27034 project still a work in progress, this list of parts is not definitive.

ISO 27001 certification is essential for protecting your most vital assets.\nISO 27001 implementation is an ideal response to customer and legal requirements such as the GDPR and potential security threats including:\n- Cyber crime\n- Personal data breaches\n- Vandalism / terrorism\n- Fire / damage\n- Viral attack\nThe ISO 27001 standard is also structured to be compatible with other management systems standards, such as ISO 9001 and it is technology and vendor neutral, which means it is completely independent of any IT platform. As such, all members of the company should be educated on what the standard means and how it applies throughout the organization.\nHelps you with\n- Asset protection\n- Security policy\n- Cyber security strategy\n- IT governance\n- Incident management\n- Threat mitigation\n- Downtime reduction\n- Loss prevention\n- Data breaches\n- Compliance checklist\n- Management system\nBenefits of ISO 27001 Certification\nGive customers confidence that their personal data/information is protected and confidentiality upheld at all times.\nAvoid downtime with management of risk, legal compliance and vigilance of future security issues and concerns.\nUnderstand how statutory and regulatory requirements impact your organization and its customers, whilst reducing risk of facing prosecution and fines.\nImproved risk management\nEnsure customer records, financial information and intellectual property are protected from loss, theft and damage through a systematic framework.\nProven business credentials\nIndependent verification against a globally recognized industry standard speaks volumes.\nAbility to win more business\nProcurement specifications often require certification as a condition to supply, so certification opens doors.\nGlobal recognition as a reputable supplier\nCertification is recognized internationally and accepted throughout industry supply chains, setting industry benchmarks for sourcing suppliers.\nIs ISO 27001 right for me?\nIt’s right for you and your organization if you need the evidence or assurance that your most important asset is protected from misuse, corruption, or loss.\nWe have certified organizations to ISO 27001 in a diverse range of sectors including Royal Mail Group, Smart Water Technology, Barcode Warehouse and the Northern Ireland Council for Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment.\nWhat is an ISMS?\nAn ISMS is a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information so that it remains secure. It includes people, processes and IT systems by applying a risk management process.\nIt can help any size organization within any industry keep business information assets secure.\nGDPR and ISO 27001\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has a much more extensive scope than the previous Data Protection Act (DPA) and has been introduced to stay in touch with the modern digital landscape. The Regulation affords more data rights to individuals and requires organizations to develop defined policies, procedures and to adopt relevant technical and organizational controls to protect personal data.\nThe GDPR applies to two types of users, of which we will undoubtedly all fall; Controllers and Processors. Briefly put; the controller determines how and why the personal data is used or processed and the processor acts on the controllers behalf, much like many organizations relying on the services of an IT service provider. Processors have more legal obligations placed on them in the case of a breach however a controller will be responsible for ensuring the contracts with the processor comply with the GDPR.\nThis is not a complete overview of the regulation and should not be used as such.
