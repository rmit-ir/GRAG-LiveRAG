1	what are the mass and orbit time of two stars in eta carinae system	In the Eta Carinae system, there are two stars orbiting each other with a period of 5.5 years. The larger star has a mass of about 120 solar masses (though it was once 150), while the smaller star has a mass of 30 solar masses.	['A star millions of times as bright as the sun has been imaged using a combination of space and Earth-based telescopes to provide extraordinary detail. The observations could help us predict when the star will go through an explosion that is likely to offer us a spectacular show.\nWithin the Eta Carinae stellar system is a truly phenomenal star, with an estimated mass so great it has forced us to reconsider how heavy stars can be without blowing themselves apart. More massive stars have since been found, and it is thought they once grew bigger still, but nothing so large is anything like it so close.\nIn 1843, Eta Carinae had an extraordinary outburst, making it temporarily the second brightest star in the sky. Its fading is thought to result from a cloaking cloud of dust, rather than any diminution of emitted light.\nWe now know Eta Carinae is two stars orbiting each other with a period of 5.5 years. The larger star was once 150 times the mass of our sun, but is now down to around 120 solar masses, while the smaller is a still huge 30 solar masses.\nThe enveloping gas and dust thrown off by Eta Carinae’s A’s activity is so thick that for a long time there was debate about whether a second star even existed. Now NASA has mapped their interaction and the effect of their stellar winds on the surrounding gasses with extraordinary accuracy, including stitching together 41 Hubble images covering gas clouds a tenth of a light-year wide.\nThe stars’ orbits are very elongated, and when these stars are closest together (periastron) interesting things happen, including X-ray flares followed by a sudden quiet. One periastron occurred in 2014, and astronomers now think they are coming to understand what they witnessed. To solidify their thinking, the NASA scientists used a 3-D printer to create models of the system with the stars at different orbital stages.\nThey believe the key to what was seen during the last three periastrons is the way the two stars’ stellar winds interacted with each other and the gas around them. In keeping with their size, both stars have hugely powerful stellar winds, but with differing compositions – thick and slow for Eta Carinae A, six times faster and a hundredfold less dense for its companion.\n“We are coming to understand the present state and complex environment of this remarkable object, but we have a long way to go to explain Eta Carinae’s past eruptions or to predict its future behavior,” said Dr. Ted Gull of the Goddard Space Flight Center. The Goddard team have created a model that predicts how each periastron will differ, but face a frustrating wait until 2020 before they can test it out.\nCredit: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center/T. Madura Simulation with Eta Carinae A and B as black dots and lighter colors showing denser stellar winds.\nStars larger than eight times the mass of the sun end their life in supernovae explosions. We know much less about stars 15 times larger, but suspect they put on quite a show and Eta Carinae A may be ready to blow.']	['<urn:uuid:38a181de-3661-4905-8465-3b01aaded27d>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	14	45	525
2	i do martial arts need to know how elbow joint works attacks and injuries common techniques general overview help	The elbow joint is a hinge joint that consists of three bones - the humerus (upper arm) and radius/ulna (forearm), forming three joints. It permits flexion and extension only to a certain degree. In martial arts like Qin Na and BJJ, the elbow is commonly attacked through joint manipulation techniques. These include armlocks, where the opponent's arm is hyperextended between the legs while grabbing the wrist. When attacking the elbow joint by manipulating it against its natural range of motion, the tendons attaching muscle to bone are affected, causing pain that can be controlled by maintaining pressure. Elbow injuries are very common in martial arts (about 20% of injuries in BJJ competitions) and can affect the joint capsule, ligaments (UCL and RCL), and muscles (biceps, pronator teres, wrist flexors). Proper management of elbow injuries involves controlling pain/inflammation, restoring range of motion, increasing strength/endurance, and gradually returning to full functional performance.	"['Qin Na (Chin Na)\nThe Art of Seizing and Controlling\nQin Na is primarily known as the Chinese art of joint locking. Qin means to seize or catch and Na means to hold or control; so Qin Na is the art of seizing and controlling an opponent.\nAlthough Qin Na techniques can be found in most Chinese martial arts systems, one style above all others is renowned for its highly specialized application of Qin Na. This is Ying Zhao Fan Zi, better known in the West as Eagle Claw Kung Fu.\nA unique characteristic that renders added efficiency to the application of Qin Na techniques in Ying Zhao Fan Zi is the utilization of the hand formation for which the style is famous. This is the ""eagle claw"" (see picture). This anatomical hand shape represents the powerful talons of the king of birds and is ideal for applying the four major categories of Qin Na techniques.\n- Fen Jin: Separate the muscles\n- Cuo Cu: Misplace the bones\n- Bi Qi: Stop the breath\n- Dian Xue: Attack the vital points\nThe techniques in the Fen Jin category deal with separating the muscles. Throughout the body, muscles adjoin, meet and overlap. It is at these points that the eagle claw can be applied to separate the muscles by applying pressing and pulling pressure.\nFor example: The anterior forearm contains several adjoining muscles that are commonly attacked with Fen Jin techniques. Consider the Pronator Teres and the Flexor Carpi Radialis muscles; applying the eagle claw to separate these two muscles will cause severe pain (see picture).\nThe great body of techniques applied in Qin Na deal with those in the Cuo Cu category. These techniques are usually applied at the joints of the human body also known as articulations.\n- A joint is a place where two bones come together\n- A joint is classified based on the amount of movement it allows\n- The human body contains 360 joints\nThese joints are divided into six categories. The joints that can be most effectively attacked with Qin Na techniques are concentrated in the upper limbs: the wrist, the elbow and the shoulder. The lower limbs, thorax and throat also contain joints that are vulnerable to Qin Na techniques.\nWhen attacking a joint by manipulating it against its natural range of motion, the tendons that attach the muscle to the bone are also affected. This unnatural bending or twisting of the joint, combined with overstretched tendons, will cause pain. This pain can be controlled by maintaining or increasing the pressure that is applied against the joint.\nFor example: The elbow joint is known as a “hinge joint,” which only permits flexion and extension and then only to a certain degree. When pressure is applied against the opponent’s normal elbow function, pain is administered and control is quickly gained. (see picture)\nThe techniques of Bi Qi (stop or seal the breath) form a minor category in Qin Na. These are specialized techniques that attack the breathing passages, namely, the pharynx (the throat) and the trachea (the windpipe or ""Adam’s Apple”). The application of these techniques often also damages the larynx (voice box).\nWhile some Bi Qi techniques involve arm chokes, Ying Zhao Fan Zi specializes in the use of the eagle claw to attack the throat and crush the windpipe. The claw is usually combined with a joint lock to give added control and leverage.\nFor example: The windpipe is attacked and crushed with an eagle claw to seal the airway while an elbow immobilization lock is simultaneously applied. The lock renders futile any resistance while the claw attack to the windpipe quickly restricts the airflow. (see picture)\nThe ability to attack the vital points is the acme of Dian Xue. This is considered the most advanced and secretive aspect of Qin Na.\nMany teachers are hesitant to teach these techniques and many masters take their secrets with them to the grave rather than risk passing on the knowledge to unscrupulous students.\nGrand Master Leung Shum taught the techniques only once, during the occasion of his 30th anniversary celebration, over an intensive training session for his most advanced students.\nThe categories of Qin Na techniques described above are drilled and refined through the practice of ""Yi Bai Ling Ba Qin Na,"" the famous 108 Locking Hands of Ying Zhao Fan Zi (Eagle Claw Kung Fu).\nQin Na is considered one of the four traditional fighting aspects of Chinese martial arts, which are Ti, Da, Shuai, and Na.\n- Ti (Kick)\n- Da (Strike)\n- Shuai (Throw)\n- Na (Seize)\nSince fighting occurs at long, medium, close and grappling range, a fighter needs to be well versed in all these aspects so as to not have any loopholes an opponent can take advantage of. Qin Na techniques are excellent for close in and grappling range and will round out your fighting skills.\nThe effective application of Qin Na techniques requires repeated practice with different partners and a thorough knowledge of the human muscular, skeletal and nervous systems. It is this knowledge that allows for the efficient application of techniques without relying on brute force.\nThe effective application of Qin Na techniques causes severe pain, and pain is a great lever for controlling an adversary. Qin Na is considered a high level martial art since one is able to bring the opponent under control without seriously incapacitating him.', 'I have been working with International Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Federation for the last 14 years covering tournaments in the entire Western region of the United States. I have been privileged to have the opportunity, and over the years, I have seen a lot of injuries. My day is only busy when someone gets hurt or has been hurt and they are looking for information on how to manage their problem are. One of the most common areas that I get questions about is the elbow. It’s also the area of the body that is most frequently injured in competition (roughly 20% of the injuries we see). But the injuries are not always directly related to competition but also to training. This article will discuss elbow injuries, how to manage them, and how to prevent them.\nAn armbar, or armlock, is one of the most basic jiu-jitsu maneuvers, and usually one of the first submissions taught to you in class. It’s a submission attempt whereby the opponent wraps their legs around your armpit and neck from the front side while holding your arm between their legs in a hyperextended position. The lever arm is increased by grabbing the wrist and driving the hips up toward the ceiling. It can cause pain at any part of the elbow, but most commonly the pain is the medial (inside) part of the elbow.\nWith the nature of the sport, gripping is a necessity to performance. Many successful jiu-jitsu practitioners discuss the importance of grip strength. Having good strength here may prevent your opponent or training partner from getting away from you. Gripping requires strength in your forearm and wrist flexors (muscles of the inside of the elbow), but also requires your wrist extensors (muscles on the outside of the elbow). It is also a normal human activity in which we grasp, push, and pull with for everyday undertakings.\nThe bone of the elbow consist of the humerus (upper arm bone) and the radius and ulna (forearm bones). These three bones also make up three joints in the elbow. All of these bones are considered long bones which means they can be used to provide leverage in the case when you get caught in an armlock. The motion that happens among these bones can be significant enough to affect all the way down into your wrist.\nThe ligaments hold the bones together along with the joint capsule. These two structures often blend together seamlessly. These structures are known as static restraints, meaning that they provide stability when no motion is happening. The ligaments of the elbow are primarily on the inside and outside of the elbow. On the outside, you have the radial collateral ligament (RCL) and the annular ligament. This annular ligament wraps around the radial head to allow you to turn your palm up and down like you are waving. The RCL provides stability to any forces that would push laterally (outwardly). The biggest ligament, and arguably the most important, is the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL). This ligament connects the humerus and ulna together and is very broad and long when compared to the RCL. It prevents force moving medially. This is the area of the elbow that is particularly vulnerable to armlocks and even Americana armlocks.\nWhen armlocks occurs, it can also damage the muscular complex around the elbow. Flexion and extension (bending and extending) of the elbow after an armlock is often quite painful if damage happens but can also affect pronation and supination (turning palm down and palm up). When there is damage to the muscle or tendon complex, it can generate a muscle strain/pull or tendinopathy. These muscles create and can control motion at the elbow. These are known as dynamic restraints which means they provide stability when motion is occurring. When an armlock is applied, the muscle that are affected will likely be the biceps brachii, pronator teres, or other wrist flexors. This can also be dependent on the hand position and what is going on at the shoulder during the attack. For instance, if you are placed in a position where you shoulder is also extended behind you, a large amount of tension is placed through the long head of the biceps at the shoulder as it is being tensioned down at the elbow by the attack (shown right). Gripping activities or wrist extension will affect the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis and extensor digitorum (wrist extensors). These are affected by overtraining or profound changes in your training schedule.\nMechanism of Injury\nThere are two primary mechanisms for elbow injuries in jiu-jitsu: the armlock and tendinopathy injuries due to unaccustomed activities/overtraining. Besides direct trauma, the tendon injuries happen from multiple causes. In men, it is frequent to see tendon injuries at the lateral elbow which is commonly referred to as “tennis elbow.” This can be due to muscle tightness in the elbow, wrist or hand, a recent change in training schedule, work ergonomics, or typing on a computer.\nWith the armlock, if your opponent is able to take the arm into the position of elbow extension and your thumb facing straight upward, then there is a risk of damage to the elbow joint capsule and elbow flexors (biceps brachii, brachialis, and brachioradialis). If your opponent moves your elbow into extension and then turns your palm upward, it makes it harder to finish the submission but does stress the medial (inside) part of the elbow. Then there is risk of damage at the UCL and pronator teres muscle. Lastly, if your opponent moves your elbow into extension and then turns your palm down, it also is harder to finish the submission and stresses the lateral (outside) part of the elbow. Then there is risk of damage at the RCL and lateral elbow muscles.\nWith such a submission, and the long lever force that is generated, there is an inherent potential for both fractures and dislocations. A dislocation can be more obvious because of the large deformity that usually exists, while a fracture can be less obvious. The only way you will know a fracture is to seek a physician consult for imaging study. The rule of thumb for fractures is when in doubt, go get it looked at. For both of these situations, medical intervention should be received for proper injury management to be certain there is no nerve damage or laxity (increased motion) into the elbow joint.\nIf the serious injuries, like dislocation and fracture, have been ruled out, then the injury can likely be managed conservatively. The worst thing you can do is ignore the injury. Most of these elbow injuries can be managed conservatively with four simple steps. It is best to implement these steps immediately and progressively, and if your problem exists without improvement beyond 7-10 days, then seek medical attention or your nearest physical therapy specialist for a thorough assessment. This may include assessing the pin levels and even using wearable body sensors.\n1. Control the pain and inflammation – Training should be halted here, or significantly modified, until these are under control. This can be achieved simply by applying ice to the area. Inflammation control is important because it creates muscle inhibition (makes muscles harder to function appropriately). Although inflammation is a necessary role for the body to heal correctly, excessive amounts are thought to prolong the recovery time. So early intervention is the best intervention here!! With ice, you can apply it to the injured area for 15-20 minutes only. Any longer than that and you risk making the inflammation worst. (This is a shout out to everyone who keeps ice on for an hour. Don’t do it!) If the elbow injury is severe enough, using a sling or elbow strap may be necessary for a short time to remove additional stresses to the injured elbow to reduce the pain and inflammation.\n2. Restore range of motion and increase muscle activation – Training should still be halted or modified here, but you should be attending class and work on the psychological part of your training. Mindfulness and meditation can be extremely beneficial here. It will also build team camaraderie. Range of motion can be achieved by simple range of motion movements by flexing and extending the elbow and also turning your palm up and down at the wrist repeatedly throughout the day. You do want to work within your comfort zone but know that bending and extending will be the most uncomfortable to start. So, go slow! If the movements produce big spikes in pain again, then you are likely going too far and need to back off. As your range of motion improves, then using a light hand weight or light resistance band to perform the same motions will work well. Proprioception, or joint position sense, is also imperative to retrain at this point. This can be achieved by assuming a push up position and holding for thirty seconds to one minute. You can take some of the load away by going onto your knees or doing this push up position on the wall. If it is painful, then it is likely too soon to do this. This needs to be done repeatedly throughout the day, working up to one to two minutes at a time.\nFor those that have lateral elbow pain with gripping, stretching the wrist flexors and hand muscles are very important. The wrist flexors get tight from the activities we do daily plus grabbing in jiu-jitsu. Wrist flexor stretches can be done by simply grasping your fingers with your opposite hand and pulling back while your elbow is straight. Another stretch that works great for this is called a lumbrical stretch. First make a hook grip with your fingers, use your opposite hand to extend your fingers over your big knuckles. You should feel this stretching into the palm of your hand. Hold for at least 30 seconds.\n3. Increase your strength and endurance – Training can start here but still be careful with who you train with and make them aware of your injury. The elbow muscles need to function appropriately to provide muscular stability and control to the injured elbow. If there is still inflammation, this can inhibit muscles from working, and then they must be retrained. Or they may not reactivate. Running can offer cardiovascular benefits, but muscular endurance of the elbow can be trained with loading activities (push-ups, hand walking, and pull-ups to name a few). Strengthening of the elbow can be achieved by progressing the resistance bands and hand weights to improve elbow flexion and extension strength and endurance. Don’t forget about pronation and supination. This can also be achieved by doing more big movement activities like push up variations which require more force production. But remember, never sacrifice QUALITY of movement for quantity. We often will recommend repeated movements for time rather than a number of reps. This way the focus is on the quality. Start slow and controlled and progress to faster but always use correct technique.\nFor those that have lateral elbow pain with gripping, strengthening the wrist extensors with resistance bands and hand weights work well. Usually doing reps of 15-20 of #1-5 bands works well to address both strength and endurance of the lateral elbow muscles. You can also use a dowel with a weighted rope to address the strength in this area. And if you have one available, doing battle ropes up and down work great for the entire shoulder complex and wrist extensors with an overhand grip. Do this for 30 seconds to one minute and you will feel these muscles working.\n4. Increase your functional performance – At this point, you should be feeling great and have already been back to rolling and training. The light is at the end of the tunnel, but you are not quite there yet! This stage is the longest and the easiest for people to stop because they are feeling much better. You need to continue to address overall strength with complex movement activities like plyo push-ups, burpees, and plyo-ball exercises. You can progress from two arm activities to one handed loading activities, which will also challenge your core muscles. It is very important to continue working the proprioceptive of training with faster movements on your hands and dynamic stabilization activities. The more stable you are, the more efficient you will move.\nA delay in treatment often leads to extended healing times and lost time with training and rolling. So get treatment right away to achieve the best outcome. If your injury does not progressively improve, you will need to seek intervention consult with a sports/orthopedic physician and/or physical therapist to properly rehabilitate this injury. Improper management of your injury will increase your risk of future injury. So finding a specialist to tend to your injury is very important in the long run. The specialist will be able to work with you and guide you toward the best outcome to match your goals.\nRisk Reduction – Prevention\nWe know that the number one predictor for injury in jiu-jitsu is a previous injury. As mentioned previously, the ligaments and capsule are static restraints and the muscles and tendons are dynamic restraints. When both function as\nrequired, good stability, motion, and strength at the joint can occur. However, if one or all of these structures are damaged in some way or do not function properly, then there is an increased risk to the joint and therefore for that athlete. Ligament laxity/damage can lead to an impaired joint motion, whether if it moves too much or not enough. This is where strength training and proprioceptive training are very important to continue. The same elements described in “Management” can be applied, particularly steps three and four. If you implement these into your training regimen, then you should see a significant reduction in your own risk of injury and less down time when you do get injured. Also, seeing a movement specialist to identify potential risk factors can be even more beneficial to look for these and then address them.\nWhen it comes to jiu-jitsu, elbow injuries are the most commonly seen in competition. This information cannot necessarily be extrapolated to everyone who trains, but the rate is higher than everywhere else in the body. After an elbow injury, it’s possible to get back quickly by incorporating early intervention strategies for the injury, which often leads to better and faster outcomes. Strength training to regain muscle function and proprioceptive training to controlthe elbow are necessary for recovery. If not, you increase your risk of injury. When exercising, always stay in control. Start slow and progress to quicker movements. Remember that recovery is also an important part of functional performance so listen to your body. If you are feeling tired, then take a rest recovery day. And if your elbow injury is not progressing as it should, seek consult from your physical therapy specialist and/or physician to help get you on track and back to the mats as fast as possible. He/she will be able to give you quick recommendations and intervention after a thorough assessment to get you back quickly. Stay healthy… and see you on the mats!!!']"	['<urn:uuid:4622fe80-5948-4b7f-ba28-706d5f8f8f66>', '<urn:uuid:03296fa5-fd5c-4818-838a-553219c9849a>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	19	150	3440
3	energy savings difference triple pane led windows	LED lights provide significant energy savings using 90% less energy than traditional bulbs, while triple pane windows offer enhanced insulation and protection against elements but have much higher upfront costs that take about 20 years to recover through energy savings.	"['If you are looking for ways to cut back on your household bills, you might be surprised to note that making a few changes around your home could make a big difference. By making your property more energy efficient, you can reduce your energy consumption, saving you a good chunk of money, and helping the planet in the process. Here are 6 ways to make your property more energy efficient.\nReplace your lightbulbs\nIf you don’t already use LED light bulbs, you could save a lot of money by switching. LED’s use around 10% of the energy of a traditional incandescent and around 85% less than halogen. Even compared to CFL (compact fluorescent lamp) bulbs, which were the first energy-efficient alternative, you will use a whopping 40% less energy. Depending on the size of your home, that could result in a pretty noticeable annual cost saving.\nSwitching lights off when not in use will also reduce the amount of electricity you consume, so it’s another worthwhile change. If you tend to forget to switch the lights off, another option is to add timers or have motion sensor lighting fitting.\nDouble glaze your windows\nIf your home generally feels quite cold, it could be down to heat escaping through your windows and cold getting in. This issue is usually more severe in older properties that have single glazed windows. Although it might not be cheap, switching to double glazing is something to consider.\nAir is removed from the two panes of window glass, creating a vacuum that acts as a natural insulator. This insulator stops the circulation of air and reduces convection, which in turn reduces heat loss across the window.\nMany double-glazed units are made with a layer of gas inside instead of a vacuum, which increases the insulation even further. If you live in a particularly windy area or an upper-level apartment, for example, triple glazing will provide an additional layer of protection against the elements.\nHave solar panels fitted\nSolar panels (sometimes referred to as PV panels) are produced by adding lots of photovoltaic (PV) cells to a metal glass cased panel. The panels then convert sunlight into electricity, which then powers your home. Solar panels are usually fitted on the roof of your property and, compared to a standard electricity supply, could save you a lot of money in the long term. This renewable source of energy is not only cheaper but far better for the environment.\nMany states run incentive schemes, which can bring installation costs down substantially. For example, Oregon solar incentives allow homeowners in the greater Portland area to lower the upfront costs associated with having a new energy system installed. Energy suppliers will give a rebate to the solar installer, which will then be passed to the homeowner by way of a reduction in installation fees. The level of rebate is likely to differ depending on how many panels you are looking to have fitted. It’s a great way to reduce your month to month costs and will help to increase the energy efficiency of your home.\nHas your boiler seen better days?\nBoilers can be expensive to replace but, if yours is fairly old, it is unlikely to be working as efficiently as it should be. This is likely to result in higher energy bills and an increased carbon footprint. A new boiler will be far more energy efficient and could save you a fairly hefty sum on your energy bills each year.\nNew boilers also tend to be smaller and far less noisy, so if it something you have been considering for a while, speak to a gas safety approved engineer and find out how a new boiler could benefit your household.\nMake things easier with a smart thermostat\nIf you don’t already have a smart thermostat, you don’t know what you are missing! If you regularly forget to turn your heating off or are sick of coming home to a freezing house, this could be the gadget you have been waiting for.\nA smart thermostat works by using an app that can be controlled from your phone regardless of your location. Timers can be set, heating can be switched on and off, and temperatures adjusted as you please. Most boilers will come with a thermostat that has a timer function; however, a smart thermostat takes the flexibility you have to another level.\nMany systems will also remember your heating preferences and can be set to automatically adjust the temperate of your home to suit your usual needs. Smart thermostats can be fitted retrospectively, which makes the switch a fairly simple one.\nInsulate your loft\nIf your loft isn’t insulated or the existing insulation is old or thinning, it is worthwhile having new insulation fitted. The good news is it’s a pretty simple task that most people can do on their own. The thicker the loft insulation the more energy and money you will save, so it’s worthwhile spending a bit extra and getting insulation which is at least 270mm thick. This thickness alone could save you upwards of 14% on your heating bills each year.\nLoft insulation is purchased in rolls that cover a certain square area, so calculate what you need and then buy the required thickness. New insulation can be placed directly on top of old, so there is no need to remove anything. It is quite fibrous, so wear protective gloves when handling the insulation and wear a mask over your mouth.\nIf you want to use your loft as a storage area, then you should use loft storage boards. These are pre-cut lengths of wood that are elevated on plastic feet and screwed into the joists. This will ensure that there is a gap between your insulation and your loft boards and will allow air to circulate. It is not a good idea to pack your loft full of belongings as this can affect the energy efficiency, so keep it to a minimum and, where possible, store your belongings elsewhere instead.', 'COST AND ENERGY SAVINGS - Home : ENERGY STAR\nENERGY STAR® FOR WINDOWS, DOORS, AND SKYLIGHTS COST AND ENERGY SAVINGS: National, Regional, and City Estimates, Factoids, and Their Use.

4	What job did Reed have during the Civil War?	Reed served as chief bugler of the 9th Massachusetts Light Battery and later, starting in November of 1864, worked as an assistant to the topographical engineer under General Gouverneur K. Warren at V Corps headquarters.	['By Shawn Connery, Army Heritage and Education CenterMay 7, 2009\nDuring the first week of June 1865, like many of the volunteers who fought for the preservation of the Union, Private Charles Wellington Reed was heading home. Beginning with his enlistment into the 9th Massachusetts Light Battery in 1862, he would be swept by the tides of war from the horrors of Gettysburg to the wilds of the Wilderness, and eventually to Appomattox, Virginia, where he would witness the surrender of Confederate forces to General Ulysses S. Grant. It was on the fields of Abraham TrostleAca,!a,,cs farm in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where Reed would save the life of his commanding officer, Captain John Bigelow, earning him the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1895. During those years as chief bugler of his battery and (starting in November of 1864) as an assistant to the topographical engineer under General Gouverneur K. Warren at V Corps headquarters, Reed related his experiences in the war not only in letters home but in sketches and drawings of the people, places, and events he witnessed . It is through these letters and sketches that future generations are granted an extraordinary glimpse into the daily life of this individual soldier.\nAfter the war, Reed served as a lieutenant in the Massachusetts militia. He entered into a liquor distribution business with his father-in-law and, in 1880, purchased a home for himself and his wife, Rebecca Francis Farwell Reed. It was here that Reed began to re-ignite his artistic talents and turned to painting as a means of recounting his days in the Civil War. Many of his sketchbooks, drawings, and paintings were donated to the Library of Congress two years after his death in 1926. However, two of the watercolor paintings produced by Reed are now housed within the collections of the Military History Institute at the Army Heritage & Education Center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.\nIn 1974, the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States gave a large portion of its collections of books, manuscripts, artifacts, photographs, paintings, and drawings to MHI. The collection of over 40,000 photos was one of the most comprehensive holdings of surviving Civil War images. Found within this collection are two, 20Aca,!A?x15Aca,!A?, watercolor paintings by Reed, depicting two Civil War scenes. The first portrays a Federal artillery battery in action during a battle. Smoke fills the air over the scene of artillery soldiers sheltered behind a stone fence along a tree line. The second shows a Union General, sword raised, urging his brave infantrymen into battle. A small white clover design found on one of the soldierAca,!a,,cs hats signifies the scene as one from a charge conducted by soldiers belonging to the Second Division of the Second Army Corps. While the papers show signs of age, ReedAca,!a,,cs paintings are in fairly good condition considering that they are at least 130 years old. Preservation will assist in hindering any further damage to the support papers, and proper handling and storage within the museum collections of the Army Heritage & Education Center will ensure Charles Wellington ReedAca,!a,,cs works will continue to benefit future generations of Soldiers and of professional and amateur historians.\nABOUT THIS STORY: Many of the sources presented in this article are among 400,000 books, 1.7 million photos and 12.5 million manuscripts available for study through the U.S. Army Military History Institute (MHI). The artifacts shown are among nearly 50,000 items of the Army Heritage Museum (AHM) collections.

5	Being interested in Finland's commitment to sustainability, I wonder how the country combines its reputation as the world's happiest nation with environmental protection - what specific measures do they take in forest management and public transportation?	Finland demonstrates its commitment to sustainability through multiple approaches. In forest management, they have strict regulations including mandatory forest use declarations, protection of biodiversity, and over 90% of commercial forests are certified under PEFC and FSC schemes. This is complemented by an excellent public transportation system - clean and comfortable trains run by Valtion Rautatiet, extensive express coach lines, and efficient bus services in cities with departures every 10-15 minutes. These sustainable practices contribute to Finland's high quality of life, helping it earn its status as the world's happiest country.	"['Dubbed as the ""poor man\'s pharmacy,"" there are more saunas than cars in Finland.\nFinland is on Eastern European Standard Time (GMT +2). Without calculating for daylight savings, it’s roughly 2 hours ahead of London, and 7 hours ahead of New York City.\nFinland is a member of the Schengen Agreement, so check Schengen Visa for details on various types of visas you may need. To enter and travel around Finland, U.S. citizens are required to have an approved ETIAS visa waiver.\nIn addition, you may enter for Finland for up to 90 days for tourist purposes without a visa. For more details on travel into and within Schengen countries, please see our fact sheet.\nPlanning a trip to Finland means that you’ll most likely land in Helsinki Airport since it’s the country’s largest hub out of 27 airports. But for heading to Lapland, Rovaniemi is the airport you’d want to arrive in. From here, you can also travel to Northwest Russia, Northern Sweden and Norway.\nSince Finland has one of the best public transportation systems, you don’t need to rent a car to get around.\nBY TRAIN: The trains are clean and comfortable, even if you have to take an overnight train traveling from Helsinki to Lapland (Kolari station,) or from Helsinki to Rovaniemi requires approximately about 8 hours. Valtion Rautatiet runs Finnish trains. It’s a fast and efficient service, with prices roughly equivalent to buses on the same route. VR’s website offers comprehensive timetable information, and major stations have ticket machines. Tickets can also be purchased online, where there are discounted advance fares. You can board and pay the conductor, but if the station where you boarded had ticket-purchasing facilities, you’ll be charged a small penalty fee (€2 to €5). The main types of trains are the high-speed Pendolino (the fastest and most expensive class), fast Intercity (IC), Express and 2nd-class-only Regional trains (H on the timetable). Eurail and InterRail each offer their own “Country” and “Global” passes, which offer travel within 28-30 European countries. Be sure to check out the websites for eligibility and discount information.\nBY FERRY / BOAT: There are many ferry lines (Viking, Tallink, Finnlines…etc.) traveling over the Baltic Sea, between Finland, Estonia and Russia.\nBY BUS: There are also many express coach lines (Matkahuolto, Onnibus, ExpressBus) that can reach from big cities to smaller villages and towns. Departures range from every 10 to 15 minutes in cities, and every 30 to 60 minutes in small towns. Fares keep around €2.50 to €3.50 and payment goes directly to the driver.\nBY CAR: During summertime, renting a car and driving through Finland offers beautiful scenery around the way. During winter months, however, it’s not recommended to rent a car if you’re not familiar with snowy and slippery roads. Finland follows right-handed traffic, and headlights must be turned on at all times. Caution must be taken since elks and reindeer that are active during evenings and wander freely on the roads. The taxi (taksi) in Finland is more expensive, particularly for short rides. There’s an initial charge of €3.90 in Helsinki (often more elsewhere) with a minimum of €7 and a per-kilometre charge of up to €1.09. Fares increase with 4 or more passengers, and there’s a surcharge for night and weekend services.\nFinland is very safe for female solo travelers, since the country has low crime rates and locals are extremely hospitable. It is statistically the least dangerous place on Earth, and was recently rated the happiest country worldwide. However, you should always follow normal travel rules, and guard your bags, wallets and other personal effects.\nThe Finns are extremely friendly, so anytime you feel like you’re in danger or need help, locals will be more than willing to assist.\nFinland also ranks first in reliable police services. The average pickup time for emergency calls is 5 seconds. To get a hold of police, fire and ambulance services, be sure to contact the emergency number 112.\nThe weather in Finland is quite diverse. In fact, the country is considered to have both a maritime and continental climate.\nIf you love winter activities, then December to March is the best period to visit Finland. If you prefer spring activities, then aim for April and May. The warmest month in Finland is typically July, and the coldest is February.\nFinland’s weather is variable and can change very quickly, which is common for weather in Scandinavia.\nThese are the estimated local temperatures according to seasons:\n- Spring: 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius)\n- Summer: 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius)\n- Autumn: 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12 degrees Celsius)\n- Winter: -45°C to -50°C in Lapland, -35°C to -45°C in other regions.\nWinters are long and cold. In northern parts of Finland, you can find snow on the ground for upwards of 90 days each year. This weather is perfect if your bucket list entails visiting reindeer farms, steaming in saunas nestled into snow-capped mountains, or viewing the northern lights. The mildest weather in winter is found in southwestern Finland, amongst the countless islands in the Baltic Sea.\nFinnish is the first official language of Finland, spoken by 93% of the country’s 5 million inhabitants. It’s renowned as one of the most difficult languages to learn since it’s theoretically related to Hungarian, but locals speak English in most tourist areas. As opposed to other Scandinavian countries that have similar Germanic roots, the Finnish language is closer to Russian than it is to Swedish, Norwegian or Danish.\nSwedish is spoken by around 6% of the population, most of whom live in the southwest.\nSámi is a minority language in the Nordic countries which is spoken by around 2,000 people in the north of Finland, making up about 0.03% of the population.\nHere are a few basic words and phrases to learn:\nHello = Hei (pronounced “hey”)\nGoodbye = Hei Hei (“hey hey”)\nYes = Kyllä (ku-yu-la)\nNo = Ei (pronounced like the letter “a”)\nThank you = Kiitos\nYou are welcome = Ei kestä\nExcuse me = Anteeksi (sounds like “aun-taxi”)\nMy name is … = Nimeni on … (“knee-many on”)\nNice to meet you = Hauska tavata\nHotel = Hotelli\nAirport = Lentokenttä\nTrain = Juna\nBus = Bussi\nSubway = Metro\nTicket = Lippu (“leap-o”)\nBefore you head to Finland, understand these local customs:\n- Finland is an easy country to visit. Customs and manners are clearly European, with only a few national variations, and attitudes are generally liberal.\n- Finland is considered Nordic, rather than Scandinavian. It may share major social values with other Scandinavian countries but there are subtle differences.\n- When greeting one another, Finns shake hands and make eye contact. Handshakes are brief and firm, and involve no supporting gestures. Embracing people when greeting them is rare.\n- In Finland, both men and women bathe in the sauna, but never together except within the family. There are no mixed public saunas in Finland. A visitor hesitant to try a sauna should remember that if it has been heated specifically for him or her, it is considered rude to refuse (unless they have legitimate medical constraints).\n- Finns are very modest and don’t call themselves out to attention, so try not to interrupt in conversations and don’t be too loud.\n- The Finnish society is egalitarian, so there are many words that are gender-neutral. If you’re introduced to a couple, always greet the female first.\n- Saunas are part of the local way of life, similar to onsen in Japan, even business meetings can be conducted in saunas at times.\nFinland’s unit of currency is Euros. Though the most common use of payment is via debit or credit cards, there are plenty of ATMs—especially in the cities—and most machines will accept cards issued by major international banks. US, UK and Australian cards are widely accepted in Finnish hotels, restaurants, stores and markets. Visa, Mastercard and Maestro are most common, and American Express is accepted in most places as well.\nAs a rule, service is included in restaurant bills. Therefore, tipping has never fitted very comfortably into the Finnish way of life. You can feel safe that while nobody will object, very few will mind not being tipped.\nTipping! Restaurants typically include a service charge so tipping isn’t necessary. Always check the bill and you can always tip more for excellent service but it is not expected.\nLike the rest of Europe, Finland uses one of the two European standard electrical socket types, with voltage of 220-240 Volts (U.S./Canada are 110-120 Volts.) Your converter should look like one of these:\nTap water in Finland is considered to be among the healthiest in the world, and needs no treatment in most areas. It is available almost anywhere free of charge.\nMost hotels, bars, restaurants will offer free WiFi.\nIn addition to being optimally safe and happy, Finland also happens to be one of the most gay-friendly places on the map.\nHomosexuality has been decriminalized since 1971, and gay marriage has been legal since 2017, so most of the locals are accepting of the LGBTQ+ community.\nHelsinki Pride’s 100,000+ annual attendees are a testament to the country’s thriving queer scene.\nFor added assurance, though, you can look for Gay Travel Finland’s We Speak Gay certification, which is granted only to companies that have proven to be inclusive to LGBTQ+ customers.\nFinland is possibly one of the most eco-friendly destinations to visit, especially with its low population paired with nature conservation for its beautiful landscape.\nRussia and Sweden become religious and trade rivals on Finnish territory.\nHelsinki is named the capital of Finland.\nWood saunas become popular in the country.\nNOKIA is established as a pulp mill company.\nThe Russian Revolution allows Finland to declare its independence.\nWomen of Finland become the first in Europe who are granted the right to vote.\nKorvatunturi is disclosed as the location of Santa’s “secret workshop.”\nThe Olympic Games are held in Helsinki.\nFinland joins the United Nations and Nordic Council.\nFinland becomes a member of the European Union.\nFinland elects its youngest prime minister in history, Sanna Marin.', 'Sustainable forest management in Finland\nForests have played an important role in the Finnish history. Finnish forests have provided food, shelter, employment and income for the Finns through centuries. Most of the Finnish forests are in commercial use. Commercial forest are not only utilised but also regenerated. Finnish forests grow more than they are being harvested and the growth has increased significantly through the last 50 years. The growth and evolution of forests in Finland is mainly the result of good and long-term forest management.\nWhat guides forest management\nThe Forest Act provides a framework for forest management in Finland. The leading principle of the forest legislation has been the obligation to regenerate after logging. The inception of Forest Act in 1997 (revised again in 2014) raised multi-functionality to a key driver in forest management, emphasizing safeguarding of ecological sustainability as well as promotion of diverse use of forests, landscape management and water protection.\nThe Forest Act requires that the forest owner delivers a mandatory forest use declaration before felling. Forest use declarations are monitored by a competent authority. The forest use declaration is a way to make sure that environmentally important values are considered in the management of forests. The declaration is also the core of the control system in the EU Timber Regulation, the purpose of which is to prevent the entry of illegally produced timber on the EU market. The Forest Act also obligates that forests shall be managed and used in such a manner that the conditions for the preservation of habitats important for the biological diversity of forests are safeguarded.\nIn addition, Best Practice Guidelines for sustainable forestry that are based on national research on forests provide extra tools to sustainable forest management over requirements of the legislation, including biomass harvesting for bioenergy production. The guidelines have been successfully implemented to private forestry.\nHabitats protected under the Natura 2000 network form the basis for forest protection. The habitats are protected e.g. under Nature Conservation, Forest, and Wilderness Acts. There are several country-wide forest protection programs, such as programs for old forests, herb-rich forests and eskers. The network of protected areas consists of national parks, strict nature reserves, protection program areas etc.\nThe Forest Biodiversity Action Program METSO supplements legislation-based protection by providing landowners a voluntary tool for both permanent and temporary forest protection in Southern Finland. The goal is to protect permanently 96 000 ha forests via METSO by 2025. Almost 90% of the target is reached today. Helmi habitats program, which started 2019, complements METSO in increasing habitat restoration and conservation of other habitat types than forests.\nForest management in Finland today\nForest data has been gathered in Finland for 100 years. The National Forest Inventory (NFI) data is based on statistical sampling and a new inventory of forest resources is implemented every 5-10 years. Accurate forest data is the base for planning forest management activities.\nUntil 2014 commercial forests were managed with an even aged structure because of legislation. Sustainable forest management in Finland concentrates on finding a balance between economic, social and environmental aspects. These are also the basic pillars for the two forest certification schemes PEFC and FSC that are actively used in Finland. Over ninety percent of Finnish commercial forests are certified under these schemes.\nDeforestation in Finland has been rather small-scaled and caused by agriculture and infrastructure building. The successful forest industry has laid the foundation for forests to remain forests. Forests have been and will continue to be managed sustainably and actively. Furthermore, the number of natural disasters in forests has been small compared to several European countries as a result of climate conditions and good forest management.']"	['<urn:uuid:5170cfc0-5706-4ec2-92d1-09e5c8c71452>', '<urn:uuid:6ad5d7e9-5f35-4cdc-af69-6ce0e61c671d>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	36	90	2297
6	nature imagery comparison darkling thrush lake isle innisfree poems describe	The poems use contrasting nature imagery. The Darkling Thrush depicts a bleak winter landscape with 'spectre-grey' frost and 'tangled bine-stems'. In contrast, The Lake Isle of Innisfree presents idyllic natural elements like 'nine bean-rows', 'honey-bee', cricket songs, and 'midnight's all a glimmer', creating a more peaceful pastoral setting.	['The Darkling Thrush by Thomas Hardy: Summary and Analysis\nI leant upon a coppice gate\nWhen Frost was spectre-grey,\nAnd Winter’s dregs made desolate\nThe weakening eye of day.\nThe tangled bine-stems scored the sky\nLike strings of broken lyres,\nAnd all mankind that haunted nigh\nHad sought their household fires.\nThe land’s sharp features seemed to be\nThe Century’s corpse outleant,\nHis crypt the cloudy canopy,\nThe wind his death-lament.\nThe ancient pulse of germ and birth\nWas shrunken hard and dry,\nAnd every spirit upon earth\nSeemed fervourless as I.\nAt once a voice arose among\nThe bleak twigs overhead\nIn a full-hearted evensong\nOf joy illimited;\nAn aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,\nIn blast-beruffled plume,\nHad chosen thus to fling his soul\nUpon the growing gloom.\nSo little cause for carolings\nOf such ecstatic sound\nWas written on terrestrial things\nAfar or nigh around,\nThat I could think there trembled through\nHis happy good-night air\nSome blessed Hope, whereof he knew\nAnd I was unaware.\nStarting With the Poem\nWritten in 1899, The Darkling Thrush is very much a reflection of Hardy’s troubled conscience, torn between the insecurity posed by revolutionary religious assertions and a faint belief in the resurrection of mankind.\nThe poem marks the termination of two significant events – the decline of the Victorian age with its religious beliefs, agrarian society and the end of Hardy’s career as a novelist. The critical reception of two of his novels, “The Tess of the d’Urbervilles” (1891) and “Jude the Obscure” (1895), led Hardy turn towards poetry as means of self-expression. Moreover, the decay of agricultural society brought about by relentless Industrialization, along with the abatement of religious beliefs by Darwin’s revolutionary assertion on evolution, made him sceptical like his contemporaries, Mathew Arnold, and Tennyson. This explains the reason behind the other title, “By Century’s Deathbed,” the poem had, when it was published on December 29, by a weekly newspaper called “The Graphic.”\nLeaning “upon” a gate that opens into the woods (coppice gate), Hardy makes a short estimation of his surrounding; “Frost” appears “ghost-like,” the already waning day is rendered lonely (desolate) by the last bite of winter (winter’s dregs). Along with this, the rising stems of shrubs resemble the “strings” of a “broken” harp (lyre). He further observes that on such a frighteningly “haunted” night, all mankind seems to huddle beside their “household” fires. The barren landscape evokes a deathlike feeling and in tune with the rapidly closing century, appears as its corpse that lies (outleant), within a tomb (crypt) of overhanging clouds. With the wind singing a mournful elegy (death lament), there is hardly any note of rejuvenation, and even the seeds of spring, promising life, are shrunken hard. Consequently, the poet feels lifeless (fervourless). Suddenly the pervading gloom is interrupted by the vibrant (full-hearted) song of an aged and frail thrush. Since the bleak landscape could hardly be a source of inspiration for the bird’s “carolings,” the poet wonders what “blessed Hope” that he is unaware of, has inspired it.\nDesolation and Gloom\nRight from the very onset, the inescapable feeling is one of depression and loneliness. The landscape seems in anticipation of an impending doom, with “Frost” assuming the semblance of an unearthly spirit. It is a “haunted nigh,” and everyone is “fervourless.”\nHope amidst Despair\nThe thrush and its carefree song, embodying eternal hope, voice the poet’s belief in some betterment of the dreary situation.\nFour stanzas of eight lines\nThe rhyme scheme is ABABCDCD\nMood and Tone\nTill stanza 2, the poem bears a pessimistic tone, and the mood is meditative. With the emergence of the thrush in stanza 3, both the tone and mood become inspiring and hopeful.\nHardy is well-known for coining new words in his poems and several such “nonce words” that he create in this poem for maintaining its rhyme scheme, and meter are, “outleant,” “blast-beruffled,” and “spectre-gray.” Simultaneously, he also uses words of other poets such as “darkling,” (a term employed by Mathew Arnold In “Dover Beach” and John Keats in an “Ode to a Nightingale.” Besides these, the major portion of the poem is dominated by gloomy sounding words such as, “gray,” “dregs,” “desolate,” “broken,” and “haunted.” It is from stanza 3 that the words become a bit lively. For instance, in lines 5‑6 of Stanza 3, the domination of “b” sound in the words, “blast-beruffled,” intensifies the presence of the bird amidst the bleak surrounding.\n- The “aged thrush” symbolizes hope for the depressed mankind\n- The “tangled bine-stems” heighten the bleakness of the surrounding\nImage and Imagery\nIn the first half of the poem, most of the images are gray and grim. For instance, the lines, 3‑4, “And Winter’s dregs made desolate/The weakening eye of day,” create a picture of looming solitariness or the lines, 9‑12, “The land’s sharp features seemed to be/The Century’s corpse outleant,/His crypt the cloudy canopy,/The wind his death-lament.” establish an image of sorrow and futility. From stanza 3, the images tend to be bright as the poet remarks that the bird sings a “full-hearted evensong / of joy illimited.”\nFigures of Speech Used\n- In line 2, “Frost” is personified as someone having ghost-like features to develop the barren setting of the poem\n- In line 3, “Winter” is personified as someone responsible for increasing the isolation when the poet says,” And Winter’s dregs made desolate/The weakening eye of day.”\n- In line 10, the “Century” is personified as someone who’s dead, and his “corpse” is the arid land.\n- In line 31, “Hope” is personified to emphasize the ushering of something good despite morose circumstances.\n- In line 5,” The tangled bine-stems” are compared to “strings of broken lyres”\n- In line 15, “every spirit upon earth” is said to be as listless as the poet\nIn line 9 10, the “land” is said to resemble the “corpse” of the fast fading “Century.”\nIn lines 11‑12, the cloudy sky is said to be the tomb (crypt) of the “Century” and the winter wind is compared with the “death lament” sung for the departed “Century.”\n- Lines 1-2 – ‘At once, a voice arose among the bleak twigs overhead.’\n- Repetition of “k” sounds in the lines, Lines 1-7: “I leant upon a coppice gate … And all mankind that haunted nigh.”\nThe Darkling Thrush, apart from echoing the Victorian traits of being a lyric or having a moral objective, is also a fitting forerunner of Modernism, for, in dealing with loss, despair, and loneliness, it reflects a trend that was going to be explored more intensely by Eliot and Pound.\n- a note on critical analysis of the darkling thrush', 'One of my favorite poets is W.B. Yeats (you’re shocked, I know)—and one of my favorite of his poems is “The Lake Isle of Innisfree.” I’m not alone in liking this poem—in fact, for quite a few years, Irish schoolchildren were required to memorize it, as it is aesthetically beautiful and contains nationalist overtones.\nI’d like to share with you both the poem and my interpretation of some aspects of the poem.\n“The Lake Isle of Innisfree”\nby W.B. Yeats\nI will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,\nAnd a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made:\nNine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee;\nAnd live alone in the bee-loud glade.\nAnd I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,\nDropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;\nThere midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,\nAnd evening full of the linnet’s wings.\nI will arise and go now, for always night and day\nI hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;\nWhile I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,\nI hear it in the deep heart’s core.\nIt’s short and sweet, but we can say so much about it!\nHere’s what I have to say about this poem, in the context of the medieval Irish tradition of Green Martyrdom. This article was published in 2009 in Volume 26, Issue 1 of the Yeats-Eliot Review.\n“A Millennium’s Journey Into ‘The Deep Heart’s Core’:\nWilliam Butler Yeats’ ‘The Lake Isle of Innisfree’ and Green Martyrdom”\nby Maura Grace Harrington\nMost readers agree that the persona in William Butler Yeats’ “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” is longing for and celebrating his mental return to a bucolic setting, despite his physical presence in a modern city. First published in 1893 in Yeats’ second poetry collection, The Rose, the poem reflects the isolation and exile that the poet felt in his surroundings in London. He would feel more at home on a comparatively deserted island, Innisfree, likely based on the island of the same name in County Sligo, near where he grew up. Through his mind’s journeying to this place, where he can be alone and attain “some peace” (ln. 5), the persona of the poem hopes to fulfill a vocation that he “hear[s] in the deep heart’s core” (ln. 12). This poem carries universal meaning as a statement of an individual isolated by the hustle and bustle of modern urban life who wishes to return to the natural world and therefore to return to himself, in a Wordsworthian sense. However, the poem also has a particularly Irish flavor in its references to the medieval Irish practice of green martyrdom.\nBecause at the time of Ireland’s wholesale conversion to Christianity there was a dearth of opportunity for physical blood (or red) martyrdom, the faithful often sought other ways to make penitential sacrifices to God. Strongly influenced by the asceticism of St. Anthony of Egypt and of the desert fathers, who chose to deny themselves physically in order to grow spiritually, a crop of Irish hermits sprang up, secluding themselves in the wilderness in order to enhance their religious devotion. Poetry was written by the hermits themselves and by others about the hermits’ affinity with nature, as experienced through this green martyrdom. Though written in Irish, these poems have enjoyed frequent translation into English. The themes of peacefulness, order, slowness of pace, and an almost mystical natural beauty are evident in the medieval poems, and also find their way into Yeats’ “The Lake Isle of Innisfree.” Not only are the tropes and themes of the medieval poems updated for a modern audience through Yeats’ poem but the medieval and modern counterparts also share specific word choice and imagery, which indicates similarity in purpose and kinship in attitude and taste.\nDrawing out the similarities among three medieval poems, “The Hermitage” attributed to St. Manchan of Offaly and “The Hermit” and “The Hermit’s Song” by unknown writers, and comparing these to Yeats’ “The Lake Isle of Innisfree” will demonstrate that Yeats’ poem, though singularly beautiful, is by no means the first of its tradition in Irish poetry. Indeed, it is perhaps because Yeats so adeptly translates the controlling ideas in the earlier poems into those suited to a modern audience that ever since the work’s composition, this poem has been so highly esteemed as representative of its nation of origin. The three medieval poems focus on the benefits to the Christian faith of experiencing nature, although the speaker in “The Hermit’s Song” does not explicitly invoke God. While Yeats’ poem includes no direct reference to God, the poem’s other components, when taken together, indicate, as do the three medieval poems, a desire to retreat to nature in order to experience peace, order, a slowing down, and nature’s beauty and plenitude, all of which phenomena are considered, in the medieval poems and in the Irish Christian tradition generally, as stepping-stones to the experience of God.\nPerhaps the logical place to embark on an investigation into the similarities among the poems is at the beginning of these works. In all cases, early in the poems the speakers describe the physical habitations that they will enjoy in their retreats into the wilderness. All of the personae describe humble dwellings, some of which are constructed by nature itself, others of which are constructed from unadulterated natural materials. Yeats’ speaker, for example, will construct “a small cabin…of clay and wattles” (ln. 2). The simplicity of the edifices that will protect the retreatants from the elements of nature implies a trust that they will be safe, regardless of, or perhaps because of, the lack of fortifications constructed against nature. Significantly, Yeats’ persona describes his cabin immediately prior to the line in which he explains that he wants to have “a hive for the honey bee” (ln. 3) and two lines before he praises the virtues of “the bee-loud glade” (ln. 4). By juxtaposing his simple dwelling and his appreciation for bees, Yeats’ persona brings to mind the beehive huts that medieval Irish hermits often crafted in the woodlands so that they could encounter God in solitude. In a similar vein, in “The Hermit’s Song,” the persona praises “Bees and beetles” as “music-makers” (ln. 41) and St. Manchan esteems “Salmon and trout and bees” (ln. 40) as a source of wholesome food. In addition to evoking the beehive huts through his placement of the lines on bees, then, Yeats also situates his work on the praise of nature in the tradition of the mystics who appreciated bees, which creatures could be considered pesky but were not believed to be so by the green martyrs, who were happy to use all of the resources with which God had provided them.\nOther natural imagery is common among the poems. Additional animals, for example, are mentioned in the poems, almost in catalog fashion. The linnet is mentioned as a staple of the milieu in both “Innisfree” and “The Hermit’s Song.” Also, there is consistency in the plant names in the poems. In “The Hermit’s Song,” the persona notes that the landscape is marked by “upland heather” (ln. 51), and he relishes the “Heathberries and whortleberries [that he eats] / For a sweet” (ll. 27-28). The speaker in “The Hermit” celebrates the fact that flora compose parts of his abode: “The doorsteps are of heather, / the lintel of honeysuckle” (ll. 5-6). Additionally, the persona is aware of the heather that provides him with berries to eat and that marks the landscape of the area surrounding him (ll. 36 and 56). More obscurely for those who do not speak Irish, “Innisfree” includes a mention of heather in its very title. P. W. Joyce, author of Irish Names of Places, originally published in 1869 and commonly read by the Irish at the time of Yeats’ composition of the poem, provides the etymology of locations in Ireland. Joyce notes that “Innisfree” in Lough Gill in Co. Sligo is named “heathy island,” from “Inish” for “island” and “fraeigh,” the genitive form of the word for “heather” (520). It is reasonable to expect that Yeats, well-read in Irish cultural history, would have been aware of the derivation of the name of his title location. A place named after such foliage fits in well with the loci described in the medieval predecessors of the poem.\nIn the medieval poems and also in Yeats’ “Innisfree,” order and harmony contribute to a sense of peace that the personae feel or anticipate feeling in their bucolic abodes. St. Manchan and Yeats refer to order in nature in an explicit manner in their numbering and clearly laid-out plans for their habitations. St. Manchan, who will not be entirely alone but seems to be planning to form a monastic community in the wilderness, has a plan for how many of his companions will be in each row in their simple chapel. In a less rigorous sense, the anonymous authors of “The Hermit” and “The Hermit’s Song” imply the order of nature by virtue of the fact that the disparate elements of nature provide for the needs of the hermits. “Sparkling wells and water-torrents, / best for drinking” (ll. 21-22) abound in “The Hermit,” and the green martyr is a guest at “meals [to which] the woods invite [him]” (ln. 21), featuring such delicacies as “water, herbs and cresses, / Salmon, trout” (ll. 23-24). Having one’s needs met leads to a feeling of peace, as expressed more or less explicitly by each of the four personae. For the speaker in “The Hermit’s Song,” the slowness of pace and softness of sound of his surroundings contribute to the peace he feels. For the persona in Yeats’ poem, “peace comes dropping slow” (ln. 5), tying together peace and a slowing of pace. For two of the three medievals, of course, the peace is also induced by Christian meditation on God, while in Yeats’ poem religious devotion is not explicitly described.\nHowever, the four poems might in fact share a similar religious impulse. St. Manchan hears the call of God to “pray in every place” (ln. 44), and is actively engaged in seeking out a natural setting in which to pursue spiritual fulfillment (ll. 1-4). The speaker in “The Hermit” celebrates the solitude of his abode by virtue of the fact that “none knows it but the Lord, my God” (ln. 2), and in the final three stanzas of the poem, he acknowledges Christ as the source of all of the bounty from which he benefits in his “bothy” (ln. 72). The speakers in both “The Hermit’s Song” and “Innisfree” experience a calling in their bucolic bungalows. The persona of “The Hermit’s Song” proclaims that “in wreathed boughs the wind is whispering” (ln. 57) and that “river water falling / Is calling too” (ll. 59-60). While the least explicitly Christian in religious bent of the four poems, Yeats’ work is perhaps the one most strongly influenced by the notion of vocation. In declaring at the beginning of the poem “I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree” (ln. 1), the speaker conjures up the image of rising above his current circumstances. Additionally, the use of the word “go” twice in this first line gives the word emphasis, and highlights the movement to which the speaker feels compelled. This incipient movement suggests that he is on a mission and aligns him with the green martyrs who left their homes and families to venture into the wilderness. The repetition, in the first line of the final stanza, of the clause “I will arise and go now” (ln. 9) serves to give further emphasis to this impetus of motion for a higher cause. The persona in this poem is, of course, in the middle of a modern city at the time of his recitation of the virtues of Innisfree, but despite his physical location, he has a deep connection with the island, so deep that he can assert: “I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore; / … / I hear it in the deep heart’s core” (ll. 10-12). Such a statement indicates that the persona experiences a vocational call to the island where he can experience the order and bounty of nature, which will give him peace. Although he does not claim a specifically Christian mission, this modern speaker is acting on the precedent of his early Christian compatriots who sought to “arise and go” in order to hear Him who speaks “in the deep heart’s core.\nAccess to rare texts provided by M.J.

8	help me compare what happens encoder loses power whip vs magnetic type	When power is lost, incremental encoders and pseudo-absolute encoders will lose all position information. However, magnetic encoders can maintain functionality in challenging environments where optical encoders might fail (like humid or dusty settings), though they may require magnetic shielding to block stray fields. When considering long stroke applications, screw-driven systems can experience 'whip' that limits speed at longer lengths, while magnetic solutions can provide consistent performance.	['Modern electromechanical machine design\nJune 2018, System Integration & Control Systems Design\nEngineers from the older generation will remember the days when machine design had to be based around catalogued electromechanical actuators. Variations from standard were rare, in addition to being expensive. Fast forward around 40 years and the modern experience is somewhat different. Today’s machine designers not only desire highly configurable and adaptable products, they expect them.\nWith this in mind, many leading motion technology suppliers have developed their product portfolio specifically for machine designers. Explained below are some key factors that will aid the selection of electromechanical motion products for use in the machines of today.\nAmong the fundamental questions to ask is: Does the actuator offer various stroke lengths as standard? A product using a ball or lead-screw drive is commonly restricted to stroke lengths up to around two metres maximum for practicality. There are some actuators offering strokes to four metres, however at lengths such as these, speed is often limited due to screw ‘whip,’ so the product that achieves a particular speed at one stroke will not usually achieve that speed at a longer stroke length.\nVery long stroke lengths can, however, be achieved by belt drives, which perform to a similar level regardless of stroke length, but lack the precision of a screw-driven product.\nA further option is linear motor-driven products, which provide performance levels that scale extremely well with increases in stroke. In addition, linear motors do not demonstrate speed restrictions at longer strokes and offer the same repeatability over the full stroke.\nWith regard to scalability, machine builders should determine if the actuator is available in a number of different frame sizes or widths. Having a family of products to select from allows the project to be cost-optimised. Moreover, many multi-axis applications demand different loading for each axis.\nHaving multiple drive train choices in the same product is often overlooked, but the availability of screw or belt options within a given product can prove extremely useful to a machine designer. In the same form factor, designers can tailor the drive train to specific requirements, be it thrust density normally obtainable from a screw-type drive, or speed from a belt drive. The ability to bounce between the two without having to rethink the machine’s layout can be highly beneficial.\nModularity and performance\nIt is a common requirement for electromechanical actuators to be connected to other actuators or mechanical devices. The ability to combine linear actuators into XY, XZ, or XYZ assemblies quickly and effortlessly is vital. As a result, most modern electromechanical products can be bolted together like building blocks, without the use of transition plates for XY systems (plates are often unavoidable for the Z or vertical axes to maintain stability).\nA further factor here is performance-to-size ratios, which should be considered carefully. Using a product that is highly condensed leaves more space for machine designers to include end effectors and tooling. For this reason, metrics such as thrust or rated load per height-by-width become important.\nSelectable resolutions and encoder types\nTo retain good servo control, an actuator should have 5-10 times more resolution available than the repeatability of motion required. With this in mind, having multiple options is the optimum solution as high-resolution encoders can be quite costly.\nBeing able to adjust the resolution is also important. Some of the latest encoder products can vary their resolution through a relatively simple hardware change. A further approach is to deploy analog feedback devices and compatible servo drives. In using analog feedback signatures (typically 1 V peak-to-peak), two analog signals are passed from the encoder to the drive, 90° out of phase with one another. Equivalent resolution is established within the drive, and is dependent upon the pitch of the linear scale and resolution of the drive’s analog input.\nAs well as flexible resolution, the availability of flexible encoder technologies is another major benefit. Optical encoders with glass scales have been a popular choice for many years, but today there are many alternative technologies that provide competitive resolutions and costs.\nFor example, in applications that do not require especially high levels of precision, magnetic encoder technology is a cost-effective option, while applications that do require high precision but not long stroke lengths benefit from the very high resolutions of capacitive encoders. Inductive encoders are often popular for applications directly exposed to heavy contamination, such as coolant from a machine tool. Applications which require constant positional information regardless of an axis being homed will require an absolute feedback source.\nWith regard to communications, until recently, most encoder protocols were based on embedded propriety signals, which meant that designers had to use a limited list of manufacturers. Today, open standard protocols such as the single cable Hiperface DSL solution allow design engineers to use a variety of products and even reduce installation and cabling efforts.\nIn cutting-edge design software, finite element analysis (FEA) can be used to understand not only the deflection characteristics, but also the thermal or magnetic variations within the product. Naturally, these simulations cannot give results with 100% certainty as they are only as good as the algorithms and assumptions that are used, but modern machine design is starting to leverage these digital design methodologies more heavily to expedite development.\nMetrology test data\nTest data from metrology can be used to take ball-screw backlash into account, and improve overall system accuracy. For applications with very specific requirements, these tests can be performed to mirror the actual application characteristics. Cleanroom applications are a good example as there are many characteristics, such as speed, acceleration, orientation and air flow, which can greatly impact product performance. Selecting products from a design partner that understands the mission-critical aspects of the application and tests will prove particularly advantageous.\nToday, the demand for faster turnaround time on machines has become critical. The same design engineer who might have allowed for a machine to be developed in several months, now expects it in weeks. Key to the machine-building race is selecting the right product from a manufacturer which understands the daily design hurdles and has systems in place that allow for rapid machine development.\nFactors such as breadth of product, range of options, modularity and product test data should be taken into account when designing the machines of today. This strategy will enhance the machine builder’s ability to respond to customer needs, and provide faster ROI.\nFor more information contact Lisa de Beer, Parker Hannifin SA, +27 (0)11 961 0700, firstname.lastname@example.org, www.parker.com/za', 'Last year, Automation World examined the differences between accuracy, resolution, and precision in the encoder world. And while understanding the differences among these terms is important to understanding encoder function, it’s even more important to effectively determine the correct type of encoder for your application.\nThe core function of an encoder is to provide feedback to a controller on the position of moving parts in a machine or electromechanical system. “Encoders close the feedback loop and tell you exactly what a moving part in your system is doing,” said Neal Donowitz, COO, US Digital, a supplier of encoders.\nGiven the feedback role of encoders in a motion control system, Donowitz said the first decision in your encoder selection process should be based on the type of motion in your application.\n“Linear motion occurs in a straight line—back and forth. Therefore, linear encoders are made to be used in applications like reporting the position of a forcer in a linear motor, or distance in digital calipers,” he said.\nRotary encoders are typically attached to a motor to report motor shaft position. Donowitz added that they can also be used “with anything that rotates. For example, they can report the angle of flaps on an airplane, or the angle of a robot’s arm.”\nThe information from either type of encoder—linear or rotary—is used by a motion controller to calculate position, speed, distance, and direction.\nOptical, Magnetic or Capacitive\nOnce the type of motion to be monitored in your system has been determined, the next step is determining which of the three types of encoders are best for the application—optical, magnetic or capacitive.\nThe most commonly used encoder are optical encoders. “Inside these encoders is a disk with opaque and transparent areas, usually in a pattern of lines and windows,” said Donowitz. “An LED array shines light at the disk—the lines block the light and the windows let light pass through to a photo sensor on the other side. In most encoders, signals from the sensor are processed with onboard signal conditioning circuitry and are transmitted to the motion controller.”\nBecause optical encoders function best when nothing gets in the way of the light path, operation environments with high humidity, moisture or excessive dust can cause problems for optical encoders unless addressed by specialty packaging.\nMagnetic encoders typically have a magnet attached to a rotating shaft so that a stationary sensor can detect the north-south field lines from the magnet and report the angle of the magnetic field as the shaft rotates.\nDonowitz said that magnetic encoders are frequently used in humid, moist or dusty settings that can cause problems for optical encoders. However, because magnetic encoders can be sensitive to stray magnetic fields which might be coming from the motor, or even other encoders nearby, users may need to install magnetic shielding to block stray fields to isolate the encoder.\nCapacitive encoders are the newest type of encoder technology. These encoders detect changes in capacitance and relate that change to position. “Inside the encoder, a transmitter sends a high frequency signal past a rotor to a receiver,” said Donowitz. “The rotor modulates the signal and the receiver translates the modulated signal, which is then sent to the motion controller.”\nHe explained that capacitive encoders draw less current than optical and magnetic encoders and perform well in environments with dust, moisture or condensation. However, the maximum speeds of capacitive encoders are “often less than optical encoders,” he noted.\nIncremental, Absolute or Pseudo-Absolute\nUnderstanding how encoders capture position data is one important decision factor. The other is in how encoders report the position information they collect.\nAccording to Donowitz, there are two primary ways encoders report this information, with a third method being a hybrid approach to the two primary methods.\nIncremental encoders report relative position, he said. “As the internal disk rotates or a linear strip moves, the encoder will transmit a high or low pulse for each increment of motion. Two output channels, often called Channel A and Channel B, are typically used to send signals to a motion controller. The channels are offset from each other by 90 electrical degrees—a phase difference known as quadrature—which allows the motion controller to determine direction of motion.”\nBecause the pulses transmitted by incremental encoders are simple to process, Donowitz said these encoders are recognized as being good choices for position and speed control. They are particularly effective at high speeds because they continuously stream output pulses. The main drawback for this type of encoder is that they will lose position information if power is lost or cycled.\nAs their name implies, absolute encoders report absolute position—even if power is cycled. “Every sector of the internal disk in an absolute encoder has a unique pattern,” said Donowitz. “Outputs from the encoder transmit information the controller can use to determine the exact position of the mechanical system. Many output types are available, including analog voltage variation, pulse width modulation, and serial communication interfaces.”\nThere are two types of absolute encoders: single-turn and multi-turn. Single-turn absolute encoders report position within one revolution of the encoder disk, while multi-turn absolute encoders also keep track of the total number of turns. Donowitz noted that multi-turn models need a battery backup, gears or other method to preserve position information if power is cycled.\nHe also pointed out that absolute encoders require internal circuitry that is “more complex than incremental encoders, which makes them more expensive.” Also, because absolute encoders don’t continuously stream their data like incremental encoders, they may not be well-suited for some high-speed applications.\nPseudo-absolute encoders, also known as incremental encoders with index, are basically incremental encoders with a third channel added, i.e., the index. “This gives them the ability to act like absolute encoders,” Donowitz said. “The index is a mark, located on its own band on the encoder disk or linear strip. The encoder is able to keep track of its location by how far it is from the index.”\nHowever, this is only true as long as the power stays on. “If power fails or cycles, you will lose all position information,” Donowitz said. “Your system will need to perform a homing move to find the index position and start counting from that point.”\nMore to consider\nThough much information about encoder selection can be determined from knowledge of how different encoder types work and how they transmit their data, there are still more factors to take into account. Some of these considerations include deciding between shafted, kit or hollow bore encoders; your system’s available power and speed of operation; and housing needs for the encoder based on the system’s operating environment.\nTo learn more about these encoder factors, as well as more information on the encoder capabilities described in this article, visit the U.S. Digital white paper, “How to Pick the Right Encoder for Your Next Project.”']	['<urn:uuid:051c65cb-7925-4237-8f5c-bc7aa61c5e01>', '<urn:uuid:4f3cf167-6a21-40f3-913a-618d8bd73744>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	12	66	2226
9	devils tower native legend scientific formation theories comparison	Devils Tower's formation has multiple theories - geologists believe it may be the core of an ancient volcano whose outer layers eroded away. In contrast, Native American legend tells of girls being chased by giant bears, with the Great Spirit raising the rock to save them. The bears' attempts to climb created the deep claw marks visible on the tower's sides today.	"['Columnar basalt formations like Devils Tower and the Giant’s Causeway have amazed and mystified humans from time immemorial. We now know that these spectacular geological wonders formed when extruded molten lava cooled, crystallized and cracked along precise angles. When exposed en masse, these magnificent symmetrical pillars look anything but natural… but they are: SUPER natural!\nDevils Tower, Wyoming, USA\nDevils Tower, located in northeastern Wyoming, was designated America’s first national monument by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906. Geologists are not completely sure how the 1,267 ft (386 m) tall tower came to be, with most theories centering on it being the core, or plug, of an ancient volcano whose outer layers have eroded away. Though the columnar basalt on the formation’s exterior is eroding, so is the softer sandstone surrounding its base.\nDevils Tower was known of and venerated by several Native American tribes. One legend concerning the formation involves 7 young girls pursued by a bear. When the ground rose, carrying them upward and out of the creature’s reach, the bear frantically scratched and clawed at the rock until it died of exhaustion. Devils Tower burst into modern pop culture consciousness with the release of the 1977 film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The Tower first appears as a kitchen construction made of mashed potatoes and then, later on, as the contact point between humans and a more-advanced alien race.\nHexagon Pools, Golan Heights, Israel/Syria\nThe Hexagon Pools and their related watercourses are fed by cold, clear water draining off the nearby hills of the Golan Heights. Surprisingly to many who expect the region to have a classic Middle eastern desert environment, the area is well-watered and the rocks are mainly of volcanic origin.\nSheets of columnar basalt tinted a burnished gray hue hang alongside the Hexagon Pools – it’s the polygonal sections of rock that give the pools their name. The rock formations have been acted on by shifting subterranean fault lines over a very long time, which accounts for their unusual twisted appearance.\nCyclopean Isles, Italy\nLocated off the southeastern coast of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea, the Cyclopean Isles are a small group of volcanic islands associated with nearby Mount Etna. The islands are mainly made up of black basalt that, under the influence of water and weathering, has evolved into a wide variety of otherworldly formations including vertical columns and horizontal polygonal mosaics.\nThe Cyclopean Isles feature prominently in The Odyssey, the ancient Greek poet Homer’s tale of the warrior king Odysseus (Ulysses) and his lyric journey home from the city of Troy. Odysseus and his crew were captured and imprisoned by a monstrous, one-eyed Cyclops when they landed on one of the islands, only escaping when Odysseus blinded the Cyclops while he slept. In his rage, the pain-crazed Cyclops wildly threw huge boulders in the direction of Odysseus’s sailing ship.\nJusangjeolli, Jeju Island, South Korea\nJusangjeolli is a huge formation of columnar basalt extending along a 3.5km () stretch of the Jungmun and Daepo seashore in Seogwipo, Jeju Island.” In some places, sheer cliffs made up of vertical basalt columns rise up to 20m (60 ft) above the beach. Often compared to the Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland, Jusangjeolli also juts out into the ocean and owes its unique character to age-old forces acting at the interface between sea and land.\nExposure to the elements over untold millions of years has left its mark on the once sharply delineated columns. In some areas the columns have partially separated into individual spires; closer to the shore crashing waves have softened and rounded their contours to the point where they resemble man-made walls similar to those constructed by the Incas.\nFingal’s Cave, Staffa, Scotland\nFingal’s Cave is an enormous sea grotto located on the rugged coast of Staffa, Scotland. The island is uninhabited and is graced with a host of natural geologic wonders formed from the same eruption of black basalt that composes the Giant’s Causeway. Show Caves of the World notes the dimensions of Fingal’s Cave as being 85 m (279 ft) deep and 23 m (75 ft) high.\nDescribed by visitors as a “truly natural cathedral complete with basaltic organ pipes”, Fingal’s Cave is endowed with unusual acoustic properties that distort and magnify the sounds of crashing waves. Scottish novelist Sir Walter Scott visited Fingal’s Cave and described it as “one of the most extraordinary places I ever beheld. It exceeded, in my mind, every description I had heard of it… eternally swept by a deep and swelling sea, and paved, as it were, with ruddy marble, it baffles all description.”\nGarni Gorge, Armenia\nGarni Gorge is located 23 km (14.3 miles) east of Yerevan, the capitol of the country of Armenia. Due to the fact that it’s an inland canyon and not a seaside cliff formation, Garni Gorge offers a rare opportunity to view vast expanses of well-preserved columnar basalt on both sides of the onlooker. A notable landmark dating far back into prehistory, visitors to Garni Gorge can visit a restored 1st century AD Hellenistic temple situated on a promontory overlooking the canyon’s depths.\nGarni Gorge’s most famous feature is the “Symphony of the Stones”, a frozen cascade of basaltic “organ pipes” likened to a hanging garden due to erosion and undercutting of the valley floor. It’s a brave tourist who attempts to take photos or film video from beneath thousands of tons of suspended stone!\nGilbert Hill, Mumbai, India\nGilbert Hill is a 197 ft (60 m) tall monolithic black basalt extrusion located in the outskirts of Mumbai in India’s state of Maharashtra. With its sheer vertical face and precisely etched vertical rock columns, the 65 million year old formation is said by some to resemble a much smaller version of Devils Tower.\nUnlike most other famous large formations of columnar basalt, Gilbert Hill finds itself located in an urban setting as the city of Mumbai (formerly Bombay) has expanded around it. Though its summit provides a remarkable view over the densely packed roofs of Mumbai, years of quarrying around the formation’s base has both degraded the Gilbert Hill’s original, natural appearance and has created an increasingly dangerous hazard as the basalt columns lose their ground-level support.\nDevils Postpile, California, USA\nDevils Postpile is located near Mammoth Mountain in eastern California near the border with Nevada. Along with 101-ft high Rainbow Falls, this unusually symmetrical formation of columnar basalt is included in Devils Postpile National Monument, established in 1911 by a presidential proclamation. The order to create the park was in response to a dam-building proposal that would have seen Devils Postpile blasted into oblivion. The basalt formation offers visitors easy access to both the face and the top – the latter looking much like a man-made parquet floor.\nThe lava flow that created Devils Postpile is relatively young, geologically speaking, being between 100,000 and 700,000 years old. Surface topography at the time of the eruption prevented the lava from spreading out and as a consequence, the original 400-ft (122 m) thick layer of basalt cooled slowly and evenly. It’s thought that this slow cooling allowed the basalt to form very long and uniform columns, most of which are six-sided in cross section.\nSvartifoss, Skaftafell National Park, Iceland\nSvartifoss (“Black Falls”, in Icelandic) is located in Iceland’s Skaftafell National Park. This rare and striking example of a columnar basalt formation combined with a 12 meter (39 ft) high waterfall can be appreciated in all 4 seasons. The undercut structure of the columns accentuates their visual similarity to traditional church organ pipes.\nThe basalt columns that make up the escarpment over which the falls flows are virtually unweathered and display straight, sharp edges that advertise their crystalline structure. This is due to the more rapid erosion caused by the constant, fast-flowing falls combined with Iceland’s perpetual freeze-thaw cycle.\nGiant’s Causeway, County Antrim, Northern Ireland\nThe Giant’s Causeway is a spectacular assemblage of around 40,000 black basalt columns, weathered and eroded to varying degrees by the harsh seaside environment of County Antrim in Northern Ireland. The columns are up to 60 million years old, and the passage of time has acted to form a series of terraces leading down – and into – the frigid North Channel of the Irish Sea.\nThe Giant’s Causeway has another claim to fame, one which has contributed to the site being declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO (1986) and a National Nature Reserve (1987) by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland. It seems that the Girona, a straggler ship of the Spanish Armada was shipwrecked just offshore of the Giant’s Causeway in late October of 1588. The ship was carrying over 1,000 sailors from other sunk or shipwrecked Spanish ships, along with their valuables, in addition to her own crew of about 300 – it’s estimated less than 10 survived.\nIt’s somewhat surprising that the Giant’s Causeway was little known in learned geological circles until the last years of the 17th century. Part of this ignorance has to do with the formation’s isolated location, and anecdotal accounts of the features size and grandeur were deemed too grandiose to be true. Thanks to the wonders of modern photographic technology, the world can see that reports of the Giant’s Causeway were anything BUT an exaggeration!\nThe otherworldly beauty of columnar basalt formations like the Giant’s Causeway lends itself to most any artistic endeavor, including music. Those familiar with Led Zeppelin’s fifth album Houses of the Holy, released in March of 1973, may have wondered where on Earth the bizarre landscape on the album cover was located. Well, now you know… Rock On!!', ""Devils Tower was featured in the movie 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.' We both remember the scene where Richard Dreyfus was making a tower out of a big pile of mashed potatoes, running his fork up and down the pile. Once we got close to the Tower we could see what he was trying to do. The photo below shows how the rock runs in vertical strips. The parallel strips are so precise and even that they look like they've been chiseled into the rock.\nAlthough the Tower is a popular climbing destination it is not without controversy. The Tower is sacred to several Plains tribes, including the Lakota, Cheyenne and Kiowa. Because of this, many Indian leaders objected to climbers ascending the monument, considering this to be a desecration. The climbers argue that they had a right to climb the Tower, since it is on federal land. A compromise was eventually reached with a voluntary climbing ban during the month of June when the tribes are conducting ceremonies around the monument. Climbers are asked, but not required, to stay off the Tower in June. Approximately 85% of climbers honor the ban and voluntarily choose not to climb the Tower during the month of June. However several climbers, along with the Mountain States Legal Foundation, sued the Park Service claiming an inappropriate government entanglement with religion. The climbers lost the lawsuit.\nMore information regarding the Tower and climbing can be found at the following link http://www.nps.gov/deto/faqs.htm\nThe sculpture in the photo above is at the new Tribal Connections site, part of Devils Tower National Monument. It interprets Devils Tower as a place that is sacred to many Native American tribes. The central feature, the Wind Circle sculpture – also called the Sacred Circle of Smoke -- was created by internationally renowned Japanese artist Junkyu Muto as the third in a series of seven “peace sculptures” planned for significant sites around the world. The Wind Circle sculpture, which is made of white marble with a black base, stands an impressive 12 feet tall. The artist designed it to evoke the image of a puff of smoke from a sacred pipe.\nWe had planned to hike around the base of the monument, but the weather wasn't cooperating. We spent some time in the Visitor Center learning more about the Tower.\nOne of the things that I thought was interesting is that there is no definitive answer as to how the Tower was formed. There are three basic theories, kind of technical but interesting. The following link explains the geological theories http://www.nps.gov/deto/learn/nature/geologicformations.htm\nNative American stories telling how the Tower was formed are even more interesting. The stories all involve a bear trying to climb the Tower and are similar to this one from the Kiowa and Lakota tribes, 'Some girls went out to play and were spotted by several giant bears, who began to chase them. In an effort to escape the bears, the girls climbed atop a rock, fell to their knees, and prayed to the Great Spirit to save them. Hearing their prayers, the Great Spirit made the rock rise from the ground towards the heavens so that the bears could not reach the girls. The bears, in an effort to climb the rock, left deep claw marks in the sides, which had become too steep to climb. Those are the marks which appear today on the sides of Devils Tower. When the girls reached the sky, they were turned into the star constellation the Pleiades'.\nIt was a pretty interesting place to visit - just wish we had been able to do some hiking. Maybe next time.\nFollowing are maps of our route from Lyons to Sundance, Wyoming, where we stayed while exploring the Tower, and our route from there to Sioux Falls, SD.\nLyons to Lusk, Wyoming where we made our first overnight stop - 222 miles\nLusk to Sundance, Wyoming - 127 miles\nSundance to Presho, SD - 245 miles. Don't recommend stopping in Presho, but driving in the wind and rain got to be too much.\nPresho to Sioux Falls, SD, our hometown. We have to return here every five years to renew our drivers licenses - 175 miles.""]"	['<urn:uuid:db0353e1-9b06-42dd-84a3-967322c62ad5>', '<urn:uuid:4cded1e3-143d-4dcf-94b0-704a1107031e>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	8	62	2310
10	need info what material and method create smoothest surface when making 3d printed mathematical knots	The FormLabs printer produces smoother surfaces and finer curves than the MakerBot printer, making it ideal for printing knots. When printed on the FormLabs printer, the knots come out smooth with only small removable nubs where the supports were located.	['I’ve continued with my project to edit the 3D printed models my Fall 2014 Math 341 Introduction to Topology class made. Recently, I came across two of my favorite pieces. The first is a model that was designed by Emily Jaekle (’16) and is a ribbon version of the (3,5) torus knot.\nThis \\((5,3)\\) ribbon torus knot was designed entirely in Cinema4D. The curve was created using the Formula tool with parametrization \\(x(t)=(2+\\cos(5t))\\cos(3t), y(t)=(2+\\cos(5t))\\sin(3t), z(t)=-\\sin(5t)\\) for \\(t\\in[-\\pi, \\pi]\\). The trianglulated surface was created by first adding in a small rectangle, then using the SweepNurbs (without caps). The rectangle was also rotated 1800 degrees in the process. The small gap was fixed using the Bridge tool in Edge mode. This ribbon knot was originally printed in blue on the Projet-260 3D Systems printer. Later, I printed it on the FormLabs 1+ printer in black resin. You can find the model here on Thingiverse.\nThe second model was designed by Cathy Wang (’15) and is a ribbon version of the (3,2) trefoil knot with an amazing color scheme.\nThe entire model was designed in Cinema4D. The knot was created using the Formula tool with parametrization \\(x(t)=(2+\\cos(2t))\\cos(3t), y(t)=(2+\\cos(2t))\\sin(3t), z(t)=-\\sin(2t)\\) for \\(t\\in[-\\pi,\\pi]\\). The trianglulated surface was created by first adding in a small rectangle, then using the SweepNurbs (without caps). The width and height of the rectangle was adjusted so the band is not a constant size through the knot. The overlapping edges and small gaps were also fixed. Finally, the knot was colored with a beautiful rainbow-gradient. This ribbon knot was originally printed in rainbow colors on the Projet-260 3D Systems printer. Later, I printed it on the FormLabs 1+ printer in black resin. You can find the model here on Thingiverse.\nI had the very great privilege of being a co-organizer of a workshop held at the Simon’s Center for Geometry and Physics and NYU Stony Brook. This was the workshop on the Symplectic and Algebraic Geometry in the Statistical Physics of Polymers. It was my first time to this campus, and I had a blast with both the math at the workshop AND all the visualization of math in the environment.\nMy first hint that things were going to be special, was the fantastic Umbilic Torus sculpture found at the end of an avenue of trees between the center and the math department.\nThe sculpture is by Dr Helamun Ferguson, click here to find a photo gallery showing the design and construction of the piece.\nThe sculpture consists of a space filling curve all over the surface of the sculpture. The sharp curve along the edges is a trefoil knot, winding three times around the central hole (the longitude on the torus) and twice around the sculpture the other way (the meridian on the torus).\nThe base of the sculpture is a large round granite disk with a 3 sided deltoid mirroring the 3-fold symmetry of the sculpture overhead. The base had to be left to settle for a year, and was greatly loved by the local skate-boarders!\nThe Simon’s Center itself is in a wonderful airy building, with mathematical themes blended seamlessly in the design. I kept finding treasures as the workshop went on. The most obvious, is the sandstone wall behind the stair case leading up to the cafe on the second floor. It is covered with small math motifs from knots, to physics, to finding the square root of 2.\nEven the screens on the side of the first floor lounge are mathematical, with different tilings of the plane illustrated. Just love the artistry of the designs in them.\nI modeled the trefoil knot as two torus knots \\(T(2,3)\\) and \\(T(3,2)\\). The parametric equations for a \\(T(p,q) \\) knot are \\(x = \\cos(pt)*(3+\\cos(qt)), y=\\sin(pt)*(3+\\cos(qt)) \\), and \\(z=\\sin(qt) \\). Here, \\(p\\) is the number of times the knot winds around the longitude of a torus, and \\(q\\) is the number of times the knot winds around the meridian of a torus.\nBoth models were printed on the FormLabs printer. I first made a small \\(T(2,3) \\) knot with a label extruded out of the curve (as shown to the left). I used Cinema 4D to design the model by using the Formula Spline to draw the curve, the Sweep NURB to give the curve depth, and the Wrap Tool to wrap the text around the curve. I also used the Extrude Tool to give the equations depth and the Boole Tool to connect the equations to the curve. For both knots I had to make sure the ends of the knots overlapped correctly. Before printing the \\(T(3,2)\\) knot, I had to change the range of \\(t\\) to \\(t=[0, 2\\pi] \\) instead of \\(t=[0, 5\\pi]\\) (I initially used \\(5\\pi\\) to be sure that the curve closed).\nThe first \\(T(2,3)\\) knot came out nicely, however the text was a little small. Using the subscript made the numbers too small, so I reprinted the knot used parentheses instead, as shown here. The \\(T(3,2)\\) knot also looked great, as it was smooth and there were merely small nubs where the supports were, which could be removed with an exacto blade. We’ve discovered that the FormLabs printer makes smoother surfaces and finer curves than does the MakerBot, which is why it is ideal for printing knots.\nYou can find the torus knots on Thingiverse here T(2,3) and here T(3,2). Instructions on how to make torus knots in Cinema 4D can be found here. Professor Denne has also created another worksheet in Mathematica about Torus knots. It can be found here.']	['<urn:uuid:880e074e-10ac-446e-a427-5fa904cb167d>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	15	40	926
11	what similar goals do hybrid intelligence and jill watson AI have in education	Both hybrid intelligence and Jill Watson AI aim to assist in education while preserving human involvement. Hybrid intelligence, as described by Microsoft, is meant to expand human intellect rather than replace it, helping students achieve better results through meaningful interactions with technology. Similarly, Jill Watson AI is designed to handle repetitive tasks and answer student questions, which gives human teachers more time to meet with students and develop teaching strategies. Both technologies serve as assistants rather than replacements - hybrid intelligence helps students complete objectives and develop social-emotional skills, while Jill Watson facilitates positive learning experiences by handling routine inquiries.	"['For the last two years, Microsoft has been speculating about what ""the class of 2030"" might look like – and at the Bett education-technology conference today in London, the company gave an update on its vision for the classroom of the next decade.\nWhile smartphones and other glowing screens are often labeled a distraction for students (and the rest of us) and the impact of technology is schools is still being assessed, the 2030 generation of students, according to Microsoft, will be a squad of high-achieving ""super-humans"", able to amplify and unleash their full potential thanks to hybrid intelligence.\nA combination of human and machine intelligence, hybrid intelligence is meant to expand human intellect, rather than replace it. It will happen, said Microsoft, via ""meaningful"" interactions between students and technology, which will ""help students do an even better job at what they already do best"".\nDaniel McDuff, a researcher at Microsoft, explained that hybrid intelligence occurs when a technology is fully at the service of the user, not the other way round. ""Most technologies today come in the form of screens that are hungry for our attention,"" he said. ""Shouldn\'t tech increase productivity instead?""\n""The collaboration between humans and AI could give us almost superhuman powers to learn, but it is important that those systems work for us, to achieve what we want to do.""\nIn particular, Microsoft identified as part of its ""class of 2030"" initiative that hybrid intelligence will be most effective in schools when it will assist humans in learning social and emotional skills.\nTo illustrate, McDuff presented a ""focus agent"" project he is working on, an enhanced digital personal assistant that could help students, for instance, achieve specific tasks. At the beginning of the day, the agent asks the user what they want to achieve and schedules a time to focus on particular tasks.\nAs the task\'s time approaches, the assistant can ask the user how they want to go about completing their objective, and once it is over, they let the user explain how they feel about the task and if they want to repeat it.\n""It assists people in completing their objectives,"" said McDuff, ""so that they can be more productive and focused. It will stop tasks from bleeding into personal time, too.""\nHe added that Microsoft is building fully-embodied digital versions of the personal assistants – so it sounds like they will even have the appearance of a life coach.\nAnother example of hybrid intelligence consists of using AI tools to understand how students work collaboratively, which could let researchers quantify dynamics that until now have remained invisible. For example, AI could highlight the need for a group leader in a class group, or spot unconscious biases happening when pupils interact.\nHybrid-intelligence technologies have myriad other applications in the classroom, some of them already grounded in 2020 technology. They include AR and VR tools, for example, which lets students, in McDuff\'s words, ""use tech in the moment rather than be glued to a screen"".\nSimilarly, the company is working on a gesture-recognition project, so that users can control videos, play music or call a digital assistant using hand poses.\nMicrosoft\'s presentation translator, a PowerPoint plugin, creates real-time subtitles for what the teacher is saying, while AI-powered speech recognition and translation tools let students hear what is being said in their native language.\nAnthony Salcito, the vice president of Microsoft Education, said at the conference: ""We need to recognize the need to embrace a hybrid intelligence to be able to achieve more. With new technology, we will have to think differently about student achievement.""', ""Let’s talk nerdy about tricky amphibians, staying healthy at home, women with spears, and more.\nScientists at Sam Houston State University have discovered the earliest example of an animal that used the “ballistic tongue” style of predation. A few tiny bits of skeleton and soft tissue from the new species were found in chunks of amber in Myanmar.\nResearchers named the animal Yaksha perettii in honor of a nature spirit from Myanmar folklore (Yaksha), and Adolf Peretti, the mineralogist who discovered the fossil.\nResearchers previously thought that Y. perettii was a chameleon because it shares features with the modern reptile. But paleontologist Susan Evans of University College London found that the creature was not a reptile. It was, in fact, a type of amphibian called albanerpetontid.\nA known albanerpetontid specimen that had a long, thin bone near its skull made scientists suspect that the animal had a ballistic tongue mechanism. The newly discovered skull that contains the entire tongue apparatus presents strong evidence the animal did catch its prey with a flick of the tongue.\nThe case for staying at home\nWith Japan’s large population and dense cities like Tokyo, you might expect big outbreaks of COVID-19. But that has not been the case. Japanese citizens have managed to curtail the spread of the virus by voluntarily staying home.\nDuring the first wave of COVID-19, researchers from The University of Tokyo Institute of Industrial Science examined location data from more than 200,000 mobile phone users.\nThe anonymized data used represented about 2% of the population. The scientists computed human movement and contact rates at a 100-meter grid-cell scale. The data showed that during the first week of the government’s state of emergency, beginning on April 7, human mobility reduced by 50%. The effect was a 70% drop in social contacts.\nData on activity at major hub train stations in central Tokyo showed 76%-87% fewer visits compared to pre-pandemic January. The researchers also found that people in greater Tokyo traveled shorter distances and less often. Both measures dropped by about 50%.\nJapanese law does not permit enforcement of a mandatory lockdown. Instead, authorities issued a gradual series of requests to close businesses and work from home. They also enacted aggressive travel entry restrictions.\nThe study backs up the idea that social distancing is effective in slowing the spread of COVID-19.\nAncient women hunted big game\nThe remains of a woman buried around 9,000 years ago were recently unearthed in the Andes Mountains of Peru. The spearpoints and other hunting tools buried with her suggest to researchers that she participated in big-game hunting.\nThe finding adds to evidence that nearly as many males as females hunted large animals in the ancient Americas.\nRandall Haas and his colleagues at the University of California, Davis, have reported that thousands of years ago, among mobile groups that inhabited the Americas, up to half of big-game hunters were women. Because males are the primary hunters in modern hunter-gatherer populations, the tendency has been to assume this was always the case.\nBut in 2018, Haas and his team unearthed burial pits in Peru that have changed the way we think about ancient gender roles. They found a 17-to 19-year-old woman who was buried with a set of stone tools for big-game hunting. Remains of a man aged 25 to 30 were found with similar items.\nQuestions remain about whether the findings accurately reflect ancient females' role in big-game hunts, but Haas’ new findings coincide with recent evidence of the existence of warrior women 5,000 years ago in California and 1,500 years ago in Mongolia.\nGetting a grip on the GI tract\nA parasitic worm that digs its teeth into its host’s intestines has inspired a team of scientists at Johns Hopkins University to invent a new “theragripper” technology. The theragrippers are about the size of a dust speck. The six-pointed devices are made of metal and a thin, shape-changing film coated in heat-sensitive paraffin wax.\nThousands of theragrippers can be loaded with medicine and sent to the GI tract. When the wax coating reaches a specific temperature, the devices close and clamp onto the colonic wall. The devices then dig into the mucosa and stay attached to the colon. The medicine is then released gradually into the body.\nWhen the job is done, the theragrippers lose their hold on the tissue and leave the body via normal muscular function.\nUnlike other smart medical devices, the theragrippers don’t require electricity or wireless signals. They release medication autonomously at body temperature.\nAfter testing the technology on animals, the researchers found that subjects treated with the devices had higher concentrations of pain reliever in the bloodstream than the control group.\nAI for education\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to surge, online learning is becoming the norm. More digital education has created a market for artificial intelligence-based teachers.\nThe hope is to design AI instructors that facilitate positive learning experiences for real students.\nOne example of an artificial instructor is Jill Watson, created by a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Jill was fed thousands of questions and answers gathered from years of online classes. Eventually, the AI was able to answer students’ questions without any human assistance.\nResearchers from the University of Central Florida wanted to find out how students will perceive AI teachers. They asked respondents to read a news article about an AI teaching assistant used in higher education. The study participants were surveyed about their perception of the technology.\nThe study found that students were most likely to accept an artificial assistant that was useful and easy to communicate with.\nThe researchers believe that AI assistants can perform simple repetitive tasks and give teachers more time to meet with students and develop teaching strategies.""]"	['<urn:uuid:d35c1bc8-8cad-4085-8472-2fd540c0a95f>', '<urn:uuid:acf54784-4063-4345-922d-f11dc4a8fb8f>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	13	100	1558
12	How do different calendar systems affect Hindu festival dates?	Hindu festival dates are influenced by multiple calendar systems. There are both Solar (Sauramaana) and Lunar (Caandramaana) methods of reckoning the year, with most calendars using a combination of both (luni-solar). The solar calendar is based on the sun's transit through constellations, while the lunar calendar tracks full moon and new moon days. This affects festival timing - for instance, while the Tamil New Year is fixed to April 14th (or 13th in leap years) based on solar calculations, lunar-based festivals like Yugaadhi vary their dates on the Gregorian calendar. The Hindu almanac marks almost every day as sacred, with rituals tied to moon phases, eclipses, weekdays, and astrological positions.	"[""Tamil New Year\n[TamilNet, Sunday, 13 April 2008, 02:30 GMT]\nThe Tamil New Year day falls on Sunday, 13th April, since 2008 is a leap year. On other years, it is 14th April. It is not only the Tamil New year, but also the New Year of Sinhalese and Malayalis. It is not appropriate to call it a Hindu New Year since vast majority of Hindus in India don't celebrate it a New Year. It is only an auspicious day called Mesha-samkraanti for them. But, the Sikhs celebrate it a New Year. It is equally inappropriate to call it a Buddhist New Year, as Buddhists don’t celebrate it universally. The calculation for the commencement of this New Year and the calendar based on it are entirely astronomical.\nOpinion Columnist Ampalam\nThe Tamil New Year day falls on Sunday, 13th April, since 2008 is a leap year. On other years, it is 14th April.\nIt is not only the Tamil New year, but also the New Year of Sinhalese (Alut Avurudu\n) and Malayalis (Vishu\n), even though the Kollam\nEra of Malayalam begins from the month of Aava'ni\nIt is not appropriate to call it a Hindu New Year since vast majority of Hindus in India don't celebrate it a New Year. Yet, it is an auspicious day called Mesha-samkraanti\nfor them. In Orissa, it is observed as Paana-samkraanti.\nThe Sikhs and some Assamese also celebrate it as New Year under different names.\nIt is equally inappropriate to call it a Buddhist New Year, as Buddhists don’t celebrate it universally.\nIn Sri Lanka, since both Sinhalese and Tamils share this occasion of New Year, it has been termed as Sinhala-Tamil New Year. In recent times, there is also a tendency to term it as Sinhala-Hindu New Year by certain sections.\nSince the people who practice this New Year are predominantly Tamils in Canada, the Canadian Prime Minister chose to term it as Tamil New Year and established a practice of wishing Canadian Tamils well on the occasion, in recent years. We can be sure that the Canadian Prime Minister must have also wished the Canadian Sikhs on this occasion choosing the term Vaisakhi.\nThe calculation for the commencement of this New Year and the calendar based on it are entirely astronomical.\nThere are two ways of reckoning the Year in the astronomical texts of South Asia: one is Solar (Sauramaana\nin Sanskrit) and the other is Lunar (Caandramaana\nin Sanskrit). The calendar and terminologies are mostly a combination of both (luni-solar).\nThe commencement of New Year observed by Tamils, Malayalis and Sinhalese is a solar reckoning, but it also involves a stellar perspective. In this calculation, the entry of the Sun into the first degree of the Fixed Zodiac (Nirayana\nin Sanskrit), i.e., the first degree of the constellation of Achchuvini\nor the first degree of the zodiacal sign of Aries (Mesha\nin Sanskrit and Thakar\nin Tamil) is taken as the beginning of the year.\nMost of the Hindus observe the Lunar New Year, based on the number of full moon and new moon days, which is commonly known as Yugaadhi\n). It falls in the solar month of Pangkuni\n(March-April), but its corresponding date with the Gregorian calendar, the Western calendar widely used in the world today, varies.\nThe co-existence of both the solar and lunar systems and even related controversies are known from the times of Mahabharata. When the Pandavas reappeared after their banishment of 13 years, Duryodhana countered them saying that the 13 years were only lunar years and they had not fulfilled the requirement according to solar years and therefore should get into banishment again. Bhishma had to intervene to say that 13 solar years were also over and Duryodhana's almanac was wrong.\nAnyway, for some reasons the Solar New Year found much currency in the southern parts of South Asia. It is associated with the Salivaahana\nEra, the reckoning of which is found predominantly in the inscriptions of South India and Sri Lanka. The Era begins in 77-78 AD.\nThe Solar New Year in April is also associated with the 60 years cycle that has rendered names for the years. This cycle is based on the calculation of the relative positions of Jupiter and Saturn, the two major planets of the solar system, supposed to be exerting special impact on the climate and natural phenomena in a year, in addition to the usual impact of earth's revolution around the sun. In this cycle, the relative positions of Jupiter and Saturn will repeat after 60 years.\nOnce again, the 60 years cycle is peculiar to Tamil astronomical texts. The names of the years are widely used only by the Tamils. The system is essentially a southern innovation despite the names being in Sanskrit.\nEven though the beginning of the year and the beginnings of the months are calculated on the basis of the sun's transit, it should be noted that the names of the months in Tamil indicate their origins from lunar calendar.\nThe names of the months originated from the names of the constellations in which the full moon will occur in that month. Chiththirai:\nfull moon in Chiththirai\nfull moon in Visaakam\nconstellation (α, β, γ, ι of Librae)\nfull moon in Moolam\n) constellation (ε, ζ, η, θ, ι, κ, λ, υ, μ and ν Scorpii)\nfull moon in Uththaraadam (Uththara-Aadam) constellation (ζ and σ Sagittarii)\nfull moon in Aviddam\nconstellation (α to δ Delphini)\nfull moon in Pooraddaathi\nconstellation (α and β Pegasi)\nfull moon in Achchuvini / Asvini\nconstellation (β and γ Arietis)\nfull moon in Kaarthikai\nfull moon in Mirukaseeridam\nconstellation (λ, φ Orionis)\nfull moon in Poosam\nconstellation (γ, δ and θ Cancri)\nfull moon in Makam\nfull moon in Uththaram\nThese full moon days are festival days in the classical and folk traditions of South Asia since time immemorial. Note how they mark the festival days in the Tamil tradition. For example the full moon day in Pangkuni\nwas celebrated in the sandy stretches of the Kaveri delta, as Pangkuni Muyakkam\n, according to Changkam\nliterature. Today, it is the most important annual festival day in the Siva temples of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka as Pangkuni-uththaram\nTherefore, the Tamil calender is actually Luni-Solar, despite its base of reckoning is in the sun's transit. This is because, accuracy is achieved better in calculations based on the sun's transit.\nA unique reckoning, exclusively based on the sun's transit through the constellations is the traditional Maldivian Calendar.\nComing under a common pattern of extreme peninsular India and Sri Lanka, comprising Tamils, Malayalis and Sinhalese, the Dhivehi (Maldivian) calendar also begins in April, with the entry of the sun into the constellation Asvini / Assidha\n. But, they take it as occurring on the 8th of April (the precession position of roughly 9th century AD).\nThe concept of the Maldivian calendar is unique to suit its equatorial location, climatic fluctuations and to help them in ascertaining the arrival of the schools of fish, compared to the agrarian based calendars of the rest of South Asia.\nThere are 27 months in this calendar based on the sun's transit in the 27 constellations (Nadchaththiram\n), each month having 13 or 14 days.\nThe original ideas behind the designing of the solar calendars were to make them coincide with the equinoxes and solstices.\nThe vernal equinox was occurring on the 14th of April, at the time when Varaha Mihira, the astronomer of Ujjaini, perfected the solar calendar. Today the equinox takes place on the 20 / 21st of March. The date advanced due to the precession of the earth's axis. For the same reason, the Winter Solstice, i.e., the returning of the sun from the tropic of Capricorn towards north, which was taking place earlier on the 14th of January, now occurs on the 21 / 22nd of December.\nOur astronomers were very well aware of this shift caused by precession, which in their term is Ayanamsa\n. However, they didn't want to change the dates of the New Year of April 14th and Thaip-pongkal / Makara-samkraanti\nof January 14th, which was originally the Winter Solstice.\nTheir argument is that the calendar is not merely solar but also stellar.\nThe beginning point of the zodiac in their opinion is a fixed star Asvini\n, and the sun's transit in it is important.\nFor the progressive year, for which the beginning date would change along with vernal equinox, they have another reckoning called, Saayana\nYear (of the Moving Zodiac, opposite to Nirayana\nor the Fixed Zodiac).\nThe justifications of the arguments need further scrutiny since the constellation Asvini\nitself was not the beginning of the zodiac in the remote past. It shifted from Mirukaseeridam\n, through Rohini\nas testified by literature and now is in Uththaraddaathi\nThe recent development is a call from Karunanidhi, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu to the world Tamils to observe Thaip-pongkal\nas the Tamil New Year Day. A law has been passed recently in the Tamil Nadu State Assembly to this effect in February 2008. Mr. Karunanidhi is reported to have said that this change marks the rise and revolution of Tamils.\nThe arguments for the need of this new myth are not clear.\nDisowning the beginning, cannot disown the concepts and science behind the system.\nWhatever pros and cons can be said about April New Year can also be said about Thaip-pongkal\n, which is Makara-samkraanti\nto the rest of India.\nThe only difference it can make is that the Tamils would lose one of their secular festivals of astronomical significance that links them closely with the Dravidian legacies of the South.\nThe critics of the DMK government's move feel that such exercises of 'shallow myths' in the name of the noble venture of forging a prestigious global Tamil identity, remind of the Jayalalitha government's effort to ban certain folk practices and the subsequent quick retreat from it.\nOne has to see how fervently and colourfully the April New Year is celebrated by the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka, reminding us of the forgotten folk culture of the Dravidian South. It was the same before the war among the Tamils of Sri Lanka too.\nAnyway, the doyen of Tamil writing, Puthumaippiththan, wrote long back in one of his short stories Kayittaravu\n, how the reckoning of time is an attribution we ourselves impose on us.

Sircar's book on Indian Epigraphy.\n12.04.08 Prime Minister of Canada greets Tamil New Year"", 'And there is the religious bit lurking behind it all. The reasons for this lie deep, in the origin of Hinduism as an organic religion. Its followers have over time considered anything, animate or inanimate, to be sacred and aspects of divinity.\nThat is also why even secular events like harvests take on religious overtones, with the patron deity presiding over the festivities. As soon as something happens, there is a kind of thanksgiving to the divine that follows it.\nApart from the universally celebrated festivals like Dussehra, Diwali and Ganesh Chaturthi, there are others that are observed in specific communities or geographical areas. Hindu holidays are also confined to particular regions by the importance a certain god enjoys.\nWorship of Kartikeya (as during the festival of Skanda Shashti) is predominant in Tamil Nadu, where the god is considered a patron of the region. Onam is a good example of a festival that is celebrated solely by Keralites. Another interesting aspect of Onam is that it is perhaps the only major Hindu festival that celebrates the reign of an asura king, although a benevolent one.\nThe profusion of legends and the contradictions inherent in them is reflected in festivals too. Travel around the country, and you will hear people tell you a variety of legends involving different gods behind a single festival. Besides, you will also find versions of the same festival being celebrated under different names in different regions.\nAll this adds that facet of unending novelty and constant change to the strikingly colorful kaleidoscope that is India. You might end up thinking the thought: “The more things change, the more they remain the same”, which is something often said about India and its magical agelessness.\nWith so many holy days and more than 20 major Hindu festivals, the calendar should be liberally sprinkled with them. But it isn’t so. There is a distinct festival season, which runs from late August through December. This is when there is a fever of celebrations, with a string of important festivals following one another in a rush.\nBut the major festivals are not the only ones that the people celebrate. Browse through the Hindu almanac, and you will find a mention of holiness or sacredness against almost every day of the year. Most of the lesser festivals are lesser because they have a private rather than public face. There are rituals for phases of the moon, solar and lunar eclipses, days of the week, a person’s auspicious star or zodiac sign.\nHindu Festival Calendar 2021: Printable\n|Hindu Festival Calendar 2021|\n|January 2021||13, Wednesday||Lohri|\n|14, Thursday||Makar Sankranti|\n|15, Friday||Bhogali Bihu|\n|14, Thursday ~ Sunday, Jan 17||Pongal|\n|February 2021||11, Thursday||Mauni Amavasya|\n|16, Tuesday||Basant Panchami|\n|March 2021||11, Thursday||Maha Shivaratri|\n|29, Monday||Holla Mohalla|\n|April 2021||13, Tuesday||Vikrami Samvat (Hindu New Year)|\n|13, Tuesday ~ Thursday, Apr 22||Chaitra Navratri|\n|13, Tuesday||Gudi Padwa|\n|21, Wednesday||Rama Navami|\n|13, Tuesday ~ Wednesday, Apr 21||Rongali Bihu|\n|25, Sunday||Mahavir Jayanti|\n|27, Tuesday||Hanuman Jayanti|\n|May 2021||14, Friday||Akshay Tritiya|\n|26, Wednesday||Buddha Purnima|\n|June 2021||20, Sunday||Ganga Dussehra|\n|July 2021||12, Monday||Rath Yatra|\n|24, Saturday||Guru Purnima|\n|August 2021||13, Friday||Naag Panchami|\n|22, Sunday||Raksha Bandhan|\n|30, Monday||Shri Krishna Janmashtami|\n|12, Thursday ~ Monday, Aug 23||Onam|\n|September 2021||10, Friday||Ganesh Chaturthi|\n|17, Friday||Vishwakarma Puja|\n|October 2021||07, Thursday||Navaratra Begins|\n|07, Thursday ~ Thursday, Oct 14||Sharad Navratri|\n|11, Monday ~ Friday, Oct 15||Durga Puja|\n|24, Sunday||Karva Chauth|\n|19, Tuesday||Kongali Bihu|\n|November 2021||02, Tuesday||Dhan Teras|\n|04, Thursday||Kali Puja|\n|05, Friday||Govardhan Puja|\n|06, Saturday||Bhai Duj|\n|08, Monday||Chhath Puja Begins (Nahai Khai)|\n|10, Wednesday||Chhath Puja Ends (Sandhya Argh)|']"	['<urn:uuid:5e29c653-8969-4052-a4a9-e16ebfca68c1>', '<urn:uuid:f2daf5c0-ed25-42cc-aa7f-be2ef558c0c1>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	9	110	2356
13	How has the accessibility and sharing of photographs changed from the early photo booth era to today's digital photography age?	The accessibility of photography has transformed dramatically from the time when Anatol Josepho's photo booths made photography available to the common man at 25 cents for eight photos, to today's era where everyone carries a camera in their smartphone. Modern technology allows for instant viewing and sharing of photos, eliminating the need for film or development time. Photos can now be shared immediately through platforms like Instagram and Twitter, where visual communication has become predominant, and users can utilize various printing, sharing, and viewing options through different technological applications.	"[""We are Tiny.\nBack to Blog\nThe photo booth machine was invented by a Siberian immigrant named Anatol Josepho.\nWho was Anatol Josepho?\nAnatol Josephewitz (later Josepho) was born in Omsk, Siberia, in 1894, to a prosperous jeweller and his wife. Anatol lost his mother at age three, and was quite attached to his father.\nEven when he was a little boy Anatol’s dream was to travel around the world. He was especially fascinated by America and was eager to see the 'Wild West'. He also had a great interest in cameras that were making photography available to the middle class.\nHe wanted to learn everything about the camera and was enrolled in a local technical institute. At the age of 15 Anatol was impatient, and told his father that he wanted to explore the world. He went to Berlin with the money his father gave him. At Berlin, he happened to see the beautiful hand-tinted photographic portraits in a studio and persuaded the owner to train him as a photographer.\nIt was here that he learnt more about photography, developing and printing. To create images that would make photographs available to the common man, he evolved the idea of creating a more efficient, faster and less costly way of taking photos.\nHis fascination for America urged him to travel to the US in 1912. However, the 18-year-old could not find any job or support in New York, and had to return to Europe.\nAnatol opened his own photo studio in Budapest with great optimism. He had already started to draw designs for an automated photo machine and experimented with photograph even though he was just 19. His aim was to create a self-operated device that would work with a coin. He was successful in his invention.\nDuring the First World War Anatol was put under strict military surveillance as he was a Russian. It was at this time that he started working on a photographic paper that would not require a film negative to create beautiful toned images. For years he continued in his pursuit. He returned home to his father in 1920. But left again, and ended up in Shanghai in 1921.\nPhotomaton is born\nIt was here that the 27-year-old Anatol changed his Russian spelling of Josephewitz to Josepho and started his own studio – Josepho Studio. He soon became popular in China. However, he was still working on his invention, which later came to be known as Photomaton. In Shanghai, an outline was approximately drawn out and the notations for the chemical process cautiously prepared. But still he was not satisfied. He wanted to invent an automatic photographic machine. He went back to America to get financial support to realise this dream.\nAfter a stint at Hollywood he came to New York City. Here he succeeded in raising the money to produce the first model. He also could find the right engineers and machinists to help him build his Photomaton machine.\n1925: His Photomaton Studio was opened in September 1925 on Broadway where he was taking photos charging just 25 cents for a strip of eight. People started to throng his studio to get pictures clicked. Finally, Anatol realised his American Dream. Soon he found buyers for his photo machines and the Photomaton patent. He was offered $1m for the American rights and Anatol accepted the offer. He sold the European rights for the Photomaton to an English/French group the next year.\nThe Photomaton started a journey that took the bulky and heavy booth to every country on earth. Everyone loved making faces, squeezing in friends, and kissing in the booth.\nPhotobooths & Hollywood\nPhotobooths can be traced to Hollywood films in the early 1950s. In the film The Band Wagon with Fred Astaire, Astaire dances into a Photomatic. Esquire magazine, in 1957, dared Richard Avedon to produce photographs and dragged one of Mutascope’s art deco booths into his studio in New York. The result was the stunning images of Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, Truman Capote and Ethel Merman.\nAndy Warhol – the first art promoter of the photobooth\n1950s: Warhol understood the photobooth as an effective and cheap camera in the late 1950s. He envisioned the sense of movement and colour an artist could achieve by combining different poses from the booth.\nIn the late 1950s, Auto-Photo tried to market the Model 11A, designed for prison mug shots.\n1963: With his inclusion of photobooth photos of models in Harper's Bazaar, Warhol challenged the commercial portrait world in 1963.\nDigital colour photobooths\n1990s: Digital colour photobooths that used a computer to print strips faster came into existence in the 1990s, promoted by Photo-Me.\nPhoto booths are as fun as ever with today’s technology. They present a wide variety of options for printing, utilizing and sharing at all types of events."", 'A Picture-Filled World\nPhotography has advanced a great deal in the last 100 years. While there was a time when you had to sit still for several minutes to have your picture taken, now you don’t even need to buy film. Instead of waiting for pictures to be developed, they can be watched and shared (or deleted) instantly. Each of us carries a camera around in the form of a smartphone, and we fill our free time with images on Instagram and Twitter, where memes and emojis have allowed us to communicate with visuals rather than words. But where will cameras go in the future? Can we build machines that will include the information that normal cameras leave out?\nThe Limitations of Traditional Photography\nWhen you take a picture, your image only represents one point of view; it reduces life to a fixed plane, which is dependent on the angle at which the photo was taken. This isn’t how we experience the world - we see things in three dimensions, not on a flat plane, and we can alter our point of view by moving. That’s why optical illusions in photos happen: because your perspective is limited by the field of vision presented to you. The camera is only showing partial information based on its capability. Is it possible to take a picture where the perspective of the photo moves and changes to provide more information about its subject?\nA more complex type of camera was proposed in 1908 by Nobel Laureate Gabriel Lippman, who suggested photographs that could integrate many small images taken with small lenses and combine them into one. As digital cameras have both increased in power and become less expensive, this sort of “super camera” composed of many smaller cameras became easier to construct, and the fledgling art form of computational photography became possible for an average person, though it requires precision and a great deal of math.\nDesign of Computational Cameras\nThe earliest versions of these machines were designed in labs at the university level, and by hobbyists willing to put the time and energy into building a large rig out of ordinary cameras. By taking multiple images of something at different angles, software could then be employed to combine the images into a single “photograph” that contained the necessary information. The right equipment was necessary, but computing ability was also required. The idea was to create cameras that could change position or alter the depth of field after the picture was taken. This could be useful in all sorts of ways; for example, anthropologists could take photos of an object from many angles and examine them in order to learn about artifacts without touching them.\nApplications of Computational Photography\nOver time, cameras were built specifically for computational photography, but they had to be constructed with a single use in mind. A dome-shaped structure could take photos of a single object from every angle, completely enclosing it. A row of cameras could catch movement to create animated photographs. And a ring design could give a 360-degree view, creating an image that reflected movement and could simulate “turning around” in a single moment.\nVirtual Reality and 360-degree Photography\nWith the rise of virtual reality, the demand for immersive video increased as well. Now there are machines available at the consumer level that allow viewers to experience an event as if they were actually present. You can turn and move in space while a still image or video is projected in front of your eyes, so that your experience with a work of art is different from that of any other person who chooses to view it in a different manner. Some would argue that this is different from traditional photography and a completely separate art form, but it is an exciting space that has yet to be fully explored.\nWhere Is Photography Going From Here?\nThere are still many people who construct computational cameras. However, as more and more users shifted to using their smartphones to take pictures, a lot of the development has taken place there, with panoramic image settings and apps programmed to combine several images into a single file. With 3D printing and virtual reality growing in popularity, the future of photography likely will continue to move beyond simple still images and become a more immersive experience.']"	['<urn:uuid:0a376afe-f706-4a8b-a24c-4c5817e25cb4>', '<urn:uuid:81a66d42-3a87-4424-8e4d-df47123781d8>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	20	89	1528
14	What are the technical characteristics of the waveform produced by sine wave inverters compared to square wave inverters, and how does this affect their safety for home appliances?	Sine wave inverters create a wave by gradually switching DC current between negative and positive values, with a pause at zero, producing a smooth flowing rhythm. In contrast, square wave inverters flip voltage directly between positive and negative without pausing at zero. This difference makes sine wave inverters much safer for domestic use since many appliances are designed to run only on sine waveforms. With square wave inverters, appliances can overheat and emit humming noises, making them compatible only with motors while being unsuitable for devices like refrigerators, air conditioners, and televisions.	['So, you’re looking to purchase an inverter to run an AC-powered device off a battery or other DC source. Will you need a pure-sine-wave inverter (PSW), or will a cheaper modified-sine-wave inverter (MSW) do the job?\nTo answer that question, let’s begin by looking at what AC is. For starters, it’s short for alternating current. In other words, it denotes a current that repeatedly changes direction. This goes for the output of both pure- and modified-sine-wave inverters. Both are AC. What sets the two apart, is how the current changes direction and how long it stays level. Have a look at the pictures below.\nAs you can see, the pure sine wave features a smooth, flowing rhythm. It’s similar to what you’d think of as a “wave”. Consequently, it’s also called a “true” sine wave. This is more or less what you get in your power point at home, and it is what most household appliances are designed to run on.\nIn contrast to this, the modified sine wave features prolonged highs and lows as well as plateaus at zero voltage, giving it a rather squarish look. Not surprising, then, that it’s also called a “square” sine wave.\nSome appliances are compatible with a modified sine wave; others are not. As a general rule, the more complex the appliance, the likelier it is that it requires a pure sine wave. But to be absolutely sure, you should always go by what the manufacturer says. To give you a better idea of how the different waveforms affect different appliances, let’s have a look at the two waveforms in greater detail, though.\nMSW inverters utilise filters to round the corners of a square wave; hence the word “modified”. As previously mentioned, however, the shape of the wave remains quite square.\nBecause of the plateauing peak outputs, appliances running on a modified sine wave will have to deal with more power for a longer time, and this equals additional heat. For this reason, many appliances that are designed to run on grid power will overheat if run on a modified sine wave.\nNevertheless, MSW inverters do have their place. Since they don’t require as many components as pure-sine-wave inverters, they are relatively cheap. And they typically use DC power more efficiently than PSW inverters, meaning that your battery will last longer. So, if you plan to run only normal light bulbs and induction or shunt motors, for instance, an MSW inverter will be the right choice for you. However, as previously mentioned, take heed: if you are unsure of whether your appliance will run on MSW, make sure of it before you plug it in.\nManufacturing a PSW inverter is a lot more involved than making an MSW inverter, and this translates into a higher price. But what you get for the additional cost is peace of mind. Appliances are getting increasingly complex; these days, even seemingly simple devices feature advanced microprocessors, and, oftentimes, MSW will not agree with these microprocessors. A PSW is the only safe choice.\nFor example, many devices rely on a PSW to time their operation by counting how often the wave passes through zero voltage. This works well on the smooth grid AC. But when such devices are run off an MSW inverter, their microprocessors are tricked by the MSW’s plateaus at zero voltage, which results in miscalculations of time, leading to poor performance and shorter product lifespan.\nA PSW inverter, on the other hand, gives you an output that is close to identical to that of household power, which makes it perfect for any appliance that you’d normally plug into the wall. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that even normal household appliances may produce abnormal loads for short periods of time. Motors and fridges, for example, may require a significantly higher wattage during 5-15 seconds at start-up. Quality PSW inverters deal with this by having a 40%-100% surge capacity. So, when shopping for inverters, always read the specifications and make an informed choice.\n- Modified-sine-wave inverters are relatively simple and cheap products that generally will use battery power more efficiently than pure-sine-wave inverters.\n- Only basic products such as normal lights bulbs and induction or shunt motors can safely be run on a modified sine wave.\n- Pure-sine-wave inverters require many components and therefore come at a higher cost. They produce current that is close to identical to that of grid AC, making them perfect for running sensitive electronics.\n- If in doubt as to whether your appliances can run on a modified sine wave, always check with the manufacturer.\nRead our comprehensive guide on Inverters HERE\nRead iTechworld Generator Reviews HERE\nRead how to avoid a drained battery HERE\nRead about light weight Solar Panels HERE\nRead 5 great tips to get the most out of your Solar Panels HERE\nRead about the benefits of travelling with Solar Power HERE', 'If you are planning to buy an inverter for your home, you will be faced with the choice of a sine wave or a square wave inverter. Before you decide which inverter you should get, it is important to know how an inverter works, the basic functioning of a sine wave inverter as well as a square wave inverter, and of course, the difference between the two.\nWhat is an inverter?\nYou must have heard of a ‘conductor’ which basically converts AC current into DC current. This means that in a conductor which is an electromagnetic device, the current flow is a typical AC in DC out the circuit. On the other hand, an inverter is the exact opposite of that.\nIn an inverter, a DC current is the input which is then converted into an AC current. An inverter is used at homes as an alternate source of power when the main power lines are not running. Since the power produced by your local power stations is the AC current, it is what is required for running all the electrical devices at our home.\nHowever, it is not possible for a small electric setup that an inverter has to actually produce AC current. Therefore, it works as a converter of DC into AC which is then used to power up the lights and electrical devices.\nAlso Check: Inverter Battery in India\nHow does a sine wave inverter work?\nA sine wave inverter works on the advanced technology of conversion of DC into AC current. The sine wave inverter produces a kind of wave of AC current by switching the DC current between negative and positive values.\nWhen a sine wave inverter is turned on, it initially creates a flat plateau of positive voltage before bringing it down to zero, taking it further down to negative voltage and then again bringing it gradually up to zero and back to positive voltage.\nHow does a square wave inverter work?\nAs compared to the sine wave inverters, square wave inverters are considered to be old tech and are even considered obsolete in some parts of the world. The square wave inverters also convert DC to AC current but they do so by simply flipping the voltage directly from negative to positive and back again.\nUnlike the sine wave inverter, there is no pause at the zero levels between the negative and positive voltages. Because of its functioning, these inverters create a square waveform because of which they are called a square wave inverter.\nDifference between a sine wave and a square wave inverter\nThe sine wave inverter is vastly different from the square wave inverter simply because their core functioning itself is very different from each other. The way these two inverters convert DC into AC current is different which ultimately results in both these inverters having their own unique features. The following are some of the major areas where these two inverters differ:\nA sine wave inverter is considered to be much safer for domestic use as compared to a square wave inverter. This is because many electrical appliances are designed to run on sine waveform of current only. If these appliances are forced to run on square wave inverters, they will get heated up and may even start emitting humming noises if exposed for long.\nMotors are the only appliances that are guaranteed to be compatible with working with square wave inverters. All other appliances such as refrigerator, air conditioner, television, etc. are usually not supported for square wave inverters such that they cannot even be connected to the square wave inverter.\nMore: Inverter AC vs 5 Star AC\nA square wave inverter has a much higher noise level as compared to a sine wave inverter which is fairly quiet and creates to real disturbance. If your appliances are not compatible with square wave inverters, they can even start humming which is not just unsafe but is also a potential cause of disturbance.\nSquare wave inverters work on an old form of technology and are therefore much more economical. Sine wave inverters are a bit pricey because they are the latest in the market and also have more appeal due to their compatibility with all the regular gadgets and appliances as well as because they fulfill the required safety standards.\nMore: Split AC vs Window AC\nWhich inverter should you go for?\nA square wave inverter is recommended for those users who just need an inverter for powering up very basic electrical equipment such as lights and fans or who need it for running motors. It is also a good buy for those who do not have a very high budget for purchasing an inverter as well as those who will not need to use it on a daily basis.\nHowever, if you are planning to connect sensitive electrical equipment such as television, microwave, refrigerator, etc. with the inverter as well, you will have to go for the sine wave inverter because of its compatibility with the electronics as well as safety features.\nIf you live in an area with frequent power outages such that you will need to use the inverter quite regularly, then too, a sine wave inverter is a much better option, though a little costly.\nThere is also a third kind of inverter called a modified sine wave inverter whose functioning is kind of in-between that of a sine wave and square wave inverters. A modified sine wave inverter does not produce a pure sine wave but rather simulates a sine wave in its most important aspects.\nThis ensures that most of the appliances can still be connected to this inverter and will not heat up easily. This kind of inverter is preferred by those who want the benefits of a sine wave inverter but without having to spend too much money. However, if your priority lies in ensuring that your appliances are absolutely safe, the most foolproof way of ensuring the same is to invest in a pure sine wave inverter.']	['<urn:uuid:f32e4768-54c8-4d84-aa81-05cbfadc81b3>', '<urn:uuid:e259fe4f-e9eb-4400-a347-fb99b8343b6f>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	28	92	1823

Is that a concern?\n- What are the environmental impacts of a wind turbine?\nFrequently Asked QuestionsMuch of the information on this page is taken from the web site of our partner, Sustainable Energy Developments Inc.\nWind energy is the energy contained in the movement of air. The sun heats the earth at different rates and times. The variance in temperature throughout the earth generates pressure disparities that in turn drive the movement of air. Air has mass and when a mass is put in motion it contains what is called kinetic energy, much like a baseball thrown by a pitcher.\nHumans have used wind energy for centuries to drive pumps and mills by taking the kinetic energy and converting it to mechanical energy through the use of windmills. This same concept is used to convert kinetic energy into electrical energy through the use of wind turbines.\nA wind turbine is a machine that harnesses the kinetic energy in the wind and converts it to electrical energy. Mechanical energy created by its rotating blades turns a generator that creates electricity. A typical wind turbine consists of the following features:\n- Rotor Blades – rotate in response to the wind and are attached to the rotor hub\n- Rotor Hub – connected to a gearbox and generator inside the nacelle\n- Generator – converts mechanical energy into electricity\n- Nacelle – houses the mechanical and electrical components of the turbine\n- Tower – used to elevate the nacelle, hub, and blades so to reach greater wind\nA kW (kilo-watt) is a rate of energy production or consumption, and a kWh (kilo-watt-hour) is a unit of energy. Think of it like driving in your car. Miles per hour is a rate at which you produce distance with your car and a mile is a unit of distance. For example if you drive for 1 hour at 60 miles per hour you have traveled a total of 60 miles. Similarly if you produce 60 kW of power for an hour you have produced a total of 60 kWh.\nThe joint venture, First State Marine Wind, is a partnership between University of Delaware-owned Blue Hen Wind and Gamesa USA. Other project partners include the City of Lewes and Sustainable Energy Developments Inc.\nUD officials chose wind power to meet its commitment to reduce its carbon footprint due to the favorable winds in the coastal area of Lewes and also for the educational and research opportunities it presents.\nOne hundred percent of the campus' electricity is provided by wind power though this project, thus meeting all the campus' electricity needs with no net carbon emissions and making it a model for other institutions in the nation. At times, the turbine generates more than enough power for the campus; the excess is fed to the electric grid for use by others in Lewes.\nIn addition to providing carbon-free electricity, the project enhances research in areas such as turbine corrosion, avian impacts, and policy issues related to renewable energy. Information gained from the project is helping the university and Gamesa work toward establishing the first offshore wind turbine in the Americas.\nThe size of wind turbines varies and is directly related to their designed electrical output. The University of Delaware turbine is a 2-megawatt (2-MW) machine, which stands approximately 400 feet high from its tower base to the apex of its blade at peak rotation. Each of the turbine's three blades is approximately 140 feet long.\nConstruction began in March 2010; the turbine was fully operational three months later.\nThe amount of electricity produced by one turbine depends on its size and quality of wind resource. A typical 2-megawatt turbine, when placed in an appropriate wind resource, can provide enough emissions-free electricity to power about 500 average homes for a full year.\nUD’s turbine generates varying amounts of energy throughout the year — there is more wind available for the turbine in Lewes during the winter than in the summer, for example. Regardless of such fluctuations, the turbine produces more than enough power to support the six buildings at the Lewes campus over the course of a year.\nWhile the blades do spin at variable speeds, the range of speeds is very limited. The blades turn anywhere from nine to 19 revolutions per minute.\nThere are three reasons why the blades might not be spinning: 1) There is not enough wind. The turbine is programmed to begin generating electricity when the hub-height wind speed reaches 8 miles per hour. 2) The turbine is in need of or undergoing maintenance. Like your car, the wind turbine undergoes regularly scheduled maintenance; at other times, unscheduled events occur that require turbine maintenance. For safety purposes, the blades are stopped when technicians work on the turbine. 3) For some research projects, such as the avian and bat study currently under way, technicians must climb the tower to mount a device.\nTraditional fossil fuel-generated electricity requires consistent input of a fuel; typically oil, gas, or coal. These non-renewable resources must be located, extracted, transported, processed, burned, and the waste treated and removed. Each of these processes costs money throughout the life of the generating plant. Wind turbines simply use the force of the wind as fuel, and only require periodic maintenance. As fossil fuel resources decline and their costs increase, proven technologies such as wind energy have become an attractive long-term electricity solution. If we look at all forms of electricity generation stripped of the apparent and hidden subsidies, then wind power is competitive.\nLike any large and complex machine, wind turbines require monitoring and periodic maintenance to keep them operational. Wind turbine vendors seldom warranty their machines for longer than 2 years, so it is important to have a plan for maintenance.\nWith advances in the engineering and manufacturing of wind turbines, the noise generated by wind turbines has been greatly reduced. Any noise generated is usually from the mechanical components, electric power conditioning, and the blades moving through the air. All modern wind turbine manufacturers design their wind turbines with particular attention to minimizing noise. Siting the turbine at an appropriate distance from occupied buildings also minimizes any potential disturbance from turbine noise.\nPre-construction and post-construction sound studies were undertaken with this project. The pre-construction study concluded that the sound from the wind turbine would be well below Delaware regulations, which limit absolute sound levels and sound levels in relation to background ambient sound. The post-construction study confirmed that the wind turbine complies with state law.\nPrior to constructing its wind turbine in Lewes, the University of Delaware engaged experts to conduct several studies, including ones on avian and acoustic effects. UD also reviewed additional studies and reports, and held meetings in the community to identify potential concerns of nearby residents. UD also attended City Council and Lewes Board of Public Works meetings where the wind turbine was on the agenda and discussed. Visit our Background Documents page to learn more about the studies.\nThe UD wind turbine was created for research purposes, and several projects have taken place. A study on the turbine's effects on birds and bats was completed, and a corrosion study shed light on salt water's effect on sea-based wind turbines is taking place near the base of the wind turbine. So far, studies on the turbine cross many disciplines and involve a microbiologist, ecologists, marine physicists, engineers, and marine policy specialists. Check our news page for the latest updates on projects.\nRepairing wind turbines is very costly. Such efforts can require a crane and other expensive equipment in addition to the purchase of replacement parts. For that reason, wind turbines are designed to be very reliable, low-maintenance machines. While there are electrical or component failures of wind turbines, overall turbines are some of the most reliable machines available today. To ensure the UD wind turbine’s reliability, Gamesa is servicing the wind turbine under an operation and maintenance agreement. Two UD personnel have received maintenance training as well.\nAlthough wind turbines do have an environmental cost, it is very minimal when compared to traditional sources of electricity. For example, a Danish study that looked at an offshore wind farm's effect on wildlife found an average of about three bird deaths per year per turbine. Birds tended to avoid the turbines by flying above, below, or around them, though the birds mostly flew around the whole wind farm. Such effects on the environment are relatively small when, for example, compared to oil spills that can kill birds and other animals, mountain mining of coal, air pollution from power plants that can harm both wildlife and humans, entrainment and mortality of fish by hydroelectric dams, and nuclear waste. Wind turbines do impact wildlife; however, and that is the reason UD scientists are trying to better understand a wind turbine's effect on birds and bats.""]"	['<urn:uuid:eceebe01-3f1c-4915-b500-e28b3ca7df17>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	8	26	1626
16	How are karst environments protected?	Karst environments are protected through various measures including the establishment of conservation reserves and national parks, with examples like Wombeyan Caves (protected since 1865) and Jenolan Caves (1866). In Texas, protection is provided through Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) which include measures like gating cave entrances, routine inspections, restricting recreational use, managing vegetation, and controlling fire ants.	"[""'Karst' is a distinct landform shaped largely by the dissolving action of water on carbonate rock such as limestone, dolomite and marble. This process typically occurs over thousands or millions of years, resulting in a variety of surface and below-ground features, including gorges, sinkholes, underground streams and caves.\nKarst features interact with the environment to produce complex ecosystems supporting plants, animals and micro-organisms which, in many cases, are unable to survive elsewhere. These species contribute to NSW biodiversity.\nNSW karst environments are among the oldest and most complex in the world, giving them outstanding national and international importance. They contain geological features and processes which indicate their exposure to a vast range of natural processes. They may also have special meaning to Aboriginal people as past sources of food and shelter and as places for ceremony.\nThe majority of NSW karst environments occur in limestone and can be found in over one hundred separate locations throughout the state. These environments are recognised as having one of the most complex processes of cave evolution and development seen so far.\nCaves are a well-known feature of karst environments and typically form in two ways:\n- from surface streams finding their way through cracks in the ground and forming underground rivers\n- by groundwater rising up through cracks in rocks under the influence of heat and pressure, dissolving out mazes and rounded chambers.\nCaves provide critical habitat for a variety of plant and animal communities and are nature's time capsules, preserving evidence of past life, climates and earth-forming processes. Caves are highly valued by the community as places for recreation, shelter and refuge and provide water for more than a quarter of the world's population.\nProtection and conservation\nKarst landforms or environments consist of geological and biological features which are highly sensitive to change because:\n- on the surface, their thin layers of soil make it is easy for them to erode and become infested with weeds\n- below ground, the many solution tubes and water-filled fissures can quickly spread pollution and disease\n- their features and animals need very specific conditions to survive and natural karst processes to continue.\nKarst environments in New South Wales were among the earliest protected areas in the world. The Wombeyan Caveswere reserved for the purposes of leisure and cave preservation in 1865, followed by the Jenolan Caves in 1866, both before the declaration of the world's first national park (Yellowstone) in 1872.\nWe're responsible for over 40 karst environments (PDF 446KB), including 15 sites on World Heritage properties and four karst conservation reserves.\nKarst conservation reserves, which recognise the sensitivity of karst environments and their special management requirements, have been established at the cave sites of:\nClose to half of our cavernous karst environments are protected in national parks or reserves.\nSome, like the Jenolan Karst Conservation Reserve, have extensive cave systems which are the focus for tourism and research activities and provide critical habitat for migratory bats and other cave-dependent animals.\nOur research into karst environments informs our conservation activities and helps us understand the complex interactions between surface and below-ground environments. We have information available to help prospective researchers in developing research proposals.\nWe work with other government agencies, the community and volunteer organisations on a range of karst-related issues. We also consult with experts via the Karst Management Advisory Committee on matters relating to conserving and managing karst areas."", '- ES Home\n- What We Do\n- Candidate Conservation\n- Listing and Critical Habitat\n- For Landowners\n- About Us\n- FWS Regions\n- Laws & Policies\n- For Kids\nDeep in the Heart of Texas\nPhoto credit: Luela Roberts/USFWS\nBy Luela P. Roberts\nThe biologically diverse Texas Hill Country, composed of a wide swath of the Edwards Plateau west of the Balcones Escarpment, is home to 9 endangered species (3 birds and 6 karst invertebrates), more than 70 other rare animal and plant species, and a wide diversity of common species. This wild and beautiful area, with its mild climate and usually plentiful water, is dominated by shallow topsoil overlying limestone deposits up to 10,000 feet (3,050 meters) deep. It is also home to more Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) than any other region of the United States.\nPhoto Credit: Luela Roberts/USFWS\nKarst features are formed by the dissolution of calcium carbonate in limestone bedrock by mildly acidic groundwater. They can take the form of caves, sinkholes, cracks, and crevices that may or may not be interconnected. Most karst features are too small for humans to enter. Although some may contribute to the recharge of underground stream systems, most in this region are considered “dry” because they have little, if any, perennial water flow or small catchment areas for surface run-off. However, humidity is often near 100 percent in these karst features and the temperature is relatively constant. Because of the absence of light for photosynthesis, cave dwellers depend on food and energy in the form of invertebrates and other animals from the surface, animal droppings, and leaf litter washing in from the cave entrance. Cave crickets and harvestmen or ""daddy longlegs"" that live inside the caves during the day and feed outside the caves at night contribute important nutrients to the cave ecosystem. Raccoons and other small animals that hide and den in the caves are also very important contributors. Raccoon feces provide a growth medium for bacteria and fungi that supports a minute prey species (springtails). Surface plant materials also provide buffers against temperature and moisture changes.\nAll six endangered karst invertebrates in the Texas Hill Country are troglobites that spend their entire existence underground and have adaptations to subterranean environments, including small or absent eyes and elongated appendages. The Tooth Cave spider (Neoleptoneta myopica) is a small, whitish, long-legged spider with obsolescent eyes. The Tooth Cave pseudoscorpion (Tartarocreagris texana) is a large, eyeless pseudoscorpion with elongated appendages. The Bee Creek Cave harvestman (Texella reddelli) is an orange daddy longlegs with an increased leg/body ratio and well developed eyes, while the Bone Cave harvestman (Texella reyesi) is long-legged, pale orange, and blind. The Kretchmarr Cave mold beetle (Texamaurops reddelli) is a small, longlegged, and shiny reddish-brown beetle without eyes. Also reddish-brown, the Tooth Cave ground beetle (Rhadine persephone) is more robust than other species of the subterranean group.\nPhoto Credit: Wyman Meinzer/USFWS\nHistorically, many cave entrances were blocked or covered to prevent injuries to livestock and eliminate hiding places for predatory animals. The greatest threat to these endangered karst invertebrates is habitat loss or degradation due to urban encroachment. Urban development in karst areas can cause caves to collapse or be filled in, change surface plant and animal communities, Service biologist and expose caves to contamination. Development can also alter drainage patterns, and increases in human population can expose caves to damaging exploration and vandalism.\nExotic plants or impervious cover often replace native vegetation near karst features. The absence of native plants may result in increased temperature and humidity fluctuations, lead to sediment build-up in caves, and promote infestations of non-native red fire ants (Solenopsis invicta), which prefer open areas where soils have been disturbed. Fire ants prey on karst invertebrates and the surface community food base upon which the karst species depend. The use of pesticides or fertilizers can also adversely effect or eliminate species when applied inappropriately. Additionally, changes in drainage patterns can cause flooding and the loss of air-breathing karst species, or can desiccate the cave by the diversion of water. Karst features with low humidity levels are usually devoid of fauna, suggesting that humidity may be a key factor in the survival of these cave invertebrates.\nSeveral HCPs in central Texas cover one or more of the endangered karst species. The Buttercup Creek HCP, for example, was developed for the protection of the Tooth Cave ground beetle. This tiny animal is endemic to only a few karst features within a small area near the City of Cedar Park in Williamson County. The Buttercup Creek HCP ensures that 12 separate cave preserve areas totaling 130 acres (53 hectares) and 2 greenbelt floodplain areas comprising 33 acres (13 hectares) will be protected and monitored in perpetuity. Many other species inhabiting these areas will benefit as well. Conservation measures include gating significant cave entrances, routine inspections and maintenance work, restrictions on recreational use of some areas (with no public access to the most sensitive sites), vegetation management to control noxious non-native plants and excess growths of juniper, and control of fire ants. Any unforeseen circumstances, such as storm damage, vandalism, or wildfires at the cave preserves, will be addressed immediately to limit potential damage.\nKarst ecosystems are a rich part of the biodiversity of central Texas that could have been lost without the protection provided for by HCPs and private landowner participation. The Service thanks the citizens of central Texas for their contributions to these conservation efforts.\nLuela Roberts is a Fish and Wildlife Biologist in the Service’s Albuquerque, New Mexico, Regional Office.\nWhat We Do\n- Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs)\n- Safe Harbor Agreements\n- Candidate Conservation Agreements\n- Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances\n- Recovery Credits and Tax Deductions\n- Conservation Banking\n- Conservation Plans Database\n- Information, Planning and Conservation System (IPaC)\n- Recovery Online Activity Reporting System (ROAR)\n- News Stories\n- Featured Species\n- Recovery Success Stories\n- Endangered Species Bulletin\n- Partnership Stories']"	['<urn:uuid:3607efc3-0e0e-4231-900b-ea14719002d3>', '<urn:uuid:56e5418f-ea04-4941-9aa2-57ee722e6cdb>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	5	56	1559
17	How do robots use hydraulics and pneumatics to move?	Robots use both hydraulic and pneumatic systems as actuators to create movement. Hydraulic actuators work by compressing liquid (like water or mineral oil) and are used for low speed and high load applications. Pneumatic actuators, on the other hand, rely on compressed air or gas and work by expanding when inflated and contracting when deflated, making them suitable for low speed and low/medium load applications. In humanoid robots, these actuators function similar to human muscles and joints, though with a different structure. They are placed at strategic points to guide the robots in moving and making gestures. Hydraulic actuators are typically used in larger robots and industrial machinery, while pneumatic actuators are better for smaller tools and precise movements.	['The use of humanoid robots is becoming widespread all over the world. Humanoid robots are designed to mimic the human body and differ from other kinds of robots such as industrial ones in that their movement is human-like, based on legged locomotion, especially biped gait. They move about the “real world” and interact with it, performing a growing diversity of specialized and everyday tasks, unlike factory manipulators and other robots that work in highly structured environments.\nSignificantly, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) plans to send a humanoid robot into space towards 2020-end as part of a crewless mission. The humanoid called Vyommitra, a legless female robot, will help ISRO prepare for its Gaganyaan manned space flight mission, the country’s first attempt at sending humans into space slated for 2022. Before accomplishing this mission, ISRO will send Vyommitra, which can speak but doesn’t move much, into space.\nWhat’s a humanoid robot?\nA humanoid robot’s overall appearance and body shape is built to resemble the human body. Generally, humanoid robots have a torso with a head, arms, and legs, though some of their types may have only some specific human parts, for instance, from the waist up. Some forms of robots have heads designed to replicate human facial features such as the face, eyes, and mouth. Humanoid robots built to aesthetically resemble a male human are termed as androids, while female counterparts are called Gynoids.\nLeonardo Da Vinci is credited with creating one of the earliest forms of humanoids in 1495. Modeled on an armor suit, it could perform several human functions such as sitting, standing, and walking.\nHow do humanoids move, talk, and carry out actions?\nInventors and engineers study the human body structure and behavior (biomechanics) and attempt to simulate human cognition, which relies on sensory information to acquire perceptual and motor skills. First-grade sensors and actuators are deployed to enable humanoids to perform multiple functions. Based on computational models of human behavior, the sensors aid robots in sensing their environments, while cameras allow them to see clearly. Motors or actuators placed at strategic points guide these robots in moving and making gestures. Creating their fully functional and realistic versions necessitates the following mechanisms:\nSensors measure attributes of the human world. Besides the essential requirements of planning and control, sensing plays a significant role in robotic paradigms. To help the humanoids sense their environment, sensors empower them with the ability to touch, smell, sight, hear, and balance themselves properly.\nWhile the hearing sensor helps humanoids hear, decipher, and carry out instructions. Thanks to the touch sensor, they are prevented from bumping into things and causing self-damage. A force sensor helps them maintain balance and orientation, and heat and pain sensors enable them to know the impending harm or damage. Also, there are facial sensors that make humanoids capable of a wide range of expressions. Therefore, sensors can be categorized under the physical process with which they work or according to the type of sensory information that they give as output.\nScientists are continually working to make the sensors more efficient for accomplishing multiple tasks. They have turned their gaze on proprioceptive sensors (e.g., touch, muscle extension, limb position) to sense the position, the orientation, and the speed of the humanoid’s body and joints. Some of the areas that have received increasing emphasis include: accelerometers to measure the speed from which velocity can be computed by way of integration; tilt sensors to measure inclination; and force sensors placed in robot’s hands as well as feet to measure contact force with the environment.\nAttention has also been given to position sensors that indicate the actual position of the robot (from which the velocity can be calculated by derivation) or even speed sensors. Tactile sensors provide information about forces and torques transferred between the robot and other objects; they use arrays of tactels to provide data on what has been touched.\nIn humanoid robots, vision sensors work to recognize objects and determine their properties. CCD cameras, which use the electromagnetic spectrum to produce an image, are used as the sight faculty of humanoids. Usually, microphones are deployed to enable the functionality of sound sensors that allow the robots to hear speech and environmental sounds.\nActuators or motors\nActuators or the motors responsible for motion in the robot, help robots move and make gestures akin to the flexible human body. Strong, efficient actuators can perform a wide range of actions, much like humans or even better.\nHumanoid robots mainly utilize rotary actuators that perform human motions, much like muscles and joints, though with a different structure. Actuators can be either hydraulic, electric, piezoelectric, ultrasonic, or pneumatic.\nHydraulic actuators operate at low speed and high load applications. Electric coreless motor actuators are better suited for high speed and low load applications, though both can only be made to act in a compliant manner through rigid control strategies.\nPiezoelectric actuators, on the other hand, can produce a small movement with a high force capability after the application of voltage. They are capable of ultra-precise positioning and for generating and handling high forces or pressures in static or dynamic situations.\nUltrasonic actuators generate movements in a micrometer order at ultrasonic frequencies (over 20 kHz). They can be used for controlling vibration, positioning applications, and quick switching.\nPneumatic actuators rely upon gas compressibility to function. Inflated, they expand along the axis, and when deflated, they contract. When one of their ends is fixed, the other will move in a linear trajectory. Intended for low speed and low/medium load applications, pneumatic actuators comprise cylinders, bellows, pneumatic engines, pneumatic stepper motors, and pneumatic artificial muscles.\nAfter the mechanisms that imitate human body parts are put in place, inventors program the instructions and codes that would enable the humanoids to carry out specific functions. Powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), they can glide around and give replies when asked questions.\nAI is critical to enhancing the level at which humanoid robots can interact with humans. It can make them decipher commands, questions, indication, even understand random, ambiguous statements and give replies laced with wit and sarcasm.\nFunctions of humanoid robots\nInitially, AI was utilized in humanoids for research and experimental tools in several scientific areas such as the study of bipedal locomotion to explore ways to create leg prosthesis, ankle-foot orthosis, biological realistic leg prosthesis, and forearm prosthesis for the neuromuscularly impaired. Some were created for entertainment purposes of singing, playing music, dancing, and speak to audiences.\nNow, the aim of humanoids has extended beyond research and experimentation to functional purposes such as performing various human tasks, such as interacting with human tools and environments and occupying different roles in the employment sector. They are an increasingly common feature in the workplace and can perform human tasks and act as personal assistants, receptionists, front desk officers, and automotive manufacturing line workers. They can help out at homes to assist the sick and elderly as household helps and nursing assistants, perform dirty or dangerous jobs, play and use tools, operate equipment and vehicles designed for the human form.\nThese life-like robots could also prove useful in helping out the children, or any person who needs assistance with day-to-day tasks or interactions. There have been many studies pointing out the effectiveness of humanoid robots supporting children with autism.\nIt has been decided by various countries to send humanoid robots for dangerous and distant space exploration missions, without needing to turn back around again and return to the Earth once the mission is completed. In essence, robots can perform any task a human being can, thanks to AI algorithms.\nScientists are striving to reduce energy consumption in humanoid movements. In this context, studies on dynamics, control, and stabilization of walking biped robots on the surface have acquired crucial importance. Equally important is the maintenance of the robot’s gravity center over the center of the bearing area for providing a stable position.\nAs a humanoid needs information about contact force and its current and desired motion to maintain dynamic balance during the walk, the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) is an essential balancing approach that has been receiving the attention of inventors. Also, they are focussing on planning and control to allow humanoids to move in complex environments, armed with the knowledge of self-collision detection, path planning, and obstacle avoidance.\nHumanoid robots include structures with variable flexibility that provide safety to the robot itself as well as to the people, more degrees of freedom, and wide task availability. To optimize these functionalities, scientists plan to further hone planning and control strategies in the functioning of robots.\nEngineers at MIT and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have developed a method to control balance in a two-legged, teleoperated robot. It marks an essential step toward enabling a humanoid to carry out high-impact tasks in challenging environments. The robot is controlled remotely by a human operator donning a vest that relays information about the human’s motion and ground reaction forces to the robot. Through the vest, the human operator can direct the robot’s locomotion and feel its motions too. If the human feels that the robot is starting to tip over, she can adjust in a way to rebalance both herself and the robot.\nIn Japan, Prof Hiroshi Ishiguro of Osaka University and his team members have developed a humanoid robot with the ability of a human-like conversation. In the ERATO ISHIGURO symbiotic human-robot interaction project, they focused on the affinity process that emerges during the movement of the robot with a human. Towards this end, they developed a child-like android named “ibuki” who could walk together with the human by using equipped wheels.\nHumanoid robots can talk like us, walk like us, and express a wide range of emotions. Some of them can engage in a conversation; others can recall the last interaction you had with them. With constant advancements in AI, humanoid robots are all set to acquire more developed human attributes and competencies. Advanced android robotics is all set to facilitate the dramatic enhancement of life going forward.', 'Hydraulic and pneumatic systems are integral to the operation of cars, trucks, buses, aircraft, and other vehicles. These systems power everything from braking and steering to heating and air conditioning. However, there are some essential differences between hydraulics vs. pneumatics.\nHydraulic systems compress liquid, are used for industrial machinery, cost about $10,000, and produce around 6,500 PSI. Pneumatic systems compress gas or air, are used for smaller tools, cost approximately $1,500, and generate about 120 PSI. Overall, hydraulics are better for large jobs, while pneumatics can handle the small ones.\nIn this article, we’ll discuss the ins and outs of hydraulics and pneumatics, what each system is used for, and their pros and cons!\nWhat Is a Hydraulic System?\nThe first type of system we’re going to dive into is hydraulics.\nA hydraulic system, or hydraulic power system, uses pressurized fluid to power the moving parts of a machine. Hydraulics pumps relatively incompressible liquids at extremely high pressures using valves and actuators. The average operating pound-force per square inch of a hydraulic system is 6,500 PSI.\nHydraulic systems are often paired with at least one other kind of power system. For example, some cars use hydraulics to power their steering and braking and use electric motors and gasoline to power the engine. Note that these systems are typically seen on heavy-duty vehicles like construction equipment, aircraft, or elevators.\nHydraulics use engineering and physics principles (think Pascal’s Law) to transfer force from one end to another- effectively, like a seesaw. If one end of the seesaw is pushed down, the other end moves up as a result. This allows for machinery to lift cumbersome pieces of equipment without much effort.\nSubstance Used in a Hydraulic System\nThere are a few different substances that can be used in a hydraulic system to create force or motion.\nThe fluids hydraulics use include water, mineral oil, water emulsion, or ethylene glycol. In order to translate the fluid into power, you need a pump- this is usually a piston pump powered by a motor.\nHydraulics also require a filter to remove particles from the hydraulic fluid before they clog any components of the system.\nParts of a Hydraulic System\nBecause hydraulics involves storing and pressurizing liquid material, hydraulic machines are usually incredibly large and intricate.\nThe main components in a hydraulic system are:\n- Hydraulic pump\n- Reservoir for hydraulic fluid\n- Directional control valve\n- Flow control valve\n- Pressure relief valve\n- Other connecting pipes and wires\nThese parts work like a well-oiled machine (no pun intended) to ensure that your piece of equipment has adequate power.\nWhat Are Hydraulics Used For?\nLike I mentioned above, hydraulic machines are typically big and more complex and are used to power large industrial equipment.\nSome areas where hydraulics are used include:\n- Lifts (fork, elevator, wheelchair, and car)\n- Amusement parks\n- Gasoline pumps\n- Cars (braking and steering systems)\n- Hairdresser/office chairs\n- Boat rudders\n- Other industrial equipment (like on a construction site)\nThese are just a few of the places you might see a hydraulic system at work in your everyday life!\nPros of Hydraulics\nThere are a few advantages a hydraulic system has over a pneumatic one.\nA hydraulic system is usually better at doing the heavy lifting- there are a variety of sizes to accommodate your industrial needs. This has led to hydraulic systems becoming the preferred choice in a wide range of commercial applications.\nOther pros include:\n- Multitasking abilities (they cool, power, and grease a piece of machinery at any given time)\n- More power generated from comparatively smaller actuators\n- Constant torque and force regardless of speed\n- Longer operating time and more reliability due to the design\n- Fewer parts and less maintenance required\nThese are all critical benefits when deciding what system is suitable for your specific needs.\nCons of Hydraulics\nWhile there are many advantages to using hydraulics, they do have some disadvantages.\nA hydraulic system has the potential to leak fluid everywhere, which is why it’s imperative to make sure everything in your machine is adequately sealed and in good working order.\nOther cons include:\n- The expense (the machines can be pricey and more energy is required to operate them).\n- Filtering oils, which can get messy\n- Being prone to leaks, which results in a lack of proper fluids rendering the entire machine nonfunctional\n- Fire hazard (created by oil leaks)\n- Loud operating sounds if air bubbles get into the system\nThe concept of hydraulics is also relatively complex and requires someone with a decent understanding of engineering to set up and use the machine properly. If you don’t know what you’re doing, the pressure in your machine can cause severe damage.\nCost of a Hydraulic System\nThe overall cost of a hydraulic system can get pretty expensive.\nIt’s not uncommon for an industrial-sized hydraulic system to cost upwards of $10,000.\nThe reasons behind this are that the machine needs to be custom-built, with most parts and pieces assembled on site. Additionally, the oil or substance used can get pricey.\nYou must also consider what mammoth machines hydraulic systems are; the energy required to power them is unmatched.\nWhat Is a Pneumatic System?\nThe second type of system is powered by pneumatics.\nPneumatic systems, also called compressed-air systems, use air or gas under pressure to provide mechanical energy for engines or other machines. Pneumatic systems power small, oscillating saws in the OR or medium-sized power tools in your garage. The average operating pound-force per square inch of a pneumatic system is 95 PSI.\nPneumatics utilizes an air compressor to reduce the amount of air to increase its pressure. The compressed air is then pushed through a filter into the tubing. Here it is controlled by valves and an actuator, which converts it into power for your devices.\nOverall, a pneumatic system is easier to operate, less expensive, and smaller in stature than a hydraulic system. That being said, it can’t handle as much weight or pressure. Because this system uses a compressed gas at lower pressures than hydraulics in order to operate, it’s best suited for smaller and lighter projects.\nSubstance Used in a Pneumatic System\nTypically, there are 3 inert gases used in pneumatics.\nThe substances used in a pneumatic system include compressed air, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide.\nCompressed air is usually used in commercial settings; it’s freely available and less combustible than regular oxygen. Nitrogen is the least reactive and most commonly used because it can be easily stored. Lastly, carbon dioxide is less popular because it quickly turns from gas to liquid and can cause suffocation in a closed space.\nParts of a Pneumatic System\nPneumatics is far less complicated than hydraulics; therefore, the parts are smaller and easier to learn.\nThe main components in a pneumatic system are:\n- Air hoses\n- Gauges (or regulators)\n- Check valve\n- Pressure relief valve\nAll of these parts work together to power your tools.\nWhat Are Pneumatics Used For?\nAs described above, pneumatic systems are typically used for small tools and machinery because of their limited pressure capabilities.\nPneumatic systems are great for equipment actions that include gripping, positioning, clamping, or repetitive movements. They are also able to tension or press.\nSome areas where pneumatics are used include:\n- Tire pressure gauges\n- Nail guns\n- Vacuum cleaners\n- The anti-slam feature on doors and drawers\n- Air compressors\n- AC systems\n- Drills and saws utilized by surgeons\nPneumatics can also be used as a direct-acting system on small loads that require exact precision, making them an attractive option across all industries.\nPros of Pneumatics\nWhile pneumatic systems are usually smaller, there are some advantages they have over hydraulics.\nSome pros include:\n- Lower PSIs reached, so safer to use (especially for novices)\n- More cost-effective (the machines and the energy used to power these machines are less expensive)\n- Smaller and can be portable (come in many sizes and pressure capabilities)\n- Utilizing compressed air results in less of a safety hazard\n- The power supply of compressed air or gas is much cleaner than oil (great for sterile environments like surgery)\nOverall, if you’re looking for a reliable energy source that needs fewer than 120 PSI, choose a pneumatic system.\nCons of Pneumatics\nFor the many advantages, there are a few downsides to using pneumatics.\nThe first disadvantage is that a pneumatic system will not be able to supply the high pressure needed to power large machinery. Therefore, it’s unsuitable for heavy loads or large projects because pneumatic systems can’t handle them.\nOther cons include:\n- Limited PSI capabilities\n- Sensitive to temperature change\n- Prone to air leaks if not secure (this can cause energy loss)\n- Hoses can corrode (if they’re not made of stainless steel) if they’re exposed to the outside conditions\nCost of a Pneumatic System\nBecause pneumatic systems are generally tiny in comparison to hydraulic systems, they are much less costly.\nAn average pneumatic system costs around $1,500.\nFor that small cost, you’ll be able to power your garage equipment and small machinery easily!\nThe Main Differences Between Hydraulics and Pneumatics\nWhen you compare hydraulic vs. pneumatic, you’ll notice a few key differences between how they operate and what they’re capable of.\nThe main difference is that pneumatics use compressed air and gas for force, while hydraulics use relatively incompressible liquid. Hydraulic systems are much more substantial and have a capability of over 5,000 PSI, perfect for industrial settings.\nPneumatic systems are used for smaller tools that require 100 PSI or less, ideal for sterile environments.\n- Top Chicago Pneumatic Air Compressors | List & Reviews\n- Central Pneumatic Air Compressor Not Building Pressure?\nWhen considering hydraulic vs. pneumatic, it’s essential to consider the applications and advantages of each.\nIf you’re looking at larger tasks, like construction projects that require heavy-duty tools and equipment, then a hydraulic system may be the best option. Hydraulic systems are more expensive than pneumatics, but they can generate around 6500 PSI of pressure and cost $10,000.\nFor smaller jobs with less demand on power generation capabilities (like saws or drills in home workshops), a pneumatic system might work better. Pneumatics are cheaper and produce less PSI.\nSo, which one is right for your job?']	['<urn:uuid:0ad66357-c679-40aa-a400-ecbf874f16ac>', '<urn:uuid:346c9595-24da-49b2-84f9-4281ab63d3eb>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	9	119	3393
18	As a medical researcher, I'm investigating links between respiratory tract anatomy and infection patterns - what's the connection between the tract's structural features and its disease manifestations?	The respiratory tract's structure directly influences infection patterns. The upper tract (nose, pharynx, larynx) filters, warms and humidifies air through nose hairs and mucous secretions, while the lower tract (trachea, bronchi, lungs) contains cartilaginous rings and alveoli for gas exchange. Upper tract infections like rhinitis and pharyngitis are usually viral and benign, affecting the filtering and protective structures. Lower tract infections are more severe because they impact the vital gas exchange structures in bronchioles and air sacs, which are more susceptible to bacterial infections and require antibiotic treatment. The anatomical differences thus determine both the type of pathogens that can infect each region and the severity of resulting infections.	"['Cells utilize oxygen for metabolism and energy production. Carbon dioxide, which is harmful, is also released during these catabolic reactions. Thus, it is evident that oxygen has to be continuously provided to the cells and simultaneously carbon dioxide produced by the cells has to be released out. This process of exchanging oxygen from the atmosphere with the carbon dioxide produced by the cells is known as breathing or respiration. The respiratory system ensures the gaseous exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and thus is vital to life.\nThe Human Respiratory System\nWe have a well-developed respiratory system comprising two lungs and associated air passages to perform the function of exchange of respiratory gasses. Air is warmed, moistened and filtered as it moves along the respiratory passages.\nThe respiratory tract extends from the nose to the lungs. It is mainly divided into two parts, the Upper Respiratory Tract and the Lower Respiratory Tract. The upper respiratory tract consists of the nose and the pharynx, while the lower respiratory tract includes the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs.\nUpper Respiratory Tract: The upper respiratory tract consists of nostrils, nasal cavities, pharynx, epiglottis, and larynx. Its main function is to receive the air from the external environment. Lungs being very delicate organs, the air is filtered, warmed, and humidified before reaching the lungs. It is the lungs where the actual gaseous exchange takes place. As the air enters nostrils of the nose, it is filtered by the nose hairs to some extent before passing into the nasal cavity. The epithelial tissue of the nasal cavity warms the air and further filters the air by secretion of mucous. At the same time, the endothelial lining of the nasal cavity transports dust and other foreign particles, trapped in mucous, to the back of the nasal cavity. Mucus is then either coughed out or swallowed and digested by the stomach acids. Through the nasal cavity air then passes into the pharynx and larynx.\nLower Respiratory Tract: The lower respiratory tract commences at the larynx. It is inclusive of the trachea, two bronchi that branch from the trachea, and mainly the lungs. The larynx is also known as the voice box. It is responsible for sound production as it houses the vocal cords. It is located in the neck below the point where the tract of the pharynx splits into the trachea and the esophagus. The larynx helps protect the trachea. The larynx also contains the epiglottis, which is a flap of cartilage situated at the opening to the larynx. The larynx closes while swallowing food in order to prevent the entry of swallowed material into the lungs. A strong cough reflex is stimulated by an ingested material in order to protect the lungs.\nVocalization occurs when air passes through the folds of vocal cords making them stretch and vibrate. Thus we need air for the functioning of the larynx and production of sound.\nThe trachea is a straight tube like structure extending up to the mid-thoracic cavity. It divides at the level of 5th thoracic vertebra into right and left primary bronchi. Each bronchi undergoes repeated divisions to form the secondary and tertiary bronchi and bronchioles ending up in very thin terminal bronchioles. The tracheae, primary, secondary and tertiary bronchi, and initial bronchioles are supported by incomplete cartilaginous ‘C-shaped’ rings. Each terminal bronchiole gives rise to a number of very thin, irregular-walled and vascularised bag-like structures called alveoli. The branching network of bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli comprise the lungs.\nLungs: We have two lungs which are covered by a double-layered covering known as the pleura. In between the two pleural layers, there is pleural fluid, which helps to reduce friction on the lung surface. The outer pleural membrane is in close contact with the thoracic lining whereas the inner pleural membrane is in contact with the lung surface. The alveoli and their ducts form the respiratory or exchange part of the respiratory system. The upper part of the respiratory system transports the atmospheric air to the alveoli, clears it from foreign particles, humidifies, and also brings the air to body temperature. Actual diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between blood and atmospheric air takes place at the surface of the alveoli. The lungs are situated in the thoracic chamber which is anatomically an air-tight chamber. The thoracic chamber is protected from behind by the vertebral column, from the front by the sternum, laterally by the ribs and on the lower side of the dome-shaped diaphragm. The anatomical setup of lungs in the thorax is such that any change in the volume of the thoracic cavity will be reflected in the lung cavity. Such an arrangement is essential for breathing, as the pulmonary volume cannot be directly altered by us.\nFunctions of the Respiratory System:\n- Breathing / Ventilation: Breathing or respiration is the term used for the exchange of air between the atmosphere and the alveoli. It is also known as ventilation and takes place in two stages, inspiration, and expiration. During inspiration, atmospheric air is taken in while expiration alveolar air is released out. A pressure gradient is created between the lungs and the atmosphere, which causes this movement of air into and out of the lungs. Inspiration occurs when the pressure within the lungs is less than the atmospheric pressure, while expiration occurs when the intrapulmonary pressure is higher than the atmospheric pressure. The strength of inspiration and expiration can be increased with the assistance of additional abdominal muscles. On an average, breathing rate of a healthy human adult is 12-16 times per minute\n- External respiration: It is the exchange of gasses (oxygen and carbon dioxide) between inhaled air and the blood. Diffusion of gasses primarily takes place at the alveolar membrane. The rate of diffusion depends on the solubility of gasses and thickness of alveolar membranes. Various factors in our body assist the diffusion of oxygen into the peripheral tissues and diffusion of carbon dioxide from tissues into alveoli for expiration.\n- Internal respiration: Internal respiration involves the transport of gasses by the blood and exchange of these gasses between the blood and tissue fluids. Blood acts as a medium of transport for oxygen and carbon dioxide. The majority of the oxygen (97%) is transported by the red blood cells and a very small amount is transported in a dissolved state through the plasma. Oxygen binds to hemoglobin which is a pigment present in the RBCs. As for the carbon dioxide, a major fraction is carried as bicarbonate while only 20-25% is transported by the red blood cells. Carbon dioxide that is transported by the RBCs is also bound to the hemoglobin and is carried as carbamino-hemoglobin.\n- Cellular respiration: Diffusion of gasses between blood and tissues and utilization of oxygen by the cells for catabolic reactions and resultant release of carbon dioxide.\n- Regulation of the blood pH in coordination with the kidneys.\nRegulation of Respiration\nThe nervous system has the ability to moderate the respiratory rhythm. The respiratory rhythm needs to be moderated depending upon the demands of the body tissues. This is done by a specialized center in the brain by reducing the duration of inspiration which eventually alters the respiratory rate. The increase in carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions in the blood leads to the activation of a chemosensitive area that is present adjacent to the brain rhythm center. This area is highly sensitive to even a slight increase in the levels of carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions. Activation of this area sends a signal to the rhythm center in order to moderate the respiratory process thereby eliminating the harmful substances.\nDisorders of the Respiratory System\nLungs are located in a very moist environment. This, however, acts as a shortcoming as it provides a favorable environment for bacterial and viral growth which further leads to many respiratory illnesses. Our respiratory health can be adversely affected because of constant exposure to the harmful bacteria and viruses in our environment. Some of these infections are simple and can be treated easily, while others can be quite serious.\n- Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URI): Nasal cavities, pharynx, and larynx make up the upper respiratory tract. URI can spread from nasal cavities to sinuses, ears as well as larynx. Most common bacterial infection of the upper respiratory tract is the streptococcal infection also known as ‘strep throat’. Common symptoms of strep throat are high-grade fever, severe sore throat, white patches on a dark red throat, and stomach ache. Antibiotics are successful in complete resolution in most cases.\n- Tonsillitis: It is the infection and inflammation of the tonsils which are present in the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. They are sometimes called as adenoids. Frequent bouts of tonsillitis can make breathing difficult. In such cases, tonsillectomy or removal of tonsils is advised.\n- Laryngitis: It is the infection of the larynx that leads to hoarseness of voice. Normally it responds to treatment. However, if it is persistent for a long period of time and is not responsive to any medications, it could be a warning sign of cancer and requires further detailed evaluation by a physician.\n- Acute bronchitis: Whenever there is an infection of the bronchi it is known as bronchitis. Most of the times it is a bacterial infection that has occurred secondary to upper respiratory tract infection. Signs include a cough that expectorates and is rich in mucus and sometimes pus.\n- Pneumonia: It is a serious infection wherein the lungs are filled with fluid. It can be a bacterial or viral infection. High fever with chills, headache, and chest pain are the commonly seen symptoms. The extent of severity depends on the amount of fluid in the lungs.\n- Emphysema: It is a chronic disorder wherein alveolar walls are collapsed due to damage. Cigarette smoking is an important cause of damage. It effectively leads to a reduced respiratory surface area or the area where the exchange of gasses takes place, thus reducing the respiratory capacity.\n- Lung Fibrosis: It is seen as an occupational disorder in workers of certain industries, especially those involving grinding or stone-breaking. Long term inhalation of particles such as sand, asbestos, coal dust, or fiberglass can give rise to inflammation leading to fibrosis (proliferation of fibrous tissues), causing serious lung damage. Here the elasticity of lungs is reduced thus reducing the respiratory efficiency. Thus lungs cannot inflate properly and keep on deflating. Workers in such industries should wear protective masks.\n- Asthma: It is a difficulty in breathing causing wheezing due to inflammation of bronchi and bronchioles. These patients have bronchial inflammation which reduces the airway diameter. Wheezing and shortness of breath are classic symptoms of asthma.', ""Doctor insights on:\nWhose More Susceptible To Getting Upper Respiratory Tract Infections\nContact route, Body: It depends on two major categories: 1. How you get it: direct contact, respiratory contacts and how close you are to source i.E school, family member. 2.

Most common viruses: rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, coronavirus, and coxsackievirus.See 1 more doctor answer\nWhat is more serious of a disease, lower respiratory tract infections or upper respiratory tract infections?\nLower respiratory: Upper respiratory infections involve upper airways such as throat, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, eustachian tubes, trachea as, nd bronchi. When the disease process in the bronchi, or bronchitis, continues, it could begin to involve lower airways in the lung tissues, which is then more advanced lower respiratory infections or pneumonia.See 1 more doctor answer\nWhy is viral upper respiratory tract infections usually benign and that of lower respiratory severe? Explanations please?\nDifferent causes: The upper respiratory tract (nose, throat, upper airways) are usually infected by viruses. While annoying, these viruses can be cleared by our immune systems without much problem. The lower respiratory tract (bronchioles and air sacs of the lung) are more susceptible to more serious bacterial infections. These often require antibiotics to clear the infection.\nSee below: An infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract.

19	What are the key differences in the architectural significance between the Armenian Monastic Ensembles of Iran and the Taj Mahal when considering their cultural and religious importance?	The Armenian Monastic Ensembles and the Taj Mahal represent different religious and cultural significances. The Armenian Monastic Ensembles, consisting of three complexes in northwestern Iran (St Thaddeus, St Stepanos, and Chapel of Dzordzorn), are important Christian monuments, with St Thaddeus believed to be the tomb location of Jesus Christ's apostle. In contrast, the Taj Mahal was built as an Islamic mausoleum by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal is renowned for its Indo-Islamic architectural style, perfect harmony, and symmetry, requiring 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants for its construction. It represents the finest architectural and artistic achievement in Indo-Islamic sepulchral architecture.	['As one of the most ancient countries of the world, Iran is a perfect destination for people who are inspired by history. After the latest edition (2019) of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Iran, Iran has now 24 World Heritage Sites listed.\nWhat does UNESCO World Heritage even mean?\nAs UNESCO mentioned on their website, World Heritage is the designation for places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as such, have been inscribed on the World Heritage List to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy. Places as diverse and unique as the Pyramids of Egypt, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, Galápagos Islands in Ecuador, the Taj Mahal in India, the Grand Canyon in the USA, or the Acropolis in Greece are examples of the 1007 natural and cultural places inscribed on the World Heritage List to date.\nHow many UNESCO world heritage sites are in Iran?\nAfter that the list of UNESCO world heritage sites in Iran was updated in 2019, there are now 24 world heritage sites in Iran, adding Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests.\nThe complete list of Sites In Iran:\nArmenian Monastic Ensembles of Iran (2008) There are three monastic ensembles of the Armenian Christian faith in the north-west of Iran: St Thaddeus and St Stepanos and the Chapel of Dzordzorn. Saint- Thaddeus is assumed to be the location of the tomb of the apostle of Jesus Christ.\nThe Armenian Monastic Ensembles of Iran is located in the West Azerbaijan and East Azerbaijan provinces in Iran.\nBam and its Cultural Landscape (2004) Bam is situated in a desert environment in south-eastern Iran. Bam’s location was very strategic in terms of trade back in the time. Bam’s heyday was from the 7th to 11th centuries, known for the production of silk and cotton garments, and being at the crossroads of important trade routes. Arg-e Bam is one of the most representative examples of a fortified medieval town. Bam also preserves some of the earliest evidence on Qanats in Iran.\nThe origins of this Bam complex can be traced back to Achaemenid or Parthian eras, although it continued to live as a residential area up to the late Qajar period.\nBisotun (2006) Darius I, the ruler of the Persian Empire in 521 BC, ordered the bas-relief and cuneiform inscription located in Bisotun. The inscription describes the battles Darius carried out to regain control over his empire and is written in three languages.\nThe town is at the foot of Bisotun mountain, the flank of which is the location of an important historical site.\nCultural Landscape of Maymand (2015) Maymand is a self-contained arid valley in the south of Iran. The villagers are seasonal migrants who raise their animals on mountain pastures, living in temporary settlements in spring and autumn. The cultural landscape of Maymand is a significant example of a migration system that appears to have been more widespread in the past and involves people moving rather than animals.\nMeymand is a very ancient village which is located near Shahr-e Babak city in Kerman Province, Iran.\nGolestan Palace (2013) Golestan Palace, located in the heart of Iran’s capital, Tehran, is a masterpiece of the Qajar era. The palace is a combination of Iranian and western architecture. Since Golestan Palace was the seat of government of the Qajar family, It became a center of Qajari arts and architecture. Golestan has remained a source of inspiration for Iranian artists and architects until today.\nThe Golestan Palace is the former royal Qajar complex in Iran’s capital city, Tehran.\nGonbad-e Qābus (2012) The 53 m high tomb built in ad 1006 is located in what used to be the ancient city of Jorjan. Ever since the city was destroyed by Mongol conquests in the 14th and 15th centuries, The tomb is the only remaining evidence of Jorjan’s civilization. This historical monument declares the progress of science and mathematics in the Muslim world at that time.\nThe modern name, meaning “the tower of Kavus”, is a reference to the most imposing ancient monument in the city.\nHyrcanian Forests (2019) Stretching 850 km along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea, Hyrcanian forests form a unique forested massif. This forest is home to 180 species of birds typical of broad-leaved temperate forests and 58 mammal species including the iconic Persian Leopard. The history of these broad-leaved forests dates back 25 to 50 million years ago.\nThe forest is named after the ancient region of Hyrcania.\nHistoric City of Yazd (2017) The City of Yazd is located in the middle of the Iranian plateau, 270 km southeast of Isfahan, representing a distinguished example of surviving under limited resources in the desert. Unlike many traditional earthen towns, Yazd has escaped modernization and succeeded in retaining its traditional districts, the qanat system ( The water supply of the city built underground), bazars, hammams, traditional houses, mosques, synagogues, Zoroastrian temples and the historic garden of Dolat-Abad. .\nYazd, the city of wind catchers, was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List on July 9th, 2017.\nLut Desert (2016) The Lut Desert, widely referred to as Dasht-e Lut, is located in the south-east of Iran, in the provinces of Kerman, and Sistan and Baluchestan. Among the world’s largest deserts, Lut Desert is one of the hottest and driest places on Earth. This large salt desert is swept by strong winds between June and October. Therefore, the site presents some of the most dazzling examples of aeolian yardang landforms (massive corrugated ridges). Lut desert represents an outstanding example of ongoing geological processes.\nThe Lut Desert, widely referred to as Dasht-e Lut, is the world’s 27th-largest desert.\nMasjed-e Jame of Isfahan (2012) Masjed-e Jāmé, literally meaning Friday mosque, is a stunning illustration of the evolution of mosque architecture in Isfahan. It is the oldest preserved edifice of its kind in the country, and also the first Islamic building to portray the four iwan layout. The mosque also features significant decorative details representative of stylistic developments over more than a thousand years of Islamic art.\nThe mosque is the result of continual construction, reconstruction, additions and renovations on the site from around 771 to the end of the 20th century.\nMeidan Emam, Esfahan (1979) Meidan Emam, also called Naqsh-e Jahan, one of the largest city squares in the world, is known for the Royal Mosque, the Mosque of Sheikh Lotfollah, the magnificent Portico of Qaysariyyeh and the 15th-century Timurid Palace. These monuments are evidence on the level of cultural and social life in Persia during the Safavid era. As a prominent paradigm of Islamic and Iranian architecture, Meidan Emam is Built by Shah Abbas I the Great at the beginning of the 17th century.\nNaghsh-e Jahan Square, also known as Shah Square or Imam Square, is a square situated at the center of Isfahan, Iran.\nPasargadae (2004) Founded by Cyrus II the Great, Pasargadae was the capital of the first great multicultural empire in Western Asia. Ranging from the Eastern Mediterranean and Egypt to the Hindus River, Achaemenid is considered to be the first empire that respected the cultural diversity of its different peoples.\nA limestone tomb there is believed to be that of Cyrus the Great.\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites In Iran (Part II)\nHow useful was this post?\nClick on a star to rate it!\nAverage rating 4.3 / 5.

From Easter Island to Stonehenge, the Taj Mahal to the Acropolis, many UNESCO World Heritage sites are instantly recognisable.\nBeing listed as a World Heritage site isn’t just a matter of status, however, it also helps to protect the area or building from being harmed in any way by new developments or environmental factors. In July, 21 new places received the prestigious accolade. The list included the Lake District in the UK, caves and ice age art at Swabian Jura in Germany and Los Alerces National Park in Argentina.\nIn this article we will talk you through five of the most iconic World Heritage sites across the globe and exactly what it takes to be included in the list.\nWhat does it take to become a UNESCO World Heritage site?\nAccording to the UNESCO World Heritage Centre website: “To be included on the World Heritage List, sites must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one out of ten selection criteria:\n- To represent a masterpiece of human creative genius\n- To exhibit an important interchange of human values, over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town-planning or landscape design\n- To bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilisation which is living or which has disappeared\n- To be an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates significant stage(s) in human history\n- To be an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement, land-use, or sea-use which is representative of a culture (or cultures), or human interaction with the environment especially when it has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change\n- To be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance\n- To contain superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance\n- To be outstanding examples representing major stages of Earth’s history, including the record of life, significant ongoing geological processes in the development of landforms, or significant geomorphic or physiographic features\n- To be outstanding examples representing significant ongoing ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of terrestrial, fresh water, coastal and marine ecosystems and communities of plants and animals\n- To contain the most important and significant natural habitats for in-situ conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation.\nAs a result of UNESCO’s criteria, World Heritage sites include natural wonders such as Mount Fuji and Yellowstone National Park, as well as architectural marvels including Chichen Itza in Mexico and the Great Wall of China.\nEaster Island, Chile\nPerhaps one of the most iconic World Heritage sites is Easter Island. This remote Chilean island is famous for its 887 monumental statues, called moai. Found along the coast, often in formation, the moai were created by the island’s earliest inhabitants. The first humans on the island of Rapa Nui (the Polynesian name for Easter Island) are believed to have arrived in approximately 300-400 A.D.\nThe tall statues stand at an average height of 13 feet and weigh 13 tonnes. They were carved out of tuff – the light, porous rock formed by volcanic ash – and placed on top of ceremonial stones called ahus. It is believed that the statues represent the ancestors of the people of Rapa Nui, however it is not known how the heavy moai were transported across the island.\nToday, the island welcomes visitors who wish to see this historical marvel for themselves. The island is accessible on a cruise via Hanga Roa, the main town, harbour and capital of Easter Island. Hanga Roa is home to around 3,300 people, amounting to 87 per cent of the island’s population.\nBetween exploring the statues, be sure to stop at one of the island’s swimming beaches. Although most of the coastline of Rapa Nui National Park is rocky due to the volcanic terrain, Ovahe Beach and Anakena Beach are white coral sand beaches with crystal clear water. Visitors can also discover the island on horseback, visit The Anthropological Museum and see the only moais facing the ocean at Ahu Akivi.\nJarryd and Alesha of NOMADasaurus told us about their experience at Rapa Nui: “Easter Island is one of the world’s most isolated destinations, and the iconic moai statues make it one of the best and most unique World Heritage sites.\n“Mystery still shrouds the fascinating heads, and it’s unknown how the ancient Rapa Nui people managed to transport the stones across the island. The highlights come from driving around Easter Island, marvelling at the wonderful statues, and visiting the volcanic craters and quarry. If visiting for one day we recommend joining a tour with a local guide to get the most information from your trip.”\nGreat Barrier Reef, Australia\nSpanning 133,000 square miles, the Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef system in the world. The reef can be found off the coast of Queensland, Australia, and achieved World Heritage status in 1981. It’s considered by UNESCO to be a “globally outstanding and significant entity” and welcomes visitors from all over the world.\nSadly, the reef has fallen victim to what is known as ‘bleaching’. When corals are stressed by changes in conditions such as temperature, light or nutrients, they expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing them to turn completely white. Warmer water temperatures are believed to be the cause of this in the Great Barrier Reef.\nThe Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) has a long history of fighting to protect the reef. Ingrid Neilson, communications manager at AMCS said: “The Great Barrier Reef represents about 10% of all the world’s coral reefs. It is one of the seven natural wonders of the world. Spanning 2,300km along the Queensland coast, the Great Barrier Reef’s 3,000 coral reef systems contain a huge diversity of marine plants and animals such as sea turtles, reef fish, sharks, hard and soft corals and migrating whales.\n“AMCS has a long, proud history of fighting for the Great Barrier Reef. We led an Australia-wide community campaign to prevent coral mining and oil drilling on the reef in the 1960s. We played a critical role in establishing the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (1974) and World Heritage Area (1982).”\nAlthough greater protection of the reef has been achieved, there’s still plenty of work to, according to Ingrid: “We are currently working to stop the industrialisation of the coastline, particularly one of the largest coal mines on Earth which is planned for Queensland. We are working hard to convince the Australian Government to heed the will of Australians who want a rapid switch to renewable energy away from coal and gas, which creates carbon pollution and drives global ocean warming and bleaching. A rapid transition to clean renewable energy is in the best interest of the reef, its communities and future generations”\nWhen asked why people should visit the reef, Ingrid said: “Because despite two years of unprecedented coral bleaching, the Great Barrier Reef is still one of the most beautiful places on Earth. Half of the reef’s corals have died in the last two years, but there are still many beautiful places to visit.\n“We must keep supporting our sustainable industries like reef tourism which sustains coastal communities and charges our economies. The tourism industries are the eyes and ears on the water along the reef. They need our support because their livelihoods, along with the marine life of the Great Barrier Reef, are too previous to lose.”\nTaj Mahal, India\nBuilt by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his late wife, the Taj Mahal is considered to be a masterpiece of the world’s heritage. The ivory-white marble building, on the bank of the Yamuna River in Agra, is universally recognised, famous for its intricate detail and symmetry.\nShah Jahan was a member of the Mughal dynasty that ruled much of India from the 16 to 18th century. In 1628, after the death of his father, King Jahangir, and a power struggle with his brothers, Shah Jahan crowned himself emperor of Agra. His wife, Mumtaz Mahal, was said to be the most cherished of his three queens. In 1631, Mumtaz Mahal died after giving birth to their 14th child. Grief stricken, Shah Jahan commissioned the building of a huge mausoleum to house her tomb. It is said that 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants were brought in to build the Taj Mahal.\nThe innovative design and planning of the Taj Mahal is what captures the attention of many. UNESCO states: “The Taj Mahal represents the finest architectural and artistic movement through perfect harmony an excellent craftsmanship in a whole range of Indo-Islamic sepulchral architecture. It is a masterpiece of architectural style in conception, treatment and execution and has unique aesthetic qualities in balance, symmetry and harmonious blending of various elements.”\nCanadian Rocky Mountains National Parks\nIcy blue lakes, glaciers and mountain peaks all come to mind when we think of Canada’s Rocky Mountains. The national parks of Banff, Jasper, Kootenay and Yoho, along with the provincial parks of Mount Robson, Mount Assiniboine and Hamber, have all been granted World Heritage status.\nUnlike the American Rockies, the Canadian Rockies are formed of layers of sedimentary rock such as limestone and shale, making them appear much more jagged and dramatic. The highest peak in the Canadian Rockies is Mount Robson, towering 3,954m over the landscape.\nUNESCO describes the parks on its website: “The seven parks of the Canadian Rockies form a striking mountain landscape. With rugged mountain peaks, icefields and glaciers, alpine meadows, lakes, waterfalls, extensive karst cave systems and deeply incised canyons, the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks possess exceptional natural beauty, attracting millions of visitors annually.”\nSavi and Vid of Bruised Passports told us why they think the Canadian Rockies are so special:\n“Having travelled to more than 80 countries on this beautiful planet, if we had to choose one place that we feel is the most beautiful when it comes to natural beauty, it’d have to be the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks. We could not believe how gorgeous the entire area is and the variety that is offers to tourists.\n“Lakes, waterfalls, mountain peaks, alpine meadows and stunning wildlife – there’s pretty much nothing nature-related that you won’t find in this area. What’s more, the glaciers, ice fields and the karst caves provide stunning insights into the evolution of our beautiful planet, making this naturally rich area an important World Heritage site.”\nWhen asked to choose the highlights of their trip to the Canadian Rockies, Savi and Vid said:\n“There were far too many to mention but if we had to pick the top three those would have to be driving the Icefields parkway, enjoying a sunset at Lake Moraine and photographing the Sunwapta waterfalls in Jasper National Park.”\nCologne Cathedral, Germany\nAs a striking example of Gothic architecture, it’s little wonder why Cologne Cathedral was granted World Heritage status in 1996. The imposing building is the largest Gothic church in Northern Europe and Germany’s most visited landmark, welcoming around 20,000 visitors each day. Visitors can admire Cologne Cathedral from a Rhine river cruise. At the site itself, there are 533 stone steps leading up to a viewing platform in the structure with spectacular views over the city.\nBuilding began in 1248 and the cathedral was not completed until 1880. Today, the cathedral represents seven centuries of craftsmanship, towering over Cologne.

20	mission values in healthcare technology how improve security measures protect information	The mission of improving healthcare technology requires balancing innovation with ethical and social responsibility. This involves recognizing the complex interactions between ethics, values, and medical technology while ensuring proper security measures. To protect health information, multiple security approaches are necessary, including physical security (using ID badges and biometric authentication), network security (encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection), application security (software validation and updates), and user security (authentication and authorization protocols). These measures help address the challenges of protecting sensitive medical data while maintaining the benefits of technological advancement in healthcare.	['Mission | Staff | Advisors and Supporters\nOur overarching mission is to understand, evaluate, and improve the ethical and cultural influences on and implications of science and technology.\nOur mission is driven by several key ideas: Innovation led by the heart as well as the head. Science that is ethically and socially responsible. Social and cultural change informed by the best science and technology. Using creativity, knowledge, and intelligence to make the world a better place in which to live.\nTo subserve our mission we have established 3 objectives. Our first objective is to foster recognition of the many and complex ways that ethics, values, and culture interact with science, technology, and medicine. We work to make these issues visible to scientists, practitioners, innovators, students, policymakers, corporations, and the public at large.\nBeyond general visibility, our second objective is to foster a better understanding of the relationship between science and values by supporting and pursuing relevant research. This includes investigations by scientists that shed light on our values and culture, by philosophers, humanities scholars and social scientists on the nature of science and the role of values within it, and by ethicists and political theorists on the ethics and politics of science.\nBuilt upon an infrastructure of a careful understanding of values and science, the third objective of the Center seeks to improve the relationship between science and values. Key to achieving this objective is connecting with the public, professionals, scientists and policymakers over a variety of issues. We want to help the public know how to balance their cultural and moral commitments relative to the improvements in their lives offered by science, technology, and medicine. We want to help medical professionals balance compassionate care with safe and efficacious treatment. We want to help scientists balance evidence with imagination, rigor with moral responsibility. We want to help policymakers learn how to integrate good science and democratic participation to promote the public good.\nNever has the time been so ripe for undertaking this mission. Medical technologies are a more central part of our lives than they have ever been, and so much promise can be found in medical advances on the horizon. At the same time, medical research is embroiled with controversy, from bias to irresponsibility to outright fraud, while medical practice is under severe economic strain, and has been accused of a lack of compassion. Science is increasingly necessary for policy-making, and indeed, scientific evidence and advice are more prominent in politics and policy-making than ever. Consequently, there has been an explosion of partisan and distorted science-for-hire. Technologies that have raised our standards of living dramatically now threaten catastrophic environmental problems. Scientific discoveries challenge our ethical values, cultural practices, and religious beliefs. Our work and leisure, our public and family lives are constantly in flux due to the rapid pace of technological change. Yet we must ask, are our lives changing in ways that we want?\nThese challenges touch us all, they are urgent, and the world cannot hope to address them without the help of science and technology. Nevertheless, science and technology on their own, without the influence of ethics, values, and culture, cannot fully resolve these problems. In bringing together medicine, science, and technology with philosophy, the humanities, and the arts, the Center for Values in Medicine, Science, and Technology provides leadership in recognizing, understanding and addressing societal problems and incipient limitations resulting from disconnects between values and science.\nThe Center for Values in Medicine, Science, and Technology was established in 2009 to help the students and faculty of The University of Texas at Dallas, as well as the surrounding community, to understand, evaluate, and support the improvement of the ethical and cultural influences on and implications of science and technology.\nThe cornerstone of the Center for Values’ outreach is a public lecture series that brings in leading scholars, authors, and related authorities to investigate topics at the intersection of technology and the humanities. In a cross-disciplinary approach to fostering public intellectualism, an international group of authors, artists, scientists, philosophers, theorists, and engineers engage a diverse audience in thinking about issues such as “Creativity in the Age of Technology” (2009 series), “Exploring Human Enhancement” (2010), “Funded and Forbidden Knowledge: Science, Politics and Cultural Values” (2011), and “The Heart of Medicine: Values and Ethics in Health Care” (2012). The speakers further play a role in our academic community by meeting with interested undergraduate and graduate students and with members of courses that are designed in conjunction with the series.', 'By Mohammad Bajwa, PhD, CPHIMS, CPHI, RHIA, MCSE\nWhile it has only just emerged this century, the use of mobile health technology (mHealth) in the delivery and management of healthcare is gaining traction due to the global implementation of health information technology. This is exemplified mostly by electronic health record (EHR) systems, wherein patients’ health information resides on computers and travels on computer networks. Normally, the information stored on computers is accessed through wires and is limited to places where such infrastructure exists. With the advent of wireless technology, electronic health information can be accessed by anybody, anytime from anywhere and on any mobile device as long as wireless connectivity is available. Despite this advantage, the security of health information stored on and accessed through mobile devices is cause for public concern. Wireless communication is prone to hacking, and mobile devices, given their size and value, increase the chance they will be lost or stolen.\nmHealth is defined as the use of mobile devices (mDevices) in the practice of medicine. These include mobile/cellphones, iPads, tablets, personal and notebook (laptop) computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and similar other devices that use wireless technology to access health information networks. Such devices often use radio waves for communication either through central access points (hot spots) or satellites. Of these, mobile phones have emerged as the greatest mobile technology gadgets.\nSince wireless signals travel through the atmosphere, diffuse in all directions, and can pass through most physical barriers, they are liable be intercepted. The intent of this article is to review wireless technology, its use in healthcare, its security issues, and best practices to make safe use of this novel technology for the delivery and management of healthcare.\nTypes of mHealth Security\nBefore discussing the security of mHealth, it is appropriate to enumerate four types of information security requirements: physical, network, application, and user security.\nPhysical security implies the security of computers, network hardware, and storage media against intruders and natural disasters. The most common mitigative security measures for this purpose includes using ID badges and biometric authentication for entry to premises, locking computers with desks, and regular backups for data restoration in case of any human-made or natural disasters.\nNetwork security denotes the protection of data and information residing on computers and in transit over the network/internet through techniques like encryption (encodes data, rendering it unreadable by unauthorized persons) and technologies such as firewalls (controls both inbound and outbound data based on the nature of traffic and source); virtual private networks (makes private data communication channel in the public network such as internet); network intrusion detection (notifies the network administrator of any intrusion by email, text message, alert); and intrusion detection and prevention systems (blocks intruder and reports to network administrator).\nApplication security requires validation of services accessing the information, level of information access and use permissions, software patches and updates, software logs, and input validation techniques (best defense against malware/spyware injection).\nUser security is a three-step process that entails user identification through user ID, authentication through password, biometric or two-factor authentication (verifies user), and authorization through permissions (what the user can access and do).\nData Transmission Media\nData and information on the network travels either on wires (wireline transmission media)—the most common being the copper cables (network and coaxial or TV cables) and fiber optic (FO) cables—or wirelessly through the atmosphere. For the discussion of data security, it is pertinent to examine how data travels on these two types of transmission media and their security vulnerabilities.\nWireline Transmission Media\nThe two types of wireline transmission media are copper cables and fiber optic (FO) cables. Copper cables transmit data through voltages (electrical signals), called electromagnetic (EM) waves, as pulses (5 volts representing 1) or no pulses (representing 0). The data from these cables can be stolen by placing a device close to the cable, which can sense pulses and covert them back to 1s and 0s. To avoid this, some copper cables are shielded (covered with aluminum foil) to stop pulses from being detected externally. One typical example of this type of cable is TV (coaxial) cable that not only shields data being braided but can also transmit it at multiple voltage levels, thus catering to the needs of TV, internet, and digital phone requirements simultaneously. Contrary to the copper cables, FO cables are made of glass or highly transparent plastic and transmit data as light pulses. Its twofold benefits include data transmission at almost the speed of light (several times faster than copper cables) and data security, as light pulses cannot be detected externally. Besides being fast and secure, FO cables transmit data in multiple frequencies, enabling several data channels in one cable (video, internet, phone). Verizon FiOS is one such example.\nWireless signals are also EM waves, but unlike the wireline media, they travel through the air or atmosphere at different frequencies (amplitudes). They are advantageous in areas where wired networks cannot be set up (old and historical buildings) or are required temporarily (training or classroom setup). Because the wireless signals radiate in all directions and can pass most physical barriers, they are very valuable in hospital environments or healthcare organizations with mobile workforces. However, they are the least secure, as they can easily be intercepted by monitoring devices, and data can be interrupted, interjected, modified, stolen, rendered unusable, or even destroyed.\nMobile Technology (mTechnology)\nmTechnology is based on wireless technology that moves with the user. It is a portable two-way communication network and includes internet-enabled devices like smartphones, tablets, notebook computers, and navigation devices. mTechnology touches all aspects of our daily lives from starting the day with the alarm clock in your phone; managing the day through your calendar, reminders, and notes; communicating through emails, texts, social media; and accessing online information like maps, books, magazines, files, photos, and videos. The common four types of mTechnologies are:\n- Cellular or radio networks: Use distributed cell towers that enable mobile devices (cellphones) to switch frequencies automatically and communicate without interruption across large geographic areas.\n- Packet switching technology (5G network): Organizes data into packets for transmission and reassembles packets into information at destination.\n- Wi-Fi: Radio waves that connect devices to internet through localized routers.\n- Bluetooth: Connects devices over short distances using short-wavelength radio waves.\nMobile Health (mHealth)\nmHealth is the use of mTechnology in healthcare. The World Health organization (WHO) defines mHealth as the “use of mobile and wireless technologies to support the achievement of health objectives,”1 while the National Institutes of Health (NIH) describes it as “use of mobile and wireless devices to improve health outcomes, healthcare services, and healthcare research.”2\nThus, mHealth is the practice of medicine and healthcare over mobile devices, like smartphones, tablets, and iPads, such as eVisit (only mode of remote healthcare delivery service during COVID-19 pandemic). Although traditionally used for wellness management, their use for healthcare both by patients and providers has increased exponentially.3\nCurrently, mHealth technologies are being used for patient monitoring, patient-provider communication, telehealth, and e-health. Although the lines between telehealth (also referred to as telemedicine) and e-health are blurred, they are two different technologies. E-health is the electronic communication of information for improving patient’s health, while telehealth uses video, smartphones, or any wireless tools or telecommunications technology (network/internet) for specific healthcare delivery and is named after the type of healthcare service: telenursing, telepharmacy, telerehabilitation, teleradiology, teletrauma care, telepsychiatry, telepathology, and teledermatology. Telehealth requires license and an infrastructure to practice, while e-health has no such requirements. Both became routine during COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe global health data breaches in 2020 increased to 24.5 percent against financial services breaches (7.3 percent), once being the reverse.4 Thus, it is pertinent to elaborate on some mHealth security issues to understand their specific security vulnerabilities.\nMobile devices use air interface to communicate and transmit data through the atmosphere. The wireless medium is broadcast (signals diffuse in all directions), and signals can pass through physical barriers (e.g., walls, roofs, and concrete). They are vulnerable to active (through injecting, deleting, altering the message) or passive (redirecting the information) attacks. The signals traveling through the atmosphere can be intercepted, modified, destroyed, hacked, and rendered unusable through ransomware. Being portable, mobile devices are small and lucrative and can be lost or stolen along with data, have low processing power to handle encryption, and can use public unsecure Wi-Fi. Bring your own device (BYOD) policies poses additional risks of healthcare cybersecurity, as healthcare workers can use their own devices to access organizational network, access patient data, and enter medical orders. BYOD policies are advantageous because of higher productivity, as the providers can access health information from anywhere and anytime; they increase job satisfaction by supporting flexible work arrangements; and they increase effectiveness due to more comfort and speed with the use of people’s own devices. However, they suffer from several disadvantages, like data breaches due to lost or stolen personal devices, lack of firewall and anti-virus software, dearth of encryption power, and increased IT costs for supporting personal devices.\nHIPAA and mHealth\nHIPAA requires security of the protected health information (PHI) through its Security Rule that mandates the security of health information through a three-pronged approach: administrative (policy-based), physical (physical access to facility, workstation, and storage devices), and technical (technological requirements to control access to information).5 mHealth devices have potential HIPAA Security Rule compliance issues such as physical loss or theft of devices, data transmission over unsecured Wi-Fi, unencrypted text messages/emails, inadequate or lack of authentication protocols, and poor adherence to BYOD policies and procedures.\nBeside the potential to have HIPAA security compliance issues, other specific mHealth device issues include interference with implanted medical devices (pacemakers) and their use in monitoring vital signs and supporting life-threatening and critical care situations that use a part of electromagnetic spectrum, like mobile devices. They also suffer from diagnostic interpretations due to small screen size, which may conceal some crucial details in EKG, ultrasound, MRI, and X-rays.\nBest Security Practices for Securing mHealth Devices\nAlthough no technique or technology can provide fool-proof security for the data contained in mHealth devices or accessed through them, some measures can minimize the security risks. These include implementation of strong user authentication (biometric or two-factor authentication), automatic lock after excessive number of incorrect logins, remote wiping when a device is lost or stolen, employing encryption for conversations (emails, text messages), developing an application policy for BOYD devices, regular updating to keep vulnerabilities mitigated, and installing security programs/antivirus, as being networked they are apt to all sorts of malware attacks.\nInternet of Things in Healthcare (IoHT)\nYet another breed of mHealth devices are Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) or Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, which is the use of Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare. IoHT devices are sensor-based interconnected devices used for tracking assets and resources. In hospitals, they can be used for locating patients, medical staff, and visitors (called smart hospitals), and collection and integration of health data (generation, collection, and communication of health data through wearable devices).6 Other benefits of IoHT devices include savings in medical cost, reduction in medical errors, improved patient experience, manageability of medical drugs and adherence, better control over wastage in healthcare sector, and better outcomes of medical treatments.\nSecurity Mitigation of IoHT Devices\nMitigation of security for IoHT devices include both technological and administrative measures. The technological mitigation measures comprises use of blockchain technology to protect data in IoHT devices, enable IoHT devices to use authentication to validate user identity and access privileges, enable IoHT devices to use encryption for all health-related communication, enable integrity on IoHT devices to verify devices to ensure that they are unaltered and uninterrupted, and ensure IoHT devices are patched and updated to avert any vulnerability.\nThe administrative mitigation measures comprise using the principle of least privilege for required actions and types of communication, logging all user activities and events and monitoring them regularly for unusual activities (duplicate device ID or elevation in privileges), reviewing device data regularly to identify unusual trends or patterns, implementing security best practices associated with protecting and securing sensitive data, and conducting formal education, training workshops, certifications, and participation in mobile security conferences.\nFuture of IoHT\nIoHT devices have a great future in healthcare applications, especially through the integration of artificial intelligence with IoHT in the form of ingestible sensors (ePills, which are pill-sized devices to monitor internal physiology and act as diagnostic devices sending medical information and images to outside connected devices); nano-devices to monitor human physiology and deliver drugs to targeted areas like cancer cells; connected lenses that would determine tear glucose and eyes diseases; and blood clot monitoring sensors to avert heart attacks. Their potential healthcare implications include smart hospitals, virtual clinics, microsurgery, vital sign monitoring systems (which can analyze real-time data inputs from critically ill intensive care unit patients), activity trackers for heart patients to collect lifestyle information, and fitness wearables, to name a few.\nIn view of the significance of mTechnology in healthcare, the Journal of Mobile Technology in Medicine is published to disseminate the mHealth research results.\n- World Health Organization. https://www.who.int/goe/publications/goe_mhealth_web.pdf\n- National Institutes of Health. https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-14-028.html\n- Phaneuf, A. “How mHealth apps are providing solutions to the healthcare market’s problems” (2019).

22	Can you explain what activities ancient British people engaged in for entertainment and leisure during peaceful times?	The Celts enjoyed various forms of entertainment. They played board games and were very fond of music, playing flutes and lyres. When weather permitted, they held horse or chariot races. They also enjoyed hunting wild boar on horseback.	['DAILY LIFE IN CELTIC BRITAIN\nBy Tim Lambert\nAbout 650 BC the Celts introduced iron into Britain and they made the first swords.\nWarfare was common during the iron age and many hill forts (fortified settlements) were built at that time. (Although there were also many open villages and farms). The Celts fought from horses or light wooden chariots. They threw spears and fought with swords. The Celts had wooden shields and some wore chain mail.\nMost of the Celts were farmers although were also many skilled craftsmen. Some Celts were blacksmiths (working with iron), bronze smiths, carpenters, leather workers and potters. (The potter’s wheel was introduced into Britain c.150 BC). Celtic craftsmen also made elaborate jewelry of gold and precious stones. Furthermore objects like swords and shields were often finely decorated. The Celts decorated metal goods with enamel. The Celts also knew how to make glass and they made glass beads.\nCeltic society was hierarchical. At the top was a class of nobles headed by a king or chieftain. Below them were the craftsmen (of whom metalworkers were the most important). Then came the farmers who provided the food supply and also fought for the chief. There was also a class of slaves in Celtic England. However the Celts were divided into tribes. There was no political unity among them and a great deal of fighting.\nThe Celts grew crops in rectangular fields. They raised pigs, sheep and cattle. They stored grain in pits lined with stone or wicker and sealed with clay. The Celts also brewed beer from barley.\nTrade with Europe was common. Metals like copper, tin, iron and lead were exported from England. Wool, cloth, skins and grain were also exported. Luxury goods like fine pottery and expensive metal goods were imported from Europe. At first the Celts used iron bars as a form of currency but by about 50 BC they were using gold coins.\nThe Celts lived in round houses. They were built around a central pole with horizontal poles radiating outwards from it. They rested on vertical poles. Walls were of wattle and daub and roofs were thatched. Around the walls inside the huts were benches, which also doubled up as beds. The Celts also used low tables.\nCeltic men wore tunics and trousers and women wore long dresses and mantles. They used bronze mirrors. Women wore belts around their dresses made of cloth, leather or bronze rings. Celtic men soaked their hair in lime water to make it stand up straight. They wore mustaches but not beards. Wealthy Celts wore gold ornaments around their necks called torcs or torques.\nThe Celts made dyes from plants, woad, for blue, madder, for red and weld for yellow.\nFor amusement Celts played board games. They were also very fond of music and played flutes and lyres. In good weather they held horse or chariot races. The Celts also enjoyed hunting wild boar on horseback.\nThe Celts had priests called Druids. The Druids were very important in Celtic society. As well as being priests they were scholars, judges and advisers to the kings. The Celts were polytheists (they worshiped many gods and goddesses). They did not build temples but instead worshiped at natural sites such as groves of trees, springs, rivers and lakes. Sometimes the Celts sacrificed valuable goods by throwing them into lakes and rivers.\nIn Celtic times the old practice of building barrows to bury the dead in died out. Instead people were interned in individual graves. They were still buried with grave goods showing the Celts had a strong belief in an afterlife. They believed that when you died your spirit went to a place called the other world.\nThe Romans claimed the Druids practiced human sacrifice but this claim is doubtful. (See The Druids)\nThe main Celtic festivals were Imbolc at the beginning of February at the start of the lambing season, Beltane at the beginning of May, when cattle were sent out to graze in the fields after being kept indoors and fed on hay during the Winter, Lughasad in August when the crops were growing ripe and Samhain at the beginning of November. That was the time when animals were brought in from the fields for the Winter. The Celts could not grow enough hay to feed them all so those not needed for breeding were slaughtered.\nAlthough the Romans regarded the Celts as barbarians they created a sophisticated and advanced society. Women certainly had more freedom than in Roman society and Celtic craftsmen were superb.\nReligion in the Ancient World\nLife in Roman Britain\nA history of England']	['<urn:uuid:5a5bc2fc-dd2e-4a1d-aec7-2e70c60220b1>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	17	38	769

In 2000, the United States Mint released the Golden Dollar coin, changing the alloy of the dollar coin to a clad composition manganese-brass, containing 88.5 percent copper, 6 percent inc.Get A Quote\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States CFIUS.\nMacroeconomic and Foreign Exchange Policies of Major Trading Partners.\nAll of the materials used for producing our coins are purchased from commercial manufacturers. The United States Mint obtains one-cent coin blanks already made, but produces the blanks for five-cent coins and the cupronickel clad coins from strip. Coin strip is fed into high-speed automatic presses which cut the coin blanks, known as planchets.\nThe cupronickel planchets are softened by annealing in a special furnace, then they are cleaned in large rotating barrels which contain a chemical solution that washes and polishes them, and then they are dried.\nNext, the planchets are put through an edge-rolling operation in the upsetting machine. This gives them the familiar thickened edge found on the one-cent coins and five-cent coins. It also serves two other purposes. The edge hardens during the upsetting process, thereby preventing soft metal from squirting between the collar and the dies during stamping. It also removes any burrs and smoothes the edge, making it easier to automatically feed them into the high-speed coin presses.\nFinally, the upset planchets go to the coinage presses, where with a single stroke, they are stamped with the designs and inscriptions that make them into coins. Most of the presses are equipped to strike four coins simultaneously, while others simultaneously strike two coins.\nAfter striking, each coin is inspected. The coins are then counted and bagged.

Animals that can be spotted include ibex families, rare manuls, wolves, corsac foxes, tolai hares, groundhogs, mouse hares, golden eagles, black vultures, bearded vultures, prairie eagles, saker falcons, Altai snowcocks, and occasionally snow leopards. Photographers can capture unique photos of wild animals from very close distances.	"[""Saylyugemsky National Park. Altai Mountains, Russia\nWhere panthers and manulas live\nThe Saylyugemsky National Park is the quintessence of the Gorny Altai wild nature. Mountains and rivers, creeks and prairies, ice caps and valleys... Here you can find manuls and irbis, Alpine ibex and argali, and the growing edelweiss on the high-mountain meadows.\nThe Saylyugemsky National Park is situated on the borders of the Altai Republic (Russia) and Mongolia. It was created in 2010 to preserve the biggest group of snow leopards in the Altai-Sayano region and the trans-border group of the argali mountain ram (muflon).\nThe first attempts to create protected lands in the mountains of Central Altai were made in the beginning of the XX century by the traveler and explorer V.P.Semenov of the Tian Shang. The Altai and Katunsk reserves appeared in the last century, but the decision on opening the Saylyugemsky National Park was postponed for a long time. The proposals to preserve a part of the Argut river basin and the Saylyugem ridge in the Kosh-Agach region of the Altai Republic were given in the 1970's. But the authorities had to keep in mind the interests of the locals. The status of a conservation limits the attendance and usage of the territory, when a lot of people here have private territories and cattle that feed on these grounds.\nTherefore, a national park was made — a territory with a less strict visiting rules. Unfortunately, several areas for preserving the snow leopard and argali were not included in the Park. Nevertheless, today this young national park can show you not only the beautiful wild nature, but also its inhabitants.\nAccessible routes and objects\nWhen visiting the National Park, you get a unique ability to observe wild animals in their natural life environment. The tourists can choose several types of tours that last up to ten days.\nThese tours take place at 2500-3000 meters above sea level. You can walk, ride a horse or take a car. Depending on the weather conditions, ATV buggies and snowmobiles can be used. You can even visit the top of the Saylyugem ridge that is 3444 meters high. There you will see panoramas of colorful mountains, high-altitude prairies, tundra, cliffs, different figures in stone made by the wind, creeks and river valleys.\nThe Saylyugem and Ulandryk clusters on the border with Mongolia is the place with the biggest population of the Altai mountain ram. This is the biggest subspecies of the argali that is in the Red List of Russia and IUCN.\nIn order to watch the animals, visitors use optical tubes with x80 zooming capabilities. Photographers can take unique photos of wild animals from very short distances. During the tour you can see a family of ibex, a very rare manula, wolf, corsac fox, tolai hare, groundhog, mouse hare, golden eagle, black vulture, bearded vulture, prairie eagle, saker falcon, Altai snowcock, and if you are very lucky — a snow leopard.\nThe route encounters season settlements of locals, Altaian and Kazaks, where you can get acquainted with their way of life, national cuisine and the traditional management of natural resources of nomads, which have been herding sheep, horses and yaks on these lands for several hundreds of years.\nThe National Park provides accommodations and transport, rental of tourist equipment. A proper hotel can be found in the Visit-center of the Park in the Kosh-Agach village (Saylyugem street 1). In order to visit the grounds, you will need a permit of the administration and an allowance from the FSB (Federal Security Service) for visiting the Clusters. All this can be given in the Visit-center.\nThe winter in Kosh-Agach is very cold: up to -50°С, and it is almost snowless. In spring it is cold and often windy. That is why you should bring warm clothes: these are the highlands, after all, where summer can be very cool. Comfortable waterproof hiking shoes will make your mountain trips easy.\nAirPano team would like to express gratitude to the Saylyugemsky National Park and personally Valentina Semchenko, Alexander Demchinov and Mirzhan Mandaev for help with organisation of shooting the Altai Mountains.\n12 December 2018""]"	['<urn:uuid:910bbb96-febe-4f88-9337-552222fd7c13>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	6	62	689
25	epm vs eee horses mortality rate comparison	EPM and EEE have different mortality rates in affected horses. For EPM, while specific mortality rates aren't given, horses with mild to moderate clinical signs have a good prognosis with most making significant improvement after treatment. However, for EEE, the mortality rate is much higher, between 50-75% of cases.	"['EPM Testing, Treatment Options Reviewed\nBeard recommended veterinarians perform a thorough neurologic examination and rule out as many differential diagnoses as possible prior to testing for EPM.\nPhoto: Stephanie L. Church, Editor-in-Chief\nOne of the most common equine neurologic diseases—equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, or EPM—is also one of the most difficult to diagnose. Further, with only three FDA-approved treatment options, treating EPM can be a challenge as well.\nAt the 2013 Western Veterinary Conference, held Feb. 17-21 in Las Vegas, Nev., Laurie Beard, DVM, MS, Dipl. ACVIM, associate clinical professor at Kansas State University\'s College of Veterinary Medicine, reviewed the current diagnostic and treatment options for veterinary attendees.\nBeard said that EPM is the most common equine neurologic disease in North America, and it affects horses of all ages, breeds, and disciplines. It is a progressive (increasing in extent and severity) and potentially fatal neurologic disease caused by protozoal (single cell) microorganisms—most commonly Sarcocystis neurona and less commonly Neospora hughesi—that cause inflammation in the brain and/or spinal cord. Clinical signs of disease vary widely, she said, and include:\n- Ataxia (incoordination), ranging from mild to severe, depending on disease status;\n- Muscle atrophy;\n- Lameness, ranging from mild to severe;\n- Head tilting; and\n- In severe cases, recumbency (the inability to stand or rise).\nIn many cases, EPM clinical signs are asymmetric, meaning one side of the horse\'s body is more severely affected than the other.\nBeard also noted that disease prevalence generally correlates with opossum (S. neurona\'s definitive host and the animal that passes EPM-causing organisms on to horses) populations in specific geographic regions.\nCurrent Diagnostic Options\nWhen it comes do diagnosing EPM, Beard noted a few key points that veterinarians should consider:\n- First, she said, perform a thorough neurologic examination and rule out as many differential diagnoses as possible prior to testing.\n- She recommended only testing horses that have clinical signs of neurologic disease. ""No test is 100% accurate,"" she said. ""When you test a group of animals with a very low prevalence of disease (i.e., normal horses), the positive predictive value—meaning that a positive test is really a true positive—is very low. However, if you test a group of animals with a higher prevalence of disease (i.e., horses with neurologic disease) the positive predictive value (the positive test result is really a true positive) of that test increases.""\n- Consider performing multiple tests; Beard says this will increase the sensitivity of the test (or increase the chance of finding a positive test result) but can decrease specificity (an increased chances of a false positive).\nCommonly used EPM diagnostic test options include:\n- Western blot: The first commercially available EPM test was the Western blot. It\'s still used today and essentially gives practitioners a yes or no answer as to whether a horse has developed antibodies against EPM\'s causative agents. Beard said when the Western blot test is run on cerebrospinal fluid, it\'s sensitive to blood contamination, potentially leading to false positive results. This test can be (and often is) performed with a blood sample, as well, she said.\n- IFAT: A newer and commonly used diagnostic test is the immunofluorescent antibody test, or IFAT. The IFAT identifies the immune response to S. neurona\'s and N. hughesi\'s surface antigens (SAG) and produces a quantifying number (referred to as a quantitative test), or titer, that expresses the concentration of antibodies circulating in the horse’s blood. This test is most successful when used on a blood sample, Beard said. ""If all you have is a blood sample, it is the test I would pick,"" she said. ""This test is still useful for CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) as well.""\n- SAG-1 ELISA: Another quantitative test uses an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay format (ELISA) to measure the antibody response to the surface antigen SAG-1. Some strains of the S. neurona organism do not contain this surface antigen, generating false negative results.\n- SAG-2, 3, and 4 ELISA: Finally, Beard discussed the newest EPM diagnostic test, which measures antibodies to the S. neurona surface antigens SAG-2, SAG-3, and SAG-4 in blood and CSF. This test focuses on the ratio of titers in blood compared to CSF and is generally considered positive when the ratio (as calculated by the laboratory that carries out the test) totals less than 100, she said. This test appears to have a good sensitivity and specificity, Beard said.\n""There\'s no perfect test—there will always be false positives and negatives,"" Beard said. Thus, she recommended veterinarians retest horses if they\'re not satisfied with initial results.\nThe three FDA-approved EPM treatments—ponazuril, diclazuril, and sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine—all report 60%-70% success rates, said Beard.\n- Ponzauril (marketed as Marquis) is available in paste form, she said. The recommended dose is 5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) of body weight daily for a minimum of 28 days. Some veterinarians believe that combining ponazuril with a small oral dose of dimethyl sulfoxide (commonly known as DMSO) could help increase ponazuril\'s bioavailability (the amount of drug that actually reaches systemic circulation), Beard said.\n- Diclazuril (marketed as Protazil) is sold as an alfalfa pellet; the recommended dose is 1 mg/kg daily for a minimum of 28 days.\n- Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine (marketed as Re-Balance) has recently been made available again after a span of being commercially unavailable. The recommended dose of the oral suspension is 15 mg/kg of sulfadiazine and 1 mg/kg of pyrimethamine once daily for a minimum of three to six months.\nBeard said some veterinarians use adjunct therapeutic options including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, natural vitamin E, and immunostimulators in addition the FDA-approved treatment options.\nThe severity and progression of clinical signs are the most important prognostic indicators, Beard said.\n""Horses that present with severe ataxia (and have a) rapid progression to recumbency have a very poor prognosis,"" she said. ""The prognosis in horses with mild to moderate clinical signs is usually considered good, with the majority of horses making a significant improvement in clinical signs.""\nShe cautioned that a relapse of clinical signs can be an ongoing problem in some cases.\nEPM remains a diagnostic challenge for veterinarians due to its extremely variable clinical signs and the current diagnostic tests available. Despite that, many mildly to moderately affected horses recover with treatment.\nAbout the Author\nErica Larson, news editor, holds a degree in journalism with an external specialty in equine science from Michigan State University in East Lansing.

This is followed by the emergence of neurological features, such as confusion, focal neurological signs, generalized or focal seizures, meningism, and somnolence 1. These neurological features rapidly progress and the patient\'s condition typically deteriorates within days to become stuporous or comatose 1.\nEEE is caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), a single-stranded RNA alphavirus 1,2. Mosquitos and wild birds, especially in the east and Gulf coasts of the Unites States of America, are reservoirs for the virus, which is then spread by mosquitoes 1,2. Importantly, only approximately 5% of patients with EEEV infection develop EEE 2.\nAsymmetric bilateral basal ganglia and thalami involvement is classical regardless of CT or MR imaging 1-6. Less commonly, the internal and external capsules, brain stem, periventricular white matter, cortex, and leptomeninges may also be involved 1-6.\nMRI is the imaging modality of choice and is nearly always abnormal in patients with EEE 1,3. The most striking feature are asymmetric high T2-weighted signal intensities classically affecting the basal ganglia and thalami 1-6. It is thought that these lesions represent a combination of edema, inflammation, and ischemia 1,3. As with CT, in large lesions, local mass-effect may also be appreciated 1-6.\nUncommonly, and as aforementioned, there may be additional involvement of the adjacent internal and external capsules, the brainstem (especially the midbrain), the periventricular white matter, the cortex (especially the medial temporal lobes), and the leptomeninges (see leptomeningeal enhancement) 1-6. Particular involvement of the internal and external capsules, visualized as linear T2-weighted regions of high signal, has emerged as a sign that may be unique to EEE compared to other viral encephalitides, and has been described as the ‘parentheses sign’ 5.\nIn regards to other MR sequences, all of these lesions regardless of location may demonstrate low signal on T1 with variable contrast enhancement, and usually demonstrate iso-intense diffusion signal on DWI 2,6.\nTreatment and prognosis\nThere is no specific antiviral treatment available for EEE, and thus supportive management (e.g. anti-epileptics, corticosteroids) is encouraged 1. Mortality is thought to be between 50-75%, however surviving infection with EEEV does confers lifelong immunity 1,3.\nHistory and etymology\nEEE was first recognized in the United States of America in horses from Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey, and Maryland during an equine epizootic in 1933 7,8. The first human cases followed during a 1938 outbreak in Massachusetts, when there were 25 deaths from 34 cases 7.\nOther infectious causes that can cause a similar imaging pattern include the Flavivirus encephalitides:\nFurthermore, other causes of increased T2 signal in the basal ganglia should also be considered, such as:\n- 1.

26	How do doctors treat regular atrial fibrillation compared to when someone has both Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation at the same time?	For regular atrial fibrillation, treatment focuses on controlling heart rate, restoring normal rhythm using anti-arrhythmic drugs, and preventing blood clots using anticoagulants. In contrast, WPW with atrial fibrillation requires immediate cardioversion if the patient is hemodynamically unstable, or procainamide treatment if stable. Importantly, common AF treatments like AVNBs (adenosine, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, digoxin, and amiodarone) must be avoided in WPW with AF as they can cause deadly ventricular arrhythmias.	['Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a congenital cardiac abnormality that manifests itself as a conduction irregularity found between the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes. In an otherwise healthy heart, electrical conduction begins at the SA node, which is located in the right atrium. An electrical pulse is then sent downward causing the atrium to contract and subsequently reaching the AV node, which acts as the connecting catalyst to allow the electrical pulse to reach the ventricles causing them to contract.1This pathway is controlled as electrical conduction is regulated by the SA and AV node. However, in a patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, there is an extra pathway—also known as the accessory pathway—that allows conduction to occur directly between the atrium and ventricles, bypassing the AV node, thus leading to preexcitation of the ventricles. This preexcitation allows conduction to occur with higher and uncontrolled rates resulting in tachycardias.2 The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a shortened PR interval and the characteristic “delta wave” which resembles a slurring slow rise of the initial portion of the QRS interval.\nPathophysiology and Treatment:\nIn the long-term preventative setting, WPW is managed surgically through catheter ablation.3 However, in the emergent setting treatment is dictated by specific manifestations of WPW associated arrhythmias. There is WPW with orthodromic tachycardia, WPW with antidromic tachycardia, and WPW with atrial fibrillation.4\n1. WPW with orthodromic tachycardia\nA. Orthodromic tachycardia occurs when the electrical circuit travels normally from the SA node to the AV node and down the Purkinje fibers; however, the circuit reenters the atrium via the accessory pathway causing the tachycardia as represented in Figure 1.\na. This rhythm resembles a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) even though etiology is slightly different; however, treatment is identical.5\nB. Diagnosis is made through electrocardiogram (ECG).\na. ECG will show a regular narrow QRS complex tachycardia resembling a SVT as seen in Figure 1.6\na. Due to its similar mechanism as SVT, orthodromic tachycardia can be treated the same method as a SVT with an AV node blocker (AVNB).5\n– Adenosine7, 8\n– Verapamil8, 9\n– Beta blockers10\n2. WPW with antidromic tachycardia\nA. Antidromic tachycardia occurs when the electrical circuit travels from the SA node through the accessory pathway first, then up the Purkinje fibers, and through the AV node all through a retrograde or opposite direction than the orthodromic tachycardia as seen in Figure 1.\na. This rhythm resembles a ventricular tachycardia (VT), even though etiology is slightly different; however, treatment is identical.6\nB. Diagnosis is also made through ECG.\na. ECG will show a regular wide QRS complex tachycardia resembling a ventricular tachycardia as seen in Figure 1.6\na. It is necessary to treat with agents that selectively target the accessory pathway.\n– Loading dose: 20 to 50 mg/min IV infusion until arrhythmia suppressed, hypotension ensues, QRS prolonged by 50%, or total cumulative dose of 17 mg/kg12\n– Alternative loading dose: 100 mg every 5 minutes until arrhythmia is controlled or any condition described above is met.12\n– Follow with a continuous infusion of 1 to 4 mg/min (must reduce maintenance dose in patients with renal impairment).12\nc. Amiodarone150 mg IV over 10 minutes, then 1 mg/minute for 6 hours, then 0.5 mg/minute for 18 hours or change to oral dosing.13\nFigure 1. Diagrams of orthodromic and antidromic electrical pathways and associated ECG rhythms. Available at: https://umem.org/files/uploads/content/MattuECG%20Tumblr/OrthoAnti.jpg. Accessed August 4, 2014.\n3. WPW with Atrial Fibrillation\nA. This is the most dangerous etiology of the WPW manifestations due to its high risk of iatrogenic error and deadly ventricular arrhythmias.2\nB. In WPW with atrial fibrillation, electrical conduction in the heart travels down two paths, the normal pathway through the AV node AND from the atrium to the ventricles through the accessory pathway as seen in Figure 2.14\nC. Diagnosis is made through ECG.\na. The two electrical pathways manifest themselves on ECG as irregularly irregular rhythms.\n– While pulses that pass through the AV node have some rate regulation due to the AV node, impulses traveling through the accessory pathway have no rate regulation, leading to measured ventricular rates on ECG above 200 beats per minute (bpm).2\n> This lack of regulation through the accessory pathway causes the irregular wave morphologies with no consistencies in the QRS waves as seen in Figure 3.\n> In contrast, Figure 4 depicts a more typical atrial fibrillation without WPW where the QRS waves are seen to be more regular and ventricular rate does not exceed 150-200 bpm (due to the rate regulation caused by the AV node).\nb. Atrial fibrillation with WPW is often misdiagnosed as a SVT, VT, or atrial fibrillation with a bundle branch block.\n– If misdiagnosed, treatment with an AVNB will preferentially block the AV node and consequently divert all electrical impulses down the accessory pathway.15\n> This shunting of electrical impulses to the accessory pathway causes ventricular fibrillation and high risk of death.\n> Therefore, AVOID ALL AVNBs (i.e. adenosine, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, digoxin, and amiodarone) in patients with WPW with atrial fibrillation.\na. Immediate cardioversionis the recommended first line treatment for hemodynamically unstable patients when WPW with atrial fibrillation presents.16\nb. In a hemodynamically stable patient, procainamide can be used, as it selectively targets the accessory pathway.12\n– Per 2010 ACLS guidelines, procainamide dosing is as follows:\n> Loading dose: 20 to 50 mg/min IV infusion until arrhythmia suppressed, hypotension ensues, QRS prolonged by 50%, or total cumulative dose of 17 mg/kg12\n> Alternative loading dose: 100 mg every 5 minutes until arrhythmia is controlled or any condition described above is met. 12\n> Follow with a continuous infusion of 1 to 4 mg/min (must reduce maintenance dose for renal impairment).12\nFigure 2.

WPW orthodromic tachycardias are treated as SVT with an AVNB (i.e. adenosine, verapamil, beta blockers).\nB. WPW antidromic tachycardias are treated as VT with procainamide or amiodarone.\nC. WPW with atrial fibrillation is treated with immediate cardioversion if hemodynamically unstable.

Circulation. 2014.', 'Heart Condition: Atrial Fibrillation\nWhat is Atrial Fibrillation?\nAtrial Fibrillation (AF) is the name for the most common type of irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). When someone has AF it means that their heart beats in a disorganised way. This chaotic activity leads to an irregular and usually fast pulse rate which may cause palpitations, and increases the risk of having stroke, heart failure or other heart-related complications.\nWhat happens to your heart when you have AF?\nTo understand AF you need to know a little about how your heart works. Your heart is a muscle about the size of a clenched fist and is located slightly to the left of the centre of your chest. The heart has four chambers – two upper ones called the right and left atria and two lower ones called the right and left ventricles. The heart’s function is to pump blood all around the body. It does this via its own electrical system driven by its natural internal pacemaker and this causes the heart to beat regularly.\nHeart rate and heart rhythm are the different ways the heart pumps.\nThe heart rate is the number of times your heart beats in a minute. For most people, normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute (although it can vary from person to person and can depend on what you are doing). The heart rhythm is how regular or irregular the beats are. Normal heart rhythm is known as sinus rhythm. Both the heart rate and the heart rhythm need to be regular for your heart to work as best it can.\nWith atrial fibrillation, a problem with the heart’s electrical system causes the two upper chambers of the heart (the atria) to quiver or beat in a disorganised pattern. This upsets the rhythm between the upper and lower chambers and results in the ventricles beating faster without a regular rhythm.\nWhat are the Different Types of Atrial Fibrillation\nThe symptoms of AF can come and go, can change over time and there may be long spells between episodes. Indeed, some people in the early stage of AF may not even be aware that they have the condition. It is important to know which type of AF you have in order to understand your condition and determine how it can be treated. There are three types of AF and each one determines the type of treatment you might require. The types of AF can be classified as follows:\n- Paroxysmal AF: paroxysmal AF are episodes of AF that come and go and can last for hours or days. However, they generally do not last any longer than a week. If you have symptoms, these may also come and go.\n- Persistent AF: this type of AF generally lasts longer than seven days. It does not go away on its own and generally requires some kind of medical treatment to restore the normal rhythm of the heart.\n- Permanent AF: this is a continuous type of AF lasting longer than a year where your regular heartbeat does not return and a normal heart rhythm cannot be restored with medical treatment. With this type of AF you may need medications to control the heart rate.\nWhat are the symptoms of Atrial Fibrillation?\nThe symptoms of AF are different for different people. Some people do not have any symptoms and are only diagnosed during a routine medical check-up. Other people might notice their heart beating faster or with an irregular rhythm and decide to visit their doctor. Symptoms can include the following:\n- Palpitations, or awareness of your heartbeat, where it feels like your heart is racing, thumping or fluttering.\n- Feeling tired, weak or lacking energy\n- Being dizzy, light-headed or feeling faint\n- Being short of breath\n- Experiencing pain or discomfort in your chest\nIf you feel you have any symptoms of AF, it is important to see your doctor as soon as possible.\nWhat are the Causes of Atrial Fibrillation?\nThe causes of AF are not always clear or easy to determine and sometimes there is no known cause. AF can affect people of any age, but it is more common in people over 65. The risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing AF are:\n- High blood pressure\n- Coronary heart disease\n- Heart attacks\n- Disease of the heart valves\n- Heart failure\n- Overactive thyroid gland\n- Lung infections such as pneumonia\n- Blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism)\n- Previous heart or lung surgery\n- Sleep apnoea (interrupted breathing while sleeping)\n- Drug or alcohol abuse.\nHow is Atrial Fibrillation Diagnosed?\nIf you are having signs or symptoms of AF, you will need to visit your doctor. Regular pulse checks can help to detect AF. After a physical examination, there are a number of tests your doctor may recommend in order to diagnose whether or not you have AF. These tests may include:\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG): the ECG test measures and records your heart rhythm and rate. It usually just takes a few minutes and can be done at your doctor’s surgery or in hospital. This is the main test used to diagnose AF.\n- 24 Hour ECG Recording (Holter Monitor): in some cases it may be necessary to monitor the heart over a 24-hour period. You wear a small recording device for 24 hours, usually around your waste, and it records the electrical activity of your heart.\n- Echocardiogram (Echo): this test is an ultrasound of the heart and is used to detect if there are any problems with the heart muscle or valves that are contributing to the irregular heart rhythm.\n- Cardiac Event Recorders: if you do not get symptoms very often your doctor may use other devices to diagnose your irregular heart rhythm, including a cardiac event recorder or an implantable loop recorder. These record the electrical activity of your heart over a longer period of time.\n- Coronary Angiogram: is an additional test that may be carried out to determine if there is any narrowing of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle.\nHow Is Atrial Fibrillation Treated?\nAF is treated differently for different people. Your doctor will recommend the treatment that is best for you and will be dependent on a number of factors including:\n- The type of AF you have been diagnosed with\n- How long you have had AF\n- What kind of symptoms you have\n- What treatments you have already received\n- Your medical history – any underlying cause.\nThe goals of AF treatment are to:\n- Help control your heart rate\n- Return your heart rhythm to a normal rhythm (if possible)\n- Reduce the risk of blood clots forming in order to reduce your risk of stroke.\nHeart Rate Control: you may be prescribed medicine to slow down your heart, particularly if you have symptoms such as palpitations.\nHeart Rhythm Control: certain medications can help to restore the heart’s normal rhythm and help prevent the return of AF. These medicines are called anti-arrhythmic drugs\nReducing Blood Clots & Risk of Stroke: people who have AF are at an increased risk of developing blood clots which can lead to having a stroke. These medications reduce the risk of blood clot formation and are known as blood thinners or anticoagulants.\nSome people may also require hospital procedures for their AF and these could include:\nCardioversion: the aim of this procedure is to reset your heart to its normal regular rhythm. It involves delivering a controlled electric shock to your heart using special electrodes or paddles that are placed on your chest. The procedure takes place in hospital and you will be asleep and will not feel any pain or discomfort. Sometimes, even though the regular rhythm is restored, the AF may come back so continued follow-up is usually required.\nCatheter Ablation: Catheter ablation is used to find the area of disorganised electrical signals and correct the cause of AF. With this procedure, narrow wires are inserted into a blood vessel in your leg and gently threaded to a position in your heart. Electrical impulses are then sent via the wire to destroy the area that is causing the irregular heartbeat.\nLiving with AF\nAF is not immediately life-threatening in the same way as some arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) are. Most people are able to live full and active lives with AF. You can do this by taking your prescribed medication, following the medical advice you received from your doctor, having regular medical check-ups and making positive lifestyle changes.']	['<urn:uuid:589bf6cd-d0ad-48e3-86db-ad807367a49c>', '<urn:uuid:de45d4b3-7ca7-4f03-b321-8c52815b35ca>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	22	71	2861
27	bare root plants planting and disease prevention tips how prepare soil and prevent spreading plant disease between fields	For bare root plants, prepare soil by mixing organic material (compost) and manures together, ensuring the mixture is damp. For disease prevention, it's crucial to clean equipment and fields between seasons, remove stubble after harvest that can harbor diseases, and avoid ratooning (allowing crops to sprout after harvest) as diseases can sustain between seasons.	"['Bare rooted plants are field grown plants which have been dug up from the soil in their dormant state, no soil remains attached to the remaining root mass, hence the term ‘bare rooted’. Read on if you’d like a head start on all things bare rooted.\nThe significant root loss during this process means the remaining roots need to be protected and new roots encouraged to grow. At BAAG we pot up nearly all of our bare rooted stock in order to protect roots from drying out and being physically damaged.\nMany thousands of bare rooted plants are successfully established by gardeners every year. It is a very efficient and economical way of planting deciduous trees and shrubs. However, given the nature of bare rooted stock, there are several tips that will maximise your chances of success:\nPrepare the soil in advance. You want the best possible soil for your plant. This commonly means digging organic material (compost) and manures into the soil. We also recommend adding zeolite* to the soil mix. It is important that you combine everything together, do not plant into straight compost. The soil, compost and manures need to be mixed together. Ensure that the soil mixture is nicely damp throughout.\nIf necessary you can keep your potted bare root plant in the pot for several months as long as it is kept moist.\nWhen your soil is prepared and you are ready to plant:\nDig a hole and keep the soil off to one side, you will need this later.\nWater the plant the night before so that the potting mix is moist but not saturated.\nLie the pot on its side and carefully ease the plant out of the pot and gently place the plant in the hole. Most of the potting mix will fall away as there will not be much root mass to hold it together. You want to keep the potting mix together as much as possible to prevent it falling away and tearing off any fine root hairs that may have developed.\nHold the plant in position and fill the hole with the soil you have kept off to one side. To avoid collar rot, make sure you only bring the soil up to the level that the potting mix was. Tamp it down firmly and water the plant in well with a solution of Plant Starter/Seasol/Maxicrop or similar liquid fertiliser. These help to stimulate root growth.\nIf the tree needs staking, place the stake far enough away that they are in undisturbed soil and hammer firmly into the ground. Don’t make the ties too tight; allow the tree a bit of movement.\nApricots: These are the exception to the rule. Do not prune now, prune in Spring after the foliage has appeared. Remove at least one third of the tree’s branch structure to reduce the leaf load in the first year. Prune again in autumn (this is the normal pruning time for apricots) before the tree loses its leaves. Apricots should be pruned into an open vase shape.\nFigs: These will often die back at the tip, so wait until the leaves emerge before pruning back to a healthy bud. Figs can take a long time to leaf up in the first season after being planted out as a bare root tree.\nRoses will already have been pruned. You can tidy them up a bit if needed.\nFruit trees and ornamental blossom trees: Prune back by at least one third to one half\nOrnamental trees: Shape is important, so remove any crossing or damaged branches, and lower branches as necessary.\nMaples These can die back at the tips, so wait until the foliage has emerged and prune back any branches showing dieback, allowing a longer stub than normal as maples tend to die back from pruning cuts.\nIn the first year, your primary concern is establishing a good root system. Keep the soil consistently moist, avoid either drying out or water logging the soil, as this tends to kill those fine root hairs you are trying to encourage. Once bud swell has occurred, give all bare rooted plants a monthly drink of Plant Starter/Seasol/Maxicrop or similar liquid fertiliser.\nPest and Disease control:\nCopper sprays for peach leaf curl\nWatch for pear and cherry slug and use Di-pel or Success.\nWatch for Elm leaf beetle, treat with a physical adhesive barrier, or call an arboriculturalist.', ""How to manage pests and diseases\nFarmers lose an estimated average of 37% of their rice crop to pests and diseases every year. In addition to good crop management, timely and accurate diagnosis can significantly reduce losses. If you are facing a problem in your crop and need help with diagnosis, seek advice from a professional or use the Rice Doctor.\nCrop problems can be caused by other living organisms, like rats and fungus, or by non-living factors, such as wind, water, temperature, radiation, and soil acidity.\nThe best control for pests and disease problems is prevention. To limit pest and disease damage:\nPractice good cleaning of equipment and field between seasons\nDiseases can be spread between fields or between seasons if you do not take proper precautions. After harvest, be sure to clean the harvesting equipment to prevent the spread of infected plants.\nSome diseases can live on the stubble between seasons and infect a healthy planted crop. In general, plowing after harvest removes stubble that serves as remaining food and shelter for pests, especially insects. In cases where your field was infested, you should remove all stubble from the previous season (see disease section for more details).\nClean the bunds and patch all rat holes on bunds and around your field. If there are nearby fallow fields or forested areas, you may want to have a community rat control effort or put up trap barriers to keep rats from damaging your crop (see rat section for more details).\nRatooning (allowing your crop to sprout and continue growing after harvest) is not recommended because diseases and insect hosts can be sustained from season to season. It is best to clean the field of any crop and leave it fallow for a few weeks to a few months before planting again.\nUse clean seeds and resistant varieties\nCertified seed is recommended but if you can't get certified seed, use clean seed that does not have any discolored seeds, weed seeds or other rice varieties mixed in.\nMany varieties have been developed with resistance to different diseases. You should check with your local extension agent or a nearby seed dealer to find out which resistant varieties they carry.\nUse short-duration and resistant cultivars to decrease insect pest populations. In short-duration cultivars, insects cannot compete as many generations, so populations may not reach damaging levels. Resistant varieties experience less feeding damage on their leaves and stems, which means less entry points for bacteria and fungal diseases.\nIRRI has a major responsibility to develop rice varieties for the benefit of rice farmers and consumers.\nPlant at the same time as your neighbors\nPlanting at the same time (or within a 2 week window) as the neighboring fields can help to minimize insect, disease, bird, and rat pressure on individual fields.\nDo not over apply fertilizer\nHigh nitrogen can increase susceptibility to certain pests and diseases that is why specific fertilizer recommendations is very important.\nEncourage natural pest enemies\nOveruse of pesticide is common among farmers and can actually lead to pest outbreaks. Natural insect enemies of the rice pests are also killed when pesticides are applied and this can lead to an outbreak of other rice insect pests. Other ways to encourage natural pest enemies are to allow plants on the bunds and between fields to flower (yellow and white flowers attract natural enemies).\nDo not apply pesticide within 40 days of planting\nGenerally, a rice crop can recover from early damage without affecting yield. The diseases section show the information on specific diseases that require early management.\nProperly store grain\nStore grain at moisture content below 13-14%, preferably in an airtight container. Clean the grain before storing so it is free of dust, chaff, and excessive broken grains. The storage area should be clean and have a dampproof floor and waterproof walls and roofs. Ideally, the storage area should be sealed to keep out rats and birds and to allow for fumigation if necessary. Stack bags on a pallett with at least 50cm of space on every side of the stack.\nDo not store grain for more than 6 months. Do not store new grain next to old grain that is infested with insects. Store grain as paddy or rough rice because it is less prone to insect attack than milled rice. Parboiled rice is also less susceptible to damage than raw rice.""]"	['<urn:uuid:f344e006-a354-4144-8f2b-7f36affb9d43>', '<urn:uuid:e9412c80-dc8b-41d9-b137-f6037762a3a2>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	18	54	1466
28	As a historian, I'm curious: when did telegraphs start being used for fires?	The first official fire alarm system using telegraphs was invented in the mid-17th century by William F. Channing of Boston, MA, following Samuel Morse's invention of the telegraph in 1837 and its commercial usage starting in 1844.	['Have you ever stopped to wonder where fire alarm systems started, or how they started? If you have, nice! If not, well we’re here to walk you through the interesting history of fire alarms from way back when to the ones you know today.\nIt All Starts with Community\nWith the creation of organized communities, precautionary solutions had to be created to protect those communities. Fire alarm systems, at their most basic level, were created along with civilization and the pursuit of staying safe, alive and well.\nAnd the demand for fire alarm systems remains to be universally understood: providing people with a clear warning of fire will always be imperative to protecting the livelihood of both life and infrastructure around the world.\nFrom Then to Now: The Evolution of the Fire Alarm System\nIt was the Ancient Greeks and Romans who set the first fire alarm system standards: the simple method of applying water to fire, quickly, to extinguish it! Specifically, their creation was a fire-extinguisher and pump, a prototype to the fire alarms we think of today.\nOkay, maybe not exactly what we think of today – it’d probably be safe to assume modern fire alarms are much more precise. Buckets were the equivalent to street-side fire hydrants – but hey – we must give credit where it’s due, right?\nObviously, technology has advanced greatly – but the premise and necessity remain the same: a system had to be created to specifically warn others of a fire and call to action those who could put it out. With this, more and more measures were put into place with the implementation of specific fire-fighting tools: the fire-fighters, fire “trucks”, fire equipment and fire stations.\nBell Towers: The First Fire Alarm System\nBy the 16th century, it was quickly understood within most civilizations a water supply must be kept close by, quickly accessible in case of a fire. Eventually, larger communities and cities needed better ways warn others from further distances. Here’s where bell towers came into play as the first fire alarm system.\nTraditionally, bell towers were meant as a public service, to track time. Bells were also rung for Church, and town gatherings, but the difference was in the way they sounded the bells. You could say fire began to have a certain ring to it.\nIt was in America, in 1828, that the Pennsylvania State House rebuilt their Independence Hall a new steeple, hung a new bell, and employed an official fire watchman. A man named Franklin Peale came up with specific bell-ringing signals: ringing the bell at certain intervals alerted folks of the general location where the fire was, and men would quickly head in that direction, water in tow.\nThis was quickly adopted in other big cities, too. Bell codes worked, to a degree, but the unpredictability of fire itself called for higher, more precise ways of locating and distinguishing fires before they reached a detrimental level of destruction. The fire alarm system has come a long way since the bell tower.\nThe Official Invention of the Fire Alarm System Box\nAmerica in the mid-17th century was an exciting era of life-changing (and saving) inventions. Following Samuel Morse’s invention of the telegraph in 1837, and its commercial usage starting in 1844, it was scholar of electromagnetism, Mr. William F. Channing, of Boston, MA, who invented the first official fire alarm system.\nChanning, and his assistant Mr. Moses Farmer, both believed that the use of telegraphy and electromagnetism could be used for different types of communication and location – specifically for emergency situations. The end goal was to create a quick, reliable fire alarm that could be used to alert firefighters the near-exact location of a fire as it started.\nOriginally, the fire alarm system was a bit confusing. It was a large, hefty contraption with several wires and levers, containing a telegraphic key with a metal handle. In 1852, when a fire was detected, someone would crank the handle, relaying the fire box alarm number to the nearest fire station location. Doing this also sounded the literal alarm, which would ring at the location and at the nearest fire station.\nOften, however, if the crank was turned too quickly, the telegraph signal couldn’t be sent out. The relationship between the electric current that would pulse out this fire alarm signal and the release of the bell-clappers (the alarm itself) was very touchy and had to be done precisely. As one may assume, in a state of emergency, your average Joe may be a little scared and not necessarily aware that he should make sure to crank the handle correctly.\nFor a busy city, this invention was a monumental moment toward the improvement of local and city-wide safety procedures, and it was quickly patented. After refining their product, patent for Channing and Farmer’s “Electromagnetic Fire Alarm Telegraph” was issued on May 19th, 1857.\nModern Fire Alarm Systems\nIn March of 1855, Channing set out his proposal describing the victories and merits of his invention at the Smithsonian Institution lecture in Boston, Massachusetts. He described his invention as “a higher system of municipal organization than any which has heretofore been proposed or adopted.” However efficient, his product just wasn’t catching on, and he was going into debt.\nJohn Nelson Gamewell, a postmaster and telegraph operator from Camden, South Carolina, attended the same lecture Channing did, and recognized the potential of the invention. He bought the rights to the fire alarm box Channing and Farmer created. Gamewell adapted the fire box to become more easily handled, and it sold to over 500 cities. Instead of all the intricate levers and pulleys arranged on Channing’s product, the now universally-recognized “pull-down lever” was adapted.\nThink of the fire alarms we have today – the small red box containing a handle beneath the glass that is to be pulled in case of a fire, often setting off sprinklers and sending out a signal to the fire station(s) close by to come and put out the fire. The original design wasn’t all that different, but there were too many things that could go wrong. Gamewell’s adaptations made all the difference and gave way to the fire alarm systems we have today.\nSo there you have it – the fire alarm system from ancient times through modern day. It’s quite interesting to see how powerful innovations that will benefit people the world round have evolved throughout history. Will there be additional fire alarm innovations beyond what we have in this modern age? As technology and the Internet of Things continue to race on, we would set a friendly wager on changes down the line. I mean, we have moved from paper fire inspections to awesome fire inspection apps!']	['<urn:uuid:b0b90424-36e9-49d4-b55f-c94ffd9dd872>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	13	37	1125

By 2030, there will likely be more than 100,000 wind turbines in the U.S., and these are expected to kill at least one million birds each year—probably significantly more. Wind farms are also expected to impact almost 20,000 square miles of terrestrial habitat, and over 4,000 square miles of marine habitat by 2030, some of it critical to threatened species.\nTo be a truly green source of energy, wind power needs to be Bird-smart and that means wind power employs careful siting, operation and construction mitigation, monitoring, and compensation to reduce and redress any unavoidable bird mortality and habitat loss from wind energy development. These are issues that should be included in mandatory federal wind standards. All wind farms should employ bird-smart principles and comply with relevant state and federal wildlife protection laws.\nWhat is bird-smart wind energy?\nBird-smart wind power implements careful siting considerations, operation and construction mitigation, bird monitoring, and compensation to reduce and redress unavoidable bird mortality and habitat loss. These are issues that the federal government should include in mandatory wind standards. For terrestrial wind farms, bird-smart wind should address:\n- Siting: Bird-smart wind power (including wind farms and associated infrastructure) is sited to prevent harm to birds, ideally in already altered habitats such as farmland, and avoids sensitive areas. Examples of such areas may include migratory bottlenecks, wetlands, raptor concentration and key nesting areas, the edges of ridges used by migrants, key habitat or flight paths for endangered or declining species, breeding concentrations of species that avoid tall structures (such as some grouse species), and in or adjacent to Important Bird Areas. Maps with detailed data on wildlife are currently being developed by conservation groups for use by the wind industry. Pre-construction assessments should always be conducted to confirm whether a particular site presents an especially high risk to birds. Some areas are not going to be suitable for wind development.\n- Operation and Construction Mitigation: Bird-smart wind power uses the best technology and management practices to avoid and minimize harm to birds, such as by burying transmission lines in high risk areas, following Avian Power Line Interaction Committee standards for above-ground transmission lines, using lighting that minimizes nighttime migratory bird collision mortality (such as strobe lights), using unguyed rather than guyed meteorological towers, and restoring habitat disturbed by construction, e.g., re-compacting soils disturbed by construction and replanting native vegetation (or restoring the site if the wind farm is decommissioned).\n- Monitoring: Bird-smart wind power conducts effective, federally reviewed and approved, site-specific, pre- and post-construction studies/assessments to assist with improved siting and operation, and to properly quantify impacts. Pre-construction assessments must provide sufficient data to assist with micro-siting (e.g., by use of radar to detect local bird movements), create an annual baseline against which post-construction studies can be evaluated, use all existing available bird study data, and be conducted during months when bird use can be expected to be at its peak at the selected site. Post-construction studies must employ mathematical models that best account for variations in local conditions and the relative difficulty of locating bird carcasses in different habitats, as well as any scavenging by predators that may reduce the number of carcasses found, and run for at least two years (and long enough to determine the efficacy of, and make needed revisions to, operational mitigation measures).\n- Compensation: Bird-smart wind power redresses the loss of any birds or habitat unavoidably harmed by construction and operation to a net benefit standard. This includes bird deaths caused by collisions with turbines and their associated power lines, and lost or degraded habitat (e.g., areas of abandoned habitat) Such compensation could include acquiring additional land for the National Wildlife Refuge system or other off-site habitat conservation projects.\nAlthough offshore wind power is not yet operational in the U.S., an analogous set of siting, operating, and compensatory measures need to be developed to make it bird-smart.\nAll wind farms should have an Avian Protection Plan which includes American Bird Conservancy’s bird-smart principles, and a means of implementing them and tracking and reporting on this implementation. Wind farms should also comply with relevant state and federal wildlife protection laws such as the Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, and National Environmental Policy Act.\nHow would you know if a potential wind farm site will have large or small impacts to birds?\nSee section above on pre-construction monitoring and post-construction monitoring.\nIsn’t the Federal Government developing wind energy regulations?\nNo, the Federal Government has released draft, voluntary wind-energy guidelines that were produced from recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior by a Federal Advisory Committee. During the public comment period on those proposed voluntary guidelines, ABC will urge that that the Department of the Interior enact mandatory standards that the industry must follow. We do not believe that energy industries should be able to choose whether or not to consider bird impacts.\nA recent lawsuit regarding the Altamont Pass Wind Farm in California illustrates that getting the right thing done voluntarily is anything but a sure thing. Recent studies say that approximately 7,600-9,300 birds were killed there each year, including 55-94 Golden Eagles, 475-477 American Kestrels, 253-433 Red-tailed Hawks, and 714-718 Burrowing Owls. After seven years of being challenged by various conservation groups, it finally took a lawsuit to get changes made at Altamont Pass. NextEra Energy Resources has only recently agreed to replace 2,400 of its old wind turbines at Altamont Pass with fewer, larger models that produce the same amount of total power. They also agreed to place the new turbines in “more environmentally friendly” locations, and to pay $2.5 million for research and raptor habitat improvement.\nWhat kinds of birds are impacted by wind farms?\nPotentially all night-migrating songbirds are at risk of colliding with wind turbines, as are raptors and other birds when wind farms are sited in areas they frequent. Habitat loss is also an issue as wind farms can degrade bird habitat or cause birds to abandon habitat.\nGolden Eagles will be especially impacted because much of the additional wind build-out planned for the western U.S. is expected to occur in areas they inhabit. The endangered Whooping Crane will be exposed to additional risk from collision with new power lines erected to service wind farms along their migratory pathways.\nTo a Greater Sage-Grouse and some other birds, any tall structure such as a wind turbine is a threat because it is a potential perch for a predatory bird. A wind turbine standing a considerable distance away has much the same effect as a small tree at a few hundred yards, causing sage-grouse to abandon traditional lekking grounds up to three miles away from a wind farm. Unfortunately for the Sage-Grouse, Wyoming, one of this bird’s last remaining strongholds, is slated for significant wind farm build-out. It is very important for the future of the Greater Sage-Grouse that this development is appropriately sited\nHow many birds are killed by wind farms each year?\nNo one knows for sure. Recent estimates of the number of birds killed by wind turbines ranges from a low of 100,000 birds/year to 440,000 birds/year (calculated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service). If 20% of the nation’s electricity comes from wind power by 2030, ABC estimates that at least one million birds per year will be killed by wind turbines, probably significantly more.\nAren’t there laws that protect birds from being killed by wind farms?\nWhooping Cranes and some other birds are protected under the Endangered Species Act. Golden Eagles are protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BAGEPA), and most migratory birds are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). Unfortunately, both the BAGEPA and MBTA are not currently sufficiently enforced to prevent predicted mortality resulting from wind development. However, in 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to begin issuing permits for wind farms that expect to kill Golden Eagles, contingent on the wind farms taking tangible steps to protect eagles. The Greater Sage-Grouse, meanwhile, currently receives no federal legal protection, though several states have stepped up to protect remaining core breeding areas.\nRead full ABC Policy Statement on Wind Energy']"	['<urn:uuid:90d8e6bf-6add-4743-a012-fb672dfb1658>', '<urn:uuid:ad348f5b-9b9c-419d-9045-9be2eb6e06f6>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	15	93	2323
30	nature resources consumption buddhist economics classical views	Classical literature uses nature metaphors like pine trees and storms to warn against excess, while Buddhist Economics provides specific principles for resource use - advocating minimal use of non-renewables, local production for local needs, and viewing excessive consumption of natural resources as violence. Both views counsel moderation, but Buddhist Economics provides explicit guidelines for sustainable resource management.

When people understand what constitutes desire, they realize that all the wealth in the world cannot satisfy it. When people understand the universality of fear, they become more compassionate to all beings. Thus, this spiritual approach to Economics doesn\'t rely on theories and models but on the essential forces of acumen, empathy and restraint.\nThe Buddhist point of view intents at giving work a trinal function: to give man a chance to utilize and develop his aptitude; to enable him to overcome his self-aggrandizement by engaging with other people in common tasks; and to bring forward the goods and services needed for a better existence.\nFrom the perspective of a Buddhist, Economics and other streams of knowledge cannot be separated. Economics is a single component of a combined effort to fix the problems of humanity and Buddhist Economics works with it to reach a common goal of societal, individual and environmental sufficiency.\n HistoryThe term was coined by E. F. Schumacher in 1955, when he traveled to Burma as an economic consultant for Prime Minister U Nu, and is used by followers of Schumacher and by Theravada Buddhist writers such as Prayudh Payutto and Phrabhavanaviriyakhun.\nSchumacher\'s essay ""Buddhist Economics"" was first published in 1966 in Asia: A Handbook, and republished in his influential collection Small Is Beautiful (1973).\nThe 1st Conference of the Buddhist Economics Research Platform, August 23–24, 2007 was held in Budapest, Hungary  and the 2nd in Ubon Ratchathani University, Warin Chamrab, Ubon Ratchathani Thailand from April 9–11, 2009. The third conference was supposed to be held in Brisbane, Australia on January 18–19 but was postponed until further notice.\n A Buddhist Economist\'s perspectiveSuppose we consider the demand for a commodity, say cigarettes and consider that it has been showing an increasing trend. This trend will be supported by an increase in production of cigarettes. These cigarettes are then put into the market and purchased and consumed by people. When it is consumed, the demand is satisfied and normally, nobody bothers about the stage after consumption. But Buddhist Economists go beyond that and investigate how these trends affect the three intertwined aspects of human existence: The individual, society and the environment. Specific to an increase in the consumption of cigarettes, Buddhist Economists try to decipher how this increase affects the pollution levels in the environment, its impact on passive smokers and active smokers and the various health hazards that come along with smoking, thus taking into consideration the ethical side of economics. The ethical aspect of it is partly judged by the outcomes it brings and partly by the qualities which lead to it.\n The differences between Western Economics and Buddhist EconomicsWhile Western Economics concentrates on self-interest, the Buddhist view challenges it by changing the concept of self to Anatta or no-self. It preaches that all things perceived by one\'s senses are not actually ""I"" or ""mine"" and therefore, humans must detach themselves from this feeling. They believe that the self-interest based, opportunistic approach to ethics will always fail. According to them, generosity will work because human beings are Homo reciprocans who tend to reciprocate to feelings (either positively or negatively) by giving back more than what is given to them.\nThe second significant difference is that Western Economists give importance to maximizing profits and individual gains while the underlying principle of Buddhist Economists is to minimize suffering(losses) for all living or non living things. Studies conducted by them have shown that human beings show greater sensitivity to loss than to gains and therefore people should concentrate more on reducing the former.\nThe third difference is with respect to the concept of desire. Western Economics encourages material wealth and desire because of which people try and accumulate more and more wealth- sometimes at the cost of others- to satisfy those cravings. In contrast, in Buddhist Economics, importance is given to simplify one\'s desires. According to them, apart from the basic necessities like food, shelter, clothing and medicines, other materialistic needs should be minimized. They say that overall well-being decreases if people pursue meaningless desires. Wanting less will benefit the person, the community they live in and nature.\nThe fourth point of difference is related to their views on the market. While Western Economists advocate maximizing markets to a point of saturation, Buddhist Economists aim at minimizing violence. According to them, Western Economists do not take into consideration primordial stakeholders like the future generations and the natural world because their vote is not considered important in terms of purchasing power. They feel that other stakeholders such as poor and marginalized people are under-represented because of their inadequate purchasing power and preference is given to the strongest stakeholder. Therefore, they believe that the market is not an unbiased place, truly representative of the economy. Thus, Buddhist Economists advocate ahimsa or non-violence. According to them, ahimsa prevents doing anything that directly causes suffering to oneself or others and urges to find solutions in a participatory way. Community supported agriculture is one such example of community based economic activities. They believe that it fosters trust, helps build value based communities and brings people closer to the land and the farm. Achieving this sustainability and non-violence requires restructuring of dominating configurations of modern business, which they advocate. This leads to deemphasizing profit maximization as the ultimate motive and renewed emphasis on introducing small-scale, locally adaptable, substantive economic activities.\nThe fifth point of difference is that Western Economists try to maximize instrumental use where the value of any entity is determined by its marginal contribution to the production output. Therefore, Buddhist Economists feel that the real value of an entity is neither realized nor given importance to. They try to reduce instrumental use and form caring organizations which will be rewarded in terms of trust among the management, co-workers and employees.\nThe sixth point of difference lies in the fact that Western Economists believe that bigger is better and more is more whereas Buddhist Economists believe that small is beautiful and less is more.\nThe seventh point of difference is that Western economics gives importance to gross national product whereas Buddhist economics gives importance to gross national happiness.\n Other beliefsBuddhist Economists believe that as long as work is considered a disutility for labourers and labourers a necessary evil for employers, true potential of the labourers and employers cannot be achieved. In such a situation, employees will always prefer income without employment and employers will always prefer output without employees. They feel that if the nature of work is truly appreciated and applied, it will be as important to the brain as food is to the body.It will nourish man and motivate him to do his best. According to them, goods should not be considered more important than people and consumption more important than creative activity. They feel that as a result of this, the focus shifts from the worker to the product of the work, the human to the subhuman, which is wrong.\nAccording to them, people are unable to feel liberated not because of wealth but because of their attachment to wealth. In the same way, they say that it is the craving for pleasurable baubles and not the enjoyment from them that holds humans back.\nBuddhist Economists do not believe in measuring the standard of living by the amount of consumption because according to them, obtaining maximum well being as a result of minimum consumption is more important than obtaining maximum well being from maximum consumption. Thus, they feel that the concept of being \'better off\' because of greater levels of consumption is not a true measure of happiness.\nFrom the point of view of a Buddhist economist, the most rational way of economic life is being self-sufficient and producing local resources for local needs and depending on imports and exports is uneconomic and justifiable only in a few cases and on a small scale. Thus, they believe in economic development, independent of foreign aid.\nBuddhist Economics also gives importance to natural, renewable and non-renewable resources. They feel that non renewable resources should only be used when most needed and then also with utmost care, meticulously planning out its use. They believe that using them extravagantly is violent and not in keeping with the Buddhist belief of non violence. According to them, if the entire population relies on non renewable resources for their existence, they are behaving parasitically, preying on capital goods instead of income. Adding to this, they feel that this uneven distribution and ever increasing exploitation of natural resources will lead to violence between man.\nThey also believe that satisfaction need not necessarily be felt only when something tangible is got back in return for giving something or something material is gained, as stated in modern economics. They say that the feeling of satisfaction can be achieved even when we part with something without getting anything tangible in return. An example is when we give presents to our loved one\'s just because we want them to be happy.\nBuddhist Economists believe that production is a very misleading term. According to them, to produce something new, the old form has to be destroyed. Therefore, production and consumption become complimentary to each other. Taking this into consideration, they advocate non-production is certain cases because when you produce lesser of materialistic things, you reduce exploitation of the world\'s resources and lead the life of a responsible and aware citizen.\n The Middle Way of livingThe concept of the ""Middle Way"" says that time should be divided between working towards consumption and meditation and the optimal allocation between these two activities will be when some meditation is utilized to lower the desire for consumption and to be satisfied with lesser consumption and the work that it involves.\nIn economic terms this means “the marginal productivity of labour utilized in producing consumption goods is equal to the marginal effectiveness of the meditation involved in economizing on consumption without bringing about any change in satisfaction”.\n See also\n- Gross National Happiness » Maintenance Mode\n- Payutto, Ven.

31	What makes bacterial biofilms so challenging to treat in medical settings, and how do researchers study their properties and structure?	Bacterial biofilms are challenging to treat because they are colonies of microorganisms encased by an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) that forms a protective shield, making them resistant to antibodies and antibiotics. According to the NIH, 80% of human bacterial infections involve biofilms, which can develop within hours. These complex 3D structures can cause chronic infections and prevent wounds from fully healing. Researchers study biofilms through various methods, including lab models like the Infection Prevention Model and Infection Treatment Model, which test treatment effectiveness against bacteria like MRSA. They also use advanced techniques such as 3D confocal microscopy to study biofilm structure and mechanics, and have developed microfluidic rheometers for measuring biofilm elasticity. This research helps understand both the mechanical properties of biofilms and their resistance to treatments.	['University of California at Berkeley\nPhD CHE ’96\nUniversity of Wisconsin at Madison\nBS CHE and Economics ’90\nOur research investigates complex fluids – soft materials with properties intermediate between fluids and solids. Our current interests include nanocolloidal assembly, colloidal gelation, and the biomechanics of bacterial biofilms. Applications that interest us include creating new optical materials, sensors, biomedical devices and procedures, as well as materials for energy management.\nThe assembly of nanocolloids into useful structures has long been a key aim of chemical engineers and materials scientists. For example, ordered arrays of colloidal particles formed in the liquid state can be further processed to yield photonic crystal structures useful for sensing and optical materials. Yet, the success of this technological aim is severely hindered by some deep fundamental problems. For example, the crystal structures that have been fabricated to date are disappointingly small, most likely because typical nanocolloidal building blocks are not nearly complex as molecules. We address this challenge by synthesizing anisotropic colloids and assembling them with the assistance of applied electric, shear and gravitational fields. We collaborate with Profs. Sharon Glotzer, Mark Burns and Joanna Millunchick in pursuit of this aim. In a second effort, we address the fact that the typical size of the ordered arrays that have been produced in academia is currently too small for real-world applications. In collaboration with Professor Ron Larson, we have investigated the complex fluid dynamics of large-scale methods for colloidal crystal production, such as spin coating. These questions are studied within a collaborative, student-drive research program that includes novel colloid synthesis, direct visualization of assembly structure and dynamics by confocal microscopy as well as rheological measurements.\nColloidal gelation is a common industrial process to manage the rheological and microstructural properties of complex fluid formulations used in the stabilization of consumer products, ceramic materials and pharmaceutical formulations. By developing new 3D confocal microscopy methods, our group has made fundamental discoveries about gels that are currently being applied in industry to develop new materials and complex fluid processing methods. Currently, we are engaged in an investigation of the origin of rupture and yielding in colloidal gels. The work involves a combination of advanced microscopy techniques, flow cell fabrication using methods such as microfabrication, and rheological measurements.\nBiomechanics of bacterial biofilms\nWith Dr. John Younger of the U-Michigan Department of Emergency Medicine and collaborators at two other universities, we are exploring the biomechanical properties of bacterial biofilms. Biofilms are colonies of microorganisms that are pervasive in a range of natural and industrial settings. They can also grow on devices, such as intravascular catheters, that are introduced into the body as part of medical practice. Biofilm structure and mechanics is thought to play a protective role by, for example, improving the resistance of bacteria to antibiotic treatments. The aim of this project is to understand and measure the mechanical properties of biofilms of size about 10 – 100 microns, since these dimensions match the scales relevant to medical practice. As part of this work, we have developed a flexible microfluidic rheometer for micromechanical measurements of bacterial biofilm elasticity. Current work is focused on molecular characterization of the extracellular polysaccharides present in biofilms, rheological characterization of whole biofilms, and confocal microscopy visualization of the complex microscopic structure of biofilms.\nOur research is supported by NSF, NIH, DOE, and Procter & Gamble.\nMichael Solomon is Professor of Chemical Engineering and Professor of Macromolecular Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. He was previously Dow Corning Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering and has been member of the Michigan Faculty since 1997. Prior to joining U-Michigan, Mike was a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Melbourne, Australia. He received his B.S. in chemical engineering and economics from the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1990 and his Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the University of California at Berkeley in 1996. He was a Rotary Foundation International Fellow in economics at the Université d’Aix-Marseille II, Aix-en-Provence, France from 1990-1991.\nSolomon’s research interests are in the area of complex fluids – soft materials with properties intermediate between fluids and solids. His group has developed and applied 3D confocal microscopy methods to study the soft matter phenomena of self-assembly, gelation, and the biomechanics of bacterial biofilms. His work has also included discovery of a universal scaling for polymer scission in turbulence that identifies the limits that scission imposes on turbulent drag reduction. Other research interests have included the rheology of polymer nanocomposites, the microrheology of complex fluids and the microfluidic synthesis of anisotropic particles.\nHis teaching interests have included development of undergraduate courses in polymer science and engineering, molecular engineering, and chemical engineering process economics as well as graduate electives in nano and colloidal assembly and light scattering. Mike has received the College of Engineering 1938E Award (2002), the University of Michigan Russel Award (2003), the U-M ASEE Outstanding Professor of the Year Award (2006), the Rackham Graduate School’s Faculty Recognition Award (2008) and the COE Education Excellence Award (2010). He has been recipient of the NSF CAREER award, 3M’s non-Tenured Faculty award, and the 2011 Soft Matter Lectureship from the Royal Society of Chemistry’s journal Soft Matter.\nSolomon previously chaired the Society of Rheology’s Education Committee and its Metzner Award Committee as well as the Fluid Mechanics Programming Committee of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. He is current member of the Editorial Advisory Board of the Journal Rheologica Acta. Currently, Solomon is Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Initiatives at the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies at the University of Michigan.\nMost recently, Solomon has taught the junior-level separation course (ChE 343), for which he wrote a course pack, and Chemical Engineering Process Economics (ChE 485). Previous electives Professor Solomon has offered are Polymer Science and Engineering (ChE 472), Molecular Engineering (ChE 496, with Mark Burns), Scattering and Optical Methods for Complex Fluids (ChE 696) as well as Nano and Colloidal Assembly (ChE 696).

Scientists are fighting back.\nAntonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) was the first person to delve into the field of microbiology and document initial observations of bacteria. After this preliminary discovery, microbiology was not actively studied again until the 1800s, when it began to gain a foothold in contemporary medicine. Fast-forward to today’s labs, where clinicians are becoming more knowledgeable in the bacteriology of wound healing, and researchers are identifying new ways to overcome long-standing challenges in wound healing, such as biofilms.\nBiofilm is a term used to describe a colony of microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi or yeast, encased by an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). The EPS forms a shield, often causing the bacteria to be resistant to antibodies. While biofilms have been understood in nature for many decades, researchers are only recently beginning to recognize the role they play in infected wounds and the healing process.\nThe US National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates that 80% of human bacterial infections involve biofilms. These infections can develop quickly, sometimes in a matter of hours, and are highly complex. Biofilms are resistant to the defense mechanisms of the body, and as polymicrobial systems, they are difficult to treat with systemic antibiotics or topical antibiotics.\nBiofilms may explain many of the challenges clinicians face with wound care, infection and healing. Due to antibiotic resistance, biofilms may cause chronic infections or prevent wounds from fully healing because the infection is never fully eradicated. Persistent infection can lead to systemic infections, risky prolonged exposure to antibiotics or amputation of the infected site.\nTasked with breaking down biofilms in order to develop effective treatments, scientists are conducting in vivo studies to better understand biofilm properties and identify ways to expose the bacteria. Two models that our lab developed to study the effectiveness of treatments for infected wounds in small and large animals, include the:\n- Infection Prevention Model, where treatment is applied prior to inoculation with bacteria and wounds are swabbed at regular intervals to determine bacteria levels.\n- Infection Treatment Model, where treatment is delayed for several days to allow establishment of bacterial infection prior to treatment. Wounds are swabbed prior to treatment for baseline levels and then at regular intervals post-treatment to determine bacterial levels.\nThere are also models in development designed to test new treatments specifically for biofilms. The typical bacterial strain for all infected wound or biofilm models is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA, as this environmental organism regularly causes infections in wounds and is a major concern in individuals with compromised immune systems, especially those who are hospitalized.\nIt’s evident that biofilms are a significant public health concern today and the more we do to understand their role in certain infectious disease and biofilm processes the greater the chances of controlling them and improving patient safety.\nAn earlier version of this post was published by MPI Research, which is now part of Charles River.']	['<urn:uuid:568b5396-35f7-4bce-9603-9f7845f9de39>', '<urn:uuid:49374028-3cf2-496f-ab9c-b318d85e10be>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	20	127	2495
32	What similarities can be found between Johnny Cash's musical journey and Willie Dixon's career path in terms of their genre-crossing influence on American music?	Both Johnny Cash and Willie Dixon were influential figures who crossed multiple musical genres. Cash, while primarily remembered as a country icon, spanned genres including rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel, leading to his unique triple induction in the Country, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame. Similarly, Willie Dixon was a founding father of both Chicago blues and rock'n'roll, writing hits that influenced multiple genres. His songs were covered by blues artists like Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, and later by rock bands like The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds, and Cream, demonstrating his cross-genre impact.	"['Johnny Cash was born on February 26, 1932 in Kingsland, AR. His older brother, Jack, died when he was 12 years old.\nJohn R. ""Johnny"" Cash (February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter, actor, and author who was considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Although he is primarily remembered as a country icon, his songs and sound spanned other genres including rock and roll and rockabilly —especially early in his career—and blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of induction in the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Gospel Music Hall of Fame.\nCash was known for his deep, distinctive bass-baritone voice, for the ""boom-chicka-boom"" sound of his Tennessee Three backing band; for a rebelliousness, coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor; for providing free concerts inside prison walls;]page needed[ and for his dark performance clothing, which earned him the nickname ""The Man in Black"". He traditionally began his concerts with the phrase ""Hello, I\'m Johnny Cash."", followed by his standard ""Folsom Prison Blues"". Music\nCountry music is a genre of American popular music that originated in the rural regions of the Southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of American folk music and Western music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, fiddles, and harmonicas.\nThe term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.\nThe Grammy Legend Award, or the Grammy Living Legend Award, is a special award of merit given to recording artists by the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States for outstanding achievements in the music industry.\nThe first Grammy Legend Awards were issued in 1990 to Andrew Lloyd Webber, Liza Minnelli, Smokey Robinson and Willie Nelson. The honor was inaugurated to recognize ""ongoing contributions and influence in the recording field"". The next year four more musicians (Aretha Franklin, Billy Joel, Johnny Cash and Quincy Jones) were acknowledged with Grammy Legend Awards. The award was given to Barbra Streisand in 1992 and Michael Jackson in 1993.\nThe Pine Bluff Metropolitan Statistical Area, as defined by the United States Census Bureau, is a three-county region in southeast Arkansas, anchored by the city of Pine Bluff. As of the 2010 census, the MSA had a population of 100,258. It is also a component of the larger Little Rock-North Little Rock, AR Combined Statistical Area.\nThe United States of America (USA), commonly referred to as the United States (US), America, or simply the States, is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, 16 territories, a federal district, and various overseas extraterritorial jurisdictions. The 48 contiguous states and the federal district of Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.79 million square miles (9.83 million km2) in total and with around 316 million people, the United States is the fourth-largest country by total area and third largest by population. It is one of the world\'s most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.\nPaleo-indians migrated from Asia to what is now the US mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The ensuing war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first 10 amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.\nKingsland is a city in Cleveland County, Arkansas, United States. Its population was 447 at the 2010 U.S. census. It is included in the Pine Bluff, Arkansas Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is famous as the birthplace of Johnny Cash.\nValerie June Carter Cash (June 23, 1929 – May 15, 2003) was an American singer, dancer, songwriter, actress, comedian and author who was a member of the Carter Family and the second wife of singer Johnny Cash. She played the guitar, banjo, harmonica and autoharp, and acted in several films and television shows. Carter Cash was inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame in 2009. She was ranked No. 31 in CMT\'s 40 Greatest Women in Country Music in 2002.\nJohn Gale ""Johnny"" Horton (April 30, 1925 – November 5, 1960) was an American country music and rockabilly singer most famous for his semi-folk, so-called ""saga songs"" which began the ""historical ballad"" craze of the late 1950s and early 1960s. With them, he had several major successes, most notably in 1959 with the song ""The Battle of New Orleans"" (written by Jimmy Driftwood), which was awarded the 1960 Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording. The song was awarded the Grammy Hall of Fame Award, and in 2001 ranked No. 333 of the Recording Industry Association of America\'s ""Songs of the Century"". His first hit, a number #1 was in 1959, with When It\'s Springtime in Alaska (It\'s Forty Below)\nDuring 1960, Horton had two other successes with ""North to Alaska"" for John Wayne\'s movie, North to Alaska, and ""Sink the Bismarck"". Horton is a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame\nIn journalism, a human interest story is a feature story that discusses a person or people in an emotional way. It presents people and their problems, concerns, or achievements in a way that brings about interest, sympathy or motivation in the reader or viewer.\nHuman interest stories may be ""the story behind the story"" about an event, organization, or otherwise faceless historical happening, such as about the life of an individual soldier during wartime, an interview with a survivor of a natural disaster, a random act of kindness or profile of someone known for a career achievement. Law Crime', ""Willie Dixon - Biography\nBy J Poet\nThough Willie Dixon didn’t make many records under his own name, he’s still undoubtedly one of the founding fathers of both modern Chicago blues and rock’n’roll. Dixon wrote some of the blues’ biggest hits, like Muddy Waters’ “Hoochie Coochie Man,” Howlin’ Wolf’s “Evil,” and Little Walter’s “My Babe,” …not to mention “Spoonful,” “Wang Dang Doodle,” “Back Door Man,” “Little Red Rooster,” “Bring It on Home,” “I Just Wanna Make Love to You,” “Big Boss Man” and about 500 more. His hits built Chess Records into a blues powerhouse; although he eventually sued them and won back some of the rights to his music.\nDixon was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi in 1915, where he heard blues, Dixieland and ragtime musicians playing on the streets. He lived in a house behind his mother’s restaurant, next to Curley’s Barrelhouse, a blues joint where he could hear Little Brother Montgomery and Charley Patton singing at night. He frequently ran away from home and at twelve he was serving time on a county farm for stealing plumbing from an abandoned house. He sang briefly with the Union Jubilee Singers gospel quartet on Vicksburg radio station WQBC before roaming the country before ending up in Chicago in 1936. There he began boxing, eventually winning the Illinois Golden Gloves novice heavyweight championship, but subsequently banned when he complained about not getting paid.\nDixon then turned back to music, learning guitar and bass – the latter on a homemade instrument with one string. He joined The Five Breezes (with Leonard “Baby Doo” Caston) and made a single in 1939 that sold poorly. When Dixon was drafted, he refused to serve, citing the social and economic oppression of black people. After a lengthy struggle, the draft board deemed him unfit for duty.\nIn 1946, Dixon and Caston formed The Big Three Trio, modeled on pop groups like The Mills Brothers and The Ink Spots. They made some successful records for Columbia but broke up in 1951. Willie Dixon: The Big Three Trio (1990 Columbia) collects some of their best tracks. The Chess brothers hired Dixon that same year and he quickly became their head producer, arranger and bandleader, in addition to playing bass on many sessions. In 1954, Muddy Waters had a hit with “Hoochie Coochie Man,” and Dixon began writing for Chess. He penned “I Just Wanna Make Love to You” and “I'm Ready” for Waters. Both reached the Top 10 on the Rhythm & Blues Records charts. At the end of 1956, after charting countless hits, he left the label over royalty and contract disputes, although he continued to pay sessions, most famously on Chuck Berry’s “Maybellene.”\nIn 1957, he started his own publishing house, Ghana Music, and then returned to Chess. On his own, he cut some down-home acoustic sessions with Memphis Slim for the small Prestige label including Willie’s Blues (1959 Bluesville). The duo played the 1959 Newport Folk Festival and became favorites at folk and blues clubs in the ‘60s. In 1962, Dixon joined the First American Folk Blues Festival; a package tour put together by German blues fans Horst Lippmann and Fritz Rau. He stayed until 1965, when he became the tour’s Chicago A&R man. When the British Invasion came along, Dixon was one of the writers bands like The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds and Cream turned to for material. The Stones had a number one hit with “Little Red Rooster,” the first blues song to top the UK Singles Chart.\nBy the late ‘60s, soul and rock had largely pushed the blues aside and in 1969, Chess was sold to GRT, where it eventually became part of Universal Music Group. Dixon’s work for Chess, both on his own and as a sideman and writer, is collected on the box set, The Original Wang Dang Doodle – The Chess Recordings and More (1989 MCA). In 1969, Dixon put together the Chicago Blues All-Stars with Johnny Shines (guitar and vocals), Sunnyland Slim (piano), Walter Horton (harmonica), Clifton James (drums) and Dixon on bass and vocals. In 1969, he released I Am the Blues (Columbia), an album filled with classic songs. He later started his own label, Yambo, and cut Catalyst (1973) and What’s Happened to My Blues? (1977), both were nominated for Best Contemporary Blues Album Grammys. In 1977, Dixon had a foot amputated due to diabetic complications but it didn’t slow him down as he moved to California and started writing for movies. He performed “Don't You Tell Me Nothin’” in Martin Scorsese’s The Color of Money (1986) and produced a new version of “Who Do You Love” for the La Bamba Soundtrack. He also appeared in the films Raw Justice, Night of the Warrior and Rich Girl.\nIn 1982, he set up the Blues Heaven Foundation to mentor young players and help old timers win back the rights to their royalties. He received a large out of court settlement from Led Zeppelin for “Whole Lotta Love” due to its similarity to his “You Need Love.” His last albums were the Grammy winning (Best Traditional Blues Recording) Hidden Charms (1988 Capital) and Ginger Ale Afternoon (1989 Varèse Sarabande), which was also nominated for a Best Traditional Blues Recording Grammy. Dixon died in 1992 in Burbank, California. Two years later, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.""]"	['<urn:uuid:27dc7628-5ea0-4ed8-9aa7-2a2e68e71175>', '<urn:uuid:5085ecae-58ab-4900-a17d-2a661655f7f1>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	24	100	2107
33	How do speaking rhythm and cognitive loads affect information processing?	Speaking rhythm impacts information processing through its tempo and alternation of stressed words - similar to music - and can enhance listener attention and experience when properly managed. Meanwhile, information processing is affected by cognitive loads: intrinsic load (task difficulty), extrinsic load (external distractions), and germane load (individual intelligence). While rhythm can be controlled through careful script writing and pauses, cognitive loads must be managed differently - intrinsic loads can be reduced by breaking down complex information, while extrinsic loads can be minimized by controlling environmental factors.	['We typically spend our schooling years writing for a teacher to silently read our essays and reports. Unless we’ve had special training, how could we suddenly know how to write for the ear?\nYet that’s what we’re expected to do when storyboarding and writing voice over scripts. Writing for audio is a different kind of writing. If you’re having trouble making the transition from eye to ear, here are some tips.\nWrite like you speak\nIn most cases, writing for the ear is more informal than writing to be read. You may find that it improves your style if you imagine that you are speaking to someone while you are writing. When you write like you speak, you will naturally use smaller words, a more conversational tone and shorter sentences (discussed below).\nGet to the point quickly\nWhen you’re writing for audio, you don’t have much time to lead up to the point. You have to get there quickly before you lose your audience. Focus on what’s most important by using straightforward wording. I like to think of it as intelligent simplicity.\nLearn from commercial scripts\nYou can learn a lot from the scripts written for those short 30-second radio commercials. They say it, explain it and repeat it. The lead sentence gets your attention and makes you want to find out more. Then you get a few details and then it’s repeated. This isn’t a bad formula for instructional scripts—Say it, Explain it, Repeat it.\nSpeak with one voice\nPerhaps you’re on a big project with several instructional designers furiously writing away, oblivious to the voice they are using. Or perhaps you’re the only one writing, but some days you start with one voice and other days you use another.\nSpeaking with one voice emerges out of consistency. It sounds like the narrator deeply knows and understands the topic, because consistency makes the speaker credible. To achieve the sound of one voice, consider defining these aspects of a script from the start:\n- Tone: Decide on a tone that will best connect with your audience (conversational, folksy, sophisticated, etc.)\n- Person: whether you’ll be using first, second or third person. If you never quite got this in school, Wikipedia explains.\n- Contractions: Will you use them or not?\nThen let one anointed editor read the scripts to smooth out all of the inconsistencies.\nKeep sentences short but varied\nMany people recommend using short sentences when writing for audio. And it’s true that in an eLearning environment, you can’t count on your busy audience to click Replay if they miss something. The risk of relying on short sentences, however, is that the script may sound stilted or too simplistic.\nA better approach might be to aim for short sentences that vary in length. This is closer to how we speak. To keep sentences on the shorter side: 1) stick to one idea per sentence; 2) delete all the extra verbiage; and 3) break sentences into two whenever possible.\nLet them read it\nNo one likes screens of text, but some subjects demand it, such as those involving legal or compliance training. In these cases, refer to the screen text in the script, state what it is and let the learner read it. Adults don’t like to be read to. To accommodate those who are visually impaired, provide an option for having the text read aloud.\nPay attention to rhythm\nSpeaking is similar to music—it’s got a rhythm related to the tempo of the speech and the alternation of stressed and unstressed words. When you read your script aloud, you can improve the rhythm by considering the words as sounds and listening to their flow and timing. A pleasing rhythm has the potential to hold the listener’s attention longer and to enhance the listening experience.\nUse silence effectively\nSilence is to audio as white space is to visuals. Listeners need time to process the verbal content and to watch what’s on the screen. You can work brief pauses into your script by indicating where the talent should stop for a moment (often referred to as a beat) during the recording. I usually indicate this with an ellipsis (…). Frequent pauses also give you time to add elements for screen builds. Silence is your friend. Use it with purpose.\nWatch your transitions\nTransition words, such as yet, but, however, therefore and meanwhile, let listeners know that a change from the previous thought is coming. Use transitions as cues to help clarify your message.\nEdit in phases\nSome accomplished writers recommend editing in several passes while honing one aspect of your writing at a time. In Getting the Words Right, author Theodore Cheney recommends that your first revision should focus on massive changes, which he calls reducing. Then he advises less ambitious revisions, such as rearranging. Finally, there is rewording. Or create your own phases of editing that work for your style of writing.\nCalculate the length of segments\nYou don’t want things to run on and on. A rule of thumb for calculating time is that in one minute, a narrator will read approximately 100 words. If you want your segment to last a minute, pare it down to 100 words or less.\nDo a sound check\nReading your script aloud is mandatory. That’s how you can determine whether the wording is awkward or smooth and whether the sentences flow from one to the next. Reading aloud helps you know when it’s best to use contractions, if juxtaposed words are difficult to pronounce and whether the whole script is well-connected. Finally, this is how you know if a narrator can get through a sentence without having to stop for a breath in the middle.\nConsider sound effects\nMany public radio producers add depth and realism to their stories through sound effects. When used with sophistication, sound effects can add richness to straight narration, scenarios, interactions and games. And their cost is minimal.\nYou probably have some tips too! Leave them in the Comments below.\nGet the latest articles, resources and freebies once a month plus 12 Scripting Tips.', 'The Cognitive Load Theory states that an individual’s working memory is impacted by factors that can decrease the memory function. These factors, known as loads, are divided into three categories: intrinsic, extrinsic, and germane.\nOnly intrinsic and extrinsic loads are controllable. Germane load refers to IQ; individual intelligence impacts how much information can be stored in the working memory. IQ varies slightly throughout an individual’s lifetime, but intellectual ability remains fairly fixed.\nWhat is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic loads? Here’s what to know about intrinsic vs. extrinsic loads and how these load types impact reading.\nWhat are Intrinsic Loads?\nIntrinsic load refers to the level of difficulty of a new task or skill. For example, learning how to solve a basic linear equation could be simple for an individual whose mind learns math easily. Others, though, might find that the intrinsic load of algebra is overwhelming.\nEveryone has overwhelming intrinsic loads unique to them. However, individuals with lower than average intelligence might find scholastic-related skills to be more difficult than their higher-IQ peers. For individuals with a high germane load (i.e. a lower IQ), the intrinsic load of learning a new skill results in a load burden. Learning could be incredibly difficult, and educators would need to break new lessons or skills into chunks to ease the burden.\nLearning also could be impacted by extrinsic loads. What are extrinsic loads and why are they important to understand?\nWhat to Know About Extrinsic Loads\nExtrinsic loads refer to external factors that negatively impact learning a new skill or subject matter. A new subject or lesson does not need to be difficult to cause learning struggles. External factors lead to distraction or discomfort that causes an individual to feel overwhelmed or even unable to fully process and learn something new. In addition, the way a teacher presents the subject might confuse a student or be distracting.\nSensory examples of extrinsic loads include:\n- Temperature sensitivities (the room might be too hot or too cold)\n- Loud noises or distracting sounds\n- Uncomfortable clothing\n- Displeasing aromas\n- Distracting lights or visuals\nIndividuals who become overwhelmed by extrinsic loads are sensitive or easily distracted by a sensory issue. Some individuals with autism might be overwhelmed by numerous sensory stimuli; for example, a tag on a shirt could be too scratchy, and the room might be too loud.\nThese external factors make it difficult–perhaps even impossible–to effectively learn something new. Extrinsic load burdens are the reason why some students wear headphones, and why others might bring a jacket or a sweater.\nUnderstanding sensory sensitivities can help an individual overcome this particular cognitive load burden. A student might take a test in an alternate setting or wear headphones. Another student might need to sit in a ‘wobble seat’ that allows them to fidget while learning; students might require unique solutions to aid learning.\nIn addition, extrinsic loads are related to how a teacher presents information. Overwhelming graphs or disorganized explanations could lead to confusion. Some students are auditory learners, while others learn better by reading the material; thus a long lecture about a subject could result in learning loss or cognitive burden for some students.\nThe Burden of the Loads\nThere is a belief that intrinsic load is fixed. This understanding informs how subjects are broken down related to difficulty by grade level. It would be an overwhelming cognitive load to teach a second-grade student algebra; they need to focus on simpler math skills. Most educators would agree that teaching algebra in ninth grade is appropriate, as students already mastered other math skills necessary to learn to solve more complex problems.\nHowever, the difficulty of the task is impacted by both germane and extrinsic loads. It is easy for a second-grader who is a genius (by IQ) to learn skills and lessons beyond the presumed ability based on their age. Intelligence impacts the ease of learning.\nIn addition, extrinsic factors overwhelm or aid learning. A child who learns best by listening could enjoy reading books and gain greater proficiency if they listen to the story as they read. Another student might find this mode of learning to be distracting.\nUnderstanding Cognitive Load Theory helps educators tailor learning experiences for each student and their needs. Again, children who feel overwhelmed by sensory stimuli require a learning environment that removes these distractions. Teachers can utilize alternative environments for testing, integrating preferences for seating, or encouraging students to use headphones to drown out distractions.\nCognitive Load and Reading\nThe task of reading is a fixed intrinsic load at each grade level. However, while the load remains fixed related to the difficulty and age-appropriateness of the task, a child’s intelligence and their unique response to external factors or extrinsic loads impacts the ease of learning to read.\nThere are numerous types of reading struggles, and millions of children struggle to read. Educators also now understand the impact of the methodologies they use to teach students how to read. For this reason, many school districts are pivoting to instruction that focuses on the Science of Reading.\nIn the past, educators used lessons to teach reading that relied less on teaching phonics (and decoding) skills and more on encouraging children to decipher the words using pictures as clues. For children who understood the sounds of letters and knew how to effectively sound out words to properly decode them, this method did not extrinsically overload them. However, many children did not gain reading proficiency from this method of instruction.\nThe Nation’s Report Card shows just how poorly the nation’s children read. Only one out of every three fourth graders scores proficient or above in reading. The statistics are worse for eighth graders. The reality is that reading proficiency is now not the norm.\nScores for reading and other subjects dropped post-Covid, reflecting the impact of lost learning and perhaps absenteeism, too. More children have accrued absences related to mental health struggles as well as other struggles, and chronic absenteeism is on the rise.\nTeaching children to read successfully means that schools had to reevaluate their current curriculum. What they realized was that teaching children to guess a word based on pictures was not a successful strategy, and likely has never been a successful strategy.\nBoosting reading proficiency requires an instruction strategy that simply and impactfully teaches children the core fundamentals of reading. The Science of Reading incorporates different documented and successful types of reading instruction to create a successful curriculum. The Science of Reading shows what works, and the most successful reading curricula include phonics lessons as well as instruction on phonological awareness.\nStudents need to learn and master the letters of the alphabet and the sounds of each letter. They need to identify how these letters and sounds blend together to make a word. This is the easiest and most effective strategy for teaching children how to read.\nWhile previous literacy curricula likely increased the cognitive load for some children who found this instruction to be confusing, the Science of Reading simplifies the task of reading by focusing on the core element behind reading success. That core element is the mastery of reading’s code: phonics (and the alphabet).\nSimplify the Extrinsic Load with These Strategies\nMany schools have already made the pivot to the Science of Reading. However, just because the school uses proven and science-based instruction does not mean that a child will read with ease. Parents need to remember that other extrinsic loads impact the successful processing of any skill.\nChildren could be distracted by noise, temperature, or even by an illness. Once parents understand that a child’s extrinsic load is pushing them towards feeling overloaded, they can work with educators to remediate the learning environment. Children with learning disorders might have an IEP that outlines any necessary accommodations that help alleviate distraction and learning distress.\nEducators understand that all children learn differently. Understanding Cognitive Load Theory helps parents identify areas that could impact their child’s learning success and find help to remove load burdens.']	['<urn:uuid:cac6225e-e0d0-4ae8-9f82-69cf8bb4370d>', '<urn:uuid:09028ca7-1a2c-4723-84c3-21d5f31f1446>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	10	87	2354
34	mail carrier dog attack numbers	In 2017, more than 6,000 US Postal Service employees were bitten by dogs while performing their duties.	['How liability works in all 50 states\nLet’s talk about dogs.\nAccording to the American Pet Products Association, there are approximately 90 million dogs in the United States. This means that there are more dogs in America than there are people in France and Australia combined. Roughly 49% of all American households have at least one dog and 43% of all non-pet owners plan to own a pet in the future.\nWith so many dogs in so many homes, it’s easy to forget that dogs are animals. Unfortunately, reminders can come in the form of vicious dog bites.\nDog bite statistics\nAccording to recent estimates, more than 4.5 million people are bitten by a dog every year. In addition to being painful, dog bites can cause injuries and infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that roughly 1 in 5 people bitten by dogs require medical attention.\nHere are some other dog bite statistics:\n- Breeds responsible for the highest number of reported bites are, in order: pit bulls, mixed breeds, German shepherds, terriers, and rottweilers.\n- The majority of dog bites involve dogs who aren’t spayed or neutered\n- Roughly 25% of fatal dog attacks were inflicted by chained dogs\n- The insurance industry pays roughly $550 million in dog-bite-related claims every year\n- More than 6,000 US Postal Service employees were bitten by dogs in 2017\nDog bite injuries\nDogs come in all shapes and sizes, from chihuahuas (3-6 pounds) to English Mastiffs (up to 350 pounds). As a result, dog bite injuries can vary tremendously.\nHere are some of the most common dog bite injuries:\n- Puncture wounds\n- Nerve damage\n- Emotional distress\nWhen are dog owners liable for dog bites?\nAll 50 states have laws in place that determine when dog owners are liable for dog bites. In most cases, states have adopted strict liability laws, one-bite laws, or simply chosen to apply negligence laws. Check out the table at the end of this article to find out where your state falls.\nStrict liability laws\nIn states that have adopted strict liability laws, a dog owner is liable for the injuries caused by their dog so long as the injured person can prove that:\n- The injury was caused by a dog bite, and\n- The bite was sustained while the injured person was in a public place or lawfully on private property.\nYou’ll notice that the injured person doesn’t need to prove that the dog previously bit someone or that the dog had previously exhibited any violent behavior. If the dog bit the person, the owner is liable so long as the injured person wasn’t trespassing.\nIn states that have adopted one-bite laws, a dog owner isn’t liable for a dog bite unless the injured person can prove that the owner should have known about their dog’s violent propensities.\nLet’s look at an example:\nJanet has had her golden retriever Lucy for 7 years. During those 7 years, Lucy has never bitten anyone or acted violently. Nevertheless, one morning while Janet is walking the dog down the street, Lucy pulls away from Janet and bites a passing child.\nIn this example, Janet would not be held liable in a one-bite state because she had no knowledge of any violent propensities. However, Janet would be liable in a strict liability state.\nSome states don’t have specific statutes addressing dog bites and instead apply the normal negligence laws to dog bite cases. In these states, a person injured by a dog bite needs to prove that:\n- The dog owner owed a duty to the injured person,\n- The dog owner breached that duty, and\n- The injured person was injured as a result of that breach.\nTo stick with the example above, Janet owes a duty to take reasonable care to avoid hurting others. It doesn’t appear that Janet did anything to breach that duty and therefore she likely wouldn’t be found negligent. However, Janet might be found negligent if she failed to leash her dog (particularly if a leash law was in place).\nDefenses to dog bite claims\nDog bite cases tend to be pretty straightforward in strict liability states. The only available defenses are:\n- The victim wasn’t actually bitten\n- The victim provoked the dog\n- The victim was trespassing at the time of the bite\nIn one-bite states, however, cases can be a little less clear. This is because the focus of litigation is generally on whether the dog exhibited violent behavior before the bite and whether the owner knew or should have known about these behaviors.\nAny of the following might be used to prove that a dog exhibited violent behavior before the attack:\n- Police reports of other bites\n- Witness testimony\n- Videos or photographs displaying aggressive behavior\n- Copies of citations or warnings issued by the local animal control center\nWhere to file your lawsuit\nIf you suffered a serious dog bite injury, it’s probably best to file your lawsuit in a state court of general jurisdiction.\nOn the other hand, if your damages are low, it may be appropriate to file your lawsuit in a small claims court. Small claims courts limit or “cap” the amount of damages you can recover. The dollar limit depends on the state but is generally somewhere around $10,000. Small claims courts tend to be less formal than other courts and lawyers aren’t typically involved (in some states, lawyers are strictly prohibited).\nWhat about insurance?\nIt may not be necessary to file a personal injury lawsuit after suffering a dog bite. Injuries caused by dogs are normally covered under the dog owner’s homeowners insurance policy.\nAfter a dog attack, assuming it’s safe to do so, get the name of the dog owner and their homeowner’s insurance company name and policy number. You can then file an insurance claim with the insurance company.\nKeep in mind that the insurance company will likely investigate the claim, so be prepared to provide any evidence of the attack, including medical records. If the insurance company denies your claim or gives you a lowball offer, consider reaching out to an experienced personal injury attorney.\nWe’ve already established that you can recover damages if you’re bitten by a dog.\nBut what if you don’t think that’s enough? What if you’re worried the dog will strike again?\nThe answer depends on the state (and even the county) in which you were bitten.\nIn most states, individual counties have the authority to pass ordinances addressing how they control dangerous dogs.\nLet’s use Cascade County, Montana as an example.\nIn Cascade County, if a dog has bitten people on 3 separate occasions (or if any 1 dog bite was particularly violent), the dog may be put to death by an animal control officer following a hearing to determine if the action is necessary for the safety of the citizens of the community.\nDog bite statutes apply to—you guessed it—dog bites.\nBut what happens if a dog causes you injury without biting you, such as knocking you over or causing you to crash your car?\nIf a dog injures you without biting you, you’ll need to file a negligence lawsuit.\n|Dog Bite Laws in All 50 States|\n|State||Authority||Summary of law|\n|Alabama||Ala.

35	environmental impact western red cedar siding versus vinyl fiber cement brick life cycle assessment results	Western Red Cedar siding had the best overall environmental performance compared to vinyl, fiber-cement and brick, receiving top marks in five of seven impact criteria, including global warming potential. It can become a net carbon sink when end-of-life disposal practices include reuse and energy recovery instead of landfilling, while other tested products remain greenhouse gas contributors.	"[""Vic Ash or Victorian Ash is not a species. It is the trade name for a mixture of two similar species; Mountain Ash and Alpine Ash from Victoria.\nSustainability and the Environment\nSourced from renewable plantation grown eucalypts, Victorian Ash is a beautiful and naturally renewable resource. Its use for timber products and value added process is energy efficient and greenhouse positive.\nLight pink to blonde with a range of characteristics. A range of different finishes can be used to bring out the unique appeal of Victorian Ash.\nVictorian Ash is sought after for appearance grade applications such as flooring, studs, bearers, joists, trusses, furniture, staircases, mouldings, window frames and doors.\nIt ranges in colour from a highly attractive pale blonde through to nutty brown tones. Natural features, such as gum vein, add decorative appeal to this species, telling the tale of the tree’s previous life in the natural elements.\nWith a grain that is straight, open and even with a uniform texture, Victorian Ash is easy to work, with a good propensity for steam bending and laminating.\nColour and Stability\nThe naturally light colour of Victorian Ash responds beautifully to stains and lacquers allowing versatility in colour and design. It also blends attractively with other timbers and furnishings.\nUnlike other hardwoods, Victorian Ash is quarter sawn thereby minimising the effect of fluctuations in atmospheric conditions. This method of sawing enhances its natural stability ensuring trouble free Performance in a wide range of applications.\nWESTERN RED CEDAR\nThuja Plicata, commonly called Western or Pacific Red Cedar, Giant or Western Arborvitae, Giant Cedar, or Shinglewood, is a species of Thuja, an evergreen coniferous tree in the cypress family Cupressaceae native to western North America. Despite its common names, it does not belong with the true cedars within the genus Cedrus.\nGrown in North America, Western Red Cedar is renowned for its high impermeability to liquids and its natural phenol preservatives, which make it ideally suited for exterior use and interior use where humidity is high.\nWestern Red Cedars’ slow growth, dense fibre and natural oily extractives are responsible for its decay resistance and its rich colouring, which ranges from a light milky straw color in the sapwood to a vanilla-chocolate in the heartwood. It is a stable wood that seasons easily and quickly, with a very low shrinkage factor.\nHeartwood very pale brown to very dark brown. Sapwood yellowish white. Texture fine but uneven. Grain straight. Growth rings prominent.\nEasy to work but the sanding dust can be very irritating to the breathing passages, so a well-ventilated workshop is essential. It is rather brittle, so care is needed in working end grain.\nSince it is very soft there is a risk when dressing it that the cutters may compress the softer earlywood, which will later recover to produce a ridged surface. Glues well and is a good base for coatings.\nThe damp wood is corrosive to iron, resulting in a black discolouration of the surrounding wood, so hot-dipped galvanised nails are commonly used in areas likely to experience any dampness.\nA yellowish colouring readily leaches from the wood, so white-painted woodwork at a lower level can be stained if storm rains penetrate, say, to the unprotected rear surface of cladding. Not resinous.\nSTUDY: CEDAR IS MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY CHOICE\nThird-Party Study Proves Western Red Cedar is Most Environmentally Friendly Choice for Siding and Decking\nOverview of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and why it is important\nConsumers of building materials, whether professional architects, engineers and specifiers, or home owners, are increasingly concerned about their environmental “footprint.” They are particular about products they choose and factor environmental considerations into the decision-making process.\nUnfortunately, getting the “whole picture” about a product’s environmental impact can be challenging. Most manufacturers only promote a selective criterion of attributes. Sure, a product may be biodegradable or contain recycled content. However, this does not address other key considerations like energy consumed in manufacture, emissions and impact on global warming. Accessing and comparing like information about alternative products is another challenge.\nA Life Cycle Assessment or LCA (also known as life cycle analysis, ecobalance, and cradle-to-grave analysis) quantifies environmental impacts of materials in a side-by-side comparison.\nLCA measures cradle-to-grave environmental impact through complex analysis of a range of measurables such as resource, water and energy use, emissions, transportation, and waste created. Extraction, manufacture, transportation, consumption or use, and end-of-life disposal practices are examined to create a scorecard against which objective comparisons can be made. Testing is done on a third-party basis, providing consumers reliable data.\nOverview of this study\nWestern Red Cedar Lumber Association (WRCLA) members determined commissioning a third-party LCA of siding and decking products was the only credible way to provide consumers with reliable environmental performance information. To place the study results in sharper perspective, a parallel study of alternative products including brick and fiber cement siding as well as composite decking products was also commissioned.\nForintek, Canada’s leading forest products research organization, conducted the study in accordance with international standards in the ISO 14040/44 series, which requires that all products be treated equally and be of similar quality. Study results were presented for peer review to independent third-party organizations to ensure ISO standards compliance.\nFor Western Red Cedar products, the study was based on data obtained from a representative cross section of cedar mills in British Columbia and Washington state in 2007. Secondary publicly available data were used to develop life cycle inventories (LCIs) for clay brick, fiber cement and vinyl siding. Cradle-to-grave LCIs for wood-plastic composite decking made with either virgin or reprocessed plastic were also developed using secondary data sources as well as information collected from experts in the petrochemical and wood-plastic composite fields.\nIn order to evaluate the environmental impacts of the life-cycle stages of product alternatives, the life cycle was modeled as four distinct life-cycle stages: resource extraction and manufacturing, transportation to customer, installation and use, and end-of-life disposition. This approach helps identify where environmental contributions occur within the life cycle of each product system.\nSummary of decking and siding findings\nThe following statements summarize the LCA results of the study for decking and siding products, giving consumers a reliable basis for comparison. Environmental impact measures applied consistently to each product were: total primary energy on a cumulative demand basis, global warming potential, acidification potential, aquatic eutrophication potential, ozone depletion, smog formation potential, and human particulate (respiratory) effects.\n- Western Red Cedar decking substantially outperformed composite decking in each of the seven criteria tested and was by far the product with the least environmental impact when compared with both virgin and recycled wood-plastic composite decking products.\n- Even after subjecting the cedar decking results to a “worst case” scenario in which Western Red Cedar required the replacement of 20% of boards in normal service and periodic application of coatings, the environmental impact results remained strongly favorable to Western Red Cedar over a “best case” scenario for composite decking.\n- Western Red Cedar siding had the best overall performance when compared to vinyl, fiber-cement and brick; it received top marks in five of seven impact criteria, including “global warming potential.”\n- Total life energy of Western Red Cedar siding can be further improved by altering end-of-life disposal practices away from the assumed practice of 100% landfill, to a mix of reuse, energy recovery and landfilling. This practice, already reality in many communities, results in cedar siding becoming a net “carbon sink;” other products tested remained green house gas contributors.\n- Cedar siding impact on smog and eutrophication – the criteria in which it was not the leader – can be traced directly to the use of paint, not the natural characteristics of cedar. Use of high quality paints and stains (some of which carry length performance warranties) or the use of the new water borne coatings would have a very positive impact on results.\nAbout Western Red Cedar Lumber Association:\nWestern Red Cedar Lumber Association (WRCLA) is a Vancouver, B.C. based non-profit association known as “the voice of the cedar industry.” Founded in 1954, the association operates architect advisory and technical service programs throughout the U.S. and Canada. It seeks to inspire, inform and instruct architects and consumers about Western Red Cedar, its uses and benefits.\nWestern Red Cedar is one of nature’s truly remarkable building materials. Not only does it have distinctive beauty, natural durability and centuries of proven performance, Western Red Cedar is the ultimate green product. It produces fewer greenhouse gases, generates less water and air pollution, requires less energy to produce than alternatives and comes from a renewable and sustainable resource. Equally important, Western Red Cedar is carbon neutral.\nFor more information please visit, www.wrcla.org.\nThe following information has been sourced from the Rainforest Information Centre Goodwood Guide. www.rainforestinfo.org.au\nAraucaria Cunninghamii is a species of Araucaria known as Hoop Pine. Other less commonly used names include Dorrigo Pine, Colonial Pine, Arakaria and Queensland Pine. The scientific name honours the botanist and explorer Allan Cunningham, who collected the first specimens in the 1820s. Hoop refers to the tendency of the bark to remain as hoops on the forest floor after the timber has decayed. Hoop Pine is a rainforest timber, native to northern NSW, Queensland and the mountain regions of PNG. It is the only native tropical timber grown in substantial quantities in plantations within Australia. (Plantations have been established since the early 1920's, when attempts to source Hoop from naturally regenerated forests failed.) It is the major rainforest species used in plantations in Queensland. From an ethical, sustainable point of view, Hoop Pine is streets ahead of most of its plantation-grown exotic softwood counterparts.\nHoop Pine and the Environment\nFrom an ecological point of view, growing Hoop Pines in plantations is preferable to growing Radiata Pine.\nAdmittedly, Hoop Pines are, like Radiata, grown in monocultures and at maturity are clearcut. But they have the advantage over exotic timbers in that they at least belong to the land of our region. Hoop pine is native to north-east NSW and southern Queensland, as well as mountainous areas of Papua New Guinea; Radiata comes from a relatively limited area on the west coast of North America, but is planted widely in the world's southern temperate zone (especially South Africa, Chile, New Zealand and Australia).\nIn Hoop plantations, an understorey can develop which, at least for a few decades under present cutting regimes, provides habitat for other species (of plants and animals), whereas the ground in Radiata plantations is usually covered in a layer of highly acidic pine needles and a few hardy (exotic) weeds, but is otherwise barren. Native plants and animals just cannot make a go of it in or under under these trees. (Go into a radiata plantation: more often than not, all you will hear is the wind sighing in the trees - no birdsong.)\nThe duration between 'crop-rotations' in a hoop plantation is also longer - about 45 years rather than 35 years, as for Radiata Pine. This gives the other understorey species a longer time-frame within which to establish their habitat before the plantation is again harvested. Hoop Pine plantations are also preferable to Radiata in that they require less fertilisers and/or herbicides.\nIn NSW, it would appear that demand for Hoop Pine currently outstrips supply, yet there are good supplies of the timber in northern NSW and Queensland.\nNonetheless, the existing plantation estate in Queensland could be expanded for example by converting regional pineapple farms - whose environmental track-record is appalling. (Pineapple farms are highly vulnerable to soil erosion because of archaic management techniques used, and are usually heavily contaminated by pesticides. Retrained pineapple growers would be able to have a less toxic, much safer and more sustainable livelihood!)\nLikewise, in the NSW Northern Rivers region, financially beleaguered cattle farmers could transfer to Hoop production and capitalise on the increasing world prices for plantation timber whilst progressively divesting themselves of their devaluing livestock. (Regenerating rainforest in cattle-free riparian zones could also begin to stabilise and restore the region's highly degraded river systems.) With increased supply of the timber, the potential for marketing Hoop Pine both domestically and overseas is huge.\nHoop and Radiata have different site requirements, so expansion of the Hoop plantation estate can complement existing stocks of Radiata. Clearly, the agenda for future timber supplies should include plans for many more mixed-species native softwood and hardwood plantations - Hoop Pine could be one of the dominant species in these, putting it at the forefront of a resurgence of our ailing timber industry.\nNB: Be wary of any product with a clear-grade Hoop Pine veneer, as it may come from what are or should be high conservation value [HCV] areas within state forests. Environment groups are campaigning to change the areas of NSW forests which have been reserved for their so-called 'high conservation value', because too many logged-over areas have been included in reserves, and too many high-value old growth forest areas have remained on State Forests' Order of Works.""]"	['<urn:uuid:17693cd2-81a2-4b98-919d-4e77c2c67d55>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	15	56	2164
36	What role does variety in sports training play in injury prevention, and how does it compare to year-round training in a single sport?	Variety in sports training plays a crucial role in injury prevention by preventing repetitive strain on specific body parts and developing a more comprehensive range of physical capabilities. When athletes participate in different sports, they develop strength across various muscle groups and movement patterns, which creates better overall body support and reduces injury risk. In contrast, year-round training in a single sport leads to a significant spike in repetitive overuse injuries. This occurs because athletes continuously use the same movement patterns, creating dysfunction particularly in young athletes who aren't physically developed enough to handle the rigors of a single sport year-round. For instance, baseball players who only focus on throwing may develop arm problems because they rely solely on arm strength, whereas incorporating other sports would help develop the core stability and lower body strength necessary for better overall performance and injury prevention.	['As the days of winter turn, eventually, into the warmth of spring and summer, a new season will be soon upon us. And for most adolescents and teenagers, it’s the dawn of the new sports season. In the past it also signified a transition from the end of winter sports to the beginning of a new spring or summer sports activity. However, in recent years, more and more kids are playing a single sport year round. Is it to better their skill set? Of course it is! Anyone who has played a sport, or performed an activity at a high level of skill, knows that repetition is critical to improvement. But what are the costs of giving up playing multiple sports in favor of focusing on a single athletic endeavor?\nThough the “change of pace” is nice to give kids a variety of activities, the systemic problems lie much deeper. In outpatient orthopedics physical therapy, we have seen a tremendous spike in repetitive overuse injuries. This spike has shown a direct correlation with the advent of the single sport athlete. Where young athletes would get a change from the overhead throwing of baseball to the lower body taxation of soccer, we now see continual repetition of sport specific movement patterns creating dysfunction in athletes who are not physically developed enough to withstand the rigors of a single sport year round.\nRepetitive and overuse injuries can occur throughout the body for a very wide range of reasoning. However with our young athletes, problems such as rotator cuff injuries, hip flexor strains, Achilles tendinitis, and spinal pain are becoming overwhelmingly common. The answer to why is simple: Over development of very specific muscle groups used in one sport; and under development of muscles utilized in multiple sports which would be otherwise strengthened and supported through different isolation and combined movement patterns.\nVariation of exercise is a fundamental principle that extends into simple weight training up through differentiation in sporting activities. Cross training across athletic lines creates variability in a young athlete’s ability to strengthen and support their body. Take an overhead throwing athlete such as a baseball player. Conventional wisdom would say in order to throw the ball harder, strengthen the arm and in particularly the rotator cuff. But if you delve deeper into the mechanics behind a throwing athlete, we realize that core stability and lower body strength play equally as big of a role. Our lower body and core generate biomechanical power to improve distance and velocity with throws, whether pitching or making the throw from 3rd to 1st base when younger baseball players make the transition to the big field. Without proper lower body strength and a strong core, a player is forced to rely solely on creating power from their arm, hence creating a tremendous strain on their body.\nIn the rehabilitation setting, we offset these issues by strengthening the under developed muscles. This is necessary to support areas susceptible to overuse injuries, and improve range of motion otherwise limited due to using only a few select movement patterns while playing a lone sport. As AAU, travel teams, and the various town leagues dominate a schedule, this leaves little time for other athletic endeavors. But let’s not forget a basic principle of athletics: the stronger you are throughout your body, the better you will perform, and the less likely you are to sustain injuries.\nKyle Branday MSPT, CAP is a licensed physical therapist and Certified Acupuncture Practitioner at Amity Physical Therapy in Woodbridge.

For the most part, this does hold some truth to it.\nTo become the best in the world at a given sport, you do need to practice that specific sport a hell of a lot.\nThis is quite obvious, and really, it makes a whole lot of sense.\nHowever, for us as humans, this specialization may also be to our determinant.\nIn fact, there is a reason to believe that actively participating in different sports may be much more beneficial for health. Additionally, it could benefit physical development and musculoskeletal capacity more than simply sticking to the single sport indefinitely.\nWhat is Sports Specialization?\nWe could simply define sports specialization as the intense, year-round training of a single sport, in conjunction with the exclusion of other sports (Malina, 2010).\nWhile variations on this general definition do certainly exist, they all have a very clear thing in common. They indicate that a person sacrifices the potential performance of other sports to focus all their energy and effort into one.\nThis may undoubtedly have merit in adult athletes who aim to reach the top level of their chosen sport. However, there is research to suggest that it may actually have some rather negative effects in certain populations.\nRelated Article: Developing & Maintaining Athleticism\nEarly Sports Specialization\nWhen researching sports specialization, the most common group discussed is children and youth athletes. This is often in conjunction with the term early sports specialization.\nAs previously discussed, there is a general agreement that the number of hours spent deliberately training for a particular sport will positively correlate with the level of achievement in that sport. It is a concept that stems from early research on musicians.\nThis particular research found that those musicians who had spent over 10,000 hours practicing their instrument of choice were almost always more successful. This is especially when compared to their peers who had accumulated 7000 hours or less.\nMoreover, this same research showed that those musicians who began their training at around 5 years of age were much more likely to become more successful than those who started later in life.\nEssentially, those who began after age 5 were unable to catch up.\nHowever, research in athletes has not shown the same association.\nIn fact, research has consistently demonstrated that early intense training is not essential for achieving elite levels of performance in all sports. Rather, for most sports, early diversification and sports variation is much more likely to lead to success (Jayanthi, 2013).\nAlternatively, in this scenario, early sports variation has some rather significant downfalls.\nWhat Are the Negatives Associated With Early Sports Specialization?\nYoung athletes who specialize early have been shown to be at a significantly greater risk of injury than those individuals who perform a variety of sports. This is irrespective of whether the total training volume between the two groups is the same (Jayanthi, 2015).\nWhile we cannot be one hundred percent sure as to the reason for this finding, it is likely two-fold.\nFirstly, those athletes who specialize in a single sport will undoubtedly find themselves repeating the same movements over and over again. This repetition can easily overload specific tissues of the body, leading to an increased risk of injury.\nConversely, those athletes who diversify do not get this same repetitive tissue strain.\nSecondly, those athletes who participate in a variety of different sports get the opportunity to develop several physical qualities simultaneously. As a result, they have the capacity to become a more robust individual, in which they can more effectively handle the physical demands placed upon them in unexpected sporting scenarios.\nAlternatively, while those who specialize may become extremely competent at the specific skills involved in their chosen sport, their physical capacity remains very narrow. In other words, they can only handle the physical demands placed on them within a specific sporting context.\nAs a result, they are less equipped to handle the unexpected physical demands that may arise in open competition, thus increasing their risk of acute injury.\nIn conjunction with the physical impact of early specialization, it has also been suggested to have associated psychological implications (Myer, 2015).\nYou see, there are increased pressures associated with intense, specialized, training and competitions. This has been shown to significantly increase the risk of developing burnout, depression, and anxiety.\nAdditionally, research on young athletes has shown that professionalized, adult-style practices can actually inhibit talent development pathways.\nSpecifically, it has been shown that children and adolescents need to enjoy the activities of their domain to ensure intrinsic motivation. Without enjoyment, there is no desire to maintain participation or achieve goals.\nAs a result, increased rates of physical inactivity and drop out are increasingly common in children who specialize too early (Wall, 2007).\nWhat is Sports Variation?\nOn the flip side, we have sports variation.\nAs its name suggests, sports variation (also known as sports diversification) essentially describes the process of actively performing more than one sport across the year’s duration.\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean trying to become the best in the world at several different activities. Rather you should partake in a number of sports that require different skill sets. As a result, this variation ensures the development of several physical characteristics simultaneously, whilst also keeping enjoyment levels high across the year.\nWith all this in mind, it essentially eliminates the negative effects of early specialization. If your child does look to have a career in elite sport, they shouldn’t really begin to specialize until they get closer to college.\nBut how does this affect us as adults?\nWhat Are The Benefits of Sports Variation in Adults?\nAs adults, we have a tendency to gravitate towards those activities that we enjoy – which makes sense. If we are training for the sole purpose of maintaining a fit and healthy lifestyle, then why not do things that we find fun?\nThis is likely to improve adherence, motivation, and therefore effectiveness.\nHowever, it does again have some pitfalls.\nMuch like in the scenario of early specialization outlined above, limiting yourself to strictly performing one specific task for years on end greatly increase your chance of developing an overuse injury.\nSimilarly, it can also limit the development of numerous physical qualities.\nWhile this doesn’t sound all that bad, it is important to note that to maintain a high quality of life throughout the duration of your lifetime, you need to maintain the physical capacity to navigate through life effectively (Rennemark, 2009).\nThis means you need to have adequate strength, power, and reaction time. Additionally, you have the ability to respond to unexpected situations effectively. They are all skills that come with actively choosing to diversify the sports that you play, either in a competitive or social setting.\nNot to mention that fact that performing team sports in more social environments have been shown to have a myriad of mental health benefits. Health benefits include increased self-esteem, lower risks of depression and anxiety, and even heightened life satisfaction (Eime, 2013).\nIn short, sports variety can have a huge impact on your life.\nRelated Article: The Best Workout Combination: Endurance Training and HIIT\nHow Should I Train for Sports variety?\nSo, we know that participating in different sports can have an immensely positive impact on both the physical and psychological aspects of your life. But most of us also realize that there is some risk associated with performing a sport we are not accustomed too.\nNamely, the risk of injury, and of course, the chance of being somewhat average at it (which obviously improves through participation).\nBut this risk can be mitigated by ensuring that you are adequately prepared for any sport in a completely physical sense. This is done by dedicating your own training to developing the most important physical qualities that underpin all sport.\nSpecifically, aerobic capacity, muscle strength, muscle power, and landing ability.\nBy ensuring that you train each of these qualities in a gym environment, you can be certain that you are at the very least prepared for the physical demands of any sport. It will not only improve your performance capabilities but also lowering your risk of injury.\nThe Best Sports Variety Gym Program\nTaking the above into consideration, I have put together a simple gym program that can be performed 2-3 times per week. This program targets the fours key qualities outlined above, ensuring that you are well prepared for literally any sport.\nIn conclusion, sports variety is so much more than just playing different sports. It provides the opportunity to develop the broad foundation of physical capacity required to navigate daily life effectively.\nIn children, this can lead to seriously improved outcomes in sporting scenarios and improvement in health. Similarly, in adults, it can lead to better functional capacity, psychological health, and even greater quality of life.\nIt truly is one of the most enjoyable ways to boost health and function on the planet.\nMalina, Robert M. “Early sports specialization: roots, effectiveness, risks.” Current sports medicine reports 9.6 (2010): 364-371.\nJayanthi, Neeru, et al. “Sports specialization in young athletes: evidence-based recommendations.” Sports Health 5.3 (2013): 251-257.\nJayanthi, Neeru A., et al. “Sports-specialized intensive training and the risk of injury in young athletes: a clinical case-control study.”.

38	What are the main health problems that can develop in someone's body when they have type 2 diabetes over a long time?	Type 2 diabetes can lead to several serious long-term complications, both microvascular and macrovascular diseases. The microvascular complications include retinopathy (eye disease), nephropathy (kidney disease), and neuropathy (nerve disease). The macrovascular complications include myocardial infarction (heart attack), peripheral vascular disease, and stroke. These macrovascular diseases are considered to be the leading cause of death among diabetics. Additionally, long-term elevation in blood glucose levels is associated with heart diseases, stroke, blindness and kidney diseases.	['A cross sectional comparative study was performed in Owerri metropolis to evaluate the serum electrolyte and lipid profile among type 2 diabetic patient and non diabetics. A total of 60 subjects within age range 40-69 years were selected and grouped as diabetics and non diabetics (control) with 30 cases in each. Fasting serum lipid profile, glucose and electrolyte were measured using enzymatic kits. Data were compared between diabetics and control and analyzed statistically by student independent t-test. The results show that total cholesterol was significantly (p<0.05) higher in diabetics (216.00 ± 11.67mg/dl) than Control (181.57 ± 12.94mg/dl). Mean serum TG level was significantly (p˂ 0.05) higher in diabetics (149.27 ± 21.82mg/dl) than Control (113.80 ± 11.18mg/dl). The group means of High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDLC) shows a lower level of concentration in Diabetics (33.30 ± 4.56mg/dl) than Control(44.33 ± 6.72mg/dl); and this difference is statistically significant. Statistical analysis of the Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDLC) shows a higher level in diabetics (152.87 ± 13.05mg/dl) than Control (114.47 ±13.47mg/dl). This difference is statistically significant. Comparism of Glucose values of both groups shows a statistical significant (p<0.05) increase in diabetics (192.03±25.35mg/dl) than Control (78.07 ± 7.84mg/dl). Sodium and potassium level of diabetics (130.53 ±3.83mmol/l, 3.21±0.25mmol/l) are significantly (P<0.05) reduced than the control (138.77± 3.07mmol/l, 4.05± 0.27). Bicarbonate values of the diabetics (22.10±2.6mmol/l) are non significantly (p>0.05) reduced than that of the control (25.57 ±1.57mmol/l). Chloride values of the diabetics (109.37±4.06mmol/l) are significantly higher than that of the control (101.10±2.58mmol/l). It may be concluded that lipid abnormalities and electrolyte imbalance contribute towards complications observed in diabetes.\nDiabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders that is characterized by elevated levels of glucose in blood (hyperglycemia) and insufficiency in production or action of insulin produced by the pancreas inside the body (Maritim et al., 2013). Insulin is a protein (hormone) synthesized in beta cells of pancreas in response to various stimuli such as glucose, sulphonylureas, and arginine however glucose is the majordeterminant (Joshi et al., 2007). Long term elevation in blood glucose levels is associated with macro- and micro-vascular complications leading to heart diseases, stroke, blindness and kidney diseases (Loghmani, 2015). Sidewise to hyperglycemia, there are several other factors that play great role in pathogenesis of diabetes such as hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress leading to high risk of complications (Kangralkar et al., 2010).\nType 2 diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial disease characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, altered insulin secretion, and insulin resistance – a state of diminished responsiveness to normal concentrations of circulating insulin (Landas and Goldstein, 2008). T2DM is also defined by impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) that results from islet β-cell dysfunction, followed by insulin deficiency in skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissues (Radami et al., 2010). In individuals with IGT, the development of T2DM is governed by genetic predisposition and environmental variables (a hypercaloric diet and the consequent visceral obesity or increased adiposity in liver and muscle tissues) and host-related factors (age, imbalances in oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses) (Pickup et al., 2014). Clinical complications of T2DM include both microvascular diseases (eg, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) and macrovascular complications (eg, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke). The macrovascular diseases are considered to be the leading cause of mortality among diabetics (Johanson et al., 2015).\nDyslipidemia is elevation of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), or both, or a low high-density lipoprotein levelthat contributes to the development of atherosclerosis of which causes may be primary (genetic) or secondary anddiagnosed by measuring plasma levels of total cholesterol, TGs, and individual lipoproteins. It is traditionallyclassified by patterns of elevation in lipids and lipoproteins. Dyslipidaemia is a well-recognized and modifiablerisk factor that should be identified early to institute aggressive cardiovascular preventive management (Keech et al., 2013). Themost typical lipoprotein pattern in diabetes, also known as diabetic dyslipidemia or atherogenic dyslipidemiaconsists of moderate elevation in triglyceride levels, low HDL cholesterol values, and small dense LDL particles (Smith et al., 2008). Type 2 DM is associated with a marked increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Thus the managementof diabetic dyslipidaemia is a key approach in preventing CVD in individuals with Type 2 DM.\nDyslipidemiausing World Health Organization (WHO) criteria [serumtriglyceride- 150-400 mg/dL (1.7-4.5 mmol/L), totalcholesterol (TC) > 200 mg/dL (>5.2 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C) > 135 mg/dL(>3.5 mmol/L), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol(HDL-C) < 35 mg/dL (<0.9 mmol/L) in men or <40 mg/dL(<1.0 mmol/L) in women, and a ratio of total cholesterol toHDL-cholesterol > 5] has been identified as a risk factor inthe development of micro- and macrovascular complications in diabetic patients including diabetic nephropathy (WHO, 2014).\nElectrolytes are the smallest of chemicals that are important for the cells in the body to function and allow the body to work. Electrolytes regulate our nerve and muscle function, our body’s hydration, blood pH, blood pressure, and the rebuilding of damaged tissue. In our bodies, electrolytes include sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), bicarbonate (HCO3–), magnesium (Mg2+), chloride (C1–), and hydrogen phosphate (HPO42-). Various mechanisms exist in our body that keeps the concentrations of electrolytes under strict control.\nDiabetic nephropathy is one ofthe complications of diabetes mellitus, which ultimatelyleads to renal failure and renal failure is a cause ofelectrolyte imbalance among hospitalized diabeticpatients; other causes are diarrhea, vomiting, diureticuse and chronic laxative use.The most commonelectrolyte imbalance is hyponatraemia, others arehypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hyperkalaemia (Haque et al., 2012).\nHyponatraemia, defined as a plasma sodiumconcentration <130 mmol/L, usually reflect a hypotonicstate. However, plasma osmolality may be normal orincreased in some cases of hyponatraemia. Hypertonic hyponatraemia is usually due to hyperglycemia. Relativeinsulin deficiency causes myocyte to becomeimpermeable to glucose. Therefore, during poorlycontrolled diabetes mellitus, glucose is an effectiveosmole and draws water from muscle cells resulting inhyponatraemia. Isotonic hyponatraemia may occur inconditions like hyperlipidemia and hyperproteinemia.In general, hypotonic hyponatraemia occurs due eitherto a primary Na+ loss (secondary water gain) likesweating, burns, gastrointestinal loss: vomiting,diarrhea; renal loss: diuretics, hypoaldosteronism, saltwastingnephropathy; or due to a primary water gain(secondary Na+ loss), hypothyroidism,primary polydipsia; or due to a primary Na+ gain(exceeded by secondary water gain) like heart failure,hepatic cirrhosis, nephritic syndrome. It is important tonote that diuretic-induced hyponatraemia is almostalways due to thiazide diuretics and cerebral salt wastingafter neurosurgery are also the cause of hyponatraemia (Braunwald et al., 2005). Hypernatraemia can occur in hyperglycaemichyperosmolar state.Potassium is the principal intracellular cation andmaintenance of the distribution of potassium betweenthe intracellular and the extracellular compartmentsrelies on several homeostatic mechanisms; when thesemechanisms are perturbed, hypokalemia orhyperkalemia may occur (Kimberley, 2005). Hypokalemia, defined as aplasma K+ concentration <3.5 mmol/L, may result fromone or more of the followings: decreased net intake likestarvation; shift into cells like metabolic alkalosis, insulin, total parenteral nutrition;and increased net loss like diarrhea, sweating, renal loss:diuretics, primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism.Diminished intake is seldom the sole cause of K+depletion since urinary excretion can be effectivelydecreased to <15 mmol/day as a result of net K+reabsorption in the distal nephron. However, dietary K+restriction may exacerbate the hypokalemia secondaryto increased gastrointestinal or renal loss (Braunwald et al., 2005). Hyperkalemia, defined as a plasma K+ concentration>5.3 mmol/L, occurs as a result of either K+ releasefrom cells or decreased renal loss. Increased K+ intakeis rarely the sole cause of hyperkalemia since thephenomenon of potassium adaptationensures rapid K+excretion in response to increase in dietary consumption.Iatrogenic hyperkalemia may result from overzealousparenteral K+ replacement or in patients with renalinsufficiency. Metabolic acidosis, with the exception ofthose due to the accumulation of organic anions, can beassociated with mild hyperkalemia resulting fromintracellular buffering of H+. Insulin deficiency andhypertonicity (e.g., hyperglycemia) promote K+ shiftfrom the ICF to the ECF. The severity of exerciseinducedhyperkalemia is related to the degree ofexertion. It is due to release of K+ from muscles and isusually rapidly reversible. Severe digitalis toxicity andtreatment with beta blockers may contribute to theelevation in plasma K+ concentration. Other drugs likeangiotensin receptor inhibitors (ACE inhibitors),angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs) and spironolactoneare often responsible for hyperkalaemia.Pseudohyperkalemiarepresents an artificially elevatedplasma K+ concentration due to K+ movement out ofcells immediately prior to or following venepuncture.Contributing factors include prolonged use of atourniquet with or without repeated fist clenching,hemolysis, and marked leukocytosis or thrombocytosis.Intravascular hemolysis, tumor lysis syndrome, andrhabdomyolysis all lead to K+ release from cells as a result of tissue breakdown. Magnesium is the major intracellular divalent cation thatforms a key complex with ATP and is an importantcofactor for a wide range of enzymes, transporters, andnucleic acids required for normal cellular function,replication, and energy metabolism. The concentrationof magnesium in serum is closely regulated within therange of 0.7–1.0 mmol/L.\nMagnesium deficit is associated with several acute andchronic illness, of major concern is the association ofhypomagnesaemia with cardiovascular problems, suchas myocardial infarction, hypertension and congestiveheart failure. In addition, evidence is mounting regardingthe relationship between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, andmagnesium deficit. Hypomagnesaemia can result fromintestinal malabsorption; protracted vomiting, diarrhea,or intestinal drainage; defective renal tubular magnesiumreabsorption; or rapid shift of magnesium from the ECFinto cells, bone, or third spaces. Dietary magnesiumdeficiency is unlikely except possibly in the setting of alcoholism (Haque et al., 2012).\nDiabetes mellitus a problem of glucose metabolism is associated with a lot of microvascular and macrovascular disorders. It is a global concern for its increase in endemicity is quite alarming. Type 2 diabetes mellitus pathogenesis has been linked with a lot of environmental factors and some metabolic disorders. So many research have been carried out linking its association with dyslipidaemia and. Also its association with electrolyte imbalance has been studied but there is scarcity of this research being done in Nigeria. Therefore this research is carried out to evaluate the level of lipid parameters and electrolyte in type 2 diabetes in Owerri.\n1.3 AIM AND OBJECTIVES\nAIM: To estimate the levels of lipid profile and electrolyte parameters in type 2 diabetes mellitus individuals.\n- To determine the levels of total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, in type 2 diabetes mellitus individuals.\n- To evaluate the levels of potassium, sodium, chloride and bicarbonate in type 2 diabetes mellitus individuals.\nHO There is no change in the levels of total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, in type 2 diabetes mellitus individuals.\nH1 There is change in the levels of total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, in type 2 diabetes mellitus individuals.\nHo There is no change in the levels of potassium, sodium, chloride and bicarbonate in type 2 diabetes mellitus individuals.\nH1 There is change in the levels of potassium, sodium, chloride and bicarbonate in type 2 diabetes mellitus individuals.\nDISCLAIMER: All project works, files and documents posted on this website, iProjectMaterials.com are the property/copyright of their respective owners.

39	what border problems does tohono oodham tribe face and how did they affect learning traditional songs in cababi arizona	The Tohono O'odham face serious border enforcement issues that prevent tribal members from freely traveling between the US and Mexico. They must produce passports and border ID cards, and have been detained and deported while traveling through their traditional lands. Border officials have even confiscated cultural and religious items. These border restrictions impact their ability to maintain cultural traditions, which is particularly significant given how their musical heritage was preserved and passed down in places like Cababi, Arizona. In Cababi, Elliott Johnson taught traditional Tohono O'odham fiddle tunes that had been passed down through generations, some dating back 200 years to when missionaries first taught the Tohono O'odham to play fiddles. The preservation of these cultural practices requires the ability to freely gather and share traditions across traditional O'odham lands.	['This is a CD of social dance tunes from the Tohono O’Odham people of southern Arizon. We learned them from Elliott Johnson of the Gu Achi Fiddlers.

Cuadrilla/Biscuit Cheeks\nThe Cuadrilla is a type of dance similar to a Square dance and in New Mexico and Arizona a few of the typical 6/8 tunes are alive, though the dance is gone. Elliott told us that biscuit cheeks referred to those folks who have cheeks that look like biscuits.\n3. Santa Rosa Processional This exquisite tune is played as the Saint is paraded around the church on the town Saints Day in Santa Rosa, a small town south of Casa Grande, AZ. This tune might have arrived on the reservation 200 years ago when the missionaries taught the Tohono O’odham people to play fiddles for the mass. The 3rd part had been forgotten, and Elliott made sure we learned it.\n4. Uncle Charlie’s/Marla’s Elliott named this first tune for his Uncle Charlie Johnson who was one of his teachers. As with many tunes, their names were lost. Marla’s was named for Marla Streator, from Port Townsend, WA who was a frequent visitor to Cababi and who has continued to share the music Elliott taught us.\n5. 2nd Time in San Xavier/Lonnie’s South of Tucson there is the fascinating Mission – San Xavier del Bac. It is striking in how it rises out of the desert. We are not sure what happened the 2nd time there. Lonnie’s is a just great polka, and we like pairing these tunes.\n6. Sonora Church 2 Step This is the first tune Ken and Jeanie learned from the cassette, Gu-achi Fiddlers #8082 Vol. 1. in the key of C, at the time never suspecting that Elliott and Lester, like so many traditional fiddlers, kept their fiddles tuned down almost a whole step. So it is actually in D fingering on that tape.\n7. Big Shoes Just another great chotis.\n8. Elliott’s Special This is one the rare tunes in A, like a Cajun 2 time (valse a deux temps) waltz that Elliott had never recorded.\n9. Peanut Shoes/Purple Lilies Peanut Shoes refers to those big toed boots. Purple Lilies is one of our favorites, and so it makes us smile every time we play it. We have taught it to many others, so that we can play it at jam sessions where ever we go. In France they like to sing la la la la la along with the B part, while polka-ing around the room at a fast pace. It is also very popular in Ireland at pub sessions.\n10. Great Big White Tortillas One day we received lessons in tortilla making, the Cababi way. We were fascinated by how one golf ball size of dough would yield a tortilla 15” or more in diameter, and not fall apart! Our efforts produced tortillas in interesting shapes, not round as expected, and Elliott named each one as looking like a one of our 50 states. Paul and Emily, Raf and Ben recorded this in their Santa Cruz, California kitchen with Ken and Jeanie in Dec. 2003.\n11. Memories in Ajo Ajo, which means garlic, is the name of a town, and the highway, Ajo Way, that passes through\nthe reservation from Tucson, AZ to points west. Memories in Ajo is aptly named, as we were filled with our memories of Cababi as we traveled along this road.\n12. Libby Bird Song Mazurka Libby Bird is a niece of Elliott’s, and this is a tune he wrote for her. We imagine a bright, bubbly and fun loving person when we play this tune.\n13. Mary Johnson’s/Blackie’s Mary Johnson is Elliott’s cousin who lived next door. This chotis in two keys was named for her. Blackie’s, is a fun to play polka and was Elliott’s favorite.\n14. First Choice Chotis’s rule. What else can we say.\n15. Pinto Beans This tune reminds us of the time we came to appreciate the incredible work in making those highly sought after baskets, a major source of income on the reservation.\n16. Caballito Blanco/Paul’s White Sox We first learned a two part version of Caballito Blanco (Little White Horse) from Northern New Mexico fiddler, Cleofes Ortiz and were surprised the evening that Elliott played it for us with four parts. Upon learning Paul’s White Sox and asking the for the name of the tune, Elliott, with a twinkle in his eye, pointed his bow to the white sox of Paul Rangell and said, “Call it Paul’s White Sox”.\n17. Cababi Polka/Hohokum Polka Cababi is the Village where Elliott and his family lived We often sing “Here we\nare together” as a memory of this tune and our times together on the reservation. Hohokum is the name of the\noriginal natives that lived in this area, they were contemporaries of the Anasazi people in New Mexico. Together these tunes make a great medley.\n18. Squashfields This is an area near Quijotoa.\n19. It’s In There We learned this tune on the last day of the year of 2003, when Scott and Linda came to visit in Silver City, and we recorded it the next day. Elliott coached Jeanie from the other world on the harmonies.\n20. Rosalia As the last tune we learned from Elliott at a last visit in December of 1992, this fabulous haunting minor tune is the perfect ending.\nIt’s nearly impossible to play the tunes we learned from Elliott Johnson without conjuring up the images of the Sonora Desert and Elliott’s home in the village of Cababi, AZ. We were drawn in by the sight of those large and looming saguaro cacti of all kinds of shapes and the smells of the mesquite and cooking stoves. Though the need to be still during those hot dry days was overwhelming, the desire to learn those uplifting Tohono O’odham (the desert people) tunes at night kept us there until, under the cool Milky Way that shone so clearly in that remote desert, we took in the feelings, music, sounds and ancient spirits, learning as much as we possibly could from Elliott. Those astonishing tune sessions took place sitting outside in the “ramada” formed by the ocotillo cactus fence, each spiny stalk standing tall and wired together, enclosing us in a small space in the vastness. The ocotillo had rooted and gave us glimpses of their beautiful red flowers, reflected\nin the light of the cooking fires. We were captivated by the odd lengths and measures of the tunes, and the loveliness of the harmonies that so seemed to match the environment. Though harkening back to music from earlier centuries and from across the ocean, the twists and turns of conquest, and a red chile stew of cultural dreams and nightmares, had made the music seem less familiar to us. In this small ancient village in the middle of the modern\nrush and business that is the modern Southwest, we met\nthe most wonderful and patient people. There were thosewho stood in the shadows of night, tapping their toes as they listened to the tunes of their youth, almost lost forever, as played in the old style as Elliott had learned them, from his Uncle Charlie Johnson, the Ajo Orchestra and others. Then there were the younger ones, taking in the scene and watching us, who had come from far away, learning to play the music of the elders. Would these young people watching us, in some future time play these tunes themselves under the clear desert sky? Our days were filled with so many lessons, mostly unexpected, as\nwe grew in our understanding of desert life on the reservation, and how it is intertwined with the music.\nOur education and adventure began in the summer\nof 1989 when Ken, Jeanie, Paul, Emily and 2-year-old Rafael went to Arizona in search of Elliott and found the Pascola dancers near San Simon, just missing Elliott. It was not until the next summer, at the Festival of American Fiddle Tunes in Port Townsend, WA, that everyone met Elliott and his band, the Gu-achi Fiddlers (Elliott Johnson – vln, Lester Vavages – vln, Wilfred Mendoza – gtr, Gerald Leos – snare drum & Mike Francisco – bass drum) and where a group of eager musicians, began to learn the tunes, and the duo fiddle style of Elliott and Lester. Over the next three years, there were eight visits to the reservation to learn the tunes and the unique harmonies and hear the stories that Elliott and his family shared. We’d return to Cababi and, at each visit, play what we had learned previously, and Elliott would correct our mistakes, sometimes showing us another harmony. He used to say there were five harmonies for each tune. Each visit filled us with memories and enriched our souls. We had become students of so much more than the music.\nIt is with great pleasure that we are re-releasing the tunes first recorded on Memories in Cababi (UBIK 27), and have recorded and included an additional eleven tunes for this new CD. We are forever grateful to Elliott (d.1993) and Nancy (d.2002) Johnson for their hospitality and inspiration, Lester Vavages for his harmony playing (d. 1995), Geraldine and Gerald Leos, Roberta Johnson, and cousin Mary Johnson for supporting our efforts, Gaylord Johnson for doing what ever it took to make us comfortable, and to the rest of the Johnson family, and the people of Cababi.\nWe are indebted to Drumbeat Indian Arts (Canyon Records) and are forever grateful to Jim Griffith for recording two cassettes of the The Gu-achi Fiddlers, (CR 8082 & CR 8092), as these were our introduction to the music and the band. Thank you Elliott for your love of the music, your teaching us, and your eagerness to play all kinds of music.\nHere we are together, again.\nBayou Seco: Ken, Jeanie, Scott, Linda – April, 2004.\nKen Keppeler – Keppeler fiddle\nJeanie McLerie – 5-string Keppeler/White fiddle\nScott Mathis – Gibson F-4 and Collins mandolins,\nTarahumara Drum (#4,8,9,12,19)\nLinda Askew – Gibson J-45 guitar\nJefferson Voorhees – Drums (tunes #2,7,11,13,14,17,18)\nElizabeth Neely – Tarahumara Drum (tunes #3,15,16 )\nThe Rhythm Rangellers (Emily Abbink, Paul, Rafael, and\nBenny Rangell) (tune # 10)\nAll tunes are traditional or used by permission.\nAll Rights Reserved © Bayou Seco 2004\nProduced by Bayou Seco\nOriginal cassette digitally recorded and engineered in\nAlbuquerque by Manny Rettinger,\nUBIK sound (#2,7,11,13,14,17,18), and by\nKen Keppeler in Scott and Linda’s house on a\nDenon DAT.

Go ahead, touch it. Bless yourself with it. It is holy. You are safe now…” Ofelia Zepeda,~Deer Dance Exhibition (excerpt from the Poetry Foundation)\nThe O’odham are descendants of the Hohokam who lived thousands of years ago along the Salt, Gila, and Santa Cruz Rivers. Today, the majority of the tribe lives in the Sonoran Desert in Arizona, and the rest ( several thousand) live in northwestern Mexico.\nIn 1687 Father Eusebio Kino, a Jesuit missionary, arrived in Sonora and built missions and introduced Christianity, to the Tohono O’odham and Pima people. he and his people also introduced wheat, livestock, fruit, and metal tools. In 1700, he established the San Xavier mission.\nIn 1848 The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican-American War with Mexico ceding most of what is now the modern-day southwest of the United States.\nWith the independence of Republic of Mexico, O’odham fell under Mexican rule. In 1854, through the Gadsden Purchase or Treaty of La Mesilla, the O’odham land was divided almost in half, between the United States and Mexico.\nIn 1917 the main Tohono O’odham reservation was established. Following the Plan de Iguala, O’odham lands in Mexico continued to rapidly decrease. In 1927, reserves of lands for indigenous peoples, were established by Mexico.\nOn the U.S. side of the border, the Gadsden Purchase had little effect on the O’odham because they were not informed that a purchase of their land had been made. Initially tribal members were free to travel back and forth between borders to work, visit relatives, and participate in religious ceremonies.\nToday: Border Issues\nUnfortunately, stricter border enforcement mainly due to drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico have been enforced. Because of this, the border has become an issue that affects the O’odham in many ways. For one, the immigration laws present a barrier that prevents the O’odham from traveling back and forth. This prevents them from visiting relatives and sacred sites, and from conducting business related to their jobs and culture. O’odham members must produce passports and border identification cards to enter into the United States.\nOn countless occasions, the U.S. Border Patrol has detained and deported members of the Tohono O’odham Nation who were simply traveling through their own traditional lands… Border officials are also reported to have confiscated cultural and religious items, such as feathers of common birds, pine leaves or sweet grass.\nU.S. Federal Recognition Today\nTohono O’odham bands are now broken up into 4 federally recognized tribes: the Tohono O’odham Nation, the Gila River Indian Community, the Ak-Chin Indian Community and the Salt River (Pima Maricopa) Indian community.\nEach band is politically and geographically distinct and separate. The remaining band, the Hia-C’ed O’odham, are not federally recognized, but reside throughout southwestern Arizona. All of the groups still speak the O’odham language, which derives from the Uto-Aztecan language group, although each group has varying dialects.\nThe Tohono O’odham members reside on reservation land live on one of the four separate pieces of land that make up the Tohono O’odham Nation. These pieces of land are the “main” reservation, Florence Village, San Xavier and San Lucy. There are also O’odham who live in Mexico. The Tohono O’odham Nation houses branches of government and their programs, five recreation centers, one health center, six Head Start preschools and much more.\nAlthough the tribe has several casinos that help with some of the costs, they still cannot cover the outstanding costs for basic needs such as medical, housing, education and emergency services. The physical isolation of the tribe has always been a handicap to its economic development.\nOne of the tribe’s outstanding members is Dr. Ofelia Zepeda, who teaches at the University of Arizona. Dr. Zepeda is the director of the American Indian Studies program, and was one of the co-founders, and now director of the nationally recognized American Indian Language Development Institute (AILDI). She is the author of the first book on the grammar of the Tohono O’odham language, A Tohono O’odham Grammar. In addition, she has written several books of poetry.\nTribalpedia: Questions for Comprehension and Discussion\n1. The Tohono O’odham are descendants of what group of people?\n2. Who was Father Eusebio Kino?\n3. What event occurred in 1854 that caused the tribe to be divided between the U.S. and Mexico?\n4. Due to the stricter border enforcement laws, what are some of the problems the Tohono O’odham are having today?\n5. Although the tribal members have several casinos, they are till having financial problems in many areas in the community. What are the areas?\nTohono O’odham Creation Story\nIn the Tonoho O’odham creation story, the reproductive powers of the universe give birth to the Papagueria and the world thanks to I’itoi, the god who lives in Waw kiwalik, or Baboquivari Peak. This version is a close adaptation of one Bernard L. Fontana recorded in his book Of Earth and Little Rain.\nLong ago, they say, when the earth was not yet finished, darkness lay upon the water and they rubbed each other. The sound they made was like the sound at the edge of a pond.\nThere, on the water, in the darkness, in the noise, and in a very strong wind, a child was born. One day he got up and found something stuck to him. It was algae. So he took some of the algae and from it made the termites. The termites gathered a lot of algae and First Born tried to decide how to make a seat so the wind could not blow it anywhere. This is the song he sang:\nEarth Medicine Man finished the earth.\nCome near and see it and do something to it.\nHe made it round.\nCome near and see it and do something to it.\nIn this way, First Born finished the earth. Then he made all animal life and plant life.\nThere was neither sun nor moon then, and it was always dark. The living things didn’t like the darkness, so they got together and told First Born to make something so that the earth would have light. Then the people would be able to see each other and live contentedly with each other.\nSo First Born said, “All right. You name what will come up in the sky to give you light.”\nThey discussed it thoroughly and finally agreed that it would be named “sun”.\nNext First Born made the moon and stars, and the paths that they always follow. He said, “There will be plenty of prickly pears and the people will always be happy.”\nThat’s the way First Born prepared the earth for us. Then he went away.\nThen the sky came down and met the earth, and the first one to come forth was I’itoi, our Elder Brother.\nThe sky met the earth again, and Coyote came forth.\nThe sky met the earth again, and Buzzard came forth.\nElder Brother, Earth Magician, and Coyote began their work of creation, each creating things different from the other. Elder Brother created people out of clay and gave then the “crimson evening,” which is regarded by the Tohono O’odham as one of the most beautiful sights in the region. The sunset light is reflected on the mountains with a peculiar radiance.\nElder Brother told the Tohono O’odham to remain where they were in that land which is the center of all things.\nAnd there the desert people have always lived. They are living there this very day. And from his home among the towering cliffs and crags of Baboquivari, the lonely, cloud-veiled peak, their Elder Brother, I’itoi, spirit of goodness, who must dwell in the center of all things, watches over them.\nTohono O’odham Creation Story: Named in Stone and Sky, An Arizona Anthology edited by Gregory McNamee, University of Arizona Press.\nTohono O’odham home page: Nation Seal\nPhoto: Edward Curtis The North American Indian']	['<urn:uuid:0d746bee-232f-4e93-98d7-490c54aba0c8>', '<urn:uuid:b64d9a27-30eb-4cdc-bcd1-b6ab48824d4b>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	19	130	3537
40	What are the essential items I should have in my car for tire-related emergencies, and what different types of tire problems can occur while driving?	For tire-related emergencies, you should keep several items in your car: a tire iron, spare tire, tire jack, lug wrench, and Fix-A-Flat. WD-40 can also be helpful to have on hand. You should also have a flashlight to help when changing tires at night and a blanket to keep yourself clean when working under the car. As for tire problems, there are two main types: flat tires and punctures. A flat tire occurs when the air has gone out of the tire, while a puncture specifically means there's a hole in the tire, usually caused by running over a sharp object. While a puncture will cause a flat tire, flat tires can have other causes, such as a faulty valve. When you have tire problems, roadside assistance can help by sending a service professional to replace the flat tire with your spare.	['What To Keep In Your Car In Case Of Emergency\nWe spend a lot of time in our car, but are we prepared for anything that might happen? What if it breaks down in the middle of nowhere? What if it’s the dead of winter in the middle of the night? What if there’s an accident? What if someone in the car gets sick? Are we prepared for any of those situations? We can and should be.\nUsually, a sudden malfunction can leave you miles away from help. Worse, you might find yourself with no phone signal!\nAlthough unforeseen circumstances can’t be predicted, you can have the right items in your arsenal to hopefully prepare you for anything.\nWhether you’re driving a minivan, truck or hatchback, it’s always a good idea to keep these things in your car in case something unforeseen happens.\nCellphone And Cellphone Charger\nBelieve it or not, a cellphone and a cellphone charger is one of the most valuable devices to have these days in your car and on your person. A lot of people have no experience changing a tire and calling someone to help would be a top priority.\nYou never want to be caught with a dad phone battery, especially in a dire emergency in a car in the middle of nowhere. So make sure you either have a car charger or better yet a portable battery (in case the car charger doesn’t work) to charge your phone and make a call during an emergency.\nFirst Aid Kit\nYou should always have a first aid kit with you in the car. It’s something we don’t often think of carrying with us, but it can be one of the most important things you can have with you in case of an emergency.\nThis kit should be complete with bandages, vinyl gloves, scissors, antiseptic, pain relief medicine, band aids, and q-tips that will come in handy for a lot of things.\n- 200-PIECE FIRST AID: Keep your family safe indoors & outdoors with premium First Aid supplies\n- COMPACT, LIGHT AND PORTABLE: Rugged kit fits into backpack or car glovebox, weighs only 16 oz.\n- ★UPGRADED GEAR FOR 2020: Includes Fire Starter Rod, Compass, Wire Saw, Fishing Line, & Mylar Blanket\n- ALL PURPOSE: Recommended for home, car, boat, camping, kitchen, sports and weather emergencies\n- FDA REGISTERED & TRUSTED: Swiss Safe Guarantees customer satisfaction or receive a 100% refund.\n- Manufactured by the #1 leading manufacturer of First Aid Kits in the USA. 100 pieces of comprehensive first aid treatment products.\n- This Kit meets United States FDA Regulatory Standards as a Medical Device. Ideal for most businesses and perfect for family use at home or travel.\n- Fully organized interior compartments provides quick access. The rugged, sturdy, high density plastic case is impact resistant\n- Compact size case measures 7.5in x 2.5in x 6.8in, is portable and can easily fit anywhere.\n- Features Easy Slide Latches that securely locks into place.\nTire Changing Supplies\nNo one wants to be stuck in the road with broken tires. To avoid this, have your tire changing supplies ready at the back of your car.\nBe ready with your tire iron, spare tire, tire jack, lug wrench, handy dandy Fix-A-Flat, and even some WD-40 on hand so you’ve got everything you need if a tire suddenly goes flat.\nDead batteries happen. It can take you by surprise. But don’t rely on a Good Samaritan to always show up and give you a jump.\nHave a set of jumper cables ready in your own car. Be sure to carefully follow the instructions to safely return the power back to your vehicle.\nDuct tape is great for everything, from roadside first aid to temporary repairs.\nThis roll of tape is a quick and easy repair to get you back on the road if you have a minor hose leak. This could give you just what you need to make it home or to a repair shop and not leave you stranded needing a tow.\nHave a basic tool kit containing pliers, hammer, screwdriver, and wrench within reach all the time.\nAs a lot of roads are not well lit, there are also others with no lighting at all!\nIf you need to pull over, especially in the middle of the night, you need to stand out against the dark, especially for late-night motorists.\nA blanket will not only keep you warm during winter, if you break down, it will also keep you and your tools clean in case you need to look under your car or change the tire.\nYou need a flashlight when changing a tire at night. It can also illuminate your work space and allow other motorists to easily spot you from a distance.\nMake sure to keep a few things you can snack on in case you get really stuck. There’s nothing worse than adding hunger to an already frustrating situation.\nKeep a few non-perishable food items in your car. Stash some granola bars, dried fruit packs, or energy bars in case of emergency.\nThese food items can be eaten without utensils and you won’t need water to wash your hands afterward.\nPaper towels are quick cleanup options.\nYou can use them to wipe the dirt off your face and hands. You can also wipe the bugs off the windshield or clean your seat using a paper towel.\nAlso having toilet paper handy is useful especially when traveling and having to use some not great gas station bathrooms along the way…\nNobody wants to be stuck feeling helpless on the road. However, if you have these items with you, in your car, you’re assured that you have a solution in case something happens while you’re driving.\nAre there other things that you keep in your car for emergency purposes? Share them with us in the comments below.', 'Car breakdown services are categorised as roadside assistance which helps drivers when their vehicles get inoperative. Almost every auto has an insurance policy. Every insurance company is liable to compensate their client as early as possible. Car insurance can save you from all the hassle an accident can cause.\nMost of the new technologies and cool car gadgets are introduced only in the newest models and very few are found in the oldest cars.\nGenerally, roadside assistance service includes: towing, battery service, flat tire service, fuel delivery, lockout service, and extrication. Here is a brief description of what each service includes and a situation that would call for it.\nRoadside Assistance When Your Car Breaks Down\nBe sensible and don’t just jump in your car and drive off. Get into the habit of making sure everything is in apple pie order. Every time we get into a vehicle, we automatically can make quite a few safety checks, probably without even realising it. For example, we check the mirrors are aligned, we have fuel and our seatbelt is fastened.\nWhen your car breaks down, you badly need protection in the form of roadside assistance. Simply, it means to get professional assistance through a phone call when you have problems with your car.\nA breakdown service is actually the attempt by a service professional to make minor mechanical repairs and adjustments to make your car drivable again. Your car can face many mechanical issues during traveling on the road, so it needs to be insured in order to get roadside assistance. The following mechanical car breakdown services can be provided when your car breaks down on the way.\n1. Towing service is urgent when repairing fails\nYou can be provided with one of the handy breakdown services when your car needs to be towed.\nTowing service is actually made when the roadside assistance fails to repair your vehicle and makes it drivable again safely. They have to tow your vehicle to a mechanic up to a limited number of miles. In this scenario, you want your vehicle towed beyond that limit, they won’t leave your vehicle stranded, but they will charge you extra.\n2. Dead battery needs a quick jump\nYour car’s battery can be dead for many reasons: extended lack of use, interior lights left on, or cold weather. When it happens on the road, you are totally helpless. No matter what happens, having a dead car battery can ruin your plans and leave you stranded. Get quick help against a dead car battery from your service provider.\nGenerally, hybrid vehicles use the battery which powers the electric motor to turn over the gasoline engine, making it unlikely they would ever require a jump-start.\n3. Flat tyres mean no air; a puncture means a hole\nA flat tyre happens when the air has gone out of it; a puncture means a hole in the tyre, caused by running over a sharp object. A puncture will cause a flat tyre but flat tyres can have other causes, such as a faulty valve.\nIn this situation you will have to call your roadside service provider, a service professional will report to your location and replace the flat tire with the spare one inside your vehicle. Roadside assistance will not typically compensate a flat tire for a motorcycle or any other two or three-wheeler.\n4. When your car locked inside, locksmith service is urgent\nAt the time of buying a car, you should always go direct to a car locksmith or key cutting station to produce a duplicate of your car key.\nHence, you might have the ability to prevent these situations.\nIt’s very sensible to keep an extra key in your luggage. Or also somewhere in your house or on your desk at work.\nWhen you are in a scenerio like that and need a local locksmith to get you into your car whenever possible, call Locksmith for excellent mobile vehicle locksmith services.\nWhen a driver fails to gain entry to his own vehicle, both lockout service and locksmith service are required. But there is a difference between the two. Any time a roadside service professional helps a driver open his vehicle, it falls under lockout service. They usually can use various tools to unlock a door. If the roadside service professional fails to get entry to the vehicle, a locksmith service will be called.\n5. Emergency fuel delivery\nIt is really a bad situation when your car runs out of fuel.\nIf you fall into this situation, a breakdown service can usually deliver enough to get you to the nearest petrol station.\nFuel delivery service is provided to the drivers who run out of gas while driving. A service assistant will come to your location with enough fuel to get the vehicle to the nearest gas station.\n6. Vehicle on its side: Extrication options\nExtrication is the process of transporting a vehicle if it is constrained or stuck on the road as a result of an accident.\nA vehicle resting on its side following a bump is not an uncommon contingency and roadside breakdown services should be familiar with the options they have with which to extricate the vehicle.\nModern vehicle technology keeps advancing and is always challenging extrication tools and techniques. We always follow the progress of the automotive industry and we can only hope to be prepared by constantly researching and learning.']	['<urn:uuid:edd487aa-0080-4a5e-8c59-f799c0ce8546>', '<urn:uuid:1fa485c9-4b92-4cb9-8827-eda918173955>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	25	142	1884
41	sustainable development funding challenges poor countries environmental social factors	Poor countries face multiple challenges in achieving sustainable development. Environmental risks are significant, with many countries relying on rain-fed agriculture and being affected by droughts. They also struggle with isolated markets due to poor infrastructure and undiversified economies. The social dimension is crucial for achieving results, as reforms need to be meaningful to people and cannot simply be imposed. For example, when addressing issues like fossil fuel subsidies, success requires a comprehensive reform strategy that includes alternative solutions and transparency about future use of saved money. Without considering the social aspects, people may resist changes. Additionally, countries need to ensure harmonious relationships between population growth, poverty, and environmental degradation to achieve sustainable economic growth. Financial support, such as through trust funds and development assistance, plays a vital role in helping these nations implement necessary reforms.	['“And why anticorruption?

But if you want lasting results, get people onboard, and that’s where social dimension comes in.”\nBy Shin Hyon-hee (email@example.com', 'Economics of Poverty\nEconomics of Poverty\nPoverty is one of the issues on the top global agenda. Poverty has been accepted as a multidimensional issue. It is a factor that has remained elusive and the central point in the study of production, distribution, and consumption of resources in the society (Barrett & Carter, 2013). The measurement and conceptualization of poverty have been considered in the academic arenas as a matter of contention (Cowell, 2003). The purpose of this study is to provide an accessible synthesis that would contribute to the understanding of why poverty exists, measurement of poverty, reasons for the existence of poverty and the possible mitigations to reduce and eliminate poverty. The study will also focus on money metric approaches and their significance to income and consumption. In addition, the study will argue the case of the capability approach on monetary income and consumption level.\nThere has been a transitional thinking on poverty. However, the thinking has changed over the last centuries. The traditional policy debate provides two different views concerning poverty. In the past years, poor people had no potential to pursue anything other being poor (Barrett & Carter, 2013). As such, poverty is considered as inevitable. However, prominent thinkers are of the view that poverty is the primary reason for economic development and progress. The prominent thinkers found it necessary to develop policies that would protect people from shocks associated with poverty and ensure that social stability is maintained.\nThe traditional policy debate provided for an option of identification of the poor by focusing on consumer preferences, income generated and the demand for the commodities available in the market (Barrett & Carter, 2013). There are common methods and approaches which are used to measure poverty. Poverty is viewed as a social ill. However, public action initiated by the government can be sued to avoid it (Barrett & Carter, 2013). Such actions must be consistent with the policies on economic development. According to the prominent thinkers, the best strategy that can be sued to eliminate poverty should adopt policies that allow individuals to enjoy economic freedom by pursuing their economic interests (Cowell, 2003). Today, most countries are striving to avoid poverty by employing strategies that can be used to eliminate it at all costs.\nAnalysis of the Pros to Economics of Poverty\nIt is the responsibility of the various states to ensure that people have access to essential materials which are necessary for personal fulfillment (Barrett & Carter, 2013). The most prominent tool to curb poverty is equity. It provides a breakthrough to all traps of poverty. Anti-poverty policies should be used to protect and promote the welfare of the members of the society. Such anti-poverty policies should provide public education and sound health systems. Besides, the functioning financial market should be considered as a crucial element that can help the future generation to avoid poverty.\nThere are very many countries that are still struggling with pervasive poverty, food insecurity, and environmental degradation (Barrett & Carter, 2013). Such countries are mandated with the duty to increase the level of their economic growth, reduce poverty and enhance natural resource sustainability. It is important for a country to provide policies and strategies that can be used to ensure a harmonious relationship between population growth, poverty, and environmental degradation (Cowell, 2003). If the linkage between the three is developed efficiently, then it would become easy to ensure sustainable economic growth. Addressing the issues of poverty requires a multi-organizational approach (Barrett & Carter, 2013). It calls for all official institutions including religious organizations, Non –Governmental organizations and civil society groups. Such groups can develop effective programs that can be sued to address poverty and enhance economic development. Some of the structural approaches and initiatives that can be used to address poverty include macro-economic adjustments and productivity-enhancing technologies.\nThe structural macroeconomic policies have been used to address poverty in different countries. In addition, the programs have proved to be sustainable in the long run. Environmental risks are inevitable in most of the developing countries. In most cases, people rely on rains for agriculture. In addition, the areas are affected by droughts. The countries are also affected by isolated markets resulting from poor infrastructure and undiversified economy (Cowell, 2003). However, these environmental factors can be addressed to promote sustainable economic development in the countries which are hit by drought and other natural calamities (Barrett & Carter, 2013). Various strategies can be put in place curb the effects of the natural calamities. In spite of the backlash thinking on policymaking, there are plans which are fostered to secure success in addressing matters of poverty. It is evident that even today, there are very many people who are being criminalized and blamed for poverty. However, it is important to acknowledge the progress which is being made in addressing poverty. People should understand that developing successful strategies can take time. However, tremendous efforts are being made to address the issue of poverty. These developments will overshadow backlash thinking on policy-making on matters of addressing poverty.\nIt is important to understand how different people respond to economic crises. Imposing top-down remedies play a critical role in promoting sustainable economic recovery (Cowell, 2003). Understanding how various agents both at the micro-level and macro level response to poverty provides an insight into policy prescriptions. It is essential to understand how different households respond to poverty. Understanding such responses provides useful lessons that can be used to develop macroeconomic and micro economic policies to be used in addressing poverty. In spite of the analysis concerning poverty and economics, we must acknowledge that several people are still affected by the menace. However, going forward, the problem of poverty will be a thing of the past considering the tremendous contributions of various organizations. Several countries are committed to addressing cases of absolute poverty. However, they must have good policies and political goodwill to make progress against poverty.\nThere are two distinct factors which should be considered in addressing the issue of poverty in both developing and developed countries. Such factors include pessimistic trajectory and optimistic path (Barrett & Carter, 2013). The pessimistic trajectory considers the low progress in the developed countries towards addressing poverty. The developed countries experienced progressive development in the 1980s and 1990s (Cowell, 2003). As such, little progress is being made to get people out of poverty. There exist their performance judges a huge gap between the rich and the poor and the poor. On the other hand, the optimistic approach considers a progressive growth rate that would help people to get out of poverty. The pessimistic approach is being applied by the majority of the developing countries such as Ethiopia and South Africa. They are committed towards a sustainable economic development since they did not experience progressive economic development like the developed countries in the 1980s and 1990s (Barrett & Carter, 2013). They are confident that they will lift the majority of people who are affected by absolute poverty by 2030.\nAnalysis of the Cons to Economics of Poverty\nThere are principle challenges that people still experience in overcoming poverty. There are a majority of people who believe that poverty is inevitable and eliminating it would be a threat to the society (Barrett & Carter, 2013). I find such arguments as retrogressive in addressing poverty in both developing and developed countries. In this case, inequality is still considered as the primary factor to attain the goal of economic prosperity. Inequality has stood out as a major hindrance to addressing issues concerning poverty. It affects both developed and developing countries. Cases of inequality make it difficult to address poverty because high-growth rates are required. It is difficult to attain higher growth rate especially for countries that experience high inequality (Barrett & Carter, 2013). As such, it becomes difficult to reduce poverty compared to countries that experience low inequality. Inequality can be experienced in both social and economic dimension. However, it is important to un-pack inequality in particular dimensions to ensure progress against poverty. In developing countries, there are inequalities in access to quality healthcare and education. As such, it becomes difficult to address poverty since the poor find it hard to get out the cycle of poverty. Access to land is also a common inequality in rural economies of the developing countries. In this case, it impedes progressive development. Gender inequality also promotes pro-poor growth over concerning command over material goods (Cowell, 2003). Therefore, inequality is the primary impediment to progressive development. It is difficult to eliminate and reduce poverty in a society which is infested with high inequality levels.\nThose who are against the economics of poverty believe that inequality is the primary driver of economic development. People should not be equal in society. In a society where every individual is rich can experience retrogressive development since there will be no individuals to hire as labors (Barrett & Carter, 2013). In this way, the government and other civic organizations should provide quality public institutions that cater to the needs of the poor people. In this way, the poor and the rich should have different social amenities. In addition, they require the legal systems to be more inclusive in places that are occupied by the poor members of the society. They believe in the redistribution of wealth and more supportive role. Such policies will only ensure that the rich continue to be rich while segregating the poor members of the society (Barrett & Carter, 2013). Improving tax systems is also a high priority since it would increase revenue that can be used to remove people from absolute poverty.\nPoverty can be eliminated, and external effort is required to reduce and eliminate it in both developing and developed countries. Several micro-economic and macroeconomic policies can be used to address poverty and realize a society where every individual has rights to pursue an economic interest. External programs that address poverty are important. They provide short-term and long-term aid. External development assistance is received from the developed countries. It allows the developing nations to address crises that contribute to poverty. Such funds should be directed to help the developing countries to address agro-climatic factors other shocks that affect the economy. In addition, the external aids should be used to fund programs that would help in promoting strategies for sustainable poverty reduction in the long run. Such funds should be directed towards providing social amenities such as schools and hospitals that provide quality services.\nMarket failure is another factor which is responsible for inequality thus affecting progress against poverty. Credit market failure should be a matter of great concern (Cowell, 2003). The poverty elimination strategies should provide efforts that work towards making the markets to work better to allow the poor people to compensate for the effects of market failures. The policies should provide other means that can be used to address the inequality that is experienced in the market. Such policies should include redistribution of resources to address the issue of inequality that undermine poverty eradication strategies. In addition, the powerful landowners should reconsider introducing land reforms. The reforms will allow the poor to acquire land that can be used to enhance their standards of living thus contributing to poverty eradication.\nIn conclusion, poverty is an issue that can be addressed if effective policies are put in place. Inequality is the primary contributing factor to poverty. People should be encouraged to have economic freedom and pursue their economic interest to bring an end to poverty.\n- Barrett, C.

"['The Treaty of London, 1913.\n1. FIRST MEETING OF THE LONDON PEACE CONFERENCE, DECEMBER\nThe armistice for the cessation of the First Balkan War was signed on\nDecember 3, 1912, and the London Peace Conference, composed of delegates from the Balkan\nallies, including Greece, who had not signed the armistice, and Turkey, held its first\nmeeting on December 16, 1912. At the same time a Conference of Ambassadors, consisting of\nSir Edward Grey and the London representatives of all the powers, was also in session.\n2. DEMANDS OF THE BALKAN ALLIES.\nThe Balkan allies demanded a war indemnity, as also the cession of all European Turkey (excepting Albania), Crete, and the islands in the Aegean Sea. Turkey was to be allowed to retain Constantinople, together with a strip of territory extending from Midia on the Black Sea to Rodosta on the Sea of Marmora, as also the peninsula of Gallipoli or the Thracian Chersonese.\nTurkey was unwilling to give up Adrianople, a sacrifice insisted upon by\nBulgaria. The ""Divan,"" or Turkish National Assembly, decided, however, on\nJanuary 22, 1913, that the demands of the allies must be conceded. Kiamil Pasha\ntelegraphed the Turkish commissioners at London that same night, directing them to yield\nAdrianople and agree to the cession of all Turkey in Europe beyond a line running from\nEnos on the Aegean Sea, at the mouth of the Maritza River, to Midia on the Black Sea.\n3. COUP D\'&EACUTE;TAT OF JANUARY 23, 1913, AT\nBut on the following day, January 23, as a result of a successful coup\nd\'état, Kiamil Pasha was driven from power and Nazim Pasha murdered by Enver Bey, who\nplaced himself at the head of a new government. When the news of the coup d\'état reached\nLondon it was recognized that further negotiations were useless and that the London Peace\nConference had failed.\n4. TERMS PROPOSED BY THE POWERS.\nAdrianople having been captured by the Bulgarians, assisted by the Serbs, on March 28, 1913, the time was ripe for a resumption of peace negotiations. On March 22 the great powers had proposed the following terms as a basis for the renewal of negotiations: (1) A frontier line from Enos to Midia to follow the course of the Maritza, and the cession to the allies of all the territories west of that line, with the exception of Albania, whose status and frontiers were to be determined by the powers. (2) The question of the Aegean Islands to be decided by the powers. (3) Turkey to abandon all claims to Crete. (4) The powers would not entertain favorably the demand for an indemnity, but were willing to admit the allies to participation in the discussion of an international commission which should meet in Paris for the equitable settlement of their participation in the Ottoman debt and the financial obligations of the territories newly acquired. Turkey was to be asked to take part in the labors of this commission. (5) An end of hostilities immediately after the acceptance of this basis of negotiations\nTurkey agreed to these stipulations, but the allies insisted, among\nother things, that the Aegean Islands be ceded directly to them and were eager for an\n5. SECOND MEETING OF THE LONDON PEACE CONFERENCE, MAY,\nIt was not until April 20 that the Balkan States finally agreed to\naccept the mediation of the powers. When the Balkan delegates and the representatives of\nthe great powers finally met for the second time at London on May 20 they found a treaty\nembodying the original terms of the powers all ready for them to sign. They demurred at\nfirst, but when, on May 27, Sir Edward Grey, frankly told them that they must either sign\nor leave London they signed without much further delay on May 30, 1913.\n6. DISCUSSION AMONG THE BALKAN ALLIES.\nThe long delay in the negotiations was largely due to differences among the allies regarding the division of the spoils. Mutual hatred and suspicion and conflicting territorial ambitions made agreement almost impossible. The action of the Conference of Ambassadors in regard to Albania added greatly in the difficulty of the situation, since Serbia was thereby prevented from extending its territory westward to the Adriatic and would be left with only a relatively small recompense for its sacrifices in the war, unless Bulgaria could be induced to consent to a modification of the Serbo-Bulgar treaty of March 13, 1912, a thing to which she was unwilling to agree. Even before the declaration of war Serbia had suggested a rectification of her frontier as outlined in the Serbo-Bulgar treaty of March, 1912. Her demands grew with her victories, with the free hand in Macedonia allowed her and Greece by Bulgaria\'s preoccupation in Thrace, and with her exclusion from the sea by the creation of Albania. Bulgaria, on the other hand, cared intensely for expansion in Macedonia. Very bitter feeling was generated between Bulgaria and Serbia, culminating in warlike preparations, some actual hostilities, and a final demand on May 25 on the part of Serbia for revision of the treaty of 1912. Meanwhile Serbia had been approaching Greece suggesting conterminous bounds in Macedonia and alliance against Bulgaria, and a final agreement with her was reached on May 19 -- June 1.\nA second question was raised by Roumania, who hoped to gain Silistria\nand a more advantageous military frontier for her Dobrudja region. Bulgaria refused her\nsuggestions as to compensation for neutrality (made at the London conference), and war\nalmost resulted, but was averted by a Petrograd conference which gave Roumania Silistria\nwithout fortifications (May 7). On April 19 Serbia offered her a treaty against Bulgaria,\nand on May 2 the Greeks made a similar offer. She desired, however, to remain free until\nwar was actually begun, fearing the effect of an alliance of all against Bulgaria.\n7. TERMS OF THE TREATY OF LONDON, MAY 30, 1913.\nThe terms were practically those proposed by the powers on March 23. (1)\nTurkey ceded to the Balkan allies her territory in Europe beyond a line drawn from Enos\nnear the mouth of the Maritza River on the Aegean Sea to Midia on the Black Sea. (2) The\nstatus and boundaries of Albania were to be fixed by the great powers. (3) The Sultan of\nTurkey ceded Crete to the Balkan allies in whose favor all rights of sovereignty were\nrenounced. (4) To the great powers was left the decision upon the fate of the islands in\nthe Aegean Sea (excepting Crete) and the status of Mount Athos.\nSource: Anderson, Frank Maloy and Amos Shartle Hershey, Handbook for the Diplomatic History of Europe, Asia, and Africa 1870-1914.

Consequently, some of the earliest fighting took place between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. Serbia held out against Austria-Hungary for more than a year before it was conquered in late 1915.\nDalmatia was a strategic region during World War I that both Italy and Serbia intended to seize from Austria-Hungary. Italy entered the war in 1915 upon agreeing to the Treaty of London that guaranteed Italy a substantial portion of Dalmatia.\nAllied diplomacy was able to bring Romania into the war in 1916 but this proved disastrous for the Romanians. Shortly after they joined the war, a combined German, Austrian and Bulgarian offensive conquered two-thirds of their country in a rapid campaign which ended in December 1916. However, the Romanian and Russian armies managed to stabilize the front and hold on to Moldavia.\nIn 1917, Greece entered the war on the Allied side, and in 1918, the multi-national Allied Army of the Orient, based in northern Greece, finally launched an offensive which drove Bulgaria to seek peace, recaptured Serbia and finally halted only at the border of Hungary in November 1918.\nThe Serbian Army was successfully able to rebuff the larger Austro-Hungarian Army due to Russia\'s assisting invasion from the north. In 1915 the Austro-Hungarian Empire placed additional soldiers in the south front while succeeding to engage Bulgaria as an ally.\nShortly after the Serbian forces were attacked from both the north and east, forcing a retreat to Greece. Despite the loss, the retreat was successful and the Serbian Army remained operational in Greece with a newly established base.\nRomania before the war was an ally of Austria-Hungary but, like Italy, refused to join the war when it started. The Romanian government finally chose to side with the Allies in August 1916, the main reason for this was that they wanted the occupation and annexation of Transylvania, to the Kingdom of Romania. The war started as a total disaster for Romania. Before the year was out, the Germans, Hungarians, Austrians, Bulgarians and Ottomans had conquered Wallachia and Dobruja – and captured more than half of its army as POWs.\nIn 1917, re-trained (mainly by a French expeditionary corps under the command of General Henri Berthelot) and re-supplied, the Romanian Army, together with a disintegrating Russian Army, were successful in containing the German advance into Moldavia.\nIn May 1918, after the German advance in Ukraine and Russia signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Romania, surrounded by the Central Powers forces, had no other choice but to sue for peace (see Treaty of Bucharest, 1918).\nAfter the Vardar Offensive on the Macedonian Front knocked Bulgaria out of the war, Romania re-entered the war on November 10, 1918.\nPrior to direct intervention in World War I, Italy occupied the port of Vlorë in Albania in December 1914. Upon entering the war, Italy spread its occupation to region of southern Albania beginning in the autumn 1916. Italian forces in 1916 recruited Albanian irregulars to serve alongside them. Italy with permission of the Allied command, occupied Northern Epirus on 23 August 1916, forcing the neutralist Greek Army to withdraw its occupation forces from there.\nIn June 1917, Italy proclaimed central and southern Albania as a protectorate of Italy while Northern Albania was allocated to the states of Serbia and Montenegro. By 31 October 1918, French and Italian forces expelled the Austro-Hungarian Army from Albania.\nDalmatia was a strategic region during World War I that both Italy and Serbia intended to seize from Austria-Hungary. Italy joined the Triple Entente Allies in 1915 upon agreeing to the London Pact that guaranteed Italy the right to annex a large portion of Dalmatia in exchange for Italy\'s participation on the Allied side. From 5–6 November 1918, Italian forces were reported to have reached Lissa, Lagosta, Sebenico, and other localities on the Dalmatian coast.\nBy the end of hostilities in November 1918, the Italian military had seized control of the entire portion of Dalmatia that had been guaranteed to Italy by the London Pact and by 17 November had seized Fiume as well. In 1918, Admiral Enrico Millo declared himself Italy\'s Governor of Dalmatia. Famous Italian nationalist Gabriele d\'Annunzio supported the seizure of Dalmatia, and proceeded to Zadar in an Italian warship in December 1918.\nIn the aftermath of the Balkan Wars Bulgarian opinion turned against Russia and the western powers, whom the Bulgarians felt had done nothing to help them. The government aligned Bulgaria with Germany and Austria-Hungary, even though this meant also becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria\'s traditional enemy. But Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of Britain and France) were all in possession of lands heavily populated by Bulgarians and thus perceived as Bulgarian.\nBulgaria, recuperating from the Balkan Wars, sat out the first year of World War I. When Germany promised to restore the boundaries of the Treaty of San Stefano, Bulgaria, which had the largest army in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October 1915. Britain, France and Italy then declared war on Bulgaria.\nAlthough Bulgaria, in alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, won military victories against Serbia and Romania, occupying much of Southern Serbia (taking Nish, Serbia\'s war capital in November 5), advancing into Greek Macedonia, and taking Dobruja from the Romanians in September 1916, the war soon became unpopular with the majority of Bulgarian people, who suffered enormous economic hardship. The Russian Revolution of February 1917 had a significant effect in Bulgaria, spreading antiwar and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities.\nIn September 1918 the Serbs, British, French, Italians and Greeks broke through on the Macedonian front in the Vardar Offensive. While Bulgarian forces stopped them in Dojran and they didn\'t succeed to occupy Bulgarian lands, Tsar Ferdinand was forced to sue for peace.\nIn order to head off the revolutionaries, Ferdinand abdicated in favour of his son Boris III. The revolutionaries were suppressed and the army disbanded. Under the Treaty of Neuilly (November 1919), Bulgaria lost its Aegean coastline in favour of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers (transferred later by them to Greece) and nearly all of its Macedonian territory to the new state of Yugoslavia, and had to give Dobruja back to the Romanians (see also Dobruja, Western Outlands, Western Thrace).\nIn 1915 the Austrians gained military support from Germany and, with diplomacy, brought in Bulgaria as an ally. Serbian forces were attacked from both north and south and were forced to retreat. The retreat was skillfully carried out and the Serbian army remained operational, even though it was now based in Greece.\nThe front stabilised roughly around the Greek border, through the intervention of a Franco-British-Italian force which had landed in Salonica. The German generals had not let the Bulgarian army advance towards Salonika, because they hoped they could persuade the Greeks to join the Central powers.\nIn 1918, after a prolonged build-up, the Allies, under the energetic French General Franchet d\'Esperey leading a combined French, Serbian, Greek and British army, attacked out of Greece. His initial victories convinced the Bulgarian government to sue for peace. He then attacked north and defeated the German and Austrian forces that tried to halt his offensive.\nBy October 1918 his army had recaptured all of Serbia and was preparing to invade Hungary proper. The offensive halted only because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918.\nThe Russians had to pour extra divisions and supplies to keep the Romanian army from being utterly destroyed again by the Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian army.. According to John Keegan, the Russian Chief of Staff, General Alekseev, was very dismissive of the Romanian army and argued that they would drain, rather than add to the Russian reserves (John Keegan, World War I, pg 307). Alekseev was proven correct in his analysis.\nThe French and British kept six divisions each on the Greek frontier from 1916 till the end of 1918. Originally, the French and British went to Greece to help Serbia, but with Serbia\'s conquest in the fall of 1915, their continued presence was pointless. For nearly three years, these divisions accomplished essentially nothing and only tied down half of the Bulgarian army, which wasn\'t going to go far from Bulgaria in any event.\nIn fact, Keegan argues that ""the installation of a violently nationalist and anti-Turkish government in Athens, led to Greek mobilization in the cause of the ""Great Idea"" - the recovery of the Greek empire in the east - which would complicate the Allied effort to resettle the peace of Europe for years after the war ended."" (Keegan pg. 308).']"	['<urn:uuid:1af77097-dc69-46c3-9642-f1cb24c2cb75>', '<urn:uuid:131279d8-35b1-40dd-84ca-337bfb1987a3>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	7	43	2655
43	my dad with dementia often gets angry and hits people what are behavior management techniques to handle aggression	Aggression in dementia can be managed using the A-B-C behavior management method. This approach involves analyzing three components: the Antecedent (what happens before the aggressive behavior, such as hunger, pain, frustration with communication, or environmental factors), the Behavior itself (in this case, the hitting and anger), and the Consequence (what happens after the behavior). By understanding and modifying what happens before or after the aggressive behavior, you can potentially decrease its frequency. Research has shown this method is effective for managing various problematic behaviors, including aggression.	"['Behavior Management for Dementia Caregivers\nIn addition to communication changes, a significant part of caregiving involves managing the challenging behaviors that often accompany dementia. Most of the time, problem behaviors are the reason for placing a person with dementia into a nursing home. Behavior management techniques are a way to structure the environment to increase safety and decrease frustrations for a person who can no longer regulate his or her own behavior. Using behavior management techniques to manage problems like aggression and wandering can often keep a person with dementia in the home for a longer period of time.\nOne way to approach challenging behaviors is by using the A-B-C method of behavior management. The method is based on the theory that changing what happens directly before or directly after a problem behavior can be used to alter, or at least decrease the frequency of such behavior. A large body of research has shown that the A-B-C method can be used to deal with a wide variety of problematic behaviors (described below).\nThe A-B-C Behavior Chain\nThe A-B-C Behavior Chain can be used to track and analyze challenging behaviors in order to develop new ways to approach and respond to them. There are three components in the A-B-C Behavior Chain:\n- Antecedent - The ""A"" stands for antecedent, which is anything that happens before a challenging behavior or ""sets the stage"" for it to happen. Antecedents can be internal (e.g., thoughts or physical sensations occurring within the person with dementia) or external (e.g., environmental characteristics). Some examples of antecedents include hunger, pain, frustration at not being able to communicate, loud noises, hot or cold room temperatures, a busy environment, fluorescent lights, unfamiliar surroundings, or overwhelming tasks.\n- Behavior - The ""B"" stands for the problematic or challenging behavior. Examples of challenging behaviors, which will be discussed in more detail later, include agitation (becoming restless, anxious, or upset), aggression (shouting, cornering someone, raising a hand to someone, or actually pushing or hitting), repetition (repeating a word, question, or action over and over again), hallucinations (sensory experiences that seem real to the person with dementia, yet they are not really happening), suspicion (perceiving situations inaccurately and accusing others of theft, infidelity, or other offenses), apathy (a lack of interest in anything; not wanting to do anything), confusion (becoming confused about person, place, and time), sundowning (becoming more confused and agitated in the late afternoon and early evening), and wandering (on foot, in a car, or using some other mode of transportation).\n- Consequence - The ""C"" stands for consequence, which is anything that happens right after the behavior occurs. Consequences can ""reinforce"" the behavior (i.e., increase the likelihood that the person will behave in the same or similar fashion in the future) by encouraging or rewarding it. On the other hand, consequences can also ""punish"" the behavior (i.e., decrease the chances of it being repeated in the future). Examples of consequences are providing calm reassurance, offering the person a desirable item like food or a photo album, yelling, taking something away from the person, or removing the person from the situation in which the behavior occurred.']"	['<urn:uuid:319a0ead-b9de-40d6-9456-f4b496ffd7aa>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	18	86	524
44	I've been thinking about joining the military but I'm worried about how that fits with being religious - what did early Christians think about being soldiers?	Early Christians, specifically before the time of Constantine, were pacifists who rejected military service. Historical records show that Christians were taught that soldiers must be rejected from the faith, and if a believer sought to become a soldier, they must be rejected for having despised God. A military commander was required to resign or be rejected. This position was based on the absolute renunciation of killing among true believing Christians, who were considered as 'sheep among wolves.'	"['Christian refusal of violence\nChristian pacifism is the theological and ethical position that any form of violence is incompatible with the Christian faith.\n- One is called to live non-violently, even if the social or political change one worked for is in fact unlikely or even impossible.\n- Daniel Berrigan, in Lights on in the House of the Dead: A Prison Diary (1974), p. 52\n- We Christians forget (if we ever learned) that attempts to redress real or imagined injustice by violent means are merely another exercise in denial — denial of God and her nonviolence towards us, denial of love of neighbor, denial of laws essential to our being.\n- Philip Berrigan, in Fighting the Lamb\'s War: Skirmishes with the American Empire (1996), p. 204\n- Our faith obliges us to bind wounds, not to make blood run.\n- Petr Chelčický, in The Net of Faith, (c. 1443)\n- Wars and other kinds of murder have their beginning in the hatred of the enemy and in the unwillingness to be patient with evil. Their root is in intemperate self-love and in immoderate affection for temporal possessions. These conflicts are brought into this world because men do not trust the Son of God enough to abide by his commandments.\n- Petr Chelčický, in The Net of Faith, (c. 1443)\n- The path shown by Jesus is a difficult one that can only be trod by true martyrs. A ""martyr,"" etymologically, is he who makes himself a witness to his faith. And it is the ultimate testimony to one’s faith to be ready to put it to practice even when one’s very life is threatened. But the life to be sacrificed, it should be noted, is not the enemy’s life, but the martyr’s own life — killing others is not a testimony of love, but of anger, fear, or hatred. For Tolstoy, therefore, a true martyr to Jesus’ message would neither punish nor resist (or at least not use violence to resist), but would strive to act from love, however hard, whatever the likelihood of being crucified. He would patiently learn to forgive and turn the other cheek, even at the risk of death. Such would be the only way to eventually win the hearts and minds of the other camp and open up the possibilities for reconciliation in the ""war on terror.""\n- True believing Christians are sheep among wolves. ... They employ neither worldly sword nor war, since with them killing is absolutely renounced.\n- A pacifist between wars is like a vegetarian between meals.\n- Ammon Hennacy, as quoted in A Revolution of the Heart : Essays on the Catholic Worker (1988) edited by Patrick G.

But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you. And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.

45	How do zoonotic diseases spread to humans, and what economic impact do they have?	Zoonotic diseases spread to humans through increased contact with wildlife due to expanding human populations and vanishing natural habitats. This contact is especially common with species like primates, bats, and rodents that adapt well to human environments. Economically, these diseases have caused losses of more than $100 billion in the last two decades, not including COVID-19, which is expected to cost $9 trillion over the next few years. Additionally, about 2 million people die annually from neglected zoonotic diseases, mostly in low- and middle-income countries.	['Although COVID-19 is still at full pandemic status in the US, it seems like the conversation is slowly shifting towards what happens next. SARS-CoV-2 may never be fully “eliminated,” but an aspirational view of recovery has started to take hold. Sometimes this manifests as a need for reflection—to ensure that the post-COVID future is indeed brighter.\nYet while the pandemic is certainly the loudest crisis facing the world right now, it isn’t the only one. Horrific wildfire seasons, record temperatures, and unprecedented weather events of recent years boggle the mind, but as America stares down the barrel of resurging infection waves, climate nihilism—or de-prioritization—is a natural stance to take. “What’s the point in trying to save the environment if some pandemic virus could wipe us all out tomorrow?” Over the last few months, I’ve heard this sentiment from peers more often than I can count. Usually it’s in reference to a failure to recycle the obscene amount of plastic packaging from one’s third takeout dinner of the week. Interestingly, the obverse has been similarly prevalent: “well, [insert impending climate crisis here] will happen soon anyway, so why should we be worrying about the next 100-year pandemic?”\nThe answer is simple: environmental protection is a matter of public health. And preventing the next pandemic is a matter of environmental security.\nHere’s why. Those once-in-a-century diseases emerge from somewhere, and 60% of the time that somewhere is an animal population known as a zoonosis. The term zoonosis might conjure in your mind newsreels of Tyvek-clad veterinarians culling domestic turkeys and pigs to slow bird or swine flu outbreaks, but these pathogens did not arise in domestic animals. Livestock populations are often just the human-adjacent accelerant for an otherwise “wild” pathogen. Even measles and smallpox, diseases that we think of as endemic to humans, trace their evolutionary history back to animal origins. And scary pathogens are emerging much more often than once per century. The past few decades of unprecedented technological innovations in medicine have also seen unprecedented increases in zoonotic epidemic frequency (SARS, MERS, Ebola virus disease, Zika, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Nipah virus infection, COVID-19—just to name a few in my lifetime). Additionally, many of those zoonotic epidemic events can be easily traced to wildlife experiencing extreme environmental duress. Zoonosis prevention is, in fact, an ecosystem service.\nEnvironmental considerations really start to play a role in zoonosis at the human-wildlife interface—and that interface is growing rapidly. The assumption that ‘the humans arrive and the wildlife leave’ isn’t exactly true. In the immortal words of Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park, “life finds a way”—and rarely does it find a way that bodes well for us. The underlying biological mechanisms of zoonoses haven’t changed; it’s still the accidental result of a genetic lottery that enables a pathogen to adapt to a new host. But the more humans come in contact with wildlife, the more times we’re effectively rolling the dice. As human population centers expand and natural wildlife habitats vanish, the animal species that win out are those that can most easily adapt to the new human-dominated landscape. Those species that thrive in anthropogenic or human-created ecological niches are also ones that account for the majority of zoonotic diseases: primates, bats, and rodents. This reduced biodiversity in the face of dramatic land-use change usually results in one of two eventualities: either the remaining species outcompete others and explode in number by nestling up close to humans (think: rats in the sewers and bats in the belfries); or, surviving species wind up stressed, bottlenecked, and less genetically diverse—making them much less capable of weeding out infections within their own population before encountering humans and passing them on (think: foxes contracting rabies).\nIt’s all too easy to think of infectious disease outbreaks as unpredictable natural disasters, but some predictive capacity does exist. In the same way that meteorologists can predict low-pressure systems, the theoretical knowledge to give us a fighting chance against the next pandemic already exists. Disease ecologists know some species are likely to harbor pathogens with zoonotic potential, and they can find out where and when they frequently come in contact with humans. We know which latitudes and elevations are likely to see changes in temperature and precipitation that will provide fertile new ground for disease-carrying mosquitoes.\nSo we know how to begin forecasting zoonoses or anticipating the shifting maps for vector-borne illnesses—in fact, some groups like the USAID PREDICT project, the Cary Institute, and EcoHealth Alliance have already started doing it. The obstacles lie in the untapped potential of interdisciplinary collaboration. Effective GIS models and predictive disease mapping require talented mathematicians and software engineers. Viral metagenomics on the scale required to effectively surveil the zoonotic reservoirs that we know of requires an incredible application of molecular biology and data science. And the data-sharing required to combat outbreaks that know no borders will demand immense feats of international policy.\nThe point here is not to stack more problems atop the ever-growing list; it’s to consolidate these pressing needs under a single manageable heading: One Health. If we address the needs for zoonosis prevention as a combined issue with a fully-articulated, well-understood network of interactions, then suddenly it could feel like we’re all cooperating and collaborating to solve one, multi-faceted issue instead of further restricting our lanes of expertise and responsibility into narrower and narrower specialties.\nUltimately, it’s not just zoonoses we need to be worried about. Environmental considerations touch on many other aspects of infectious disease: farming and mining practices create habitats for waterborne parasites, ecological disturbances enhance growth and spread of vector-borne diseases such as ticks, severe outbreaks of seasonal influenza is tightly correlated with milder winters over the past 25 years. The predicted 2-5°C rise in global temperatures will put an estimated 500 million to 1 billion people at risk of mosquito-borne illnesses they’ve never before been exposed to. When you factor in non-communicable diseases and the socioeconomic determinants of health that climatic shifts have already begun to exacerbate, we start to glimpse the universality of the issue. The list goes on and on until eventually, it’s impossible to ignore the interconnectedness of public health and environmental security.\nIt will take epidemiologists, veterinarians, agricultural engineers, geographers, mathematicians, conservation biologists, policymakers, environmental regulators, sociologists, behavioral scientists, resource managers, and more all working together to predict and prevent pandemics, alleviate the effects of environmental change on human and veterinary health, and restore integrity to our ecosystem services. We cannot recover from COVID-19 or prepare for an unknown Disease X in a resilient, equitable way without addressing climate. And we’ll never bring to bear all the necessary resources to combat environmental change without addressing emerging infectious diseases as a deeply connected issue.\nCharlie Minicucci is a research assistant at the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine. He works on issues in global health with NASEM’s Forum on Microbial Threats and One Health Action Collaborative.\nThe author is solely responsible for the content of this article, which does not necessarily represent the views of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine or the Aspen Institute.', '#Nairobi; #UN; #UNEP; #ILRI; WorldZoonosesDay; #COVID19\nNairobi, Jul 6 (Canadian-Media): As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take lives and disrupt economies across the world, a new report UN report warns that further outbreaks will emerge unless governments take active measures to prevent other zoonotic diseases from crossing into the human population, and sets out ten recommendations to prevent future pandemics.\nThe report, Preventing the Next Pandemic: Zoonotic diseases and how to break the chain of transmission, is a joint effort by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI).\nIt identifies seven trends driving the increasing emergence of zoonotic diseases, including increased demand for animal protein; a rise in intense and unsustainable farming; the increased use and exploitation of wildlife; and the climate crisis. The report finds that Africa in particular, which has experienced and responded to a number of zoonotic epidemics including most recently, to Ebola outbreaks, could be a source of important solutions to quell future outbreaks.\n“The science is clear that if we keep exploiting wildlife and destroying our ecosystems, then we can expect to see a steady stream of these diseases jumping from animals to humans in the years ahead,” said UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen. “Pandemics are devastating to our lives and our economies, and as we have seen over the past months, it is the poorest and the most vulnerable who suffer the most. To prevent future outbreaks, we must become much more deliberate about protecting our natural environment.”\nA “zoonotic disease” or “zoonosis” is a disease that has passed into the human population from an animal source. COVID-19, which has already caused more than half a million deaths around the world, most likely originated in bats. But COVID-19 is only the latest in a growing number of diseases – including Ebola, MERS, West Nile fever and Rift Valley fever – whose spread from animal hosts into human populations has been intensified by anthropogenic pressures.\nEvery year, some two million people, mostly in low- and middle-income countries, die from neglected zoonotic diseases. The same outbreaks can cause severe illness, deaths, and productivity losses among livestock populations in the developing world, a major problem that keeps hundreds of millions of small-scale farmers in severe poverty. In the last two decades alone, zoonotic diseases have caused economic losses of more than $100 billion, not including the cost of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is expected to reach $9 trillion over the next few years.\nAfrican countries have an opportunity to lead pandemic prevention efforts\nZoonotic diseases are on the rise everywhere on the planet, and African countries – a number of which have successfully managed deadly zoonotic outbreaks – have the potential to leverage this experience to tackle future outbreaks through approaches that incorporate human, animal and environmental health. The continent is home to a large portion of the world’s remaining intact rainforests and other wild lands. Africa is also home to the world’s fastest-growing human population, leading to an increase in encounters between livestock and wildlife and in turn, the risk of zoonotic diseases.\n“The situation on the continent today is ripe for intensifying existing zoonotic diseases and facilitating the emergence and spread of new ones,” said ILRI Director General Jimmy Smith. “But with their experiences with Ebola and other emerging diseases, African countries are demonstrating proactive ways to manage disease outbreaks. They are applying, for example, novel risk-based rather than rule-based approaches to disease control, which are best suited to resource-poor settings, and they are joining up human, animal and environment expertise in proactive One Health initiatives.”\nThe report’s authors identify the One Health approach -- which unites public health, veterinary and environmental expertise -- as the optimal method for preventing as well as responding to zoonotic disease outbreaks and pandemics.\nThe report identifies ten practical steps that governments can take to prevent future zoonotic outbreaks:']	['<urn:uuid:fe59e159-8abf-4ccb-aa33-f12933df2c1a>', '<urn:uuid:d5522a92-bf9e-4baa-8fe7-b403b7e767ca>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	14	85	1828
46	file storage advantages network threats	File storage provides familiar and easy-to-use storage that's readily accessible by common applications like Microsoft Office, with simple management and minimal administrative tasks when used in shared storage. It uses existing Ethernet networking without requiring specialized components. However, it faces several security threats - the file systems can be tampered with by competitors who might edit or add false information, and the network requires protection through firewalls, particularly packet filtering firewalls which offer deep-packet inspection to scan for viruses while maintaining speed. Additionally, encryption methods like symmetric or asymmetric cryptography are needed to secure the stored files.	['File storage and block storage are the two major types of data storage typically found on networked storage systems. The terms “file” and “block” refer to the way data is stored, managed and accessed on the storage media, such as hard disk drives, solid-state drives or tape. File and block are access protocols that use different methods to save and retrieve data.\nFile storage is associated with unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that may be at variable lengths, with files that don’t necessarily have common formats or features that allow for the data to be arranged in a meaningful, coherent and consistent fashion. Some examples of file data include word processing documents, presentations, email messages, videos and graphics.\nBlock data isn’t file oriented, but rather consists of chunks of data that comprise databases and other data forms that have specific structures that define each data segment by its constituents. Block data is often represented in columns and rows. A row represents a single entity, while a column defines the contents of that entity. Rows are generally referred to as “records” and columns as “fields.”\nHow Does File Storage Work?\nBoth file storage and block storage are forms of data virtualization because they provide organization and a management layer that operates above the storage media’s native management system.\nFile storage devices manage the data they hold centrally, using a file system interface, such as Windows File Explorer or Apple’s Finder utility on Macs. The data that comprises a single file as recognized by a word processing application, for instance, may in fact consist of many pieces that are spread across a drive or multiple drives. The file system maintains pointers that indicate the locations of those pieces. The system can then enable the assembly of those pieces in the proper order to present the full file.\nThe file system also stores metadata for each file. Metadata is basic information that helps to identify the file and includes file name, the size of the file, the date the file was created and when it was last modified. Files are listed in hierarchical fashion within multiple levels of folders.\nIn addition to the way data is stored on individual PCs, file storage is the main type of storage used for shared storage called network-attached storage, or NAS. NAS systems allow multiple servers and the users they support to access a defined share of a centralized storage pool.\nFile storage on NAS systems typically supports file access protocols such as network file system (NFS), which is native to Linux and Linux applications, and server message block (SMB) -- previously called common internet file system (CIFS) -- for Windows servers and the applications they host.\nHow Does Block Storage Work?\nBlock storage doesn’t overlay the inner workings of a drive to the degree that file storage does. It is more closely functionally related to the underlying native drive management system that controls the storage media. As such, block storage isn’t file oriented and maintains much less metadata for the storage it manages.\nWith block storage, users define volumes with blocks of storage capacity. To the server’s operating system and applications, a volume looks like a single drive. The blocks have a fixed size and are sometimes difficult to adjust once they are in use, so when allocating a volume to an application, users should anticipate data growth and make the appropriate allowances.\nBlock is the type of storage used in storage area networks (SANs), which are shared storage resources accessible by many servers and applications. SANs are similar in concept to NAS systems, but typically host only block storage. Originally, SANs required their own specialized networking protocol, Fibre Channel (FC), which was developed specifically for networked storage. FC networks use different network interface cards, switches and other gear than Ethernet networks, so SANs that support block storage were typically built around their own specialized infrastructure.\nIn 2004, that restriction eased somewhat with the publication of the Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) standard. ISCSI allowed shared block storage systems to use conventional TCP/IP networks so that the same Ethernet components that connected servers and users could be used to attach those assets to shared block storage. About five years later, another storage networking protocol -- Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) -- was introduced. FCoE retained some of the performance aspects of FC but could run over a standard Ethernet network.\nWhat Are the Benefits of File Storage?\nFile storage is familiar to anyone who has used a computer. It’s easy to use and readily accessible by a broad range of applications, including popular productivity apps like Microsoft Office.\nAs the basis for a shared storage resource -- NAS systems -- file storage offers relatively easy management with a minimum of administrative tasks required to make storage available to users and applications. And because NAS can use existing Ethernet networking facilities to make the storage available, it does not require any special networking knowledge or specialized networking components.\nWhat Are the Benefits of Block Storage?\nBecause it operates close to native operations of the drives themselves, block storage usually performs at a higher level than file storage. That level of performance, combined with its block-based data access, makes block storage particularly suitable for databases. It is also suitable for other applications that use large amounts of data that is augmented and updated regularly.\nIn a disk drive block storage environment, even greater performance can be attained by short-stroking the disk drives. This involves using only the outer edges of the disks that move a faster clip than the inner parts so data can be written and retrieved more quickly. All-flash SAN arrays and flash-aided arrays are likely to produce even greater performance for block storage systems.\nWhat Are the Drawbacks of File Storage?\nThe main drawback to file storage is that file systems are limited in the number of files they can manage. That number will vary considerably from one system to the next, but the common trait is that when the limit is reached, the system will not be able to store any more data.\nFile systems are hierarchical, containing levels of folders and sub-folders that hold files that must be tracked, managed and updated with current metadata. By limiting the number of folders and files, the storage system can manage everything in a reasonably timely manner so that users and applications get access to data without major delays.\nIts hierarchical nature also limits files storage’s performance. While it may be possible to run modest databases and other non-office productivity applications on file storage, the performance might be insufficient for handling more challenging relational databases and related applications.\nWhat Are the Drawbacks of Block Storage?\nBlock is typically higher priced than file storage. A networked storage resource may require a special network to support Fibre Channel -- unless the block storage is part of an iSCSI SAN using traditional Ethernet networking protocols.\nManaging block storage in a SAN can be complicated and require more expertise than needed for NAS administration. Although most SAN vendors that sell block storage have simplified administrative procedures over the past decade, capacity allocation and overall management often remains complex.\nBlock storage also doesn’t attach as much metadata to the data it stores compared with file storage, so other tools may be needed to identify and manage stored data.\nUnified Storage: File Storage Coexists With Block Storage\nUnified storage systems combine file and block storage in a single storage resource. Because iSCSI block storage can use Ethernet protocols just as file storage does, it made it possible to provide both types of storage in a single shared resource. Later developments made it possible to include FC and FCoE storage protocols in unified storage systems.\nWith unified systems, users can decide how to allocate the storage capacity as either file or block. These systems are typically less expensive than block-only arrays, although block performance may not be at the same level of dedicated block storage appliances. But the flexibility to allocate resources as needed may outweigh the trade-off in performance.\nConclusion: Use Cases Determine File or Block Storage\nBoth file storage and block storage have been around for a while. They are both mature technologies that address specific data center needs. That’s true even as the storage media has evolved from spinning disks to flash-based solid-state drives. The choice of file vs. block depends on the intended use cases and expectations related to performance.', 'Assignment 1: Security Threats on Information Resource\nSecurity threat concerning information resource is a major concern in for business people and organizations. A strong security system should, therefore, be developed and maintained to assist in guarding this information against current and future security breaches. This section will address the best way to protect institutional information against security threats.\nA firewall is a small device that is used to enforce security policies within a network or between networks by controlling traffic flows (Sheth and Thakker, 2011). Firewalls are of three types; Packet Filtering, Application/proxy firewalls, and Packet Inspection. Of the three, Packet firewalls are the best since they are much faster than application firewalls and offer a good deep-packet inspection which permits the firewall to dig into the data portion of the packet and match on protocol compliance, scan for viruses and still operate very quickly.\nThere are two types of encryption used today. These are symmetric cryptography and asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption uses a shared key for encryption and decryption between the sender and the recipient. This necessitates the use of a secure method for transferring the key between these two ends. Asymmetric cryptography splits the keys into two smaller keys; one public shared among authorized recipients and the other private kept by the owner. Information encrypted by the public key is decrypted only by the corresponding private key.\nFor disaster recovery, there are two types of sites namely a hot and cold site. A hot site is a location that is ready for implementation, that is, equipment is already set up with current data on arrival. On the other hand, a cold site is just space with nothing set up. One has to set up the equipment and make all the connections on arrival.\nBesides security threat on an organizations network, other information resources also face this risk of security. These information resources include publications containing information regarding the organization, human resource, that is, the employees working in that organization, and advertisements made concerning the business (Workman, Bommer and Straub, 2008). These sources too can be encountered with security threats in one way or another. Publications such as journals and brochures can be tampered with and edited by potential competitors, and false information added that could breach the reputation of the organization. Employees, especially those involved in making strategic decisions and being charged with the responsibility of holding crucial information about the company may find themselves, faced with security threats especially from rival companies. They may be abducted and forced to provide information that would otherwise remain confidential. This information will then be used by the rivals to their advantage. The said employees could even be killed which could be a big blow to the company since such an employee is an important resource to the success of the company.\nThe above-mentioned threats can be minimized or prevented through various actions. One, all the publications regarding the company should be made and monitored by a department in the organization and similar information posted on the companys website to maintain similarity. The customers will, therefore, be able to verify what they read on the publications from the website. This applies to the advertisements made, either on billboards or social media. Employees, especially those holding top information about the strategies of the company should be provided with a security detail by the company to safeguard them at all times, especially when outside the workplace.\nAssignment 2: Data Communication - A Case Study of Walmart\nA strong data communication system is essential for organizations to realize success. Walmart has made various changes in its data communication system to approve its suppliers access to sales and inventory data. They did this by adding a customized Web site for its suppliers which allows them to access sales, inventory and forecasting data over an extremely fast connection. They also installed a sophisticated security system that prevents suppliers from accessing information about each others products (Slemmons, 2011). There is also a web-based access to its RetailLink system which allows suppliers to use information in the database.\nOther typical data communication applications at Walmart include automated distribution, computerized routing, and electronic data interchange. Walmart has also installed wireless communication technology to ease its operations. This is being used for the Warehouse Management System (WMS) in tracking and managing the flow of goods through its distribution centers. An additional wireless application is used to control and monitor forklifts and industrial vehicles moving merchandise inside its distribution centers. The most current data communication application in Walmart is the Vehicle Management System (VMS). It has unique features such as a two-way text-messaging system which enables the management to channel material-handling resources to areas most needed effectively. Walmart says that VMS has significantly improved safety and raised the productivity of its operations.\nWalmarts system can be split into several components namely production, supply, inventory, transportation, location, and information. Production focuses on strategic decisions concerning manufacturing of products. Walmart then obtains the required inputs for production from its suppliers. Inventory is effectively managed on a daily basis through the use of Radio Frequency Identification technology. Transportation services are offered using trucks to the customers. Products are also available in Walmart stores. Walmart emphasizes on the identification of customer demands when deciding on the location of its stores and production facilities. Information is the final component, and Walmart has all its stores globally connected with each other using the largest satellite system. This allows sharing of customer feedback and information to help in improving the business.\nNetworking concepts such as bandwidth, routing, routers, and client/server model can be used to improve the networking needs for Walmart. Bandwidth refers to the quantity of data transferrable from one point to another in a certain period. With its large system, Walmart can increase the amount of information being shared among its stores to save on time. Routing process decides the path to take. The path which offers fastest link between the users of information should be applied. Routers are network connection devices that link network systems and controls traffic flow. The safest and fastest router should be utilized by Walmart since they have many stores and production facilities across the globe. Client/server model is software that runs the local computer and communicates with the server to request information. Walmart should utilize these networking concepts to assist in their networking needs, making their system even more effective than it already is.\nTo sum up, information security and strong data communication systems are very essential in businesses today. With the advancement in technology comes the risk of companies important data being accessed by malicious individuals and this calls for the implementation of systems that minimize, if not eliminate, these security threats.\nSheth, C., & Thakker, R.

47	Working on optimizing industrial flow systems - what's the relationship between pipe sizing and pressure control?	The relationship between pipe sizing and pressure control involves several key factors. In vortex meters, pressure loss gradient has a similar shape to orifice meters, with the lowest pressure point at the shedder bar. The pressure recovers gradually downstream, resulting in permanent pressure loss. To prevent cavitation, the minimum required pressure at five pipe diameters downstream must follow the formula: Pmin = 3.2*Pdel + 1.25*Pv (where Pdel is calculated permanent pressure loss and Pv is vapor pressure at operating temperature). For cooling systems, pressure considerations vary with pipe diameter - small diameter pipes (0.5-2 inches), mid-diameter pipes (3-6 inches), and large diameter pipes (8+ inches) each require different valve types to maintain proper pressure control and system capacity.	"['Vortex Meters can be used for a wide range of fluids, i.e. liquids, gases and steam. They are to be seen as first choice, subject to verification to cover the requirements of a particular application.\nVortex meters are essentially frequency meters, since they measure the frequency of vortices generated by a “bluff body” or”shedder bar”. Vortices will only occur from a certain velocity (Re-number) on-wards, consequently vortex meters will have an elevated zero referred to as the “cut-off” point. Before the velocity becomes nil, the meter output will be cut to zero.\nAt a certain back-flow (above cut off point) some vortex meters could produce an output signal, which could lead to a false interpretation.\nAlso See: Vortex Flow Meter Animation\nVortex meters are actual volume flow meters, like orifice meters. These being intrusive meters like orifice meters, will cause the pressure drop as flow is increased, resulting in a permanent loss. consequently, liquids near their boiling point, could introduce cavitation as the pressure across the meter drops below the vapour pressure of the liquid. As soon as the pressure recovers above the vapour pressure the bubbles will impode. cavitation causes the meter to malfunction and should be avoided at all times.\nPrincipal – A fluid flowing with a certain velocity and passing a fixed obstruction generates vortices. The generation of vortices is known as Karman’s Vortices and culmination point of vortices will be approx. 1.2D downstream of bluff body. Strouhal discovered that as soon as a stretched wire starts vibrating in an air flow, frequency will be directly proportional to air velocity,\nSt= f*d/V0 (without dimention)\nSt= Strouhal’s number\nf=frequency of wire\nd=diameter of wire\nThis phenomena is called “vortex shedding” and the train of vortices is known as “Karman’s Vortex street”.\nThe frequency of vortex shedding is a direct linear function of fluid velocity and frequency depends upon the shape and face width of bluff body. Since the width of obstruction and inner diameter of the pipe will be more or less constant, the frequency is given by the expression-\nf= vortex frequency, Hz\nSt=strouhal’s number, dimention less\nV=Fluid velocity at the sheddar bar, m/s\nD=Inner diameter of the pipe, m\nc=constant (ratio d/D)\nd= Face width of sheddar bar, m\nThe pressure loss gradient across the vortex meter will have a similar shape to that of an orifice meter. the lowest point in pressure will be at the sheddar bar (comparable to vena contracta for orifice meter). downstream of this point of pressure will recover gradually, finally resulting in permanent pressure loss. To avoid cavitation, the pressure loss at vena-contracta is of interest.\nThe minimum back pressure required to ensure cavitation doesn’t occur is:\nPmin=3.2*Pdel + 1.25*Pv\nPmin= minimum required pressure at five pipe diameters downstream of the flow meter in bar\nPdel= calculated permanent pressure loss in bar\nPv= vapour pressure at operating temperature in bar\nRemember- for most vortex meters d/D will have range, 0.22 – 0.26, & frequency od vortices will depend on sizre of meter, larger the meter, lower the frequency. So the maximum diameter of vortex meter is restricted, because resolution of meter could become a problem.for control purposes. To overcome this problem, on-board digital multipliers are used which will multiply the vortex frequency without additional error.\nFrequency Sensing Principle –\nPiezo-electrical Sensors- a pair of piezo-electrical crystals is built into the sheddar bar. as the sheddar bar will be subject to alternating forces caused by shedding frequency, so will the piezo-crystals.\nVariable capacitance Sensors- a pair of variable capacitance sensors is built into the sheddar bar. As the sheddar bar will be subject to alternating micro movements caused by forces as a result of the shedding frequency, the capacitors will change their capacitance accordingly.\nPerformance of Vortex meters is influenced by-\nchange in sheddar bar geometry owning to erosion\nchange in sheddar bar geometry owning to deposits, i.e. Wax\ncorrosion of upstream piping\nchange in position of sheddar bar if not properly secured\nIn-general votex meter will consist of following electonics part-\npick-up elements, AC-pre amplifiers, AC-amplifier with filters, Noise abatement features, Schmitt Trigger, Microprocessor\nThe vortex shedding meter provides a linear digital (or analog) output signal without the use of separate transmitters or converters, simplifying equipment installation. Meter accuracy is good over a potentially wide flow range, although this range is dependent upon operating conditions. The shedding frequency is a function of the dimensions of the bluff body and, being a natural phenomenon, ensures good long term stability of calibration and repeatability of better than ±0.15% of rate. There is no drift because this is a frequency system.\nThe meter does have any moving or wearing components, providing improved reliability and reduced maintenance. Maintenance is further reduced by the fact that there are no valves or manifolds to cause leakage problems. The absence of valves or manifolds results in a particularly safe installation, an important consideration when the process fluid is hazardous or toxic.\nIf the sensor utilized is sufficiently sensitive, the same vortex shedding meter can be used on both gas and liquid. In addition, the calibration of the meter is virtually independent of the operating conditions (viscosity, density, pressure, temperature, and so on) whether the meter is being used on gas or liquid.\nThe vortex shedding meter also offers a low installed cost, particularly in pipe sizes below 6 in. (152 mm) diameter, which compares competitively with the installed cost of an orifice plate and differential pressure transmitter.\nThe limitation include meter size range. Meters below 0.5 in. (12 mm) diameter are not practical, and meters above 12 in. (300 mm) have limited application due their high cost compared to an orifice system and their limited output pulse resolution. The number of pulses generated per unit volume decreases on a cube law with increasing pipe diameter. Consequently, a 24 in. (610 mm) diameter vortex shedding meter with a typical blockage ratio of 0.3 would only have a full scale frequency output of approximately 5 Hz at 10 ft/s (3 m/s) fluid velocity.\nSelection and Sizing :\nAs the first step in the selection process, the operating conditions (process fluid temperature, ambient temperature, line pressure, and so on) should be compared with the meter specification. The meter wetted materials (including bonding agents) and sensors should then be checked for compatibility with the process fluid both with regard to chemical attack and safety. On oxygen, for example, non ferrous material should be used avoided or approached with extreme caution. The meter minimum and maximum flow rates for the given application should then be established.\nThe meter minimum flow rate is established by a Reynolds number of 10,000 to 10,500, the fluid density, and a minimum acceptable shedding frequency for the electronics. The maximum flow rate is governed by the meter pressure loss (typically two velocity heads), the onset of cavitation with liquids, and sonic velocity flow (choking) with gases. Consequently, the flow range for any application depends totally upon the operating fluid viscosity, density, and the vapour pressure, and the applications maximum flow rate and line pressure. On low viscosity products such as water, gasoline, and liquid ammonia, and with application maximum velocity of 15 ft/s (4.6 m/s), vortex shedding meters can have a rangeability of about 20:1 with a pressure loss of approximately 4 PSIG (27.4 kPa).\nThe meter’s good (“of rate”) accuracy and digital linear output signal make its application over wide flow ranges a practical proposition. The rangeability declines proportionally with increase in viscosity, decrease in density, or reductions in the maximum flow velocity of the process. Vortex shedding meters are therefore unsuitable for use on high viscosity liquids.\nVortex Meter Advantages\n• Vortex meters can be used for liquids, gases and steam\n• Low wear (relative to turbine flow meters)\n• Relatively low cost of installation and maintenance\n• Low sensitivity to variations in process conditions\n• Stable long term accuracy and repeatability\n• Applicable to a wide range of process temperatures\n• Available for a wide variety of pipe sizes\nVortex Flow Meter Limitations\n• Not suitable for very low flow rates\n• Minimum length of straight pipe is required upstream and downstream of the vortex meter\nVortex flow meters are suitable for a variety of applications and industries but work best with clean, low-viscosity, medium to high speed fluids.\nSome of the main uses include:\n• Custody transfer of natural gas metering\n• Steam measurement\n• Flow of liquid suspensions\n• General water applications\n• Liquid chemicals & pharmaceuticals\nAlso Read: Turbine Flow Meter Working Principle\n- Vortex Flow meter Working Animation\n- Difference between Different Types of Flow Meters\n- Types of Vortex Flow Meter Sensors\n- How to Select a Flow Meter\n- What is a Vortex flowmeter ?\n- V Cone Flow Meter Working Principle\n- Comparison of Venturi and Orifice flow meter\n- Swirl Flow Meters Working Principle\n- Flow Transmitter Rangeability\n- Flow Measurement Multiple Choice Questions', ""Along with pressure comes the capacity of the system.Consider the following three options when examining the pressure level and relative capacity of the cooling system Small-diameter pipe (0.5 to 2) globe control valve.Mid-diameter pipe (3 to 6) segmented ball valve. results for this questionWhat are the different types of cooling pipes?What are the different types of cooling pipes?Consider the following three options when examining the pressure level and relative capacity of the cooling system Small-diameter pipe (0.5 to 2) globe control valve Large-diameter pipe (8 and above) high performance butterfly valve (HPBV) Small-diameter pipe two- or three-piece ball valve Mid-diameter pipe three-piece or flanged ball valveBest Practices Pipe and Valve Selection for a Cooling results for this questionWhat is a cooling system?What is a cooling system?Regarding cooling systems,the valves that are selected typically are going to be flow control valves and isolation (shutoff and bypass) valves.There are important questions to consider before picking the valve for the cooling system.Best Practices Pipe and Valve Selection for a Cooling\nresults for this questionWhat to consider before picking a cooling valve?What to consider before picking a cooling valve?There are important questions to consider before picking the valve for the cooling system.The first thing to consider is the flow capacity.When considering the size required by the cooling application,it is easy to narrow down the valve that should be chosen.An important thing to remember in valve selection is the pipe size.Best Practices Pipe and Valve Selection for a Cooling 12345NextEnclosure Cooling Selection - AutomationDirect\nValve Evaporator Compressor Condenser Enclosure Cooling Selecting a Fan or Cooling Device Fan selection To select the proper size (CFM) fan for your forced air cooling solution,you need to determine the amount of heat to be removed (in watts) and determine the Delta T (Max.allowable internal enclosure temperature °F Max.outside ambientAuthor Ray HerreraValves Improve Process Cooling 2015-08-11 Process CoolingAug 11,2015·The wine cooling process itself is fairly straightforward,but it may highlight how valves can function as surprisingly important ingredients in improving a variety of cooling applications.Consider a typical wine cooler process and learn about suggested tradeoffs and advantages involved in optimum valve selection.\nThis guidebook covers the best practices in piping systems with a primary view of reducing energy cost,keeping in mind the safety and reliability issues.The basic elements of best practice in piping systems are 1.Analysis optimum pipe size selection for water,compressed air and steam distribution systems 2.Good piping practices 3.Best Practices Engineering GuideBest Practices Engineering Guide Installation Recommendations for FCI Single-Point, and selection of thermal dispersion flow meters simple and effective.

48	boreal forest main characteristics location	The boreal coniferous forest, or taiga, is an extensive northern biome occurring in moist climates with cold winters. It is dominated by coniferous cone-bearing trees, especially species of fir, larch, pine, and spruce. Some broad-leaved trees are also present, including species of aspen, birch, poplar, and willow. Most boreal forests experience periodic catastrophic disturbances, such as wildfires and insect attacks.	"[""Ecosystems: what they are and why they are important\nA biome is different from an ecosystem. An ecosystem is the interaction of living and nonliving things in an environment. A biome is a specific. A biome is an ecosystem containing plant and animal species that are characteristic to a specific geographic region. (An ecosystem is the community of plants. Ecological levels: from individuals to ecosystems Ecosystems and biomes . And now, a direct relationship to God, unmediated by the institution of the.\nNew species sometimes also arrive. For example, a new bird that eats a certain insect can come to an area. That insect will now be less abundant and affect the plants that it used to feed upon as well as the other animals that eat this plant.\nThe animals and plants that live in an ecosystem are perfectly suited to these particular living conditions. Changes in external factors, like temperature, can change the plants grow and, therefore, the animals that eat the plants might adapt, move, or die in response. Ecosystem services The normal functioning of an ecosystem provides humans with an abundance of services that we depend upon or that can significantly improve our quality of life.\nThe list of ecosystem-provided services is very, very long and includes several more nuanced entries that we tend to take for granted, like clean air, a stable climate, and safe drinking water. Pollination is an important ecosystem service. Human influence Human action is currently disrupting a large number of ecosystems.\nFor example, by removing most of the fish from the ocean, the whole food chain and system are disrupted and can no longer function properly. The result is running out of certain types of seafood that we enjoy. Introducing invasive species also influences ecosystems because these invasive species outcompete several of the native species that are necessary for the system to work properly. On a larger scale, humans are even capable of influencing external factors.\nBy causing the earth to warm via increased carbon dioxide emissions, it influences which plants and animals can live where. It is true that new species often enter ecosystems and that climate can naturally fluctuate but the current changes are so frequent and sudden that the ecosystems cannot adapt to new equilibrium.\nWe are also shooting ourselves in the foot because disrupting ecosystems could have disastrous effects on ourselves: Maintaining the balance of the ecosystem benefits us personally.

The boreal coniferous forest, or taiga, is an extensive northern biome occurring in moist climates with cold winters. The boreal forest is dominated by coniferous cone-bearing trees, especially species of fir, larch, pine, and spruce.\nSome broad-leaved trees are also present in the boreal forest, especially species of aspen, birch, poplar, and willow. Most boreal forests are subject to periodic catastrophic disturbances, such as wildfires and attacks by insects. Temperate deciduous forests are dominated by a large variety of broad-leaved trees in relatively moist, temperate mild or moderate climates.\nBecause these forests occur in places where the winters can be cold, the foliage of most species is seasonally deciduous, meaning that trees shed their leaves each autumn and then regrow them in the springtime. Common trees of the temperate deciduous forest biome in North America are ash, basswood, birch, cherry, chestnut, dogwood, elm, hickory, magnolia, maple, oak, tulip-tree, and walnut. Temperate rain forests are characterized by mild winters and an abundance of rain.\nThese systems are too moist to support wildfires. As a result, they often develop into old-growth forests, dominated by coniferous trees of mixed age and various species.\nBiomes and Ecosystems - Windows to the Universe\nIndividual trees can be very large and, in extreme cases, can be more than 1, years old. Common trees of this biome are species of Douglas-fir, hemlock, cedar, redwood, spruce, and yellow cypress.\nIn North America, temperate rain forests are most commonly found on the humid west coast. A boreal forest in north Saskatchewan. Reproduced by permission of JLM Visuals. Temperate grasslands occur under climatic conditions that are between those that produce forests and those that produce deserts. In temperate zones, grasslands typically occur in regions where rainfall is 25 to 60 centimeters 10 to 24 inches per year.\nGrasslands in North America are called prairies and in Eurasia they are often called steppes. This biome occupies vast regions of the interior of these continents. The prairie is often divided into three types according to height of the dominant vegetation: The once-extensive tall grass prairie is dominated by various species of grasses and broad-leaved, herbaceous plants such as sunflowers and blazing stars, some as tall as 3 to 4 meters 10 to 13 feet.\nFire played a key role in preventing much of the tall grass prairie from developing into open forest. The tall grass prairie is now an endangered natural ecosystem because it has been almost entirely converted for agricultural use. The mixed grass prairie occurs where rainfall is less plentiful, and it supports shorter species of grasses and other herbaceous plants.\nThe short grass prairie develops when there is even less precipitation, and it is subject to unpredictable years of severe drought. Tropical grassland and savanna. Tropical grasslands are present in regions with as much as centimeters 47 inches of rainfall per year, but under highly seasonal conditions with a pronounced dry season. Savannas are dominated by grasses and other herbaceous plants.\nHowever, they also have scattered shrubs and tree-sized woody plants that form a very open canopy a layer of spreading branches. Tropical grasslands and savannas can support a great seasonal abundance of large, migratory animals as well as substantial populations of resident animals. This is especially true of Africa, where on the savanna range—among other animals—gazelles and other antelopes, rhinos, elephants, hippopotamuses, and buffalo, and various predators of these, such as lions, cheetahs, wild dogs, and hyenas.\nChaparral is a temperate biome that develops in environments where precipitation varies widely from season to season. A common chaparral pattern involves winter rains and summer drought, the socalled Mediterranean climate. Chaparral is characterized by dwarf forests, shrubs, and herbaceous vegetation.\nThis biome is highly prone to wildfire. In North America, chaparral is best developed in parts of the southwest, especially coastal southern California. Deserts occur in either temperate or tropical climates.\nThey commonly are found in the centers of continents and in rain shadows of Biomes along 87 degrees west longitude and along 0 degrees longitude.\nBiome - humans, examples, body, water, process, Earth, life, plants\nReproduced by permission of The Gale Group. The most prominent characteristic of a desert is the limited amount of water available. In most cases, less than 25 centimeters 10 inches of rain fall each year. Not surprisingly, the plant life found in a desert ecosystem is strongly influenced by the availability of water: In somewhat moister places, a shrub-dominated ecosystem is able to develop. A semi-evergreen tropical forest is a type of tropical forest that develops when a region experiences both wet and dry seasons during the year.\nBecause of this pattern, most trees and shrubs of this biome are seasonally deciduous, meaning that they shed their foliage in anticipation of the drier season. This biome supports a great richness of species of plants and animals, though somewhat less than in tropical rain forests.\nEvergreen tropical rain forest. Evergreen tropical rain forests occur in tropical climates with abundant precipitation and no seasonal drought. Because wildfires and other types of catastrophic disturbances are uncommon in this sort of climate regime, tropical rain forests usually develop into old-growth forests.\nAs such, they contain a great richness of species of trees and other plants, a great size range of trees, and an extraordinary diversity of animals and microorganisms. Many ecologists consider the old-growth tropical rain forests the ideal ecosystem on land because of the enormous variety of species that are supported under relatively favorable climatic conditions. Freshwater biomes Freshwater biomes can be divided into three general categories: A lentic ecosystem is one such as a lake or pond that contains standing water.\nIn lentic systems, water generally flows into and out of the lake or pond on a regular basis. The rates at which inflow and outflow occur vary greatly and can range from days, in the case of small pools, to centuries, in the case of the largest lakes. The types of organisms that inhabit lentic biomes are strongly influenced by water properties, especially nutrient concentration and water transparency and depth.\nWaters with a large nutrient supply are highly productive, or eutrophic, while infertile waters are unproductive, or oligotrophic. Commonly, shallow bodies of water are much more productive than deeper bodies of water of the same surface area, primarily because plant growth is influenced by the ability of light to penetrate into the water. Water that becomes cloudy because of the accumulation of silt or dissolved organic matter is likely to have low productivity.\nA lotic biome is one that consists of running water, as in streams or rivers. The organisms found in a lotic biome depend on factors such as the amount of water in the system, the rate at which it flows, and seasonal changes in the flow rate. Consider a stream in which flooding is common in the spring.\nRapidly moving water churns up clay, silt, sand, and other materials from the streambed. The water then becomes cloudy and murky, and light is thus prevented from penetrating it. In this case the stream will not be able to support many kinds of life-forms.\nIn general, the common lotic ecosystems such as rivers, streams, and brooks are not usually self-supporting in terms of the organisms that live within them.""]"	['<urn:uuid:ea07324b-4919-49ad-97a6-efc764294a0f>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	5	60	1812
49	exercise frequency intensity time recommended guidelines pregnancy first trimester to third trimester	For optimal prenatal exercise, guidelines recommend gradually building up to exercising most days of the week. Previously active women can continue their pre-pregnancy exercise level in the first trimester, while beginners should start with 2-3 days of low-intensity exercise. Intensity should be monitored using the 'Talk Test' rather than heart rate. The recommended time is 10-30 minutes per session, aiming for 150 minutes total per week, which can be broken into shorter workouts. As pregnancy progresses into second and third trimesters, pregnancy-specific exercises should be introduced, and activities with risk of falling or impact should be avoided.	"[""Posted by Seanna Thompson, M.D.\nApril 22, 2015\nPregnancy might seem like the perfect time to sit back and relax. You may feel more tired than usual, your back might ache and your ankles might be swollen.\nBut there's more to pregnancy and exercise than skipping it entirely. Unless you're experiencing serious complications, sitting around won't help. In fact, pregnancy can be a great time to get active — even if you haven't exercised in a while.\nWhat are the benefits of exercise during pregnancy?\nRegular exercise can help your body adapt to the changes that occur during pregnancy. Exercise reduces constipation, bloating, swelling and backaches. Physical activity improves mood, posture, muscle tone, strength and endurance. It may also help you sleep better. Additionally, exercise can benefit the baby and may even prevent or treat gestational diabetes.\nOverall, exercise regularly keeps you fit during pregnancy, increases your energy level and can help you cope better with labor. Post-baby workouts will also help you take weight off more quickly after delivery.\nWhat exercise should I do?\nExercise that incorporates cardiovascular fitness is beneficial. Walking, swimming, cycling, aerobics, yoga, Pilates and running are exercises safe for pregnancy. Be sure to listen to your body and drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, which support the uterus, bladder, small intestine and rectum. You can do Kegel exercises discreetly just about any time. Squeeze the pelvic floor muscles for five seconds and relax and squeeze again; try to do 50 a day.\nIs it OK to start exercising if I do not routinely exercise?\nYes. It’s never too late to start. Make sure to drink plenty of water, wear loose-fitting clothes and a supportive bra. Stay cool, take breaks and stop if you feel overheated. Be sure to listen to your body.\nAre there any exercises I should avoid?\nAvoid contact sports, as well as activities where there is a high risk of falling. Avoid hot yoga, downhill skiing, hockey, basketball, soccer, wrestling, fight club, scuba, gymnastics, water skiing and horseback riding. Although free weights can be utilized, there is a risk of hitting the abdomen. Use of resistance bands may be preferable. Also, stay off your back after the first trimester. Avoid activities that require balance skills later in pregnancy.\nHow much should I exercise?\nDepending on your fitness level, consider these guidelines:\n- You haven't exercised for a while. Begin with as little as five minutes of physical activity a day. Build up to 10 minutes, 15 minutes and so on until you reach at least 30 minutes a day.\n- You exercised before pregnancy. You can probably continue to work out at the same level while you're pregnant — as long as you're feeling comfortable and your health care provider says it's OK.\nWhat should I watch out for?\nThe hormones in your body can cause the ligaments that support your joints to relax, making joints more mobile and more at risk for injury. The extra weight shifts your center of gravity, placing stress on your back, muscles and joints. Stop exercise if vaginal bleeding, dizziness, chest pain or fluid leaking from the vagina occurs. If you experience these symptoms during exercise, contact your health care provider."", ""Wondering where to get started in your prenatal exercise adventure?\nOptimal pregnancy exercise guidelines will differ for every mom, depending on your pre-pregnancy activity level and how your pregnancy is progressing. For most uncomplicated pregnancies, prenatal exercise is extremely beneficial and can help you look and feel your best throughout pregnancy and after baby. We reviewed guidelines from all over the world to find out what physicians (and moms!) do to achieve optimal health in pregnancy.\nA collective study by 10 physicians in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine analyzed the prenatal exercise guidelines of 9 countries, eleven different plans in total, to better understand what are widely considered optimal exercise guidelines for the pregnant mom. Many countries had some interesting and individual additions to their pregnancy exercise guidelines. Japan, for example, recommends exercising only between 10 am and 2 pm, while Norway specifically states the importance of wearing light clothing.\nWhile all the general recommendations presented by the participating countries have some value to moms, the advice specifically related to the FITT exercise principle (Frequency, Intensity, Time, & Type) are how we determine what the optimal exercise guidelines are. All the participating countries recommenced starting an exercise program in pregnancy (with your doctors ok), even if you were inactive before, so let’s have a look at the optimal exercise guidelines for prenatal exercise.\nAcross the eleven proposals, frequency recommendations differed for almost every guide. How often you should be exercising is partly determined by your pre-pregnancy activity level, among other health factors. 3/4 of the guidelines recommended a goal of gradually building up to more frequent exercises, on most days of the week.\nFor moms who were active before pregnancy, it’s generally considered safe to continue to exercise as often as you were before, especially in the first trimester, so long as the intensity (see below) is within range, and the exercises are safe & feel good. If you’re just starting out, get clearance from your doctor, and begin with 2-3 days per week of low-intensity exercise, gradually working up to most days of the week for optimal results. Exercising each day can help to improve your endurance, strength, and muscle memory, giving you results more quickly and safely than trying to pack a week’s worth in one day.\nSo rather than trying to set aside a day or two a week to squeeze in a gym-marathon, try fitting in shorter bursts (see Time, below), of prenatal exercises daily– your body and baby will thank you!\nDetermining how hard you’re working during an exercise can be challenging, especially if you are new to an exercise program and are concerned about overexerting yourself.\nMany exercise guidelines traditionally advise tracking heart rate. Heart rate monitoring involves tracking resting heart rate, and calculating a safe range to exercise within (usually 60-80% of maximum aerobic capacity) or around 140 beats per minute. This measurement, however, varies significantly based on your individual cardiovascular strength and pre-pregnancy activity level. Using heart rate monitoring is not considered the most effective way to determine what’s safe, or whether you’re getting a great workout.\nRecently updated healthcare recommendations suggest moms use the ‘Talk Test‘ to help achieve optimal prenatal exercise. This easy-to-use intensity indicator requires no equipment (and no math!). You should be able to carry on a conversation with your workout buddy, sing along to a song, or say a few words to your growing baby bump. Use the talk test to determine if you’re workouts are too intense (not getting enough air), or if it’s time to ramp up your efforts!\nIt’s most important to remember that the best indicator for safe prenatal exercise is how you feel. So breathe easy, do what feels good, and challenge yourself where you can to make the most of every workout.\nSeveral studies now show that shorter workouts, (10-15 minutes at a moderate intensity) performed more frequently can actually be more effective than one long sweat-session. These shorter workouts also have longer-lasting benefits, including long term cardiovascular and muscular response improvement.\nFrequent, shorter exercises, performed at your maximum intensity works to:\n- Regulate blood sugar\n- Keep blood pressure in check\n- Improve cardiovascular health\n- Increase your metabolism and improve digestion (which can often be sluggish in pregnancy– thanks, hormones!)\n- Improve your sleep quality\nAs busy mamas, an hour or more at the gym might be impossible to come by, but fifteen minutes to perform some exercises at home that don’t require a gym full of equipment can be a very realistic goal. By performing exercises for shorter periods of time, you are more likely do them accurately– so you can reduce your risk of injury, and get more out of each move.\nRather than exercising to exhaustion once or twice a week (not recommended in pregnancy!), you can try 10-30 minutes of well-performed workouts, each day. You’ll see more benefits from breaking up 2-3 hours of exercise over 7 days, versus one long day spent at the gym!\nActivities considered beneficial for prenatal health promotion across most of the guidelines in the study include: aerobic, strengthening, walking, and water exercises. Other examples of safe and effective prenatal exercises suggested in many of the included samples include; yoga, Pilates, and pelvic floor exercises (incorporated in the Prenatal + Postnatal Membership)!\nThe safest and most effective prenatal exercises for each individual pregnant mom vary, based on your pre-pregnancy exercise routines and how your pregnancy is progressing. We see moms doing CrossFit, lifting and competing in athletics, all within their own range of physical capability. You can safely continue any pre-pregnancy exercises into the first trimester, so long as there is no risk for impact or falling. Into your second and third trimester, start including the workouts from my Prenatal + Postnatal Membership. Introducing these pregnancy-specific exercises can help prepare your growing body for late pregnancy, delivery and life as a busy mom.\nRemember, only perform exercises that are comfortable for you. You can alleviate many common discomforts of pregnancy with light stretching, walking, or mindful breathing exercises, but it’s important to talk to your doctor before exercising.\nSo What's Right For Me?\nAlways discuss with your healthcare provider before changing your health plan during pregnancy. Your doctors can provide insight into how your pregnancy is progressing, and if there might be concerns or limitations specific to your body and baby.\nOnce you have the green light, and if you’re new to exercising, begin with 10-15 minutes of low-to-moderate intensity exercises, then you can gradually work up to 30 minutes per day, on most days of the week. Research indicates that 150 minutes of exercise per week is the minimum to strive for, which works out to 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week.\nBreaking up that 150 minutes in any manageable slices (fifteen minutes in the morning, and fifteen after work) can help you achieve the ultimate objective: improving your health and endurance in pregnancy, without having to overhaul your schedule!\n* * * * *\nBegin Your Optimal Prenatal Fitness Journey Today!

50	As a construction materials specialist, I'm comparing health hazards between natural stone and engineered stone benchtops - which material poses a higher silica dust risk during processing and why?	Engineered stone poses a higher silica dust risk during processing because it contains approximately 90% silica content, which is much higher than natural stones. While natural stones like sandstone and granite can vary in their silica content, engineered stone's extremely high silica concentration has been linked to accelerated silicosis, a rapidly developing form of lung disease that can occur within 1-10 years of exposure to very high concentrations of respirable crystalline silica.	"['Building materials used in construction of building structures can welcome health issues subsequently for occupants or to workmen involved in building services, maintenances, demolition and refurbishment.\nThis may be due to:\n- Vibration Effects\n- Poor acoustic characteristics of the building\n- Dysfunctional lighting\n- Extremes of relative humidity\n- The air exchange is inadequate\n- Toxicity mediated through soil\nThe above-mentioned issues will affect the durability of the building along with the health and comfort of the people residing in the respective building.\nBuilding Materials to Hazardous Material Conversion Stage\nThe whole life of a construction material must be considered and audited into account to understand what are the human and environmental health hazard issues from these materials.\nOther than this, the following mentioned stages must also be considered:\n1. The health as well as environmental impacts during the procurement of raw materials and the final disposal of the by-product or the waste product must be considered.\nThe process of obtaining raw materials includes mining, synthesis, manufacture and quarrying. Disposal of mine or unwanted by products, quarry spoil is some of the disposed materials.\n2. The hazards and health effects during the transportation of the materials must be considered.\n3. The effects of manufacturing a building product: The harmful effects if exist will affect the production worker, the members involved in the process, the public and the environment around.\n4. Improper handling of the product bringing harmful effects to the construction workers, the local residents and the environment.\n5. The hazard effects from commissioned buildings that have installed product to the people residing.\n6. The hazard effects from the works like maintenance, refurbishment and servicing to the professional workings, the decorators, plumbers, electricians and residents.\nDuring the time of construction, the surface skins and the connective tissues filling the gas are largely composed of materials. By the end of 20th century as a concern of economy and safety thousands of construction materials of asbestos have been installed in UK for new and old buildings.\nThe variation in the use of water supply connection materials have also brought mitigation to leakage problems hence avoiding the possibilities leakage that will in turn cause cholera, typhoid and other health problems.\nThis was the time where less toxic materials where used for plumbing systems like copper, iron and polymers.\nDifferent Mineral Based Construction Materials and Their Health Aspects\nCare is necessary during the selection of constructional materials that are mineral based as their respective nomenclature is commonly imprecise. The use of a hazardous material or selecting a safer alternative for the design of buildings are determined by an informed specifier.\nHence the state of knowledge of the builders and the occupants will determine the methods of working with such hazardous materials and replacement products if any.\nSome of the mineral construction materials and their respective health aspect is mentioned below:\nThe crystalline content and the amount of dust that is generated have the chances to be inhaled. This is the major health hazard caused by stone mineral used in construction works. Higher exposure to this will cause silicosis.\nThis is a health problem where the lungs will lose the normal elasticity, which will cause the act of breathing to become laboured. This will result in the impairment of blood circulation. This hence will result in the building up of waste carbon dioxide within the body and oxygen fails to enter the tissues. This will make the heart overburdened and final failure.\nThe excessive inhalation of stone dusts will result in increase of lung cancer as concluded form the studies. Based on the variation in the silica content of stones, their disease potential also varied.\nSandstone and true granite are notorious hazards for the masons. Sandstones are highly siliceous but granite can vary with their quartz content.\nThe hazard of these material lies in their quarrying and masonry work procedures also. To avoid risk, wet methods of blasting were introduced.\nThe slate material is also rich in silica content which bring the hazards of silicosis problems to the workers, the slate splitters and the engravers. The slate in the forms of slabs and tiles bring no form of harm to the occupants.\nConcrete patching will result the operatives to get irritation and become sensitive to the forms of cements and the additives used in the cement. The skin contact with the chromium ion present in cement is a problem. Withdrawal of contact with the cement faster will help in sooner recovery.\nThe clay is fired and later used for decorative purpose by glazing it. It is employed in the production of roof, sanitary piping, floor tiles and material structural decorative bricks.\nLarge silicate clay having a lesser hazard effect to health is transmuted during the clay firing into crystalline silica which are especially hazardous in nature.\nThis hazard effect is till the manufacturing process. This won’t affect the construction workers or the occupants that are residing.\nThis product is used in block form. It is used as a non-combustible thermal insulation between the joists. These bought problems for the carcinogenic potential.\nThis was determined by the observation of asbestos and vermiculite fibers in many specimens. A health study on a group of miners helped to find this health hazard.\nThe trapping of dust through the gaps of the ceiling and entering the room is a big cancer threat. If the material is very much needed, a fiber free material can be specified by the designer.\nA variety of chemical compounds in physical forms either of natural or synthetic origin have these calcium silicates. Some have fibrous forms while some have discrete particulates.\nThe test for carcinogenicity is determined by finding the calcium silicate content. Here too it is better to suggest non-fibrous products.\nGypsum in Construction\nThe gypsum material shows no health hazard. But it has accounted for 10 to 50 percent of radon in the soil due to the manufacture of plasters and plasterboards.\nFibrous form of serpentine and amphibole minerals form the asbestos. These materials where a concern behind the risks of asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma. Many new materials out of cement and polymer matrix where developed to mitigate this problem and replace the asbestos material.\nNon-Asbestos Mineral Fibers\nWHO considered that there are materials to replace asbestos by materials like glass, slag wool, ceramic and refractory fibers. Complete removal of fibers products from the construction field is not possible but the most hazardous one can be removed.\nMetals That are Used in Construction and their Health Effects\nThe different metals that are used in different construction application and their respective health effects are described briefly:\nThe lead toxicity has resulted in problems like paralysis, anemia, malaise, severe colic, convulsion etc. These can result in frank disease during their intake. This bought a decision on the replacement of lead as a construction material.\nIn olden days, the principal sources of environmental lead contamination were the solders, paints and the water pipers.\nAdults intake the lead through drinking water while the children intake is through licking the wall with paint, chewing paintwork and house dust.\nThe use of copper in contemporary building have helped to eradicate the source of lead. The reformulation of the pain and the use of linseed putty help the lead entering the children tastes.\nThe harmful effects of leads have made the use of inorganic lead in paint and the use of organic lead in petrol by the government.\nThe chromium does not bring any sort of hazard effect, whether if it is used as a decorative material or as a protective material in construction. This can be used as a corrosion resistant alloys.\nThe salts of chromium are used in cement additives. This may cause skin irritation on contact. This may sometimes lead to the persistent dermatitis. These metals also bring concerns about carcinogens.\nCopper used in construction either in the form of metal or alloyed in brass bring no kind of health problems for the occupants. The workers engaged in industrial activities are more exposed to the heavy copper metal fume in large extent.\nAcute and chronic effects are caused on the lung, kidney and bone by the entry of cadmium. Hence cadmium is a toxic element. These metals are used to coat steel, where they act as a protection against corrosion. This protective layer brings no form of harm to the occupants.\nThe redevelopment or demolition process will employ flame-cutting of the metal. This have resulted in attacks due to metal-fume fever. Some of these cases have been found fatal.\nThe cadmium metal will liberate a toxic fume, when they are overheated. This is hence categorized under hard solder. This is employed in the installation of certain domestic apparatus. But they bring no harm to the occupants. This can bring harmful effects for the engineers who carry out soldering and disassembling of the same.\nThe paints and plastic make use of cadmium as a pigment. In areas wherever there is possibility of leaching out or have chances of being ingested by infants, the same has to be excluded and a better alternative have to be suggested.\nIron, Stainless steel, steel and Aluminium Metals\nThe mentioned metal brings some sort of adverse effects in certain situations. But their use has never been foreseen to offer any form of risks to the occupants.', ""This safety alert highlights the serious health and safety risks of exposure to high levels of respirable crystalline silica (RCS) for those who work in the stone benchtop industry.\nSilicosis is an irreversible and progressive disease that causes fibrosis of the lungs from the inhalation of RCS. The only treatment for advanced disease is lung transplant.\nAs of February 2019, 99 confirmed cases of silicosis associated with engineered stone benchtop work had been identified in Queensland, Australia. The vast majority of these cases were in workers with no symptoms of disease.\nMany of these cases have been consistent with accelerated silicosis, a form of the disease which develops over a short period (1 to 10 years) from inhalation of very high concentrations of RCS.\nIn New Zealand the prevalence of silicosis is currently unknown. This safety alert has been issued to raise awareness of the risks to those working in the engineered stone industry.\nWhat we know\nEngineered stone benchtops have become increasingly popular for kitchens and bathrooms. They are made by mixing finely crushed rock with a polymeric resin, then moulded into slabs and heat-cured. The silica content of engineered stone is approximately 90% silica, which is much higher than natural stones.\nWorkers may be exposed to RCS while cutting, grinding, sanding and polishing stone benchtops during manufacturing and installation. Accelerated silicosis is one of three forms of silicosis that has been recently reported in workers working with engineered stone.\nAccelerated silicosis results from the inhalation of very high concentrations of silica dust. It develops in a pattern similar to that of simple silicosis, except the time from initial exposure to the onset of disease is shorter and the progression to complicated silicosis is more rapid. Specifically, nodules increase in size and merge into large lesions, leading to progressive massive fibrosis and ultimately cardio respiratory failure.\nBefore starting work using engineered stone, businesses must complete a risk assessment and review their controls. It is important to eliminate uncontrolled dry cutting, grinding or polishing of engineered stone.\nIf this is not reasonably practicable then exposures must be minimised. Options include:\n- substituting engineered stone for materials with a lower silica content\n- isolating work areas or tasks that generate dust using physical barriers or computer numerical control (CNC) machines\n- using engineering controls, such as local exhaust ventilation (LEV), water suppression (wet cutting), or on-tool dust extraction attachments. Wet sprays should be controlled by guards to prevent dust becoming airborne and wet waste must be managed. LEV system dust collectors or vacuums should be H-class HEPA filtered. Any LEV must be effective, fit for purpose, installed, set up and used correctly and maintained so that it remains effective\n- further minimisation controls include administrative controls, such as good housekeeping practice (wet wiping, using an H-class HEPA-filtered vacuum, and low-pressure water cleaning – dry wiping or sweeping is not appropriate).\nIf a risk still remains, use the appropriate personal protective equipment:\n- use a suitable respirator with a filter cartridge with the appropriate assigned protection factor; the appropriate respirator and filter cartridge combination will be informed by exposure monitoring\n- ensure the respirator is fit-tested for the worker, cleaned and maintained properly\n- wear suitable work clothing such as coveralls that are disposable or can be laundered at the workplace to avoid taking them home.\nThe current New Zealand Workplace Exposure Standard (WES) for RCS (quartz) is 0.05 mg/m3. This value was reduced from 0.1 mg/m3 in November following consultation.\nYou can engage an occupational hygienist from the New Zealand Occupational Hygiene Society(external link) (NZOHS), or from the Health and Safety Association of New Zealand (HASANZ) Register(external link) to measure RCS concentrations and to help evaluate risks to worker health.\nResponse and updates\nWe’re working with medical and health and safety professionals on a coordinated response for workers at high risk of exposure to dust from engineered stone.\nIf you're interested in receiving this information when it is available, and other accelerated silicosis updates, you can record your details in our online form.\nWe provide further guidance related to accelerated silicosis:\n- Silica dust in the workplace\n- 8 key things for workers to know: Controlling silica dust in the workplace\n- Controlling construction dust with on-tool extraction\n- Exposure Monitoring under the Health and Safety at Work (General Risk and Workplace Management) Regulations 2016\n- Health monitoring required under the Health and Safety at Work (General Risk and Workplace Management) Regulations 2016""]"	['<urn:uuid:6ad3eef2-50ac-4aca-82f5-d93ca2c0de10>', '<urn:uuid:f9311185-dfd7-408b-b03b-b7d83f5f5d23>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	29	72	2298

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), this global warming observed since the middle of the 20th century is primarily the result of burning fossil fuels which produces carbon dioxide, and land uses which cause deforestation.	"[""Climate Literacy Framework\nEssential Principles and Fundamental Concepts of Climate Science\nEarth’s climate offers just the right conditions for life to thrive. Climate is the average weather over a long period of time — at least thirty years. For any given region, climate is described using long term trends in atmospheric temperature, humidity, pressure, wind, and rainfall. Climate is also affected by proximity to large bodies of water, ocean currents, and ice or snow cover, as well as altitude, latitude, and topography. Climate is regulated largely by concentrations of chemicals in the atmosphere called greenhouse gases which influence the amount of energy that is retained and lost to space by Earth’s atmosphere. Decreasing greenhouse gases cause global cooling, and increasing concentrations cause global warming. Observations of weather using instruments are reliable only to the early 19th century. Climate of the more distant past is revealed by paleontologists, scientists who interpret climate records found in fossils, tree rings, ocean and lake sediments, and ice cores. Climate scientists also are developing mathematical models of the Earth system which can simulate how climate changes over time under the influence of different levels of green house gas emissions.\nHundreds of scientists participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have concluded that the global warming observed since the middle of the 20th century is primarily the result of burning of fossil fuels which produces carbon dioxide, and land uses which cause deforestation. Impacts of global warming include rising sea level; less predictable precipitation patterns, higher frequency of severe weather; melting ice caps, glaciers, and permafrost; species extinctions; and changes in crop yields. In order to slow global warming and to inevitable changes, we must become better informed about climate and global change. A climate-literate public knows how to assess scientifically credible information about climate. It can communicate about and make well-informed decisions with regard to individual actions and public policies that may affect climate.\nThis climate science literacy guide identifies the essential principles and fundamental concepts that individuals and communities should understand about Earth’s climate system. Climate science literacy provides important insights into how the entire Earth system functions. For more information on this effort, please visit the Climate Science Literacy Framework web site.

52	What specific conditions need to be met for electronic communications to be considered criminal harassment under Illinois law, and what are the potential penalties for first and second offenses?	Electronic harassment occurs when someone uses electronic communication to make obscene comments with intent to offend, interrupts communications with intent to harass, transmits files preventing device use, harasses minors under 13, threatens injury to person or property, or knowingly allows their device to be used for these purposes. First-offense harassment charges are typically Class B misdemeanors with up to 6 months in county jail. Second offenses are Class A misdemeanors, punishable by up to a year in jail. If the victim is under 13 and the sender is at least 16, it becomes a felony, with second violations requiring minimum 14 days jail or 240 hours community service.	['What is Harassment?\nHarassing conduct in Illinois is knowing conduct which is not necessary to accomplish a purpose that is reasonable under the circumstances that would cause a reasonable person emotional distress and does indeed cause emotional distress to another. Generally, it is conduct which is intentionally directed at someone and annoys, threatens, intimidates, alarms or puts that person in fear of their safety.\nA person commits harassment through electronic communications when they use electronic communication for any of the following purposes (720 ILCS 5/26.5-3):\n- Making any comment, suggestion or request which is obscene with an intent to offend;\n- Interrupting, with the intent to harass, the telephone or electronic communication service of any person\n- Transmitting to any person, with the intent to harass, any file, document or communication which prevents use of the telephone or electronic communications device;\n- Transmitting or knowingly inducing a person to transmit an electronic communication for the purpose of harassing another person who is under 13 years of age, regardless of whether they consent to the harassment, if the defendant is at least 16 years of age at the time of the commission of the offense;\n- Threatening injury to the person or to the property of the person to whom an electronic communication is directed or to any of his or her family or household members; or\n- Knowingly permitting any electronic communications device to be sued for any of the purposes mentioned above.\nElectronic Communications may encompass any transfer of signs, signals, writings, images, sounds, data by wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectric or photo-optical systems, as well as communications by telephone, cellular phone, computer, pager, emails, instant messages, text messages or voice mail.\nMost first-offense harassment charges in Illinois are Class B misdemeanors, meaning that the maximum penalty is up to 6 months in the county jail. Second-offense harassment charges are generally Class A misdemeanors, which can be punished by up to a year in the county jail.\nIf an individual consents to the actions above, criminal liability is negated. However, they must be 13 years old or older. Therefore, if a person is 12 years old and consents to transmission of any of the above communications, and the sender is at least 16 years old, the sender may still be charged and convicted of Harassment through Electronic Communications. It would also be raised from a misdemeanor to a felony. A second, or subsequent, violation of this law mandates a minimum jail term of 14 days or 240 hours of community service.\nThe Illinois crime of Transmission of obscene messages is defined in 720 ILCS 5/26.5-1\nThe Illinois crime of Harassment by telephone is defined by 720 ILCS 5/26.5-2\nThe Illinois crime of Harassment through electronic communications is defined by 720 ILCS 5/26.5-3\nWhat can I do if I believe that I am being Harassed?\nIf some is simply being unpleasant, you should try your best to stay away from them and avoid all communication with them. If you continually feel threatened or unsafe (if someone, your first step should be to call the police. Oftentimes, this can stop the harassing behavior. If your issue is still not resolved, you can choose to seek legal help and/or a court Order of Protection. You can contact us for a free initial consultation to determine your options.\nWhat is defamation, libel and slander?\nIf you are the victim of defamation or harassment you need to understand the law. Certain elements need to be met, and these vary based on the type of help you are seeking. There is often confusion between defamation, libel and slander. There are also differences when false statements are being made online, although courts treat defamation on the internet similar to offline defamation.\nFirst, what is Defamation?\nDefamation is an unprivileged false statement of fact which harms the reputation of a person or a company. It encompasses both libel and slander. It is any falsehood, spoken or written, that is meant to incite hate or contempt toward another party.\nSo what is libel?\nWhen defamation is in written form, such as on a website or a comment on an article, website, bulletin board, or post online, it is termed libel. This could also include negative reviews or blog posts.\nWhat is slander?\nDefamation that is not in written form falls under the label of slander. This could encompass such things as podcasts, audio files, transcribed videos, etc – it is spoken.\nCan I stop someone from spreading negative things about me?\nThere are certain elements that need to be met in order to be able to proceed with a defense against defamation.\nFirst, it will need to be proved that there was a publication to one other than the person defamed, that is understood to be concerning the person being defamed. The statement must be proven to have been made to a third party.\nWe will also have to prove that the statement is a false statement of fact. It cannot merely be an opinion. A fact can be proven to be true or false, unlike opinions. Opinions are typically not actionable as defamation. Keep in mind that merely labeling a statement as being an “opinion” does not make it so. Courts look at whether a reasonable reader or listener could understand the statement as being a proven fact or falsity – a statement of verifiable fact.\nIn addition to being false, the statement of fact must harm your reputation or the reputation of your company or business.\nThe false statement that is causing harm must be made without adequate due diligence or research into the truthfulness of the statement. Or, you can attempt to prove that the false statement of fact was made with full knowledge that it is false.\nThere is an additional requirement of proving actual “malice” if you are a celebrity or public official – you will need to prove that the person spreading the information intended to cause harm or acted with reckless disregard of the truth in making the statements. A private person claiming defamation only has to prove that the offender acted negligently – as in, a “reasonable person” would not have published the defamatory statement. A public figure will need to show that the offender published with knowledge of the falsity or in reckless disregard for the truth.\nIllinois is a Per Se State. This means that you can sue an offender without having to prove damages to your reputation or economic well-being if the defamation is inherently slanderous or libelous. For example, stating that the plaintiff is engaging in criminal activity, being a danger to people, calling into question the plaintiff’s ethics, or stating that they are engaging in sexual immorality. These are defamatory per se because the harm to the plaintiff’s reputation is inherent in the statement.\nWho are public figures?\nPublic figures are people who are actively sought to influence the resolution of a matter of public interest. This would include government employees, city attorneys, senators, presidential candidates. It also includes someone who may be a limited purpose public figure – someone who voluntarily participates in a discussion about a public controversy and has access to the media to get his or her own view across. People can become involuntary limited-purpose public figures, such as an air traffic controller on duty at the time of a fatal crash, due to their role in a major public occurrence or members of an activist group who spoke with reporters at public events. Corporations are not always public figures, they are judged by the same standards as individuals.\nIn Illinois, the standard deadline for filing a defamation lawsuit in Illinois is one year after the defamatory statement is made, according to 735 ILCS 5/13-201, which sets this deadline for the filing of any civil action seeking a remedy “for slander, libel or for publication of matter violating the right of privacy.” If you are under 18 at the time the statement was made or under a legal disability, you will have two years to file the lawsuit upon reaching the age of 18 or having the legal disability removed (735 ILCS 5/13-211). If the person who made the statement was out of state for any period of time beginning on the date the statement was made, their absence will not be counted as part of the one-year filing period. (735 ILCS 5/13-208) Illinois recognizes the Single Publication Rule for Statue of Limitations purposes.\nWhat if someone is accusing me of defaming them?\nTruth, opinion, privilege and fair reporting are viable defenses in Illinois defamation cases.\nWebsites and webmasters are not held responsible for defamatory third-party content, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\nCease and Desist Letters\nCease and desist letters are so popular because of the variety of circumstances in which they may be used, and the weight they carry with those who receive them. These letters are the best way to make a formal request for someone to stop an activity that you believe is violating your legal rights. Cease and desist letters provide a clear notice – stop your unlawful behavior or face consequences in a court of law. The most common uses for using a cease and desist letter are outlined below.\n- Stop Trademark and Copyright Infringement\n- Stop Invasions of Privacy, Stalking and Harassment\n- Stop Libel or Slander\n- Stop a Nuisance\n- Stop Breach of Contract\n- Stop Property Boundary Encroachment\n- Stop Debt Collectors\nA cease and desist letter is a “demand letter” sent to an individual or business by a third party who believes that their legal rights have been infringed. Failure to comply with a cease and desist order is punishable by the courts, although a cease and desist letter by itself is not a guarantee of a lawsuit. If you are the recipient of a cease and desist letter, an attorney can help counsel and guide your response efforts. They will analyze the demand with your position in mind in order to determine whether the claim is frivolous or legitimate. This analysis guides a response strategy, which can range from a simple response detailing your denial of claims; filing a declaratory judgment, or steering negotiations and settlement in your favor.']	['<urn:uuid:89908fb9-30d3-4e30-97f5-2c0d44f48d4f>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	29	108	1712
53	hemisphere pressure changes earth mars compare	On Earth, the Coriolis effect influences pressure systems, creating clockwise rotation in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Mars experiences more dramatic pressure changes, with global atmospheric pressure decreasing by 25% when CO2 freezes at the poles, and showing significant variations between hemispheres due to its eccentric orbit causing different solar heating patterns in northern versus southern summers.	"['The Coriolis effect was named for 19th-century mathematician Gustave Coriolis. It is about the objects traveling across the face of the earth due to this constant eastward rotation. If you tried to throw a baseball from the equator up to your friend standing at the North Pole, your ball would appear to veer to the right. Because it would maintain the greater momentum of the place it started from.\nOn the other hand, if you were throwing the ball to the South Pole from the equator, the ball would appear to veer to the left for the same reason. So although the Coriolis effect is a thing, applying this principle to draining water in Earth’s two hemispheres is bunk.\nCoriolis effect does, however, influence slower, moving fluids, global air, and ocean currents, which can end up giving hurricanes their spin. It would be different if there didn’t rotate on its axis, among many unpleasant things. It would be that winds wouldn’t blow either west or east.\nThey’d flow from the poles, naturally high-pressure areas, to the equator, where there’s low pressure, and back again. The Coriolis effect deflects these winds from the right in the northern hemisphere to the left in the southern hemisphere. It creates weather systems that rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the south. Coriolis effect working at that scale does affect entire climate patterns.\nWhat is the Coriolis effect?\nThe Coriolis effect happens when a mass moving in a rotating system experiences a Coriolis force. It acts perpendicular to the direction of the motion and the axis of rotation on earth. The effect tends to deflect moving objects to delight the northern and the left in this southern hemisphere.\nCoriolis force is experienced due to the earth’s rotation on its axis. This force is experienced by living and non-living organisms on the planet, air mass, and floating clouds in the atmosphere. Coriolis force is minimal compared to the other daily occurrence forces and can only be noticed for large bodies’ large displacements.\nThe westerlies are the winds in the temperate region going from the subtropical belt towards the poles. Similarly, the temperate region has westerlies in the southern hemisphere, whereas the southeasterly trade winds are in the subtropical zone.\nCoriolis effect on wind\nCoriolis effect does create hurricanes and is why Jupiter’s Great Red Spot is spinning the way it is. So, what is the Coriolis effect? It happens when objects moving in a straight line appear to curve because of rotating. Also, it affects all kinds of things. It bends the paths of missiles and sniper shots. But how does it work, and how does it create hurricanes?\nYou’ve probably noticed that big storms spin over time. As they travel in the northern hemisphere, they spend counterclockwise. But watching a storm in the southern hemisphere, you’d see it spinning clockwise. Why do storms spin in different directions? It depends on their location and the effect on the Coriolis. It is a phenomenon that causes fluids (water and air) to curve. Here’s the basic idea as they travel across or above Earth’s surface.\nEarth is constantly spinning around its axis from west to east. Earth is a sphere and wider in the middle. So points on the equator spin faster around the axis than points near the poles. Imagine you were standing in Texas with a magic paper airplane that could travel hundreds of miles. If you threw your airplane directly northward, you might think it would land straight north, maybe somewhere in Nebraska.\nBut Texas is spinning around Earth’s axis faster than Nebraska is because it’s closer to the equator. It means that the paper airplane is spinning faster as well. When you throw it, that spinning momentum is conserved. So if you throw your paper airplane in a straight line toward the North, it would land somewhere to Nebraska’s right, maybe in Delaware.\nFrom your perspective in Texas, the plane would have taken a curved path to the right. The opposite would happen in the southern hemisphere. An object traveling from the equator to the South would get deflected to the left. So what does this have to do with hurricane spinning? At the center of every hurricane is an area of very low pressure.\nAs a result, the high-pressure air surrounding the center or eye of a storm constantly rushes toward the low-pressure void in the middle. But because of the Coriolis effect, the air rushing toward the center is deflected.\nIn the northern hemisphere, the air volumes on all sides keep getting tugged slightly to the right. The air keeps trying to make its way to the middle and deflected, causing the entire system to spin counterclockwise. The opposite happens in the southern hemisphere, where the Coriolis effect pulls air to the left. Storms wind spins around the eye in a clockwise manner.\nWe’ve got a high-pressure system and a low-pressure system on this diagram. We would assume that the wind would go from the high-pressure system to the low-pressure one. The motion causes that wind to curve to the right, at least in the northern hemisphere.\nIt’ll curve to the left in the southern hemisphere with that little cooper to the right. The wind appears to curve due to the earth’s rotation. That’s why this curve happens. The wind will move towards the greater equator tends to be a lower pressure area.\nCoriolis equation: The Coriolis acceleration forms Coriolis force. Suppose someone inside the rotating non-inertial frame, causing the Coriolis force, the Coriolis acceleration. This equation gives it:\nCoriolis acceleration = 2ωv, Where ω is angular velocity & v is the perpendicular velocity for the rotation axis.\nAlso, the Coriolis force is a fictitious force that exists and acts on objects inside non-inertial reference frames.\nCoriolis effect refers to the way the Earth’s constant eastward rotation. The diameter of the earth of the Equator at 40,076 kilometers. It is so much greater than at the poles at zero kilometers. The Equator’s land is moving lots faster than the land everywhere else, about 1638 km/h at the equator compared to about half that at 60 degrees north latitude and pretty much stationary at the poles.\nRead more similar topics:\nRobert Ehrlich.

Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.\nMarion, Jerry B. Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems, Academic Press.', 'Mike Caplinger, Malin Space Science Systems September 1994\nAnnual changes in temperature on a planet are caused by a combination of two factors: axial tilt and variable distance from the Sun. On Earth, axial tilt determines nearly all of the annual variation, because Earth\'s orbit is nearly circular. But Mars has the highest orbital eccentricity of any planet except Mercury and Pluto; the distance from the Sun to Mars varies from 1.64 AU to 1.36 AU over a martian year. This large variation, combined with an axial tilt slightly greater than Earth\'s, gives rise to seasonal changes far greater than those we experience even in the coldest areas on our own planet.\nThe temperature of a location on a planet is largely determined by the amount of sunlight falling on that location. If planets had no axial tilt, then the temperature would be greatest at the equator, where sunlight falls most directly, and would drop towards the poles. However, if the planet has axial tilt, the angle at which sunlight falls on a point will change throughout the year. For example, the poles will be in darkness for half the year, and in sunlight the other half.\nThe effect of the axial tilt of Mars can be seen in the following image. The topmost image shows the vernal equinox, or start of spring in the northern hemisphere, when the sun falls directly at the equator. On the left is the summer solstice, when the pole is in sunlight during the entire day. At the bottom is the autumnal equinox, when the sun again falls directly at the equator, and finally on the right is the winter solstice, when the north pole is in continuous darkness.\nNote that the solstices and equinoxes are named for the seasons in the northern hemisphere; conditions are reversed in the southern hemisphere. Scientists studying seasonal changes on Mars often use the solar longitude (also known as L sub s or Ls), to indicate the season. Ls is the angle from the Mars-Sun line to the Mars-Sun line at the vernal equinox, so at the vernal equinox, Ls is 0. For example, at the summer solstice, Ls is 90, and at the winter solstice, Ls is 270.\nAnnual variations, such as the growing and shrinking of the polar caps, have been observed from Earth for hundreds of years, although it was not until spacecraft visited the Red Planet that it was recognized that these variable caps are not composed of water, but of carbon dioxide (CO2) frost. During the polar darkness, temperatures drop below the point at which CO2, the primary constituent of the martian atmosphere, turns from a gas to a solid. So much carbon dioxide freezes out of the atmosphere that the global atmospheric pressure decreases by 25%.\nWe can see this variation in measurements taken by Viking Lander 1. This table, of average atmospheric pressure over the course of three martian years, shows that the pressure at VL1 changes from less than 7 millibars (mb) to almost 9 millibars over a year.\nday of year pressure (mb) ---- -------- 0 8.0 57 8.25 114 8.4 172 7.75 229 7.0 286 6.9 343 7.25 400 8.0 458 8.8 515 8.9 572 8.5 629 8.0\nThe atmospheric pressure is controlled by a complex balance between the cold and warm pole. When the south pole is in total darkness, the north pole is experiencing continuous sunlight, so we might expect that the pressure would stay roughly constant over the year, as CO2 vaporized at one pole only to freeze at the other. However, remember the eccentricity of Mars\' orbit -- this causes the solar input when one pole is in sunlight to be significantly different than that when the other pole is in sunlight. We can plot the solar input, or insolation, as a function of time in the martian year (horizontal axis, with the start of northern spring at the left) vs. latitude (vertical axis, with the south pole at the bottom.) Blue indicates the least insolation, and red the most.\nInsolation at noon\nPressure at VL1\nNote that the insolation image shows that summer in the southern hemisphere is much warmer than summer in the northern hemisphere, because Mars is farther from the Sun during northern summer. (In contrast, the eccentricity of Earth\'s orbit is low, and although Earth is actually closer to the Sun during northern winter, the effect of the small variation in solar distance is not noticable.)\nBelow the insolation plot, we have plotted the pressure at VL1 as a smooth curve. Note that it reaches a maximum during southern spring and summer, has its deepest minimum near the end of southern winter, and has a smaller minimum at the start of northern spring.\nIn 1977, Viking Orbiter 2 acquired sporadic coverage of the recession of the southern polar cap. Using software developed for Mars Observer Camera (MOC) mission planning, I took 300 VO2 images and constructed the following crude ""movie"" of the cap shrinking. (Unfortunately, variability in lighting and resolution caused by the eccentricity of VO2\'s orbit, and the use of different filters and exposure times, make the quality of these mosaics rather poor. In 1998, we hope to make a one-frame-per-day movie of the cap recession, in color and with uniform resolution and brightness, using MOC2 data from Mars Global Surveyor.)\nOrbit 142 Ls 183.1 1/9/1977\nOrbit 161 Ls 195.2 1/30/1977\nOrbit 163 Ls 196.5 2/7/1977\nOrbit 241 Ls 247.0 4/24/1977\nOrbit 267 Ls 262.2 5/19/1977\nOrbit 287 Ls 274.5 6/7/1977\nOrbit 292 Ls 277.5 6/11/1977\nOrbit 313 Ls 289.7 7/1/1977\nOrbit 335 Ls 302.2 7/22/1977\nOrbit 348 Ls 306\nOrbit 352 Ls 311.8 8/7/1977\nOrbit 402 Ls 338.2 9/23/1977Mike Caplinger (email@example.com)']"	['<urn:uuid:c62243ad-44b5-469b-9ae1-ff2b70fc20c6>', '<urn:uuid:7c215132-77c7-4b2e-871d-d915576b7f9c>']	factoid	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	6	61	2038
54	How does the way modern humans distribute nutrients in ecosystems differ from how prehistoric megafauna did it?	While prehistoric megafauna would disperse nutrients widely, humans concentrate them. Humans spread fertilizer on small plots of productive farmland and keep large animals like cows fenced rather than letting them roam freely. This results in more nutrients overall, but they are very poorly distributed.	['It’s not just humans that still feel the effects of a trauma many years later: ecosystems do too. Thousands of years after human hunters wiped out big land animals like giant ground sloths, the ecosystems they lived in are still feeling the effects.\nMany ecosystems rely on big animals to supply them with nutrients, mostly from dung. “If you remove the big animals from an ecosystem, you pretty much stop nutrients moving,” says Chris Doughty of the University of Oxford.\nDoughty and colleagues simulated the distribution of phosphorus, a nutrient that plants need to grow, in the Amazon basin in South America. This area was once home to spectacularly large animals, including the elephant-like gomphotheres and giant ground sloths.\nBut 12,500 years ago, around the time humans moved into South America, these huge animals all died out, hit by a double whammy of being hunted and a changing climate. Nowadays the Amazon is still home to a huge diversity of animals. “But these extinctions cut out all the big animals,” says Doughty.\nIt seems the mass extinction had a profound effect on how phosphorus is spread around the Amazon basin. Nutrients are released when rocks are eroded, and then get distributed onto flood plains by rivers. In South America, the most phosphorus-rich soils are found near the Andes mountain chain in the west, and the rivers flowing from it – especially the Amazon.\nUsing the relationship between animal size and nutrient distribution seen in living animals as a guide, Doughty estimated how much phosphorus South America’s larger extinct animals would have transported 15,000 years ago, before they started to decline.\nThe model suggests that megafauna would have spread nutrients 50 times further in the same time than animals today do. Or to put it another way, killing off the massive animals reduced the movement of nutrients by 98 per cent. This is because big animals carry a disproportionately large amount compared with small animals as they travel further in search of food, and keep that food in their guts for longer.\nDoughty compares big animals to the arteries that carry blood around the human body. “When you get rid of big animals, it’s like severing the nutrient arteries.” He thinks the same thing happened in North America, Europe and Australia, where most big animals have also been wiped out.\n“The idea that herbivores redistribute nutrients is not new, but the scale of this thinking is much, much bigger,” says Tim Baker at the University of Leeds in the UK.\nIf Doughty is right, the Amazon is still changing in response to the extinction. He estimates the spread of nutrients will keep getting patchier for another 17,000 years, although the effect will likely be dwarfed by the impacts of deforestation and climate change in the short term.\nIn the absence of massive herbivores, humans now dominate the movement of nutrients. But we do the opposite of what the lost animals did. “These megafauna would disperse nutrients, whereas humans concentrate them,” says Doughty. We spread fertiliser on small plots of productive farmland, and keep large animals like cows fenced rather than letting them roam freely. “There are probably more nutrients because of people, but they are very poorly distributed.”\nIn a separate study, the team estimates how much large animals help to spread nutrients around in Kruger National Park in South Africa. The park is divided into a nutrient-rich basalt area and a nutrient-poor granite zone, but elephants and rhinos transfer nutrients between the two, helping plant growth in the granite zone. Wiping out these animals would have a severe effect. “You would see nutrient distribution drop by about 50 per cent,” say Doughty.']	['<urn:uuid:ba475b1f-a571-4315-ac32-0edabe5a7844>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	17	44	612
55	earliest photographs storage glass plates copper popularity durability white haze issues	Early photography began with Daguerreotypes on silver-coated copper plates in 1839, followed by ambrotypes on glass in the mid-1850s. While most Daguerreotypes have proven very stable when properly housed, some have developed concerning white haze deterioration, particularly evident in Southworth and Hawes plates that were stored unsealed and later preserved with buffered materials containing calcium carbonate.	"[""by Jeremy Rowe\nWhen people think about Ephemera, they typically think of paper – paper to which information has been added. Manuscripts are paper to which pencil or ink has been added. Trade cards, newspapers, bill and letterheads, menus and broadsides are paper to which ink has been added. Many, but not all photographs are paper to which a light sensitive emulsion has been added.\nPhotographs are clearly recognized as Ephemera. Though in numbers, most photographs consist of paper and emulsion, popular photography began with images on silver coated copper plates – the Daguerreotype – that was publically announced in 1839. Other non-paper processes were popular during the 19th and early 20th century. The ambrotype – a collodion photographic emulsion on glass – gained popularity in the mid 1850s, as did a less costly variant on japanned metal – the ferrotype or tintype.\nAlthough alternative paper based photographic processes, including salted paper and calotypes, paralleled the Daguerreotype, paper photographs didn’t begin to rival the popularity of other processes in popularity into the mid 1850s with the introduction of the collodion wet plate negative and albumen printing processes. Initial popularity of the 2 ½” X 4” (6.35 X 10.16cm) cartes-de-visite (CDV), or visiting card photo, and later the 4” X6 ½” (10.16 X 16.5 cm) cabinet card, along with larger format images became the formats of choice for photographers, who produced millions of paper images as the popularity of the daguerreotype and ambrotype waned. However, the tintype continued its popularity into the 20th century, largely due to its low cost and convenience.\nResearchers interested in unraveling the information about a given photograph can take advantage of a number of embedded clues.\nSpecific photographic formats were popular during relatively limited periods of time and elements that changed can help date an image. The style of mat and case of the Daguerreotype, ambrotype and early tintypes offer clues. Occasionally written material or handwritten notes can be found in the case behind the image.\nCard mounted photographs from the 19th and early 20th century, such as cartes-de-visites, cabinet cards and stereographs can be generally dated by their format and mount type. Printed mount notations such as photographer's identification and title are fairly reliable, but can still provide false information.\nDating by mount type and style provides a rough indicator for identifying images. The caveat is that many photographers, particularly in more remote areas, failed to keep up to photographic fashion and used old mounts until their stocks were exhausted. Also, photographers reprinted historically or commercially important images long after they were originally taken. Also, negatives were often sold or copied and the mount information may not accurately reflect the history of the images. For example, D. P. Flanders views of Prescott, Arizona Territory taken in the Spring of 1874 appear on Williscraft mounts in the late 1870s, and Continent mounts into the mid 1880s.\nNotations on the mounts can occasionally provide additional information about the image, but should always be verified by other sources before being relied upon. Handwritten notations are the most suspect, often being added long after the image was made by persons with only secondary knowledge.\nGuide for Dating Card Mounted Photographs\nAbout the Author\nDr. Jeremy Rowe is currently a Senior Research Scientist at New York University.

Of course this is disconcerting for collectors and institutions that have significant investment in these beautiful objects. The author implies that degradation surrounding some Southworth and Hawes daguerreotypes in the Young America exhibition can be applied to all daguerreotypes when he writes “The vanishing images suggested that any daguerreotype could spontaneously crumble.” This sky-is-falling statement in my opinion does not represent the majority of daguerreotypes.\nLets review this issue.\nApproximately 160 Southworth and Hawes daguerreotypes were exhibited over two years at three institutions. Five plates changed significantly with an obscuring white haze, and supposedly 25 plates changed slightly. The majority of the plates did not change at all.\nFrom personal experience I can tell you that I have 19th century daguerreotypes as well as my own daguerreotypes that have been on continuous display on my studio for 10+ years with no sign of change. This is my argument against the claim that daguerreotypes are light sensitive.\nWhat every collector or institution must know is Southworth and Hawes plates have a very unique storage history contrary to the norm. The great majority of S&H images that remain were plates retained by the studio stored completely unsealed in plate boxes. They were sold in this condition through Holman’s bookshop in the 1930’s. and early 40’s. As they migrated to private collectors and institutions they were sealed using what were thought of at the time to be proper conservation materials. A typical preservation package used by the George Eastman House from the mid-1970’s to 1999 consisted of 4-ply buffered board with a paper binding tape, and a buffered die cut paper mat separating the plate from the glass. The buffering agent is 3% calcium carbonate to provide an alkali reserve of ph 8.5.\nA significant case in point. In 1999, a trove of Southworth and Hawes daguerreotypes were discovered in the garage of David Feigenbaum after his death. A team of conservation professionals from the George Eastman House were asked to prepare the plates for auction at Sotheby’s. Over 200 plates were housed in the materials described above. A collector who purchased a Southworth and Hawes daguerreotype from the David Feigenbaum sale brought it to me to replace the conservation housing with an 19th century brass mat, preserver and case. I retained the die-cut buffered mat and backing board. Soon after, I made a daguerreotype that I felt wasn’t good enough to frame in my own passe-partout housing design, but I wanted to preserve it as I had made it in collaboration with my friend Irv Pobboravsky. I placed the daguerreotype behind glass using the die-cut mat I retained from the Feigenbaum sale held together with spring clips and placed it in a zip-lock back. It was stored in the dark for approximately four years. It now has a very definite obscuring white haze adjacent to the mat. While this is not a scientific experiment, it does provide a significant observation and cause to question if the housing materials are contributing to the deterioration of the plates.\nI have experienced the “white haze” phenomena on other of my contemporary images as well as on 19th century images that have been in contact with buffered board. What is good for the conservation of paper, ie alkaline buffering, is not necessarily good for daguerreotypes.\nIn reviewing the conservation efforts for the Young America Exhibition I learned that plates were not removed from their buffered mat board and die cut preservation packages. These were placed intact into extremely well sealed secondary housings incorporating shallow copper pans to act as pollutant scavengers. A complete overview of the conservation for this exhibition can be found here.\nIf the buffered materials are a co-factor in the formation of “white-haze” deterioration it would explain why even with the best intentioned conservation, some plates still changed during exhibition. A questionable environment was enclosed within a stable one.\nThis remains to be explored and I hope to soon analyze the plate and mat from my example. I present this scenario as a possible alternative and/or co-factor to the silver-chloride scenario presented in the Scientific American article.\nIn closing, I would say that daguerreotypes are among the most stable of photographic objects providing the housings are intact to prevent atmospheric pollutants from reacting with the silver surface and that the housings themselves are not contributing to the problem. The nature of the mechanism of deterioration particular to a small percentage of Southworth and Hawes daguerreotypes is not yet fully understood. The findings reported in the Scientific American article should not prevent us from exhibiting, collecting or enjoying these amazing photographs. It is prudent, as has been shown by the Young America exhibition, to accurately document any daguerreotype intended for exhibition and carefully monitor it at regular intervals to note any changes.\nPresident of the Daguerreian Society\nThis certainly adds a new wrinkle to the previous Scientific American article. It also goes to show that just because an article comes from a reputable source does not necessarily mean it is accurate. My bad. This bears further following, and I will post updates as I find them.

The legend states that a Berber chieftain told her she could have as much land as an ox hide would cover; Dido cleverly cut a single ox hide into thin strips and lay them end-to-end around the Byrsa hill, successfully claiming it for her people.	"[""Carthage was a Phoenician city-state on the coast of North Africa (the site of modern-day Tunisia) which, prior the conflict with Rome known as the Punic Wars (264-146 BCE), was the largest, most affluent, and powerful political entity in the Mediterranean. The city was originally known as Kart-hadasht (new city) to distinguish it from the older Phoenician city of Utica nearby. The Greeks called the city Karchedon and the Romans turned this name into Carthago.\nIt was founded c. 814 BCE by the legendary Phoenician queen Dido, increased in size after an influx of refugees from the city of Tyre following Alexander the Great’s conquests of 332 BCE, and afterwards expanded until it was the seat of the Carthaginian Empire with colonies (such as Sabratha) along the North African coast, in Sicily, Spain, and elsewhere; these would all be lost following the Punic Wars which elevated Rome to Carthage’s former position as the greatest Mediterranean power.\nThe history of the ancient city is usually divided into five periods:\n- Ancient Carthage (Punic Republic) – c. 814-146 BCE\n- Roman Carthage – 146 BCE - 439 CE\n- Vandal Carthage – 439-534 CE\n- Byzantine Carthage (Exarchate of Africa) – 534-698 CE\n- Muslim Arab Carthage (Islamic Carthage) – 698-1270 CE\nOwing to limitations of space, this article will primarily deal with Ancient Carthage/the Punic Republic.\nIn 698 CE, the city was conquered during the Muslim Arab invasion of North Africa and destroyed. It would be rebuilt, though on a modest scale compared with the city at its height, until it was completely destroyed under the reign of Muhammad I al-Mustansir (r. 1228-1277 CE) after defeating the European Christian invasion of the Eighth Crusade of 1270 CE. The site would continue to be inhabited, though the ancient ruins were neglected until the 1830s CE when modern excavations began.\nFoundation & Expansion\nAccording to legend, Carthage was founded by the Phoenician Queen Elissa (better known as Dido) c. 814 BCE; although Dido's historicity has been challenged, the founding does date to about this time. Dido was allegedly fleeing the tyranny of her brother Pygmalion of Lebanon, landed on the coast of North Africa, and established the city on the high hill later known as the Byrsa. The legend claims that the Berber chieftain who controlled the region told her she could have as much land as an ox hide would cover; Dido cut a single ox hide into thin strips and lay them end-to-end around the hill, successfully claiming it for her people.\nDido’s reign is described by the Roman poet Virgil (l. 70-19 BCE), and others, as impressive, noting how the city grew from the small community on the hill to a grand metropolis. This account, and others like it, are legendary but Carthage, which seems to initially have been a minor port on the coast where Phoenician traders stopped to resupply or repair their ships, was clearly a major center of trade by the 4th century BCE.\nThe city developed significantly following Alexander's destruction of the great industrial and trade center of Tyre (considered Carthage’s mother-city) in 332 BCE when Phoenician refugees fled from there to Carthage. These Tyrians arrived with whatever wealth they had and, since many whom Alexander spared were those rich enough to buy their lives, they landed in the city with considerable means which established Carthage as the new center of Phoenician trade.\nThe Carthaginians then established a working relationship with the tribes known as the Masaesyli and the Massylii of the North African Berber (Imazighen) Kingdom of Numidia who would fill the ranks of their military, primarily as formidable cavalry troops. From a small town on the coast, the city grew in size and grandeur with enormous estates covering miles of acreage. Carthage quickly became the richest and most powerful city in the Mediterranean.\nCarthaginian government, formerly a monarchy, was a republic based on meritocracy (rule of the elite) by the 4th century BCE. The top position was held by two elected magistrates known as suffetes (“judges”) who governed in conjunction with a senate of between 200-300 members who held the position for life. Laws were passed by an assembly of citizens who would vote on measures proposed by the suffetes and senate. The aristocrats lived in palaces, the less affluent in modest but attractive homes, and the lower classes in apartments or huts outside the city.\nTribute and tariffs regularly increased the city’s wealth on top of the lucrative business in maritime trade. The city’s harbors were immense, with 220 docks, and gleaming columns which rose around it in a half-circle, in front of towering arches and buildings ornamented with Greek sculpture. There were two harbors, one for trade and the other for warships, which operated constantly in resupplying, repairing, and outfitting vessels. The Carthaginian trading ships sailed daily to ports all around the Mediterranean Sea while their navy, supreme in the region, kept them safe and, also, opened new territories for trade and resources through conquest as the Carthaginians built their empire.\nThe city had four residential sections, which grew up around the citadel of the Byrsa in the center, and was surrounded by walls which stretched 23 miles (37 kilometers) in length from the harbors inland. The city had all the accommodations and refinements of any great ancient city – a theater for entertainment, temples for religious observances, a necropolis, an agora (marketplace) – but on a much grander scale. Its patron deity was the goddess of love and fertility, Tanit who was worshipped alongside her consort Baal-Hamon. It is possible that children were sacrificed to Tanit in the sacred precinct known as the Tophet, but this claim has been challenged, and it is equally likely that the Tophet of Carthage was simply a necropolis reserved for infants and the young.\nAffluence & Invasion\nThe city’s wealth was due not only to its advantageous position on the North African coast, from which it could control sea traffic between itself and its colony on Sicily, but also to the people’s skill in agriculture. The writer Mago of Carthage (dates unknown) wrote a work of 28 volumes devoted to agriculture and veterinarian science which was considered the most comprehensive on the subject of its time and reflects the Carthaginian’s intense interest in farming and animal husbandry. Mago’s works were considered so important that they were among the few that would be spared by the Romans after Carthage’s final defeat in 146 BCE. Roman references to the books are now all that remain of them.\nThe Carthaginians planted fruit trees, grapes, olive trees, and vegetables in a ring of gardens irrigated by small canals and then expanded their cultivation outward beyond the city walls to fields of grains. The fertility of the land, and their expertise in cultivation, increased the city’s wealth through trade with the interior as well as maritime trade elsewhere as Carthage continued to flourish.\nIt was this expansion that first brought Carthage into conflict with others. In 310-307 BCE, North Africa was invaded by Agathocles of Syracuse (r. 317-289 BCE) who sought to subdue Carthage and use her wealth to fund his wars. Agathocles was able to feed his army easily off the land because the crops grew in such abundance. He was only defeated because the Libyans and Berbers, who worked the land, sided with the Carthaginians who had treated them well. Agathocles was driven from North Africa and Carthage continued to prosper until it became involved in a conflict with Rome, then just a small city-state on the Tiber River in Italy, in 264 BCE.\nThe Punic Wars\nControl of Sicily was divided between Rome and Carthage who supported opposing factions on the island which quickly brought both parties into conflict directly with each other. These conflicts would be known as the Punic Wars from the Phoenician word for the citizens of Carthage (given in Greek as Phoinix and in Latin as Punicus). When Rome was weaker than Carthage, they posed no threat. The Carthaginian navy had long been able to enforce the treaty which kept the Roman Republic from trading in the western Mediterranean. When the First Punic War (264-241 BCE) began, however, Rome proved far more resourceful than Carthage could have imagined.\nThough they had no navy and knew nothing of fighting on the sea, Rome quickly built 330 ships which they equipped with clever ramps and gangways (the corvus) which could be lowered onto an enemy ship and secured; thus turning a sea battle into a land battle. After an initial struggle with military tactics, Rome won a series of victories and finally defeated Carthage in 241 BCE. Carthage was forced to cede Sicily to Rome and pay a heavy war indemnity.\nFollowing this war, Carthage became embroiled in what is known as The Mercenary War (241-237 BCE) which started when the Carthaginian army of mercenaries demanded the payment Carthage owed them. This war was finally won by Carthage through the efforts of the general Hamilcar Barca (l. c. 285 - c. 228 BCE), father of the famous Hannibal Barca (l. 247-183 BCE) of the Second Punic War.\nCarthage suffered greatly from the First Punic and Mercenary War and, when Rome occupied the Carthaginian colonies of Sardinia and Corsica, there was nothing the Carthaginians could do about it. They tried to make the best of their situation by expanding holdings in Spain but again went to war with Rome when Hannibal attacked the city of Saguntum, an ally of Rome in Spain, in 218 BCE.\nThe Second Punic War (218-202 BCE) was fought largely in northern Italy as Hannibal invaded Italy from Spain by marching his forces over the Alps. Hannibal won every engagement against the Romans in Italy. In 216 BCE he won his greatest victory at the Battle of Cannae but, lacking sufficient troops and supplies, could not build on his successes. He was finally drawn from Italy and defeated by the Roman general Scipio Africanus (l. 236-183 BCE) at the Battle of Zama, in North Africa, in 202 BCE and Carthage again sued for peace.\nPlaced, again, under a heavy war indemnity by Rome, Carthage struggled to pay their debt while also trying to fend off incursions from neighboring Numidia under the king Masinissa (r. c. 202-148 BCE). Masinissa had been Rome's ally in the Second Punic War and was encouraged by Rome to raid Carthaginian territory at will. Carthage went to war against Numidia and, in so doing, broke the peace treaty with Rome which forbid Carthage from mobilizing an army.\nCarthage felt it had no choice but to defend itself against Masinissa's invasions but was censured by Rome and ordered to pay a new war debt to Numidia. Having only recently paid off their debt to Rome, they now owed a new crippling war debt. Rome was not concerned with whatever conflict Carthage and Numidia were involved in but did not care for the sudden revitalization of the Carthaginian military.\nCarthage believed that their treaty with Rome was ended when their war debt was paid; Rome disagreed. The Romans felt that Carthage was still obliged to bend to Roman will; so much so that the Roman Senator Cato the Elder ended all of his speeches, no matter what the subject, with the phrase, “Further, I think that Carthage must be destroyed.” In 149 BCE, Rome decided upon just that course of action.\nA Roman embassy to Carthage presented a list of demands which included the stipulation that Carthage be dismantled and then rebuilt further inland, thus negating the long-recognized advantage it had in trade from its position on the coast. The Carthaginians, understandably, refused to do so and the Third Punic War (149-146 BCE) began.\nThe Roman general Scipio Aemilianus (l. 185-129 BCE) besieged Carthage for three years until it fell. After sacking the city, the Romans burned it to the ground, leaving not one stone on top of another. A modern myth has grown up that the Roman forces then sowed the ruins with salt so nothing would ever grow there again but this claim has no basis in fact. It is said that Scipio Aemilianus wept when he ordered the destruction of the city and behaved virtuously toward the survivors of the siege.\nUtica now became the capital of Rome’s African provinces and Carthage lay in ruin until 122 BCE when Gaius Sempronius Gracchus (l. 154-121 BCE) the Roman tribune, founded a small colony there. Gaius’ political problems, and the memory of the Punic wars still being too fresh, however, caused the colony to fail. Julius Caesar proposed and planned the rebuilding of Carthage and, five years after his death, Carthage rose again. Power now shifted from Utica back to Carthage – which became Rome’s breadbasket owing to the same agricultural success which had enriched it before - and it remained an important Roman colony until it fell to the Vandals under their king Gaiseric (r. 428-478 CE) in 439 CE.\nCarthage had risen in prominence as Christianity grew and Augustine of Hippo (St. Augustine, l. 354-430 CE) contributed to its prestige by living and teaching there. The city was considered so illustrious, in fact, that the Council of Carthage of 397 CE was held there; the series of synods which would confirm the biblical canon for the Western Church, legitimizing the narratives which would come to be known as the Bible. The Vandal invasion of North Africa did nothing to halt Christianity’s development there, but tensions would rise between the Arian Christians (the Vandals primarily) and Trinitarian Christians just as they did elsewhere.\nThe Vandals under Gaiseric took full advantage of the location of their new city and plundered passing ships at will while also raiding coastal cities. Roman attempts to dislodge them failed and so a treaty was signed in 442 CE between Gaiseric and Valentinian III (r. 425-455 CE) acknowledging the Vandal Kingdom of North Africa as a legitimate political entity and establishing peaceful relations. When Valentinian III was assassinated in 455 CE, however, Gaiseric disregarded the treaty, believing it was an agreement only between himself and the emperor, and sailed for Rome. He looted the city but, in accordance with the request of Pope Leo I (served 440-461 CE), did not damage it nor harm the populace. The Vandals would continue to hold Carthage, and profit from its location, until after Gaiseric’s death.\nThe later Vandal king Gelimer (r. 530-534 CE), an Arian Christian, reinstituted the persecution of Trinitarian Christians which enraged the Eastern Roman emperor Justinian I (r. 527-565 CE), a trinitarian, who sent his great general Belisarius (l. 505-565 CE) to North Africa. Belisarius won the short-lived Vandalic War (533-534 CE), brought Gelimer back to Constantinople in chains, and restored Carthage to the Byzantine Empire (330-1453 CE) under which it continued to flourish.\nUnder the Byzantines, Carthage prospered through trade and as a major source of grain for the Eastern Roman Empire (the Western Roman Empire having fallen c. 476 CE). Around 585 CE, Carthage became the seat of the Exarchate of Africa under the Byzantine emperor Maurice (r. 582-602 CE), a separate administrative region established for more effective rule of the western areas of the empire.\nIn 698 CE, the Muslims defeated the Byzantine forces at the Battle of Carthage, destroyed the city completely, and drove the Byzantines from Africa. They then fortified and developed the neighboring city of Tunis and established it as the new center for trade and governorship of the region. Under the Arab Muslims, Tunis fared better than Carthage, but the city continued to thrive until the Eighth Crusade of 1270 CE when it was taken by the European Crusaders who fortified the citadel of the Byrsa. Once they were defeated, Muhammad I al-Mustansir had the city’s defenses torn down and many of the buildings razed to prevent any further such occupation.\nThe site of the ancient city continued to be inhabited and was included in the region taken by the Ottoman Empire (1299-1922 CE) who had no interest in excavating the ruins. The stones of the fallen houses, temples, and walls were carried off for personal or administrative building projects or left where they had been found. Modern archaeological excavation began in the 1830s CE through the efforts of the Danish consulate and continued under the French between c. 1860-1900 CE.\nFurther work at the site was undertaken throughout the first part of the 20th century CE but, as at Sabratha and other sites, the archaeologists were more interested in the Roman history of Carthage. The political and cultural zeitgeist of the time defined the Carthaginians, who were Semites, as a people of little value, and anti-Semitism significantly influenced not only the interpretation of physical evidence but the choice of what was kept for placement in museums or discarded.\nThe history of the period of Ancient Carthage, therefore, suffered as much from these modern-day excavations as from the city’s destruction by Rome or later conflicts. It was not until after World War II that systematic, unbiased, work at Carthage would begin; a paradigm consistent with the excavation and interpretation of many other ancient sites.\nCarthage still lies in ruin in modern-day Tunisia and remains an important tourist attraction and archaeological site. The outline of the great harbor can still be seen as well as the ruins of the homes, public baths, temples, and palaces from the time when the city of Carthage ruled the Mediterranean as the most opulent jewel of the North African coast.""]"	['<urn:uuid:98ea1cde-1a21-4563-a4c6-88da15ad2cb2>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	5	68	2918
57	What role do metadata and systematic organization play in preserving cultural manuscripts, and how does this affect their accessibility for research?	Metadata plays a crucial role as it can be a key factor in using digital representations most fruitfully, as demonstrated in the case of tracking Otto Ege's dispersed medieval manuscript leaves, where details about leaf size and provenance are essential. Regarding systematic organization, libraries can enhance understanding by digitizing specific categories systematically, such as the University of Manchester's approach of digitizing Middle English manuscripts to create a coherent corpus for extended study. The organization system affects accessibility through various finding aids, catalogues, and reference systems, with some manuscripts requiring multiple search strategies and catalogues to locate specific content.	"[""Gaelic manuscripts in the National Library of Scotland\nFull treatise image and details\nGaelic manuscripts held in the National Library of Scotland date from the Middle Ages to the present time. The older manuscripts form the largest collection of late medieval Scottish Gaelic manuscripts in the world.\nOur range of modern Gaelic manuscripts continues to grow as we add archives of literary authors and cultural institutions to the national collection.\nYou can consult all our Gaelic manuscripts in the Manuscripts Reading Room in our building on George IV Bridge. See the Special Collections Reading Room pages for details.\nOn this page\nThe beginnings of the Gaelic manuscript collections\nView 'Forus feasa ar Eirinn' page\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries only seven Gaelic manuscripts made their way into the Advocates Library, the predecessor of the National Library of Scotland. Four of these were unsolicited donations, the remaining three were bought in one lot from a financially troubled printer and bookseller.\nBut in the later 18th century, James Macpherson's Ossianic poetry sparked a new interest in Gaelic traditions. Greater efforts were beginning to be made to collect and preserve the written heritage. The 19th century therefore saw a significant expansion of our Gaelic manuscript holdings. The following collections were deposited:\n- Highland Society of London: collection of Gaelic manuscripts\n- Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland: collection of Gaelic manuscripts and society archive\n- MacLachlan of Kilbride manuscripts\n- John Francis Campbell of Islay\n- William F Skene.\nA number of smaller private donations finally brought the number of Gaelic manuscripts up to 150 volumes.\nThe early Gaelic collections\nView medical work\npage and details\nView religious poem page\nMany of the early Gaelic manuscripts are composite volumes that contain a range of authors, subjects and dates. A large part is written in the classical language and script that was common to both Scotland and Ireland until the earlier 18th century.\nThe history of ownership of the volumes is interesting and varied and can often be traced back to members of the professional learned orders. About 17 volumes, for example, are associated with members of the Beaton family of hereditary physicians.\nThe subjects covered are those that are traditionally associated with Gaelic learning, including:\n- Poetry and song collections\n- History and genealogy\n- Tales and legends\n- Religious subjects\nAmong the highlights of the early collections are:\n- The Book of the Dean of Lismore (Adv.MS.72.1.37)\n- The 'MS 1467' (Adv.MS.72.1.1) with its famous clan genealogies.

It is arranged by subject rather than by manuscript number and uses an older Roman numbering system. Its use as a catalogue is therefore not the most straightforward, but the descriptions of the manuscripts are scholarly and still valuable. For more on the numbering systm see the 'Note on reference numbers' section and the Gaelic reference number concordance (PDF: 8 pages; 35 KB).\nYou can find one annotated copy of this catalogue with cross-references to modern reference numbers on the open shelves in the Special Collections Reading Room.

It is a two-volume work that for the first time lists our holdings under their current reference numbers, and also includes acquisitions of Gaelic manuscripts from 1925 onwards. Its descriptions are far less detailed than those of Mackinnon and Black (see below), but its arrangement is more user-friendly.\nWe keep copies at the Special Collections Reading Room.\nBlack's catalogue (unfinished)\nProfessor Ronald Black of Edinburgh University compiled the most detailed and up-to-date scholarly catalogue of the Gaelic material. It is arranged in two parts comprising 'classical' and 'vernacular' manuscripts. The criteria for this division were linguistic (Common Gaelic versus Scottish Gaelic), palaeographic (Gaelic 'corra litir' script versus non-Gaelic script) and chronological (pre-1745 versus post-1745). Although publication is still intended, this valuable catalogue remains an unfinished typescript, wanting much of the 'vernacular' part as well as the introduction and index. Contact us for further information.\nWe keep copies of the catalogue at the Special Collections Reading Room.\nSkene's scroll, 1861\nThe first list of the Gaelic manuscripts in the Library was made by William F Skene, who introduced a Roman numbering system which in 1925 was replaced by the present system. This list is of interest only with regard to the history of the collection. Skene never published it, considering it too rough and ready. Some newspaper cuttings are pasted in at the back.\nWe can issue Skene's scroll on request: quote reference number F.R.192.\nA note on reference numbers\nThe Gaelic manuscripts had originally been considered a species apart by the Advocates Library, and numbered through in Roman numerals. After the foundation of the National Library of Scotland in 1925, all manuscripts formerly in the Advocates Library were re-numbered and given the prefix 'Adv.MS.' This was done to indicate their origin and to differentiate them from manuscripts received after 1925.\nUnder this new numbering system the Gaelic manuscripts were gathered together in the sequence Adv.MS.72.1.1 to Adv.MS.73.3.23. A few individual items can be found outside this sequence, and the Campbell of Islay collection is at Adv.MS.50.1.1-50.3.5.\nAn earlier reference to 'Gaelic MS.IV' now translates into 'Adv.MS.72.1.4', but things are not always as straightforward as this! Therefore if you are following up a Roman numeral reference number, see the Gaelic reference number concordance (PDF: 8 pages; 35 KB).\nGaelic manuscripts acquired after 1925 have the same reference numbers that are commonly used throughout the manuscripts collections. They begin with the prefix 'MS.' if fully catalogued, and 'Acc.' if not yet fully catalogued.\n- Website on the '1467 manuscript' by Ronald and Máire Black\n- Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies: Bibliography of Irish Linguistics and Literature\n- Early Irish Glossaries database\n- Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies: Irish Script on Screen\n- National Library of Ireland: list of Gaelic manuscripts\n- Sabhal Mòr Ostaig Library\n- Edinburgh University School of Scottish Studies: Archives and Library"", 'Edwards – Question 5\n5How do digital representations of archival materials change our perceptions of those materials, and in particular, aspects of those materials not considered previously editable or archivable?\nA. S. G. Edwards\nProfessor of Medieval Manuscripts, School of English – University of Kent\n¶ 1 Leave a comment on paragraph 1 0 This is a complicated set of questions. One element in the complexity is that quite a lot of libraries or archives seem to have given little thought to the issues raised here, thus assuming that the act of digital representation is in itself inherently meaningful. This is not necessarily the case. One way of imposing some dimension of enhanced understanding may be by digitizing specific categories of material systematically. For example, the University of Manchester John Rylands Library has sought to digitize on the basis of language, starting with all its own Middle English manuscripts and others in this language from other regional repositories.1 The result is the creation of a coherent corpus that provides the basis for extended study. Other libraries may adopt more selective, less systematic approaches, depending on both the availability of funding and of specialist staff capable of providing appropriate metadata. Indeed it is the provision of such metadata that can be a key factor in using digital representations most fruitfully. An example is the current attempt to understand the activities of the American collector and dealer, Otto Ege (1888-1951), who cut up a large number of medieval manuscripts and dispersed them leaf by leaf over a period of more than thirty years. Some of the manuscripts he destroyed are of historical importance. Digitization provides the most effective means of reassembling what he put asunder, provided, however, that it is possible to accompany images assembled with coherent data about details such as leaf size and provenance.\n¶ 2 Leave a comment on paragraph 2 0 There are other ways in which the digital archive offers possibilities to retrieve significant data. These involve the strategic potential of digitization in terms of special kinds of manuscript materials, such as those that have suffered forms of damage by fire, water, or reagent. While it does seem that, in particular instances, physical fragility has been a significant criterion for digitization, it is not clear that much systematic thought has been given, for example, to whether new digital techniques might enable the retrieval of portions of manuscripts in the Cotton collection damaged in the fire of 1731.2 The Cotton manuscripts form an obvious, large body of material that invites prioritization in terms of digitization because of the new possibilities of textual retrieval it might afford.\n¶ 3 Leave a comment on paragraph 3 0 However, libraries often do not seem to have strategies for digital projects that extend to the prioritization of material in hierarchical or categorical terms. Hence, they tend to proceed on the assumption that the same problems exist, and the same strategies for resolving them apply, across the spectrum of a repository’s holdings. It is clear that this is not necessarily a secure or useful assumption. For example, manuscripts (and printed books) from later periods may, because of their greater fragility, have more pressing claims to digital conservation than medieval ones. Criteria such as script, decoration, language, and place of production all offer the possibility of assembling data into meaningful forms.\n- ¶ 4 Leave a comment on paragraph 4 0\n- In the Bigynnyng, Manchester Middle English Manuscripts, http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/inthebigynnyng/.

Teachers are expected to be effective educational agents who monitor pupil progress, maintain discipline, and create effective learning environments. Meanwhile, parents are encouraged to develop parental involvement in learning, talk to their children about their feelings, help maintain regular routines, and engage in positive activities together. If concerns about a child's development arise, both teachers and parents should collaborate, with parents being advised to speak to the school or GP for additional support.

Many children and young people may have experienced anxiety about the pandemic and may feel things are out of their control.\n“If you notice a change in your child’s mood, behaviour or personality, persistent sadness for two or more weeks, difficulty concentrating or withdrawal from social interactions, even those online, it’s a good idea to try and have a conversation with your child about their feelings and engage with some of the support ideas listed below. If things persist or get no better and you continue to feel worried please seek help via your school or GP.”\nHow to spot the signs of poor mental health in a child\n- Persistent sadness, for two or more weeks\n- Withdrawing from or avoiding social interactions\n- Hurting oneself or talking about hurting oneself\n- Talking about death or suicide\n- Outbursts or extreme irritability\n- Out-of-control behaviour that can be harmful\n- Drastic changes in mood, behaviour or personality\n- Changes in eating habits\n- Loss of weight\n- Difficulty sleeping\n- Frequent headaches or stomach aches\n- Difficulty concentrating\n- Changes in academic performance\nHow you can support a child with mental health difficulties\n- Talk to your child about how they are feeling and let them know it’s OK to be scared, worried, angry or sad\n- Normalise feelings of anxiety and sadness and explain that these are quite usual responses to this most unusual situation\n- Answer your child’s questions as best you can and appropriate to their age. Even if you don’t have the answers, just talking things through will help them feel calmer\n- Encourage your child to do the things they enjoy and encourage them to get some exercise as this can improve how they are feeling\n- Provide reassurance and let your child know you are there to talk to about their thoughts and feelings\n- Encourage children to engage in creative activities such as creative writing, scrapbooking etc – producing a creative or visual record of this time may be helpful and therapeutic for some.\n- Engage in a positive activity together, as this can help take their mind off their worries and could provide an opportunity to talk about their feelings\n- Keep as many regular routines going as possible to help your child feel safe and secure. This can include things like having regular times for going to bed, waking up, eating meals and doing hobbies.\nHow to access help\n- Talk to your child’s school about any additional wellbeing interventions they might be able to offer\n- Seek help via Off The Record – www.otrbristol.org.uk or Kooth – www.kooth.com\n- Speak to your GP who will be able to provide you with the most appropriate help\nUseful websites and apps\nYoung minds – www.youngminds.org.uk\nMinded - www.minded.org.uk\nCalm - www.calm.com/\nHeadspace - www.headspace.com/']"	['<urn:uuid:99171d2e-0bd2-4669-804e-e02d4249e08f>', '<urn:uuid:e19c65a8-02aa-40c7-8ca9-787d559eb935>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	6	83	1561
59	What's the geographic spread and testing of tularemia carriers?	Testing in Minnesota showed F. tularensis presence in D. variabilis ticks at most sites, with 128 (34%) of 378 pools testing positive, and 75% identified as type A. The disease has been reported in every U.S. state except Hawaii, with Arkansas having the highest infection rates. In Colorado, tularemia presence was confirmed in wild rabbits in Pueblo County, where officials actively monitor rabbit die-offs.	['Introduction: The prevalence of Francisella tularensis in Minnesota ticks is unknown. Ticks collected at seven sites were tested to determine the infection prevalence of F. tularensis in Dermacentor variabilis in Minnesota.\nMaterials and Methods: Ticks were collected from two properties at an epizootic site and at five long-term tick research sites. Ticks were pooled by species, sex, date, and site with a maximum of 10 ticks per pool. Ticks were bisected and homogenized; DNA from supernatant was extracted and tested by real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Twice, additional ticks were collected for bacterial culture and isolation of F. tularensis. Proportion of positive pools and minimum infection rate (MIR) were calculated.\nResults: A total of 3527 ticks were tested for F. tularensis including 1601 male D. variabilis and 1926 female D. variabilis. Across all sites, 128 (34%) of 378 pools were RT-PCR positive for F. tularensis. Of 128 positive pools, F. tularensis from 96 (75%) was identified as type A; F. tularensis from 32 pools was unable to be subtyped. The overall MIR was 3.6%. The MIR was significantly lower at the epizootic site compared with Morrison County 1 (3.9% vs. 7.2%; p = 0.02) but did not differ between the epizootic site and Pine County 1 (3.9% vs. 2.1%; p = 0.49). Within the epizootic site, the MIR was significantly higher at Washington County 2 compared with the adjacent property (5.7% vs. 2.3%; p < 0.001). F. tularensis was cultured from 6 (15%) of 40 pools.\nConclusions: F. tularensis was found in ticks at a majority of sites tested. The MIR of F. tularensis in D. variabilis ticks in Minnesota varied geographically. Our findings support the hypothesis that D. variabilis plays an important role in the natural history of tularemia in Minnesota. Further ecologic studies are needed to fully understand the importance of tick species in the maintenance and transmission of F. tularensis in Minnesota.\nThe Dermacentor variabilis tick is a hard bodied tick, also known as the American Dog tick or Wood tick and is widely known. It transmits Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) and tularemia to humans as well as canine tick paralysis to dogs. http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/in781\nDorsal view of American dog ticks, Dermacentor variabilis (Say), with male on left, and female on right. Credit: J.F. Butler, University of Florida\nIt was been suggested that adult ticks move to the edge of the roads and trails in an attempt to find a host, or “quest.” Some have hypothesized that because many animals typically follow trails, they leave an odor that attracts these ticks causing them to move toward and quest alongside trails in attempts to find a host (Mcnemee et al. 2003).\nMore on Tularemia: https://madisonarealymesupportgroup.com/2016/10/25/of-rabbits-and-men/\nNormally thought of as inhabiting areas east of the Rocky Mountains, the Wood tick is obviously defying entomology maps and traipsing all over – from Minnesota to Missouri, California, and most probably everywhere in-between.\nI remember hearing Timothy Lepore, MD, FACS, surgeon at Nantucket Cottage Hospital, at a Lyme conference. He explained that Tularemia is also a disease of those who work with the land such as landscapers and farmers, as well as those who get bit by a tick. There are cases reported in every state but Hawaii, and many other wild and domestic animals can be infected. The highest rates of infection are in Arkansas. Please see this link for more details but know that this is a bioweaponized pathogen: https://madisonarealymesupportgroup.com/2016/10/25/of-rabbits-and-men/ The WHO estimates that an aerosol dispersal of 50 kg of F. tularensis over an area with 5 million people would result in 25,000 incapacitating casualties including 19,000 deaths.\nTransmission: Transmission can occur through the skin or mucous membranes when handling infected animals as well as through tick bite, contact with fluids from infected deer flies, mosquitoes or ticks, handling or eating undercooked rabbit, drinking contaminated water, inhaling dust from contaminated soil, and handling contaminated pelts or paws of animals. It can also be inhaled from infected hay, grain, or soil. Dr. Lepore had patients who contracted it from their pet dog who shook rain water on them after chewing on a dead rabbit, as well as from folks eating road kill, a person who held sick animals, and a gentleman who slept with his pet bunny.\nAnother reminder – don’t sleep with pets!\nThe fact that 35% of Minnesotan ticks are infected with Tularemia is concerning. Spread the word.', 'Public Health Officials in Pueblo confirmed a wild rabbit tested positive for tularemia in Pueblo. The rabbit appeared to have no contact with people and was collected from the Liberty Point area in Pueblo West, Colorado.\n“Pueblo residents are advised that tularemia-causing bacteria may be present in some of the mammals – especially rabbits, rodents and hares and on the ground where these animals may be active,” stated Vicki Carlton, program manager in the environmental health division at the Pueblo City-County Health Department. She added, “Although there are no human cases of tularemia identified in Pueblo so far this year, Colorado has experienced human tularemia cases in people who have been exposed to contaminated soil, drinking contaminated water or inhaling bacteria.”\nPublic health has been monitoring rabbit die-offs in Pueblo West over the past month. This recent rabbit tested by the health department confirms tularemia is present in Pueblo County. Public Health specialists continue to monitor tularemia activity.\n“Because tularemia is known to be in Pueblo County, precautions to prevent tularemia infection should always be taken,” emphasized Ms. Carlton.\nTularemia, “rabbit fever,” is a bacterial infection most commonly transmitted to humans by the handling of sick or dead animals infected with tularemia. Infection can also occur from the bite of infected insects (most commonly ticks and deer flies) as well as exposure to soil and vegetation. Hunters who skin animals without gloves and are exposed to infected blood through an open wound are also at risk.\nTypical signs of infection in humans include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, chest pain, and coughing. Tularemia can be effectively treated with antibiotics; therefore should you have any of these early signs, contact your medical provider.\nDogs and cats also get tularemia by eating infected rabbits or other rodents and through tick and deer fly bites. If your pet shows symptoms of illness including fever, nasal and eye discharge, and skin sores, take it to a veterinarian promptly. Tularemia is easily treated if diagnosed early in dogs and cats.\nRecommended precautions include:\n- Avoid handling wild animals.\n- When outdoors near places where wild rabbits or rodents are present, wear insect repellent containing DEET.\n- Use a dust mask when mowing or doing yard work. Do not mow over animal carcasses.\n- Leash your pets when outdoors and keep them away from dead animals.\n- Routinely use a tick and flea prevention treatment on pets.\n- If a dead animal must be moved, avoid direct contact with it. Wear insect repellent to protect yourself from its fleas or ticks, and use a long-handled shovel to scoop it up. Place it in a garbage bag and dispose in an outdoor trash receptacle. Wash your hands with soap and water afterwards.\n- Wear proper footwear outdoors where dead animals have been found.\n- Do not go barefoot or wear sandals while gardening, mowing or landscaping.\n- Wear gloves while gardening or landscaping, and wash your hands after these activities.\n- Do not drink unpurified water from streams or lakes or allow your pets to drink surface waters.\nIf you hunt, trap or skin animals, take additional steps:\n- Use impervious gloves when skinning or handling animals, especially rabbits.\n- Cook the meat of wild rabbits thoroughly to a temperature of 165°F or higher.']	['<urn:uuid:ee368cfd-0b94-4b25-90f0-92d1577f5b88>', '<urn:uuid:964c9f42-94b7-4454-8d46-f8bcc6bdff72>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	9	64	1275

However, significant barriers exist, particularly for disadvantaged groups who face insecure land rights and power imbalances. Local communities often struggle with traditional collective land rights systems clashing with European-style individual ownership laws, while local elites may be co-opted by government or private sector interests, further undermining community positions. The challenges include the need to balance traditional land management practices with modern legal frameworks, and ensuring vulnerable groups can defend their resources while participating in new economic opportunities.

As competition for land and pressure on resources increases, disadvantaged groups are losing out, particularly where their land rights are insecure, their capacity to assert their rights is limited, and major power imbalances shape relations with government and incoming investors.\nIIED research on the implications of land deals in Africa both for its people and for world agriculture and food security is presented in a new book: The Great African Land Grab? Agricultural Investments and the Global Food System.\nCo-option of local elites by government or the private sector can further undermine the position of locals. Achieving stronger land rights would help local groups defend the resources they depend on for their livelihoods, and to take advantage of new opportunities — including through ‘better deals’ with bigger players, or by participating in benefits from carbon credits.\nMany national land policies and laws (often based on European legal concepts centred on individual land rights and ownership) have little relevance to land relations on the ground because people have accessed land and resources through complex social relations governed by quite effective local institutions for centuries. Land rights have traditionally been held collectively by lineages or families; sometimes there are complex systems of multiple and overlapping rights. Verbal records of these rights are sometimes safeguarded in the memory of local elders.\nBehind the global rush for land lies a complex set of drivers that reflect changing economic and geopolitical relations linking global finance, states and agribusiness to local groups. Read about these factors in this journal article.\nFaced with growing pressures on land, villagers and alliances between a range of local and global producer organisations, NGOs and social movements have challenged governments and investors – as discussed in this IIED report: “Accountability in Africa's land rush: what role for legal empowerment?”\nEven where commercial land acquisitions are not currently happening, tensions over land and the exclusion of certain groups within communities can still occur. Often those with more power or status – based on differences such as wealth, income, age, gender – gain access and the less powerful lose out. Stronger accountability mechanisms would help support such groups to have their views heard, to be part of the negotiating process, and to defend their rights to land they have traditionally had access to.\nWhat we do\nWe seek to strengthen local and national capacity to secure land rights and help communities get a better deal from incoming land investments. We work with local partners who combine legal expertise and participatory methods to promote empowerment and land rights.\nSecuring land rights in West Africa\nWe are working on the development, testing and implementation of innovative tools to secure land rights in Ghana and Mali, particularly in cases where poorer farmers, women and pastoralists, who have used the land for centuries, are being marginalised.\nPromoting inclusive investments\nWe are engaging with governments and investors in a few key countries affected by commercial land acquisitions and, together with our partners, we have been generating evidence on a range of issues concerning large-scale land acquisitions and the alternative: inclusive investment.\nIn supporting the establishment of fair, legal frameworks for investment we are Scrutinising the law and contracts and Helping communities push back by making better use of the law through our Legal tools initiative.""]"	['<urn:uuid:49c4822c-4008-40de-a5a3-71f218e60106>', '<urn:uuid:deaf1298-f355-45e9-a80e-7e03d81b5a64>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	6	100	1135
61	What are the main maintenance challenges for both exterior wall finishes and green roofs, and how can these issues be prevented during installation?	For wall finishes, maintenance challenges include potential sand sloughing from sanded finishes, crack development (especially in smooth finishes), and the need for proper application of base coats to prevent issues. These can be prevented by choosing appropriate finishes for interior/exterior use and practicing proper application techniques. For green roofs, maintenance challenges include water leakage from frozen irrigation pipes, root growth damaging waterproofing membranes, blocked drainage systems, and accumulation of dead vegetation creating fire risks. Prevention measures include installing leak detection systems below waterproofing membranes, proper sizing of gutters, regular maintenance of drainage systems, maintaining adequate moisture content in vegetation, regular removal of dead vegetation, and including specific inspection points for gutters. Additionally, minimizing roof penetrations during installation helps prevent future issues.	"['There are a lot of finish plaster texture options available for your straw bale home and knowing which one is best for you can be difficult. The best decisions are based on understanding the combination of application-technical difficulty, personal aesthetics, durability, crack hiding ability, and material availability. I have given a short description for several of the most common finishes below. Some are better suited for interior finishes and others for exterior use. I have not rated them in terms of technical difficulty because that is only relevant if I know the skills of the person completing the work. For example, even the best plastering crews may not be good at a particular finish if it is not something they do very often. I hope this will be a basic guide for you to start your journey in educating yourself on plaster finishes.\nIf you plan to do the work yourself, the biggest suggestion I have is to practice, practice, practice…and NOT on your house. Create a mock wall that you can work on until you feel comfortable. Better yet, once you have finished your work on the mock wall, build a small straw bale structure like the Sunset Cottage that you can practice the entire building process on before you start your main home. Want some hands on experience? We plaster in all of our hands-on, seven-day workshops so click here to see if there is a location and date that works for you. If you plan to hire the work out, be sure to make clear the style of finish you want on the home and then confirm, preferably with references, that the contractor can successfully complete the style you want.\nThis is perhaps the most common finish for a straw bale house exterior. It is basically created by either hand troweling or spraying the finish coat of plaster onto the wall and then smoothing it with a very slightly dampened sponge float. The float smooths the trowel marks and pulls the sand up a bit to give the texture. You can create a fine, medium, or coarse finish depending on the size of sand that you use. This texture does a good job of hiding cracks if the texture is coarse, but less so with a fine finish.\nThis texture is often used on exteriors, but is better suited for interior surfaces where the rough textures of floated finishes are not as good a choice. After all, sanded finishes tend to slough sand for a while after application and that can be a dirty experience inside a home. It tends to show cracks easily and is very difficult to perfect. To achieve this finish, use a pool trowel which is more flexible and has rounded corners.\nThis is a great interior finish as it provides smooth walls while still offering some texture and random patterns that make the overall appearance more interesting. Although I prefer it as an interior finish, I have seen it used on exteriors with success as well. Cat face is created in a two step process. First, a finish coat of about 1/8″ thickness is applied and finished fairly smooth. Before it has a chance to dry, another coat of about 1/8″ thickness is applied and smoothed. The number of inclusions, or depressions in the plaster, is up to the finisher and how smoothly the final plaster is finished. This texture is sometimes called “Green on Green” because is uses two layers of green (fresh) plaster in one application to create the effect.\nThis plaster finish can be applied by one person which makes it appealing for a DIYer. It is applied either by hand with a masonry brush or by spraying the plaster with a hopper sprayer. The mud is actually tossed (or sprayed) at the wall leaving a rough and raised texture. It is a great exterior finish and supplies good coverage for cracks. in other words, cracks are hard to see within this finish and don’t tend to develop, as long as the base coats are well applied. Similar to the Cat Face approach, this finish requires a minimum of two coats, and those are on top of the the scratch and brown coats. This is an example of harling, a traditional plastering technique used in the United Kingdom for hundreds of years, so the longevity of the finish is well established.\nThis finish is relatively easy to complete as it involves finishing the plaster in circular motions with either a steel trowel or plastic trowel. The key to this finish is using round sand. The more coarse that sand, the bigger the “worm tunnels,” which is what gives this texture its name. the finish hides cracks and imperfections well; however, it is often used in commercial applications so it may not have the refined look you are after.', ""Sustainability Series: Green Roofs\nArticle information and share options\nWith increased urbanization, green roofs are becoming a major trend. They offer many advantages to building owners and occupiers, the general public, and the environment: better insulation, reduced power consumption, stormwater retention, improved air quality, and a biodiverse environment offering aesthetic diversity. However, green roofs may introduce property considerations and concerns that owners and occupiers should be aware of when reviewing their property and business risks.\nGreen roofs comprise specific vegetation designed and installed on a series of components, including moisture retention material, a drainage system, a root barrier, and a protective layer for both the insulation and underlying roof surface.\nProperty Risk Considerations\nLet's take a closer look at a few features that will likely be of interest to commercial property insurers when evaluating the building's overall risk profile.\nDownload our guide\n1. Potential for water leakage damage\nThe irrigation pipework may be susceptible to freezing. Leaks in waterproofing membranes due to root growth or temperature fluctuations may expose the underlying roof structure to damage or corrosion. Drainage systems may become blocked by soil and vegetation. These risks are particularly relevant in the construction phase.\nLoss Prevention Tips: Penetrations in the roof should be minimized. It is important to include leak detection systems below the waterproofing membrane. Size gutters to accommodate both rainfall and irrigation runoff and maintain them regularly, with specific inspection points included. Consider the impact of roof gradient on the density of growth media and its propensity to shift or slide during heavy rain events.\n2. Fire load\nGreen roofs and their supporting components (e.g., vegetation and waterproofing membrane) typically add combustible loading to a roof and increase the potential for ignition from exposing fires or other ignition sources. In some cases, the design of a green roof may encompass space for recreational activities, introducing ignition sources such as lighting, electrical installations, barbecues/grills, and smoking.\nLoss Prevention Tips: Limit the overall fire risk by maintaining adequate moisture content of vegetation, regular removal of dead vegetation, and careful design and placement of noncombustible fire breaks. Include manual firefighting equipment such as fire hydrants, fire hose reels, and portable fire extinguishers, along with access provisions for the fire brigade. Potential ignition from electrical equipment, smoking, or other sources should be identified and carefully managed.\n3. Susceptibility to collapse\nGreen roofs introduce live loads associated with landscaping, precipitation, induced saturation due to irrigation, and periodic replacement of new soil and growth of vegetation.\nLoss Prevention Tips: The load carrying ability of concrete roofs versus all other types (e.g., long span steel) should be considered over the roof lifecycle. Some roofs may be susceptible to deformation over time, affecting the operational efficiency of certain components that originally functioned properly. Future changes may affect the structural integrity and should undergo formal review. Concrete roofs are generally more resilient than other roofs to changes that increase live loading.\n4. Damage from natural hazards\nGreen roofs are susceptible to natural hazard perils such as seismic forces and wind uplift pressures. Vegetation or potentially the entire roof system may be damaged, requiring replacement.\nLoss Prevention Tip: The system, including any moisture/root barriers, should be properly secured to structural elements (growth media should not be relied upon). Green roofs should not generally be installed in areas with elevated wind exposures such as coastal areas subject to hurricanes.\nGreen Roofs provide many environmental benefits, especially in urban locations where vegetation may be scarce. However, if a green roof is to be installed, ensure that the considerations outlined above are incorporated in the design, installation, and future maintenance requirements to mitigate the potential for loss.""]"	['<urn:uuid:14fe4a66-ec46-42a4-9807-42c14e35a9dc>', '<urn:uuid:adefe97e-66fa-495a-b3a2-8e24a422fce1>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	23	121	1416
62	How do the sound quality capabilities compare between using a basic computer keyboard for DJing versus the Traktor Kontrol Z1 controller?	The Traktor Kontrol Z1 controller offers superior sound quality capabilities with its built-in soundcard supporting up to 24/96 playback rates and 101 dB dynamic range, while DJing with a computer keyboard provides basic control functions but has no inherent sound quality features as it's just an input device.	"['DJing With A Computer Keyboard\nDigital DJing and controllerism has come a long way from simply “laptop DJing” (say it with contempt for full effect), but for most digital DJs the laptop remains the central part of their setup. While there’s usually a better workflow than hunching over your keyboard, there are instances where using your computer’s keyboard gets the job done better than anything else. In this article we explore the best uses and mapping considerations for the buttons that you always have with you on your laptop!\nTHE FULL SETUP\nIn an ideal world, you’ll be set up with a powerful controller or two. But there are plenty of DJs getting started, still searching or saving for the perfect controller. If you’ve already got that perfect controller, what happens if it gives up the ghost in the middle of a gig? The computer keyboard might not be the most stylish or the most gratifying way to manipulate your DJ software, but it’s often faster and more effective than your trackpad or mouse.\nDifferent software deals with keyboard mapping in different ways. Of the ‘big three’ – Ableton Live, Traktor, and Scratch Live – Traktor’s is probably the most powerful, but in exactly the same way as its MIDI mapping system, it’s the most fiddly.\nAbleton Live’s key mapping system works in exactly the same way as its MIDI mapping; learning is quick and easy – but it’s actually a little more flexible as shift, alt, and shift+alt can be used as modifiers.\nDespite sensible layout (including logical modifier layers) Scratch Live provides no way to modify Serato’s default key mapping, so it’s the clear nag in this particular race.\nAbleton’s key mapping approach is surprisingly flexible, combining its click-to-learn approach with four states per key with simple modifier commands. The modifiers keys include alt/option, command, control, and shift. The only thing that isn’t ideal is its inability to recognise held keys, meaning toggles are the only option and momentary switches are out.\nTraktor comes with a pretty decent default map for a two deck setup, but it’s not the best thing for every situation. Take a look at this mapping from Eric Zone (courtesy of TraktorBible), which approaches things a little differently to the default mapping. There’s less in the way of features, but a concise workflow that allows for effects, quick access to loops, and mixer functions.\nOur number one tip for making your own keyboard mappings: plan ahead! A little thought into a map that will work best for you – either to enhance your setup or act as a emergency backup controller – will go a long way. Consider your most often used functions!\nAbleton Live’s a blank canvas, and in the same way that you need to set your DJ set up from scratch in Live, you’ll have to set your key map up. Traktor’s controller editor is notoriously labourious to use, and despite Live’s surprise strength when it comes to key mapping you’d be surprised how quickly you can become key-blind staring at a list of commands in the mapping editor, so I whipped up this keyboard template image for your brainstorming sessions. Click here to download at 300dpi!\nAN EXTRA CONTROLLER\nSome DJs aren’t put off by the idea of using a keyboard in the booth at all – in fact if you have a nice keyboard you might actually prefer the feel of the buttons over those found on some MIDI controllers. A computer keyboard can actually do some cool stuff; I’ve cooked up a little FX bank for Traktor as inspiration and to show how a bunch of buttons can go a long way.\nCheck out my basic Traktor Pro 2 keyboard based FX layout here. (Warning: this .tsi contains keyboard mappings and effects settings, so be sure to have anything you choose to import backup up safely if you want to keep existing settings!)\n- Your keyboard has a whole lot of keys that each do a single thing: get pressed and register a command. Fans of Midi Fighters, Monomes, and the like will already be in ‘binary mode’ when thinking about mappings, but if you’re a little more used to thinking in terms of knobs and sliders then smart use of buttons is sometimes a foreign concept.\n- Because keyboards have no knobs and sliders, think about how you actually use effects and what you need in order to get as close as possible to your normal operation with just buttons. For example, you can’t smoothly adjust EQ, but you can hit a full kill in one movement. You can’t ride the pitch fader, but you can use pitch bend buttons to nudge you back in phase.\n- If your play style revolves around juggling cues, something to experiment with is assigning two adjacent buttons to the same action to allow you to ‘twiddle’ the two buttons and at the same time reduce the risk of accidentally hitting the wrong button in the heat of the moment.\n- Be careful when putting buttons close to each other! This is a pretty universal concept whether you’re on a keyboard or a controller, but if your load track or stop button is right next to your ‘instant cool FX’ button, you’re playing with fire. The mapping above from Eric Zone almost certainly has ‘lock playing deck’ switched on when it’s being used, because of the proximity of the load button to all the rest of the controls.\nThere’s another very valid use for your computer’s keyboard, and that’s helping out with the often gruelling task of managing your track library. Things like adding tempos, cues and beat grids can be a hassle in Traktor, but with a mapping on standby that you can switch to during downtime you can mitigate the frustration of using the mouse – or worse still, the trackpad – to get these important tasks done. Rainier over at Traktor Bible has a pretty sleek mapping designed just for this purpose over here. TraktorBible’s Beatgridding with Keypad map.\nREMEMBER THE CONTROLS!\nSo you have a setup you like. It’s just that remembering that ‘F’ is hotcue 2 isn’t the easiest thing in the world to do. If only there was some way to customize your keyboard to make things easier to remember!\nYou have a few options when it comes to improving the memorability of your keyboard maps, from off-the-shelf rubberized overlays designed to fit a variety of keyboards and work with the out of the box mappings (the DJTT webstore stocks the KBcovers pictured above for both Serato and Traktor) to customizable blank keys that can either be printed to or written on (like these over at Amazon for less than $2), to stationary stop gaps like small colored dot marker stickers.\nOne of our commenters also found these keyboard stickers – we can’t vouch for their quality, but worth mentioning!\nAs a recap, here are the files that I’ve created or compiled to help you get the most out of your computer keyboard for DJing:\nHopefully I’ve helped you get the most out of your keyboard, but as always I’m not perfect: how do you use your keyboard for DJing tasks – have I missed anything out?

63	alpine cheese making traditional methods modern hygiene standards compliance challenges	Traditional Alpine cheese-making methods evolved from medieval practices where peasant farmers would send their cows to mountain pastures, with cowmen making large, durable cheeses using specific techniques like low salt content, small curd cutting, and high temperature heating. These traditional methods created distinct cheeses like Gruyere, Emmentaler, and Appenzeller. However, modern food safety standards require careful monitoring of bacterial contamination throughout the production chain. Studies have shown that while traditional production can meet EU food safety standards for raw milk consumption, there are significant challenges in controlling thermoresistant bacteria and bacilli contamination, particularly through the fodder-excrement-milk chain, requiring strict hygiene measures especially during fodder harvest and preservation.	['I have been into Mountain cheeses lately. A “Mountain” cheese can refer to a wide variety of cheeses that are made in the mountains.\nBut it can also refer to a specific style. The specific style is what I am referring to.\nPaul Kindstedt wrote about the characteristics of these cheeses: “moderate to large-sized, wheel-shaped, firm-bodied, rugged, long-lived … durable-rind cheeses with firm elastic bodies, and sometimes with holes or eyes, and with flavor profiles often described as ‘nutty.’ ”\nIn his book “Cheese and Culture: A History of Cheese and Its Place in Western Civilization,” Kindstedt talked about the commonalities of these cheeses that popped up all throughout the Alps and other mountain ranges in Europe.\nBy the end of The Middle Ages a common set of circumstances gave rise to this cheese type. The peasant farmers would raise only one to four cows as they farmed in the valleys and lowlands of Alpine areas.\nIn the spring and summer, the farms from the surrounding areas would appoint a few trusted “Cowmen” to take all of the cows from every farm up to graze on the grass, flowers and herbs of the mountain pastures. This is known as Transhumance.\nThese Cowmen would essentially camp out for the summer and do the milking, cheese making and affinage in small sheds or huts in the highlands. The cheeses had to be large and rugged to get them down the mountain in the fall. The large size helped with transport to markets but also helped with shelf life. The cheeses were 15 to 200 pounds and remain big to this day.\nMany different techniques helped the cheeses in their high elevation. First they used relatively little salt to make the cheeses. It would have been almost impossible to carry a lot of salt up the mountains.\nThe low acidification of the milk in this environment meant that the curds had to be cut into very small pieces in order to expel enough whey. The curds were also heated to higher temperatures for the same purpose.\nThe small amounts of salt and low acid made the cheeses perfect hosts for propionic bacteria to thrive. This bacterium creates gas and it expands to give the cheese holes.\nIt also creates a strong flavor as it produces propionic acid. These cheeses were also susceptible to coryneform bacteria on the outside of the cheeses. The scraping or washing of the cheese as it ages would encourage them to grow on the rinds of the cheeses.\nSwitzerland, France, Italy, Austria and Germany all have these Alpine mountain cheese making traditions: cheeses like Appenzeller, Gruyere, Emmentaler, L’Etivaz Comte, Beaufort, Morbier, Fontina Valle d’Aosta, Bitto, Branzi and Allgauer Bergkase among many others.\nThe tradition of mountain style cheese has made its way to the U.S. Several cheese makers have made their own versions with much success. From Vermont and New York to Georgia and Tennessee, Mountain cheeses have found a home here.\nOne of the great things about this style of cheese is the way it melts. These cheeses are perfect when you apply heat. Since we are quickly approaching melted cheese weather these “Mountain Melters” deserve the attention.\nOn Sept. 27th, in conjunction with The Better Cheddar and The Culinary Center of Kansas City, I will teach a class called Mountain Melters: Fondue, Raclette and Other Cheesy Delights. We are going to have a tasting of several great mountain-style cheeses and then everyone gets to melt them. You will also learn tips about serving Fondue and Raclette at your next get together.\nFor more information about the class, which costs $60, and to reserve a seat, press here.\nLincoln Broadbooks loves cheese.

Hanuš, J. Frelich, M. Vyletělová, P. Roubal, Z. Vorlíček, R. Jedelskáhttps://doi.org/10.17221/4336-CJASCitation:Hanuš O., Frelich J., Vyletělová M., Roubal P., Vorlíček Z., Jedelská R. (2004): Technologically difficult, pathogenic and food risky bacterial contamination of raw milk and other materials from dairy cow herds. Czech J. Anim. Sci., 49: 489-499.\nProcessing of milk for higher value-added products and milk food chain safety require prevention of higher occurrence of microorganisms that can produce spores. It is important to carry out prevention already during raw milk production by farm hygienic measures. The above-mentioned microorganisms can jeopardize the quality and safety of milk foods. This is the reason why the knowledge of factors, interrelationships and possibilities of milk contamination is assumed. The occurrence of hygienically important groups of microorganisms in mixed rough fodder (F) in feeding trough, in excrements (E) and in bulk milk (M) was investigated on seven farms with a good level of milk yield, management and hygienic conditions for three years in summer (S) and winter (W) feeding seasons. The data set was well balanced in terms of other possible farm factors (such as height above sea level, breed of dairy cows and so on). In total 70 samples of each mentioned material were collected. The investigations were focused on counts of thermoresistant bacteria (TRB), total counts of bacilli (TBA), frequency of occurrence of Bacillus cereus (BCE) and Bacillus licheniformis (BLI), and counts of other bacilli (OBA) in all mentioned materials and on the frequency of occurrence of main mastitis pathogens Streptococcus agalactiae (SAG) and Staphylococcus aureus (SAU) in milk. The means of parameters did not exceed the defined standard limits, in particular in raw milk that was suitable for direct human consumption in raw state or for processing for milk products without heat treatment according to relevant EU food legislation. The variabilities of hygienic parameters were relatively high: from 179% (TBA) to 315% (TRB) in F; from 178% (BLI) to 350% (TRB) in E; from 117% (TBA) to 459% (SAG) in M. S increased TRB in F (P > 0.05). Counts of bacilli were well balanced between S and W. S increased BLI in E (P < 0.05), an opposite trend was observed in BCE. The season did not influence SAG and SAU in M. Higher (P ≤ 0.01) counts of BCE were in S, the trend was opposite for BLI (P ≤ 0.05). The season effect on the occurrence of technologically and hygienically difficult microorganisms was not confirmed in general for M, F and E of dairy cows. Regression analysis of the investigated parameters was done. There were significant positive correlations between bacilli and TRB in F as well as in E (correlation coefficients from 0.32 to 0.65; P ≤ 0.01). The relationships between TRB and occurrence of bacilli in M were less close (0.30; P ≤ 0.05) than in F and E. No significant relationships were found between TRB and occurrence of main mastitis pathogens in milk (SAG r = –0.14 and SAU r = 0.11; both P > 0.05). It confirmed the high pasteurization efficiency at liquidation of mentioned pathogens. The relationship SAU × SAG in M was 0.23 (P < 0.05). It suggests a simultaneous effect of dairy cow health state on the occurrence of both pathogens. The majority of significant relationships (from 0.26 to 0.76; from P ≤ 0.05 to P ≤ 0.001) was in F × E within TRB, BLI, OBA and TBA. 7% to 58% of the changes in E were dependent on changes in F. The occurrences of TRB and BLI in M were significantly influenced (0.24 and 0.32; P ≤ 0.05 and P ≤ 0.01) by their occurrences in E and F. The observed dependences confirm the relationships between materials (F, E and M) and possibilities of penetration of TRB and bacilli through the technological chain along the axis F – E – M. The hygiene of rough fodder harvest and preservation is highly important for prevention of the above-mentioned risks.\ndairy cow; hygiene; rough fodder; excrements; milk; thermoresistant bacteria; total bacilli; Bacillus cereus; Bacillus licheniformis; other bacilli; food pathogens; mastitis pathogens; Streptococcus agalactiae; Staphylococcus aureus; food chain safety; prevention']	['<urn:uuid:3be8db7a-262e-4570-8881-933f0f1a0c30>', '<urn:uuid:b0a13336-b8b5-41bf-9be6-5becbe399912>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	10	107	1365

65	What skills do nomads have and why are they mistrusted?	Nomads possess specialized skills like the Van Gujars' ability to breed robust buffalo suited for mountain travel and the Bhotiyas' sustainable use of mountain environments. However, they often face mistrust as outsiders since societies tend to blame strangers and minorities during times of crisis.	['Travellers in North India frequently encounter groups of nomadic or semi-nomadic pastorals such as van gujars, bakkarwals, bhotiyas or gaddis with their flocks of buffaloes and cows, sheep and goats. In addition, there are non-pastoral nomads like the artisan community of gadoliya lohars as well as some nomads associated with acrobatics and folk-dance.\nAll of these communities bring a wealth of colour and diversity to our culture, but like the gypsies of Europe, they have been frequently misunderstood. Highly distorted, unjust policies concerning them have been formulated, without taking the trouble to consult them. In India and elsewhere, most governments took it for granted that nomadic life is a sign of backwardness and try to impose ‘settled’ life on them. It is a fact that nomadic pastoral people still constitute a significant percentage of the people in some countries. In India they exist in significant numbers in some regions such as parts of the Himalayas and parts of the Thar Desert.\nIn India, a much valued traditional role of nomads has been to make available hardy breeds of cattle. The Royal Commission of Agriculture noted, “If inquiry were to be made into the history of such breeds…we believe it would be found, in most cases that their excellence was due to the care bestowed on them by the professional cattle breeders, usually nomadic”. The Van Gujars are a colourful community of nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoral people, who live in the west Himalayan hills and the plains immediately below these hills. In the winter they live in the forests of the plains with their buffaloes, and in the summer most of them migrate to high altitude hills.\nAccording to a document titled Community Forest Management in Protected Areas, the skills of the Van Gujars in buffalo breeding are evident from the special breeds they have, which are particularly suited to the nomadic life. It says, “Van Gujar buffaloes are not the rather dopey animals one see commonly in Indian villages, but a livelier and altogether more robust breed with the endurance to cover great distances on very little food and the strength to scramble over rocks in high mountain pastures.\nA study of the Bhotiyas of the Kumaon Himalayas titled Living on the Move by Vineeta Hoon establishes that “The Bhotiyas recognise the unique seasonal opportunities offered by their mountain environment and utilise them in an ecologically sustainable manner”. Some nomadic groups have also made an important contribution to the development of water resources. To meet the water needs on their preferred routes, some of them in water-scarce areas showed great skills in locating and digging water sources which ultimately proved a blessing for settled villagers as well. The Pichola Lake, an important source of water in Udaipur city, was constructed by Banjaras. The Maldhari nomads of Kutch developed a unique rain water harvesting system called ‘Virda’.\nIt is possible that a nomadic community may need some help to make its seasonal migration more secure. It is also possible that with changing times they may like to gradually move towards a more settled existence. However, such decisions have to be taken on the basis of a detailed, democratic consultation among the nomads. It is a welcome step that recently some educational programmes have been initiated among the nomadic communities. Unfortunately however, the modern, formal system, of education is unable to play such a role among the Bhotiyas. According to this study, “It has been very successful in eroding indigenous knowledge, and at the same it does not prepare Bhotiya children with survival skills to either live successfully in their own habitat or in the outside world.”\nThus, even well-intentioned development programmes can be harmful if they downgrade the time-honoured value systems, traditional wisdom and self-esteem of nomadic people.', 'Travel has rarely been free.\nI don’t just mean the monetary costs. I mean that for nearly as long as there have been state-level societies with borders to defend, there have been efforts to control who’s allowed to travel across them and when. There’s a Biblical reference to something like a passport all the way back in the fifth century BCE; both India and China had travel controls since about the third century CE.\nThis isn’t surprising. There are plenty of reasons to limit and track people’s movements, from national security to economic regulation to the prevention of epidemics. Not just at borders, either: internal travel can be restricted, too. In a highly controlled society, leaving your home village or parish without proper clearance is suspicious or even criminal. Enforcing that requires a certain amount of bureaucracy, which not every land has had the capacity or will to implement — but it’s an obstacle often overlooked by quest fantasies that take their cues from Tolkien or Dungeons and Dragons. You can’t always roam at will, looking for adventure.\nPermits can take a number of forms. Informally, they might just be letters from authority figures saying “do me a favor and let this person pass through.” Like modern visas, these tended to be issued by local officials, granting an outsider permission to enter or move around. A passport, by contrast, is issued by the traveler’s home officials — though the term “passport” in its original form was applied to something more like a visa, and literally allowed you to “pass the porte,” i.e. the gate. As government apparatus got more complex, those informal letters became standardized documents, which might record things like the appearance of the bearer (to prevent them from being handed off to other people), certification that the bearer has paid necessary taxes or fees, or a list of the places the traveler has visited or is permitted to visit.\nOf course these documents don’t mean much if someone doesn’t inspect them. That might be the responsibility of gate guards, or travelers might be required to report in at local offices along their journey; magistrates or other officials might have the right to stop any outsider and demand to see their papers. The more authoritarian the society, the more widespread the latter becomes — and the more severe the penalties for those who disobey. The game Papers, Please dramatizes this to all-too-vivid effect.\nHow do they know who’s an outsider? It depends on the situation. Obviously in a mostly homogenous culture, any differences of physical appearance (skin color, hair color, features, clothing) or behavior (language, food, religious habits) will draw attention. And in a small enough community, it doesn’t matter how well you blend in; you can’t overcome the fact that everybody there knows everybody else, and a stranger is going to stick out like a sore thumb. In larger and more diverse communities, like cities, officials are more likely to focus on people who cause problems, meaning that outsiders can slide under the radar more easily if they keep quiet. But even there, people in a given neighborhood are more likely to know one another; the places where that isn’t true, because there are a large number of travelers and transients, are also more likely to see regular inspections of papers.\nThen and now, governments tend to give the side-eye to people who are too mobile. They want you to have a fixed residence so they can record you and tax you and track you down when needed. Slipping through that net incurs suspicion — what are you running from? What are you trying to hide? It’s a feedback loop; if being transient makes you a questionable person, you’re going to have a harder time acquiring respectable work, which increases the chance that you’ll have to turn to petty (or not so petty) crime, which puts you even further outside the bounds of society.\nBut what of people whose whole culture is nomadic? In ages past this sometimes referred to pastoral cultures, i.e. those based on herding, which necessitates regular relocation to fresh pastures. Sedentary societies have generally considered those people “barbarians” and traveling through their lands a dangerous proposition, because there wasn’t the same kind of settled bureaucracy to grant official permission for passage. Even if the first band waves you along, the second one might disagree.\nMost of the time, though, what people mean when they bring this up is an ethnic group like the Romani. There’s a profound misconception here, which is that wandering is just something inherent to them and their culture — they’re free spirits, preferring a romantic life on the road to the dull routine of stationary life.\nTo the extent that such people prefer not to settle down, it’s because they know they’re all too often the first scapegoat blamed whenever anything goes wrong. Being able to pull up stakes and move on at the drop of a hat is a defensive adaptation. But in many cases it isn’t even a choice: the lands they move through forbid them to stop in one place for more than a certain amount of time, or forbid them stopping at all. Or they’re allowed to settle for a time . . . until something goes wrong, at which point the locals turn on them as the cause of every woe.\nBecause outsiders have always been liminal figures, and therefore seen as dangerous. We see this around the world and throughout time: in times of crisis, people want someone to blame, and it’s psychologically easier to blame strangers and minorities than the neighbor who’s like yourself. In Europe, this has often meant Romani and/or Jews, though bigotry of that kind has also turned against other targets. On the level of individual targets rather than communities, it might be the wandering beggar, the merchant, anybody who’s intruding from without. And if those are a source of danger, then of course it’s in society’s best interests to control and limit that as much as possible, right?\nIt can be hard to grasp how deep that mindset used to run — and still does, in other parts of the world. We haven’t shaken off bigotry by any means . . . but especially in the United States, where it’s common for people to move to other cities or states during the course of their lives, where you can live for years on a street or in an apartment complex and not know the names of your neighbors, we don’t realize how tightly-woven the fabric of a community can be, and how “foreign” somebody from the next village over can seem. These days, we’re used to being surrounded by strangers. That hasn’t always been the case.\nMind you, that doesn’t mean everyone everywhere has always been xenophobic and suspicious of anybody they don’t recognize. Hospitality is also a major force in people’s behavior. But that’s a topic for a future essay.']	['<urn:uuid:1a337f88-b755-4691-be1c-3b6da04e1db8>', '<urn:uuid:5cfd4c11-1539-45a9-a1b8-42a9adaf7894>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	10	44	1789
66	radio telescope disadvantages advantages space communication	Radio telescopes offer significant advantages for space communication and observation, but also face challenges. The main advantages include the ability to operate 24/7 regardless of weather conditions, and the capacity to observe hydrogen, which comprises 90% of visible matter in the universe. They can also see through interstellar dust clouds that block optical observations. However, there are notable limitations. Due to the long wavelengths of radio waves, large telescopes are required to achieve good angular resolution. Additionally, radio observations require complex computer processing to produce images, unlike immediate visual observations. This is particularly evident in deep space communications, where the inverse square law and limited power of spacecraft make signal reception challenging.	['When the news broke recently that communications had finally been re-established with Voyager 2, I felt a momentary surge of panic. I’ve literally been following the Voyager missions since the twin space probes launched back in 1977, and I’ve been dreading the inevitable day when the last little bit of plutonium in their radioisotope thermal generators decays to the point that they’re no longer able to talk to us, and they go silent in the abyss of interstellar space. According to these headlines, Voyager 2 had stopped communicating for eight months — could this be a quick nap before the final sleep?\nThankfully, no. It turns out that the recent blackout to our most distant outpost of human engineering was completely expected, and completely Earth-side. Upgrades and maintenance were performed on the Deep Space Network antennas that are needed to talk to Voyager. But that left me with a question: What about the rest of the DSN? Could they have not picked up the slack and kept us in touch with Voyager as it sails through interstellar space? The answer to that is an interesting combination of RF engineering and orbital dynamics.\nContinue reading “After Eight-Month Break, Deep Space Network Reconnects With Voyager 2”\nJoin us on Wednesday, February 12 at noon Pacific for the DIY Radio Telescopes Hack Chat with James Aguirre!\nFor most of history, astronomers were privy to the goings-on in the universe only in a very narrow slice of the electromagnetic spectrum. We had no idea that a vibrant and wondrous picture was being painted up and down the wavelengths, a portrait in radio waves of everything from nearly the moment of creation to the movement of galaxies. And all it took to listen in was an antenna and a radio receiver.\nOver the years, radio telescopes have gotten more and more sophisticated and sensitive, and consequently bigger and bigger. We’re even to the point where one radio telescope often won’t cut it, and astronomers build arrays of telescopes spread over miles and miles, some with antennas that move around on rails. In the search for signals, radio astronomy has become the very definition of “Big Science.”\nBut radio astronomy doesn’t have to be big to be useful. James Aguirre, an astronomer at the University of Pennsylvania, spends his days (and nights) studying the radio universe with those big instruments. But he’s also passionate about down-scaling things and teaching everyone that small radio telescopes can be built on the cheap. His Mini Radio Telescope project uses a cast-off satellite TV dish and a couple of hundred bucks worth of readily available gear to scan the skies for all sorts of interesting phenomena.\nDr. Aguirre will join us on the Hack Chat to discuss all things radio astronomy, and how you can get in on the radio action on the cheap. Chances are good your junk pile — or your neighbor’s roof — has everything you need, and you might be surprised how approachable and engaging DIY radio astronomy can be.\nOur Hack Chats are live community events in the Hackaday.io Hack Chat group messaging. This week we’ll be sitting down on Wednesday, February 12 at 12:00 PM Pacific time. If time zones have got you down, we have a handy time zone converter.\nClick that speech bubble to the right, and you’ll be taken directly to the Hack Chat group on Hackaday.io. You don’t have to wait until Wednesday; join whenever you want and you can see what the community is talking about. Continue reading “DIY Radio Telescopes Hack Chat”\nThere’s something iconic about dish antennas. Chances are it’s the antenna that non-antenna people think about when they picture an antenna. And for many applications, the directionality and gain of a dish can really help reach out and touch someone. So if you’re looking to tap into a distant WiFi network, this umbrella-turned-dish antenna might be just the thing to build.\nStretching the limits of WiFi connections seems to be a focus of [andrew mcneil]’s builds, at least to judge by his YouTube channel. This portable, foldable dish is intended to increase the performance of one of his cantennas, a simple home-brew WiFi antenna that uses food cans as directional waveguides. The dish is built from the skeleton of an umbrella-style photographer’s flash reflector; he chose this over a discount-store rain umbrella because the reflector has an actual parabolic shape. The reflective material was stripped off and used as a template to cut new gores of metal window screen material. It’s considerably stiffer than the reflector fabric, but it stretches taut between the ribs and can still fold up, at least sort of. An arm was fashioned from dowels to position the cantenna feed-horn at the focus of the reflector; not much detail is given on the cantenna itself, but we assume it’s similar in design to cantennas we’ve featured before.\n[andrew] hasn’t done rigorous testing yet, but a quick 360° scan from inside his shop showed dozens of WiFi signals, most with really good signals. We’ll be interested to see just how much this reflector increases the cantenna’s performance.\nContinue reading “Umbrella And Tin Cans Turned Into WiFi Dish Antenna”\nHumanity has been a spacefaring species for barely sixty years now. In that brief time, we’ve fairly mastered the business of putting objects into orbit around the Earth, and done so with such gusto that a cloud of both useful and useless objects now surrounds us. Communicating with satellites in Earth orbit is almost trivial; your phone is probably listening to at least half a dozen geosynchronous GPS birds right now, and any ham radio operator can chat with the astronauts aboard the ISS with nothing more that a $30 handy-talkie and a homemade antenna.\nBut once our spacecraft get much beyond geosynchronous orbit, communications get a little dicier. The inverse square law and the limited power budget available to most interplanetary craft exact a toll on how much RF energy can be sent back home. And yet the science of these missions demands a reliable connection with enough bandwidth to both control the spacecraft and to retrieve its precious cargo of data. That requires a powerful radio network with some mighty big ears, but as we’ll see, NASA isn’t the only one listening to what’s happening out in deep space. Continue reading “Serious DX: The Deep Space Network”\nHave you got a spare Dish Network antenna lying about? They’re not too hard to come by, either curbside on bulk waste day or perhaps even on Freecycle. If you can lay hands on one, you might want to try this fun radio telescope build.\nNow, don’t expect much from [Justin]’s minimalist build. After all, you’ll be starting with a rather small dish and an LNB for the Ku band, so you won’t be doing serious radio astronomy. In fact, the BOM doesn’t include a fancy receiver – just a hacked satellite finder. The idea is to just get a reading of the relative “brightness” of a radio source without trying to demodulate the signal. To that end, the signal driving the piezo buzzer in the sat finder is fed into an Arduino through a preamp. The Arduino also controls stepper motors for the dish’s azimuth and elevation control, which lets it sweep the sky and build up a map of signal intensity. The result is a clear band of bright spots representing the geosynchronous satellites visible from [Justin]’s location in Brazil.\nModifications are definitely on the docket for [Justin], including better equipment that will allow him to image the galactic center. There may be some pointers for him in our coverage of a tiny SDR-based radio telescope, or from this custom receiver that can listen to Jupiter.\nContinue reading “See Satellites With A Simple Radio Telescope”\nParabolic reflectors are pretty handy devices. Whether you’re building a microwave antenna or a long-distance directional microphone, suitable commercial dishes aren’t that hard to come by. But a big, shiny mirror for your solar death-ray needs is another matter, which is where this pressure-formed space blanket mirror might come in handy.\nPressure-forming was a great choice for [NighthawkInLight]’s mirror. We’ve covered pressure-formed plastic domes before, and this process is similar. A sheet of PVC with a recessed air fitting forms the platen. The metallized Mylar space blanket, stretched across a wooden frame to pull out the wrinkles and folds, is applied to a circle of epoxy on the platen. After curing, a few puffs with a bicycle tire pump forms the curve and stretches the film even smoother. [NighthawkInLight]’s first attempt at supporting the film with spray foam insulation was a bust, but the later attempt with fiberglass mesh worked great. A little edge support for the resulting shiny taco shell and the mirror was capable of the required degree of destructive potential.\nWe doubt this process can be optimized enough to produce astronomy-grade mirrors for visible light, but it still has a lot of potential applications. Maybe a fiberglass radio astronomy dish could be pressure-formed directly with a rig like this?\nMany Ham Radio operators in the United States participate in Field Day. This is an annual exercise where radio operators are encouraged to set up stations in conditions that might occur after a natural disaster. Usually, this means taking over some park or camp site, bringing generators, portable equipment, and making it all work for the weekend before you tear it back down.\nIt isn’t much of a Field Day without electricity. That’s why most stations use a generator, solar cells, or even batteries. Today, though, you probably need an Internet-connected computer to do logging and other features. [HamRadioConcepts] has a video (see below) that shows how they grabbed Internet from a distance for their Field Day site.\nContinue reading “Ham Radio WiFi”', 'Whats is Radio Astronomy?\nIntroduction: What is radio astronomy [reference: pictortelescope.com]\nRadio astronomy is a subfield of astronomy that studies celestial objects at radio frequencies. Unlike traditional telescopes that observe the sky in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum (400-700 nm), radio telescopes observe the sky in wavelengths ranging from centimeters to a few meters.\nA diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum, showing various properties across the range of frequencies and wavelengths.\nBut why should we observe in radio wavelengths?\nThere are several reasons to observe the sky at radio frequencies. The most common reason radio astronomers point radio telescopes to the sky is to study sources that produce radio emissions: radiation that is invisible to the human eye, but is capable of providing compelling information to astronomers & astrophysicists.\nA significant advantage radio astronomers have over IR, UV and high-energy astronomers is the atmospheric window: our atmosphere is completely transparent to radio waves, so we don’t need to send large radio antennas to space (like we usually have to do with IR/UV/high-energy astronomy satellites) in order to efficiently expose our instruments to the sky.\nA diagram showing the amount of absorption of each wavelength of light by the Earth’s atmosphere, highlighting the atmospheric windows.\nIt is also worth noting that radio observations can be carried out during both daytime and nighttime, and even under poor weather conditions (e.g. clouds)!\nLast but not least, we can utilize the techniques of radio interferometry and aperture synthesis using large arrays of antennas to achieve extremely high (angular) resolution observations, which is how the first image of a black hole became possible (the combination of several radio telescopes around the world allowed the Event Horizon Telescope team to create a virtual telescope the size of the Earth)!\nThe Very Large Array (VLA) is one of the most sophisticated radio telescope arrays in the world, consisting of twenty-seven 25-meter radio antennas that can function as a high-resolution radio interferometer.\nSo… What can I observe with a radio telescope?\nThere are plenty of sources in the sky that present radio emissions, including galaxies, supernova remnants, nebulae, radio galaxies, quasars, pulsars, masers and more. Since the radio telescope you’ll be using is primarily used to detect the neutral hydrogen concentration of the spiral arms of the galaxy, we will focus our attention on the hydrogen line.\nThe 21-centimeter hydrogen line\nThe hydrogen line refers to the electromagnetic radiation spectral line that is created by a change in the energy state of neutral hydrogen atoms. This electromagnetic radiation is at the approximate frequency of 1420.4 MHz, which is equivalent to the wavelength of approximately 21 cm ( λ =c/v). This wavelength falls within the radio region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and it is frequently observed by radio astronomers.\nThe exact mechanism under which hydrogen atoms emit electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength of 21 cm is slightly complicated.\nWhy observe at radio wavelengths?\nThere are several reasons to observe at radio wavelengths. Below we will show you the advantages and disadvantages:\nRadio astronomy can be done from the earth without being too much affected by the weather (although the quality of the observations is better with good weather)! However, there is now also a radio antenna in space, to further improve the resolution of the observations.\nDay and night\nRadio telescopes observe day and night (although for some observations the influence of the sun is negative!)\nAbout 90 % of the visible matter in the Universe is Hydrogen (wavelength: 21.106114 cm). With a radio telescope, we can study the most abundant element in the Universe.\nRadio waves are not affected by absorption. Optical waves are absorbed by e.g. dust clouds that are floating between the stars (like a sort of interstellar fog ). Radio telescopes see straight through these dust clouds.\nOn the negative side, to get good quality images that show all the details of the celestial objects it is more complicated than, e.g. at optical wavelengths. This has to do with long wavelengths of radio waves. To get good angular resolution requires large telescopes.\nA complicated procedure is required to produce the images of the observed objects (in other words, the observer does not see the images straight away). This procedure uses very powerful computers and it is necessary because of the way the observations are done.']	['<urn:uuid:77c78fdf-f686-44f4-b266-b47eac39916a>', '<urn:uuid:c0cec02f-19fe-4092-af2b-f3bbee760a0f>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	6	112	2357
67	What are the key differences between primary snoring and sleep apnea in children, and how can medical professionals tell them apart?	Primary snoring (PS) and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) cannot be reliably distinguished based on symptoms, physical examination, or history alone. While primary snoring is snoring that doesn't cause sleep disruption or breathing problems, sleep apnea involves prolonged partial blocking or intermittent blocking of breathing during sleep. A sleep study is the gold standard test for telling the difference. When snoring lasts longer than a brief respiratory infection or doesn't respond to allergy treatment, it requires thorough evaluation, often involving ear-nose-and-throat, neurology, or pulmonary specialists.	['Snoring, Obstructive sleep apnea, OSAS, Adenotonsillar hypertrophy\nIntroduction to sleep apnea:\nParents are quick to mention some things to their pediatrician: fevers, seizures, and bleeding. Snoring is another important symptom that your child’s doctor needs to know about, though it often goes unreported.\nAny child who snores may have obstructive sleep apnea, and may not be getting adequate sleep.\nNot all kids with sleep apnea snore. Even when they do, sleep apnea is often overlooked. Instead, the child may be diagnosed with a behavioral disorder — most commonly ADHD.\nWhat is sleep apnea?\nMost people make some quiet snoring noises when they have (or are recovering from) a cold but this quickly resolves after the cold. Some people snore even when not ill, and some snore loud enough that others can easily hear them. In these cases, snoring may be the sign of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), where there is prolonged partial blocking, or intermittent blocking, of breathing during sleep. The obstruction is usually caused by large tonsils or adenoids, which may be temporarily enlarged by infection or allergies.\nChildren with sleep apnea do not get sound sleep. They may also get suboptimal oxygen to the brain at night. Obstructive sleep apnea can have a serious negative impact on a child’s intellect and behavior.\nOSAS can cause growth problems. It has also been linked to ADHD, poor school performance, learning difficulties, bedwetting, high blood pressures, lung disease, heart disease, and rarely even death.\nOSAS is different from primary snoring (PS), the name given to snoring that doesn’t cause sleep disruption or breathing problems. Primary snoring is more common than OSAS.\nWho gets sleep apnea?\nOSAS occurs in about 2 percent of children. The peak age is 2 to 5 years old, but it can occur at any age.\nIn older children and adults, it is more common among the obese. It is also common in those with sickle cell disease, Down syndrome, birth injuries, or any other condition that might narrow the upper airway.\nWhat are the symptoms of sleep apnea?\nClassically, those with sleep apnea snore quite loudly for a bit, then are silent (sometimes not appearing to breathe), then snort briefly, move about, and resume snoring. If snoring is accompanied by nighttime breathing difficulty and pauses in breathing, then it may well be sleep apnea.\nHowever, many children with OSAS do not follow this classic pattern. OSAS and PS cannot be reliably distinguished from each other based on the symptoms alone.\nOther common symptoms of sleep apnea include mouth breathing, restless sleep, difficulty paying attention during the day, decreased academic performance, oppositional behavior, and restlessness.\nIs sleep apnea contagious?\nHow long does sleep apnea last?\nChildren often outgrow OSAS within several years.\nHow is sleep apnea diagnosed?\nSnoring should be brought to the attention of your pediatrician. You might want to make a cassette tape of your child’s sleep noises to bring with you.\nOSAS and PS cannot be reliably distinguished from each other based on the physical examination and history alone. Other tests must be used. A sleep study is the gold standard test for telling the difference. Thus, snoring needs to be reported to the doctor, and when snoring lasts longer than a brief respiratory infection, or fails to respond to allergy treatment, it deserves thorough evaluation. Often pediatricians enlist the help of ear-nose-and-throat, neurology, or pulmonary specialists to help distinguish between the two.\nHow is it treated?\nBecause enlarged tonsils and adenoids usually cause the obstruction, removing them can usually solve the problem.\nSometimes the obstruction is treated with gentle positive air pressure in the airway at night – nasal CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure).\nSupplemental oxygen, and correction of anemia may provide additional help.\nDecongestants, steroids, antibiotics, or other medicines might reduce snoring caused by enlarged tonsils or adenoids in PS but are unlikely to be of much help with true obstructive sleep apnea.\nHow can it be prevented?\nEarly treatment of primary snoring might prevent the cycle that leads to obstructive sleep apnea. Preventing or treating obesity and nasal congestion can also help protect children from OSAS.\nRelated A-to-Z Information:\nAdenovirus, Allergies (Allergic Rhinitis), Anemia (Low hemoglobin), Asthma, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),Bronchiolitis,Cerebral Palsy, Cleft Lip and Palate, Common Cold, Congenital Heart Disease, Cough, Croup, Depression, Down Syndrome, Enuresis (Bedwetting), Epilepsy, Gastroesophageal Reflux, Head Banging,Obesity, Pertussis (Whooping cough), Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), TonsillitisReviewed by: Khanh-Van Le-Bucklin, Liat Simkhay Snyder\nLast reviewed: November 14, 2013']	['<urn:uuid:9b43af25-b707-4570-8bd6-f922846db900>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	21	85	743
68	advantages bonding plastic with glue	Compared to mechanical fasteners and welding, structural adhesives provide several advantages: they evenly distribute stress, act as sealants, reduce noise and vibration, help prevent corrosion, and maintain the original finish of exterior surfaces. Additionally, adhesives can join dissimilar materials that would be impossible or costly to join with mechanical fasteners and welding, giving designers more freedom in material selection. For plastics specifically, urethanes are effective at bonding a wide range of plastics, including hard-to-bond polyolefins when combined with surface treatments.	"['Companies with roots and expertise in traditional welding operations are increasingly ready to give ""glue"" a try.\nIndustrial Assembly and Components Lord Corp.\nCompared to mechanical fasteners and welding, structural adhesives evenly distribute stress, act as sealants, reduce noise and vibration, help prevent corrosion, and maintain the original mill finish of exterior surfaces of thin panels. Adhesives join dissimilar materials impossible or costly to join with mechanical fasteners and welding. This gives designers more freedom to choose the best combination of materials for the task.\nAlthough adhesive acceptance has grown, there\'s still a perception that traditional welds ""look"" stronger. Unfamiliarity and misinformation about the adhesives and associated assembly process also hampers their use. However, OEMs that have integrated adhesives into their designs have benefited from immediate return on investment, reduced labor and material costs, and more-efficient production. Additionally, OEMs often command a premium for adhesive-bonded assemblies because of their reliability and surface aesthetics that are better than those of their welded or rivetedcounterparts.\nBut how does a designer switch to an adhesive joint? The key is embracing the conversion process. This includes understanding the chemistry behind adhesives, outlining a proper implementation plan, and partnering with a reputable adhesive supplier.\nOf all the polymers available for sealing and bonding, only five are regarded as structural. Acrylics, cyanoacrylates (CAs), epoxies, urethanes, and anaerobics provide strength and durability comparable to or greater than the materials they bond. CAs, or super glues, have limited structural applications, as do anaerobics, better known as threadlockers. For all practical purposes, therefore, the list of chemistries can be narrowed to acrylics, epoxies, and urethanes.\nUnderstanding the type of chemistry being used is important. In general, acrylics excel at bonding unprepared metals, composites, and thermoplastics. Epoxies give the highest strengths when bonding prepared metals, composites, and natural substrates. Urethanes offer resiliency and flexibility and are candidates for joining composites, thermoplastics, natural materials, and prepared metals.\nIt is important to remember that structural adhesives are thermoset polymers. They will not melt or change with environmental exposure, temperature, or time. Acrylics and epoxies can withstand temperatures from 40 to 400°F. Most urethanes are good up to 300 or 350°F with a low-end slightly better than the others. Exposure to tap and saltwater, humidity, oil, gasoline, solvents, and other environmental factors won\'t weaken bond strength in properly designed joints.\nMetal bonding: Toughened acrylic adhesives are the best choice for joining similar and dissimilar metals. For painted, primed, or prepared metals, urethanes or epoxies are often specified, while epoxies work best for assemblies exposed to ultrahigh heat or joints that will see exceptionally high shear stress. For impact resistance and toughness, toughened acrylics are tops.\nThermoplastic bonding: Urethanes bond an array of plastics including hard-to-bond polyoelfins (polyethylene and polypropylene) when combined with surface treatments. Epoxies and acrylics are good, but can be too stiff for low modulus materials such as the polyoelfins. Other adhesive chemistries work well as a ""modulus bridge"" between softer plastics and stiffer substrates when cross-bonding plastics to metals or composites. Composites (including sheetmolding compounds, fiberglass, fiber-reinforced plastics, pultrusion, and carbon-fiber substrates): Urethanes and acrylics are well known for their composite bonding abilities. They need little or no surface prep, are easy to handle, and quickly cure at room temperatures. Toughened epoxies that can be heat accelerated are candidates for giving ultrahigh-strength and demanding performance. Custom epoxies are the best option for highly specialized aerospace applications.\nNatural products (wood, stone, plywood, natural/synthetic rubber, and fabrics): Epoxies and urethanes are top candidates because acrylics may not cure on porous surfaces. Urethanes work best if these substrates have residual moisture that they can react with. Rubberlike materials need surface pretreatments while ""stone"" materials must be free of dust and loose surface materials before bonding.\nFor cross-bonding one material class to another, it\'s prudent to collaborate with an adhesive maker having the broadest range of chemistries and products. They will be able to pinpoint a workable fit between competing demands such as material selection, assembly processes, and desired economics.\nAN ACTION PLAN\nNothing is more vital to a successful project than a firm commitment to following an implementation plan. First, determine the goals of the project and audit current joining processes to estimate potential savings that will help justify the switch to adhesive bonding. Audits normally require a tour of the manufacturing facility and discussions with designers, manufacturing engineers, and shop-floor personnel. If the audit is promising, then substrate testing to confirm bond performance follows.\nBond trials are the most effective method to demonstrate the ability of a proposed adhesive process. Using the information gathered during the plant tour and audit, designers choose applications suitable for conversion to adhesives based on how they impact costs, process, aesthetics, and throughput. Trials also answer many of the process questions that tend to arise in this kind of change and help fine-tune any manufacturing steps that are unfamiliar to factory personnel. It is important to note that decisionmakers capable of changing the process or design should take part in trials as their buy-in is crucial to the overall switch.\nPUTTING ADHESIVES TO THE TEST\nTesting procedures vary depending on the overall objective. In some cases, laboratory testing of the substrates is all that is needed. But more often than not, it will be necessary to attempt to break the bonded assemblies. This is sometimes done with brute force using sledgehammers and chisels. Testing, however, is often more sophisticated. It can range from in-house procedures (with specific test parameters) to field trials or, as in the transportation sector, can encompass strict standardized test specifications.\nAdhesive suppliers may also add their own tests to verify product performance. They can include both physical and long-term or accelerated environmental testing. And finally, it\'s best to check the adhesive\'s track record for similar applications. One common mistake is assuming that a failure of one type of adhesive eliminates adhesives as an option altogether. The failure may be caused by the supplier making an unwise product selection, not understanding process ramifications, or by picking the wrong applications for adhesives in the first place.\n4-Star Trailers, (405) 324-7827, 4startrailers.com\nEllsworth Adhesives, (800) 888-0698, ellsworth.com\nFreeman Marine Equipment Inc., (888) 373-3626, freemanmarine.com\nLord Corp., (877) 275 5673, lord.com\nScelzi Enterprises Inc., (800) 858-2883, seinc.com']"	['<urn:uuid:463551c2-0083-4dcc-b051-bf146b251173>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	5	80	1040
69	What exactly happens to the ratio of Carbon-14 to Carbon-12 atoms in an organism after it dies, and how is this used to determine its age?	When an organism dies, it stops consuming carbon, and since C-14 is radioactive, it begins to decay while C-12 remains stable. As a result, the ratio of C-14 to C-12 atoms in the organism decreases over time - the older the organism, the more C-14 has decayed, resulting in a smaller ratio. Archaeologists use this decreasing ratio to date samples like trees or fossils.	['Carbon is indispensable to biological life. All life on Earth is based on it. If it weren’t for the amiability of carbon, simple organic matter couldn’t have evolved to achieve the extraordinary, inscrutable complexity it now boasts: the complexity to develop a system to sense, to breathe, to digest, to excrete and in a lean, hairless primate, even a system to think.\nHowever, a tiny percentage of this carbon is radioactive! Measuring the quantity of this radioactive carbon in organic matter allows us to determine its age; the method of doing so is called radioactive carbon dating or, simply, carbon dating. Here’s how it works.\nCarbon has a twin brother that only a few know about. Our planet is constantly pelted with high-energy cosmic rays hurled by the sun. These rays, which teem with neutrons, react with the nitrogen in our atmosphere to produce carbon-14 or C-14 atoms, an isotope of the carbon-12 or C-12 atom.\nAn element and its isotope exhibit the same electric properties, but different physical properties. This is because both elements comprise the same number of protons and electrons, but a different number of neutrons. The twins are then identified by different denotations, highlighting the number of neutrons, which is appended to the element’s symbol. C-12 has 12 neutrons, while C-14 has 14 neutrons; both, however, have 6 protons and electrons.\nThe key things about C-14 are that it is radioactive, that it is unstable, which forces it to emit particles and therefore decay over time.\nThe Principle of Carbon-Dating\nThe radioactive carbon will react with oxygen in the atmosphere to produce radioactive carbon dioxide. This radioactive carbon dioxide is breathed in and stored by plants, which are consumed by herbivores, who are preyed on by carnivores or omnivores, such as humans. The carbon content of every organism under the atmosphere therefore is composed of mostly C-12 atoms and a minuscule number of C-14 atoms.\nThe organisms, while they do consume carbon, also expel it when they exhale. The transaction or the cycle of producing, consuming and expelling C-14 atoms occurs in a way that, even though the amounts of C-12 and C-14 atoms in the environment and in an organism may vary, their ratio will remain the same. This is the working principle of carbon dating: despite the transactions, a living organism maintains the same ratio of C-14 to C-12 atoms as found in the environment.\nHowever, when an organism dies, it ceases to consume carbon. Now, because C-14 is radioactive, it begins to decay. The ratio of C-14 to C-12 atoms in the organism now decreases. The older the organism, the more C-14 is decayed, so the smaller the ratio. This ratio is used by archaeologists to date, say, a tree or a fossil.\nThey refer to the following equation to measure a sample’s age:\nThe equation dictates the decay of a radioactive isotope. Here, Nᵒ represents the number of atoms of the isotope in the sample at t=0 or when the organism, a part of whom now forms the sample, died, while N represents the number of atoms left after time t has passed.\nRemember that the ratio of C-14 to C-12 atoms in the organism and the environment is the same when it is alive. The knowledge of this ratio, which we already possess, allows us to obtain the value of Nᵒ, the original number of C-14 atoms. The current value N, however, must be measured. The C-14 atoms in the sample are counted by delicate instruments, such as beta-counters and mass accelerator spectrometers.\nλ is an element constant whose value for C-14 is 8,267. The time t that has since passed or the age of the sample can be obtained by rearranging the equation:\nIs Carbon Dating Reliable?\nThe radioactivity of an element is measured in terms of its half-life: the time it takes to decay half of its constituents. The half-life of C-14 is 5,370 years, which means that it becomes half of what it originally was in 5,370 years, one-fourth in 10,740 years, one-eighth in 16,110 years and so on.\nExtend the trend and one discerns that accurately measuring that the entirety of the atoms decays or, at least the percentage below which they become undetectable, after around 50,000 years. Consequently, dating a sample older than 50,000 years may produce erroneous results.\nComposite techniques have been devised that combine carbon dating with techniques to calibrate and extend its scope, but even those techniques are inherently fallible. Carbon dating is therefore only unquestionably accurate for a few thousand years; any results beyond that frame is questionable. This is the major limitation of carbon dating.\nWhat’s more, carbon dating seems to be based on a fallacy. It is fundamentally based on the assumption that the ratio of C-14 to C-12 atoms in the environment has always been the same throughout each and every Age.\nThis is certainly not true. Since the Industrial Revolution, in particular, we have diluted the amount of C-12 atoms in the environment by shamelessly dumping into it an alarming quantity of carbon dioxide, produced by the burning of fossil fuels. An increase in C-12 means that the ratio is now reduced, which means that the age of a sample will measure to be older than it really is!\nConversely, nuclear explosions produce tremendous amounts of C-14, so the plethora of nuclear tests we have conducted has increased its amount in the atmosphere. This increases the ratio, causing the age of a sample to measure younger than it really is.\nStill, with the knowledge of the amount of deviation that an increase or decrease in C-14 atoms will cause, we can account for these discrepancies by simply subtracting or adding the error from or to the apparent age to obtain the real age. Again, carbon dating might not be unquestionably accurate, but it’s good enough.']	['<urn:uuid:ac8c9ace-89e9-410c-8ce5-7c20a828f2d7>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	26	64	977
70	I've been having trouble holding my aim steady while shooting arrows. Between compound and recurve bows, which one makes it easier to hold the drawn arrow for longer periods?	Compound bows are significantly easier to hold steady at full draw. With a recurve bow, you must hold the full draw weight (typically 35-50lbs) on your fingers. In contrast, compound bows use a cam system that reduces the hold weight to around 20% of the full draw weight when at full draw. This let-off allows archers to hold the bow at full draw for much longer, providing more time for aiming.	"[""There are as many types of bows as there are types of archery. In most cases if you ask an archer why they shoot a particular bow type or style, the answer will be “Because I want to”.\nMost archers who have been shooting for a while will own a number of bows, and in many cases, these will be of different types. There are examples of most bow types available to suit all pockets, with entry level equipment costing less than £100, but if you can afford it there are also examples costing multiple thousands of pounds.\nWhichever type of bow you choose to shoot, there is normally a category or class which you can fit into to shoot competitively\nTraditional archery is archery in its original form. Beautiful bows emphasising natures raw materials. No gadgets. No aids. Just your skill with a bow and arrow.\nIf you want to be Olympic champion, you’ve got to look at recurve bows. Still the most popular style of archery in the UK, recurve archery is accessible by people of all abilities and is usually the first bow an archer will learn on.\nAnd what’s even better, is there are bows to match all budgets, sizes and strengths! Olympic Recurve Bow - as the name suggests this is the type of bow used by archers competing in the Olympics.\nTypically, the limbs (The springy bits at the top and bottom) can be removed from the riser (Handle) making it a take-down bow. In most cases the limbs will fit to the riser using the IFL (International Limb Fitting) standard. This standard, which has been adopted my most major manufacturers of archery equipment, means that archers can build bows using risers and bows from different manufacturers.\nRisers and limbs come in different lengths. Mixing these allows an archer to build a bow of the correct overall length for them. Limbs also come in different draw weights (How much weight you’re holding when you pull back the string). Olympic archers will typically draw 35lb to 50lbs.\nIn the recurve bow class, the bow is fitted with a number of add on bits. A sight to assist with aiming. An arrow rest to assist arrow clearance on release. A draw length check or “clicker” to allow the archer to measure how far they pull back the string to ensure this is the same every shot. A Long rod (Rod sticking out the front with weights on) and side rods (Rods sticking out the side, also with weights on).\nThe purpose of all these rods and weights is to give the bow stability and to help ensure it stays stable when an arrow is released. If you choose to shoot yours without the sight etc. then you’re in the world of bare bow archery.\nFondly referred to as ‘the dark side’. Usually by those that have not yet ‘seen the light’. Pretty much the “state of the art” as far as bow design is concerned, the compound bow was invented in the 1960s. Compound bows are designed for maximum accuracy and are the latest development in archery equipment.\nThe main difference between a compound bow and a recurve bow is the wheels attached to each limb. The wheels at the top and bottom are actually cams which make the draw weight reduce through the draw. With a recurve bow at full draw, the archer is holding the full weight on their fingers. With a compound bow at full draw, due to the action of the cams, the archer will only be holding around 20% of the full weight. This allows the archer to hold the bow at full draw for much longer ensuring much more time for aiming.\nCompound is the most accurate bow style. Release aids and scopes add to the accuracy. Arrow speed is faster giving a flatter trajectory. The compound bow division is hugely popular and depends more on skill than physical strength.\nBut don't be fooled into thinking this makes winning easier. Your competitors will have these same advantages too!\nJapanese Yumi Bow\nAs can be seen from the picture these are somewhat disproportionate looking bows. Originally used by Samurai warriors they are now used in a very stylised form of archery, where it is more the style that is important rather than the accuracy.\nWith a history dating back over 2000 years, crossbows continue to evolve and thrive today.\nOut club does not allow crossbows."", 'While there are several types of bows available for archery, the most commonly used ones are the compound and recurve bows. If you are a beginner looking for your first bow, any research you conduct will likely help you make an informed choice on whether to go for a recurve or compound bow. Both bows are great in their own right. Here we’ll give a compound recurve bow comparison, seeing what makes each bow type unique.\nFor instance, the recurve bow has a simple design that makes archery easy and lots of fun for beginners. Compound bows, on the other hand, are considered the most accurate bows ever made. They are, therefore, the perfect fit for anyone looking to stick with archery. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each bow type, as well as the differences between the two bows, is your best bet of making the right choice for you.\nDifference in Design\nOne of the major differences of recurve and compound bows lies in the design of the bows. A recurve bow is sometimes referred to as a traditional bow because it has a similar design to bows used in the past. There are even some current day recurves which retain the traditional bow design of one solid piece with a string running across the ends of the bow.\nMost recurve bows however, feature the more modernized takedown design of a 4-part bow. These parts include a riser, upper and lower limbs, and a bowstring. The riser, which is the middle part you hold onto while drawing and releasing an arrow, has mounts for the limbs, sight, and a few other bow accessories. The limbs in turn have a unique curve at the tips (a design first developed by Egyptian archers thousands of years ago) with a single bowstring resting across the tips of the limbs.\nCompound bows are a much recent development than recurves with the first compound bow developed in the mid-20th century. This bow type was designed to improve on the draw power of traditional bows, which is why compound bows have an entirely different design from that of the recurves. Unlike the 4-part recurve bows, which can be taken down, compound bows stay as a single unit that comprises of a riser (which holds the limbs), bowstring, and a system of pulleys (also referred to as cams or wheels) attached at the tips of each limb. The string passes through the cams several times giving off the impression that compound bows have a series of strings.\nDifference in Draw Technique\nAlthough different in design all bows share the similarity of using the mechanical advantage of leverage to store energy in flexed limbs as one draws on them by pulling back the bowstring. It is this stored energy that enables a bow to shoot an arrow faster and farther than the human hand can throw one. The difference in bow performance, however, comes in the manner in which the said energy is stored.\nRecurve bows store all their energy directly onto the limbs. As a result, the further back you pull the limbs of a recurve bow, the more the energy that will be transferred onto the arrow, and the faster the arrow will move once released. Unfortunately, the effort it takes to draw a recurve bow increases the further back you pull the bowstring. So, if you manage to draw a recurve bow all the way to its maximum point (usually referred to as ‘draw weight’), you will be holding the entire of that weight in your hands. Draw weights vary from one recurve bow to the next with the common weights being between 50 – 80lbs. Therefore, you can imagine just how hard it can be to balance those amounts of weight between your hands.\nCompound bows on the other hand, function like recurves up to a certain point. At first, pulling back a compound bow’s string is hard and only gets harder the further back you pull. However, at a certain point, the load suddenly decreases making it easy to hold back the string. This is thanks to the cams at the tips of the compound bow. These cams are designed to create a let off’ at the end of a draw. Basically, they take off a certain percentage (anywhere between 60-80%) of the draw weight when your pull the string all the way back to the let off point. For this reason, it takes much less effort to draw a compound bow compared to a recurve.\nPros and Cons of Recurve\nDue to the difference in design, compound and recurve bows each offer their own set of pros and cons. For instance, the simple design of recurves gives these bows the benefits of being:\n- Cheaper than compound bows since recurves do not require specialized parts\n- Simple to shoot as no serious adjustments are needed\n- Easy to maintain\nUnfortunately, the simplicity of the bow’s design also causes a few problems. These include the fact that recurves:\n- Are less powerful than compound bows\n- Are difficult to draw and therefore require plenty of skill from an archer for accurate shots to be made\nPros and Cons of Compound\nSimilarly, the complex design of compound bows gives these devices several pros and cons. For the pros, you get to enjoy:\n- A sturdy construction that allows for enhanced durability\n- A powerful force that can be especially useful during hunting\n- High level of accuracy that can be further improved with the use of sights and other accessories\n- More speed\nAs for cons, compound bows:\n- Cost more\n- Are hard to repair\n- Have high maintenance costs\nBest Compound Recurve Bow Selections\nWhen it comes to compound and recurve bow options, the SAS Explorer takedown recurve with Metal Riser and the Bear Archery Cruzer 70lb compound bow are considered the best beginner bow options in their respective fields. These bows would therefore make an ideal fit for beginners looking to choose between compound bows and recurves. Read on to find out more about the bows.\n|Product||SAS Explore Metal Riser Takedown Recurve Bow||70lb Bear Archery Cruzer Compound Bow|\n|Draw Weight||Interchangeable Limbs for 22lbs, 26lbs, 30lbs, 34lbs||Adjustable between 5lbs and 70lbs|\n|Draw Length||28"" ideal; pull to your ideal draw||Adjustable between 12"" to 30""|\n|Assembly and Disassembly||Relatively Quick; may require a stringer||Difficult; may require professional assistance|\nSAS Explorer Metal Riser Takedown Recurve Bow\nRecurve bows are well known for their characteristic curve at the limb tips. Despite allowing the bows to hold a lot of power, they make it difficult to draw a recurve to its maximum point. For this reason, recurve bows usually attract expert archers who have a bit more experience in bow usage. The SAS Explore Metal Riser Takedown Recurve Bow, however, seeks to turn things around. It offers a design that makes it easy for beginners to use the bow.\nWith a length of 66”, this bow is longer than most recurves. The extra inches give the bow the advantage of reducing much of the string pinch’ situation that is common with shorter bows. String pinch is a condition where fingers of the bowstring hand get pinched when the bow is nearing full draw. With the string pinch situation reduced, beginner archers will have a much easier time drawing the SAS Explorer to its maximum draw point and holding that position long enough to make accurate shots.\nAnother nice touch to the SAS Explorer’s design is that the limbs can be interchanged. You can select limbs across a range of 22, 26, 30, and 34 pounds. Compared to most recurves whose draw weights start from 50lbs, the limbs on the SAS Explorer make it easy to achieve a full draw. As a result, this bow would make an excellent fit for those new to archery. It provides a great learning curve on how to use recurves. The interchangeable limbs also give this bow the advantage of making an ideal fit for shooters of varying heights even those as tall as 6’.\nOther highlights of this recurve bow include:\nDespite being one of the few takedown recurves that you can get on a budget, the SAS Explorer has a sturdy build that promises durability. Its riser is made of a high quality aluminum material. The limbs are made of maple laminations and strong fiberglass. According to users, this combination of materials gives the SAS Explorer a light feel, smooth performance, and the quality of high priced recurves.\nA Beautiful Look\nAnother great thing about this bow is that it has a stylish look that is sure to turn heads. The gorgeous maple build fiberglass limbs are complemented by the metal riser’s carefully polished finish. Together they give the bow a beautiful professional look. To top it up, the metal riser comes in the options of a blue or red color both of which add on to the overall look of the bow.\nOne of the biggest downfalls of takedown recurves is that most feature a complex assembly & takedown process that can make anyone dread using these bow types. The SAS Explorer however is one of the few exceptions. This bow’s simple design makes it very easy to put together (as well as takedown) the bow. Some users claim to be able to put together the bow and string it in under 5 minutes.\nOne of the common complaints among users is that the string, which comes with the bow, is too long. So, if you decide to purchase this bow, you should be prepared to buy the right sized string, twist the string to size, or take your bow to an archery shop to be properly strung.\nThere have also been a few complaints about the riser’s grip section. Some users say that it is too small to fit an average sized hand while others find the grip to be uncomfortable. This however may just be a matter of opinion as many users find the bow to be quite comfortable to draw.\nAnother downside of this SAS Explorer bow is that it is designed for right hand use only. So, if you hold your bow with the left hand, this bow will not be a good fit for you.\nCruzer – Ready to Hunt Compound Bow RH A5CZ21007R from Bear Archery\nWhen it comes to compound bows, the 70lb Bear Archery Cruzer Compound Bow is one of the best options available. Durable, sturdily built, versatile, highly accurate, and comfortable to hold, this bow literally offers you everything you would want in a compound bow. And the best part is that the Bear Archery Cruzer is designed to be used by archers of all stages. It may be enjoyed by all including beginners and experienced shooters.\nRight from its build, this compound bow is designed for serious business. It’s made from a quality aluminum material that can easily handle pressure brought on by frequent use or rough handling. And despite this high performance, the bow is comfortable to handle, as the aluminum material is lightweight while the bow itself only weighs 3.6lbs. In addition to that, the compound bow features what is referred to as the Max Pre-Load Quad limbs construction’. This is whereby the upper and lower limbs are split 2 ways. The biggest advantage of this construction method is that it protects the shooter’s hand by diminishing hand shock and vibrations. Therefore, you can shoot continuously for hours with this bow without feeling fatigued or experiencing muscle aches.\nWith this compound bow, you will also get to enjoy the fact that it:\nIs Highly Adjustable\nOne of the best features of the Cruzer compound bow from Bear Archery is that it can be used by anyone thanks to its stunningly wide range of adjustability in both draw length & draw weight. The draw length spans from 12-30 inches and can be adjusted with half-inch increments. The draw weight in turn can be adjusted from a 5lb point all the way to 70lbs thereby allowing every user to draw the bow at their own comfort.\nComes Loaded With All Relevant Accessories\nAs the name suggests, the Bear Archery Cruzer bow comes fully loaded, ready to hunt straight out from the box. Not only do you get a strung bow. You also get a quiver, a stabilizer, fiber optic sights, a high quality whisker biscuit arrow rest, and even a wrist strap. With these many accessories already available, all you will require to add is quality archery gloves and you will be ready for a fun and safe day of archery be it target shooting or bow hunting.\nThis bow is fitted with offset string suppressors, which reduce the vibrations made by the string after every arrow release. This feature comes in handy for those instances where you will be using the bow for a hunt.\nHas A Design That Enhances Accuracy\nThrough its combination of features, the Bear Archery Cruzer compound bow puts the user at a better position of allowing the user to make accurate shots. The lightweight build of the bow, max pre-load quad limbs construction, and adjustability of the bow make the bow easy to handle. Thus it allows the archer to direct his concentration on making accurate shots. What’s more, the bow itself is designed to eliminate hand torque. Hand torque is one of the biggest enemies of accuracy in bows.\nThe only downside of this compound bow is that it falls on the higher side of pricing. However, considering the quality and array of features, the price is well worth it.\nLike the SAS Recurve, this model is right-handed archers only.\nWhich Bow Is Right For You?\nSo, which of the above bows wins the epic compound recurve bow battle? Well, it all comes down to how you plan on using your bow. The SAS Explorer Metal Riser recurve makes a good fit for uses such as display and target practice where accuracy is not highly required. This recurve would also work for small game hunting. However, when it comes to serious bow usage such archery competitions, large game hunting, and sea bow fishing, the Bear Archery Cruzer 70lb compound bow would make a much better fit.']"	['<urn:uuid:d28aaffc-63f0-425b-bd78-85b6983813c7>', '<urn:uuid:31969714-a88e-4c7e-b485-b4768639f89d>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	29	71	3119
71	How do both natural and recycled stone materials serve as barriers in landscaping, and what role do geographical factors play in their environmental impact?	In landscaping, recycled granite cobblestones serve as effective barriers when installed about 1.5 inches above paved surfaces, preventing weed growth and mud migration. They can be installed using a base of coarse sand or crushed gravel for positioning. Regarding geographical factors, the environmental impact of stones and soil contaminants varies by region, with south central and southwest areas showing particularly heavy pollution levels, and different land-use types showing varying levels of contamination - garden soil being the most heavily polluted, followed by arable land and woodland.	"[""Edging With Granite Cobblestones\nDEAR TIM: I have several gravel garden pathways and a gravel drive. They look swell but I am constantly battling vegetation that creeps into the gravel. Mud will also wash onto both paved surfaces during periods of heavy rain. I am sure you have solved a problem such as this. The trick in my case is to install an edging on a very limited budget. I would also prefer to use a material that is very earth friendly and possibly one that is recycled. Beth D., Worcester, MA\nDEAR BETH: You have very strong mystic powers. I have solved the problem of migrating weeds for both past customers and my wife. There are any number of ways to do this some of which are more economical than others. But the solution I have used most often gets the highest amount of praise for both beauty, durability and creativity. As you might expect, this solution will be a bit pricey. But the edging I have in mind is one of the few materials that actually holds its value. In some instances, the materials I use actually are worth more money over time.\nVisit any home center, garden center or landscaping supply business and you will see all sorts of garden edging products. Some of these products are metal, while others are wood or plastic. Perhaps the least expensive edging products are the thin plastic ones that have a rounded top. Thin edging material comes in handy if your path and drive are curved. These materials bend around very tight radius curves.\nThe metal, wood and plastic materials might satisfy your earth-friendly requirement as they could be made from recycled materials. Wood edging that comes from sustainable forests would be a very responsible choice.\nBut the material I prefer to use for garden edging is one that meets or exceeds your environmental concerns by a longshot. I have a soft spot for rock-hard stones. In particular, I prefer to use salvaged and recycled granite cobblestones for garden and driveway edging. The cobblestones I have used in the past often served as ballast in sailing ships. They were often unloaded while the ships were in port and used as pavement in many older city streets and roads. Modern redevelopment often unearths these stones and the demolition contractor sells them to landscape supply or stone-supply businesses.\nYou can also buy new granite cobblestones. White, pink and gray are perhaps the most common colors. You may find ones that have been tumbled to produce softer edges. Laborers in India, South America and other nations still shape thousands of cobblestones each day and these imports stream into the USA on a regular basis.\nInstalling the cobblestones is very easy. Typically the stones are only five inches thick. I like to have about 1.5 inches of stone show above the paved surface. This creates a formidable barrier for weeds, grass and mud. If you dig a four-inch deep trench you can install a thin base of coarse sand or small crushed gravel under the stones. This material helps you position the cobblestones as they are very rarely the exact same height. It is very important to keep the top of the cobblestones in the same plane so the edging appears uniform.\nDo not install the cobblestones one at a time. I find it is best to dig the narrow trench and then position perhaps 15 or 20 stones in a line or around a curve. Use a short piece of 2x4 to help you maintain the finished height above the gravel surface. After you have the stones positioned, stand back and look at the curve or the line. If it looks good to your eye, then add small crushed gravel on the side that contacts the gravel path or driveway. Soil can be used to backfill the other side of the cobblestones. Use coarse sand or very small gravel chips to fill any spaces or cracks where one cobblestone touches another. This gravel helps lock the stones together.\nIf the granite cobblestones are too expensive for you, you have two choices: You can install them a few at a time as you can afford them or you can use a more affordable stone product. There is a distinct advantage when you select recycled granite cobblestones. There is only a finite amount of these worn cobblestones left on the planet's face. People are noticing the beauty and unique character of these stones. As such, the price is actually going up each year for these prized works of Mother Nature. I can tell you for a fact that my wife Kathy thoroughly enjoys the granite cobblestones that tame the grass and plants along our gravel driveway."", 'Pollution status of agricultural land in China: impact of land use and geographical position\nAccording to the Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan released in May 2016, the soil quality of 666 666.7 ha of agricultural soil requires remediation before 2020. Despite the survey on the environmental quality of soil in China released in 2014, detailed data on current pollutant concentrations remain unavailable. To date, reports on soil environmental quality on the national scale are few. The current research aimed to gain a detailed understanding of soil pollution in China through literature study and data analysis. Data for eight potentially toxic elements (i.e., arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb)) and two organic pollutants (i.e., hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs)) were collected from 367 areas involving 163 prefecture-level cities. Principal component analysis and clustering analysis were conducted to understand the relationships among pollutants. Results indicated that organic pollution was less severe than inorganic pollution. In terms of land-use types, garden soil showed the heaviest pollution, followed by arable land and woodland. Regarding geographic distribution, the south central and southwest areas displayed heavy pollution. Principal component and clustering analyses revealed that As, Hg, HCH, and DDTs were mainly contributed by anthropogenic sources; Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn were primarily caused by natural background; and Cd and Pb were contributed by both sources. The soil pollution status varied among land-use types and geographic areas. The implementation of proper remediation strategies requires detailed investigations on soil environmental quality.\nAli Hazrat, Khan Ezzat, Sajad Muhammad Anwar (2013): Phytoremediation of heavy metals—Concepts and applications.

72	Which architectural style appears in both Craiova and Brasov?	The Brancovenesti architectural style appears in both cities. In Craiova, several churches display this style, including the Saint Ilie Church built in 1720. In Brasov, the County Library features the Brâncovenesc Art Nouveau style.	['Oltenia (Lesser Wallachia in antiquated versions, with the alternate Latin names Wallachia Minor, Wallachia Alutana, Wallachia Caesarea in use between 1718 and 1739) is a historical province and geographical region of Romania, in western Wallachia. It is situated between the Danube, the Southern Carpathians and the Olt river (although counties to the east run across the river in Muntenia in some areas).\nA must stop for art lovers is the town of Targu Jiu on the banks of the Jiu River. This former market town is closely associated with Constantin Brancusi, the Romanian artist who is considered to be the founder of modern sculpture.\nSome of Romania’s most tranquil monasteries can be found in this region, including Horezu, a masterpiece of the ‘Brancovenesti’ architectural style and a designated UNESCO World Heritage site. Horezu is also a renowned pottery center, where travelers can marvel at the colorful pottery created in local workshops by talented artisans.\nWhen you mention traditional food in the Oltenia region, Oltenian sausages come first to mind – finely chopped beef and pork meat mixed with garlic, pepper and salt, and then stuffed into sheep guts and smoked for two hours. Then you have to mention beef ragout, carp stuffed with mushroom, lamb stew with chives and smoked bacon. In this region, like all over the country, onion and garlic are highly praised, combined with other ingredients to make deliciously savory dishes.\nThe university town of Craiova, founded on the site of the Dacian stronghold Pelendava (which later became the Roman Castra Nova), prides itself on the strong academic tradition and wealth of important historical figures who passed through here on their journey to fame: Wallachian Prince Mihai Viteazu – who served as the ban (military governor) of Craiova and achieved the first unification of the three Romanian principalities in 1600, the world-famous sculptor Constantin Brancusi – who studied at the Craiova Art School (Scola de Arte si Meserii) between 1894 – 1898 and carved his first sculptures here, and Craiova-born Petrache Poenary (1799- 1875) – inventor of the first cartridge fountain pen.\nThe majority of train locomotives in Romania originated at the Electroputere workshops in Craiova.\nIn 1913, the treaty of peace which ended the Balkan War, treaty known in history as The Peace from Craiova, was signed here.\nThe bans had the right of coining money stamped with their own effigies, hence the name of bani (centimes) in Romanian language.\nThe city hosts a great number of religious buildings, many of them dating back to medieval times. The Church of Cosuna Monastery for example is the oldest building preserved in Craiova, dating from the 15th century. You can spend a relaxing afternoon visiting the monastery, located only 2.1 miles outside of the city centre. Another religious site, Madona Dudu Church, is renowned for its mural paintings, completed by the famous Romanian painter Gheorghe Tattarescu (1818 – 1894).\nFor those who want to find out more about the history and the traditions of this region we recommend a visit to the Oltenia Museum, housed in Baniei House (1699), the oldest non-religious building that exists in Craiova and one of the oldest lay buildings in the country.\nArt lovers should definitely not miss the Art Museum in Craiova, hosted in the Dinu Mihail Palace, built in the early 1900s in neo-classic style by a French architect. The Museum exhibits valuable masterpieces created by famous Romanian painters, among them Craiova-born Theodor Aman (1831 – 1891) and Nicolae Grigorescu (1838 – 1907). One of its main attractions is the section dedicated to Constantin Brancusi, comprising six of his early sculptures.\nAt the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century, Craiova’s architecture underwent a transformation with the creation of the Brancovenesti style, a combination of Romanian traditional art, Byzantine and Venetian elements. Churches still displaying elements of the Brancovenesti style include: the Saint Ilie Church / Biserica Sfantu Ilie, built in 1720 by Ilie Oteteleseanu and the great tradesmen of the town, the All Saints Church / Biserica Tuturor Sfintilor (1700), the Old Saint Gheorghe Church / Biserica Sfantu Gheorghe Vechi (1730), the Obedeanu Monastery / Manastirea Obedeanu (1747), the Mantuleasa Church / Biserica Mantuleasa (1786), the Saint Nicolas Church / Biserica Sfantul Nicolae (1794).\nThe Jitianu Monk Monastery, located 4.6 miles south of the city centre, was built under the guidance of Lady Balasa, wife of ruler Constantin Basarab Carnu (1654- 1658), and houses a rich collection of medieval art objects. For those interested in enjoying a relaxing afternoon outside, the Nicolae Romanescu Park, is a veritable green oasis. The park is one of the valuable monuments of landscape architecture in Romania. The plans for the park, designed by French architect Emile Rendont, were awarded the gold medal at the 1900 World Fair. Through the initiative of Nicolae P. Romanescu, then mayor of Craiova, work on the park began in 1901 and was completed in 1903.\nFor the ones who want to experience the nature more scientifically, a stop at the Botanical Garden would be the best choice.\nHorezu Monastery & Horezu Pottery Center\nThe Horezu Monastery, the largest monastic settlement in Walachia, was founded in 1690 by Prince Constantine Brancoveanu. A masterpiece of the Brancovenesti style and a UNESCO World Heritage site, Horezu is renowned for the richness of its sculptural detail, the treatment of its religious compositions and its painted decorative works. The monastery houses precious collections of frescoes and icons dating from the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century. The nearby village of Horezu is home to one of the biggest pottery centres in Romania. Nearly a century ago, local nuns taught the villagers how to make and paint pottery, and ever since, people have come from far and wide to get their hands on Horezu’s ceramic.\nCurtea de Arges\nCurtea de Arges is a city in Romania, situated on the right bank of the Argeş River, where it flows through a valley of the lower Carpathians (the Făgăraş Mountains), on the railway from Piteşti to the Turnu Roşu Pass. It is part of the Argeş County.\nFifty miles east of Horezu you can visit another stunning architectural gem: the 16th century Curtea de Arges Monastery (Manastirea Curtea de Arges), toppled with two towers spiraling in opposite directions. Behold the sad legend of Manole as you take in its beauty. Romania’s first two kings and queens are buried here.\nA former Roman settlement, the city of Targu Jiu lies at the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, on the banks of the river Jiu. Inhabited since Paleolithic times, the region of western Oltenia was of strategic importance to the Romans. The area provided direct access, through one of the most spectacular passes in the Carpathians, to present-day Transylvania, the heart of the former Dacian Kingdom.\nConstantin Brancusi, one of the most influential modern sculptors of the 20th century, was born near Targu Jiu, in Hobita. Although he lived and worked for most of his life in Paris, his legacy is also preserved in Romania, in the city of Targu Jiu.\nThe Jiu River valley was the scene of heavy fighting during World War I and World War II. Here, in a monumental ensemble, Brancusi created three sculptures as a memorial to the 8,500 Romanian soldiers who died defending the Jiu Valley from the advancing German army. The three sculptures, the Silence Table (Masa Tacerii), the Kiss Gate (Poarta Sarutului) and the Endless Column (Coloana Infinitului), are placed on mile-long (1.5 km) east-west axis that runs through the heart of the city. The Table of Silence, made from limestone, features twelve chairs, originally placed much closer to the table and arranged in pairs.\nThe Kiss Gate, made out of marble, features a kiss motif on the gate pillars. The entire structure is supported on a steel axle, set in a concrete foundation of five square meters.\nThe Endless Column stacks 17 rhomboidal cast iron modules in a 30-meter high column. The modules, completed in 1938, were made in the central workshop of Petroşani. The column was restored in 1964.\nTargu Jiu is also the capital of Gorj County, a region of rolling meadows, grassy hills and mountain scenery with plenty of natural and cultural attractions to explore. Tiny towns and villages dot the county, and contain some marvelous traditional architecture. Several spa towns and monasteries high in the mountains make for popular excursions.', 'Brașov is the 7th largest city in Romania by population, with 253200 people registered at the 2011 census. Located in the Brașov Depression, at 625 m high altitude, at the feet of Tâmpa Hill, Brașov can be reached after 184 km North East from Bucharest.\nIn 2010, the inhabitants of Brașov celebrated 775 years since the first official attestation of Brașov city. The document proof is included in the Catalogus Ninivensis document, made between 1234-1241. This catalogue of monasteries form Transylvania and Hungary, lists all the establishment visited by the catholic priest Fredericus and in it Brașov is mentioned as “Corona”.\nBrașov was founded in 1211 by the Teutonic Knights on an ancient Dacian area and populated by Saxons, being one of the seven walled citadels (Siebenürgen) along with: Bistrița, Cluj Napoca, Mediaș, Sebeș, Sibiu, Sighișoara.\nIn time, the Saxon merchants who were sent here to populate several key cities within Transylvania, gained important wealth and political influence in the region, due mostly to the strategic position, at the intersection of the trade routes that linked the Ottoman Empire and western Europe.\nHence the etymology of the German city name, Kronstadt, as well as its Latin counterpart, Corona (Crown City) and the city’s coat of arms (a crown with the bottom part of a tree trunk and its roots, above which stands a representation of a fortification).\nThere are also many other spots and sightseeings within Brașov county: Sinaia, Predeal, Poiana Brașov, Bran, Moeciu, Râşnov, Făgăraş, Prejmer, Zărneşti, Sâmbăta (at the foot of the Făgăraş mountains).\nAny tourist guide who will show you the city can illustrate that a vast palette of architectural types has been identified here: Preromantic at Brașov Fortress, romantic at St. Bartholomew’s Church, Gothic at Black Church, Classic at Catherine’s Gate, Renaissance at the Town Hall, Baroque at the houses built in the eighteenth century, Viennese Rococo, Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque at palaces built in the nineteenth century, Brâncovenesc Art Nouveau at County Library, and the royal houses from Schei district and last, the modern style seen at post-1980 constructions.\nThe building which today houses the Brașov History Museum, served in the past as a gathering place for centurions (town councilors). This construction, build in the 13th century can be recognized by its watchtower called Trumpeter’s Tower. In the same square as the Old Town Hall stands other famous buildings such as: The Black Church, the Merchant’s House built in a Renaissance style, The Orthodox Cathedral and the Mureșeanu memorial museum.\nOr the Marienkirche by its German name, derives its name from the Great Fire of 1689, during which the damages withstood the restoration of almost 100 years. It was constructed between 1385 and 1477 on the grounds of a previous church destroyed by Mongols in 1242. Its construction was interrupted in 1421 by the damaging raids of Turks. At the exterior of the church can be seen only one of the two towers which were in the initial plan and also a very uncommon sculpture on the North buttress. It is a sculpture of a little boy, who seems on the brink of falling, a reminiscence of a fatal accident of a child who helped at the construction of this church. At the interior one can find the largest organs in the entire Eastern Europe, the largest bell, weighing seven tons and also a collection of Anatolian carpets from 119 donated German merchants between 17th and 18th century. Due to these carpets, the windows of the church have been recently changed with special UV-filtering glass.\nThis medieval church built in 1392 in wood and later in 1495 rebuilt in stone, it is enclosed by walls with large wooden gates and displays a central thin tower and 4 other small towers placed in corners. The church style is eclectic, combining Byzantine, Baroque and Gothic elements. Here can be found a small old cemetery where several important figures of Romania are buried, such as Nicolae Titulescu – finance minister, foreign minister and president of the League of Nations.\nKnown also as Markplatz among the previous local Saxons, due to the red-roofed houses which belonged in the past to merchants, is circled by impressive stone walls and 7 bastions. There is also a legend about the Pied Piper of Hamelin which concerns this square and speaks about the presumably withdrawal or death of a large number of children from Hamelin town in medieval Germany.\nSaint Nicholas Church also hold on it grounds one of the first learning centers of the Romanian people, the source of several of the first printed books in Romania. Among the exhibits of the museum, lies more than 4 thousand rare books or documents, printed or copied by hand, and the oldest Bible, printed on goat skin.\nThis street was used at first as an access point for firefighters and we consider it one of the narrowest street on the European Continent, with its 1.3 m wide.\nBeginning with the Saxons settlement in the early 12th century, the raids of Mongols, Turks and other tribes especially over Bartholoma and Corona, let to the construction of the town fortifications. Most of the fortifications were erected between 15th and 17th century, including the inner walls, gates and towers of which several survived till today. The defensive wall was once 12 m high, 2 m thick and 2 miles long, but most of the fortification was demolished during 19th century due to the expansion of the inhabitable area of the city. Most work was done between 1400 and 1650, when outer and inner walls were erected, together with massive defense towers and gates. Part of the defensive wall, once 40 feet high, seven feet thick and two miles long, can still be seen today, though most was taken down in the 19th century to make room for the city’s expansion.\nThis bastion was built in 1521 and has 4 levels of which the first is currently designated as a resting area for visitors and the rest houses exhibits with medieval objects. The pass between levels is made through interior staircase.\nThis semicircular tower is placed near the Graft Bastion, on a hill and can be reached after climbing approximately 200 stairs. The construction of this tower was finished in 1494 and presents a wooden staircase that goes up four levels.\nUnlike White Tower, The Black Tower has a rectangular shape, and is placed on Starja Hill. It was built in the same year, 1494 and has 4 levels connected by a narrow wooden ladder. The name of the tower comes from a large fire from 1559 created by lightning.\nThis construction which was attested in the historic chronicles for the first time in 1529, houses today the Brașov Archives with more than 100,000 old documents, among which 80 letters from 14th – 16th century. Here is also the oldest letter written in Romanian language from 1521 by a merchant from Câmpulung named Neacșu.\nThis gate is the only one who survived in its original form until present day. It was built in 1559 by the Tailors’ Guild and it was a small part of a larger construction which was demolished.\nThe gate was erected in 1827 under the order of Emperor Franz I replacing an older structure damaged after a fire. This gate was also known as Porta Valacce (Wallach’s Gate), as this was the only mean of entrance to the Schei district allowed to Romanians living there.\nThe fortress which now houses a restaurant, served in the past as a strategic point, part of a fortification and giving a look over the northern plains. It was first built in wood in 1524 and later replaced by a stone construction. The citadel was abandoned in 17th century.\nThis bastion is the best preserved one from the seven original watchtowers from the outer fortification system. This construction, built in two phases, one during 1421-1436 and the other in 1570-1573, houses today a museum with a permanent exhibition, the scale model of the city and Schei.\nAt the foot of Mount Tâmpa lies an alley called Tiberiu Brediceanu, often visited by people who like taking a walk and which takes you from one citadel to another. The mountain is also famous for the attack of Vlad Țepeș over Brașov, between 1458-1460, in which the original citadel, built right on the top of the mountain was destroyed.']	['<urn:uuid:f5f9d671-907e-4ae4-a041-61275fc901a4>', '<urn:uuid:46a5d0b5-b09b-4784-8b8e-673080a97a96>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	9	34	2800
73	ultrasonic inspection detect small defects near surface test object how work	Small defects near the surface of a test object can be detected by eliminating the constant wave signal reflected from the top surface of the test object. This allows detection of small signals that are normally masked by the larger interface signal, even when the interface signal magnitude is around one hundred times larger than the defect signal.

The method of ultrasonic object inspection testing of\nThis application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/266,854, filed Nov. 4, 2005.\nThe present invention is directed to a method and system for processing acoustic signals for use in ultrasonic inspection and testing, and more particularly to simultaneously processing an acoustic signal with multiple linear amplifiers to obtain a combined linear digital output signal having a dynamic response range that is greater than the individual ranges of the amplifiers.\nUltrasonic inspection employs high frequency, ultrasonic waves generated by a transducer to examine test objects and make measurements. Ultrasonic inspection can be used for detection of flaws in test objects, and for performing evaluation, dimensional measurements, material characterization, and more on objects. Measurement procedures initially developed for metals have been extended to engineered materials such as composites, where such characteristics as anisotropy and inhomogeneity are of concern. Advances in digitization and computing capabilities have changed the types of instruments and algorithms that are used in processing the resulting data. High-resolution imaging systems and multiple measurement modalities for characterizing a flaw have emerged. Of interest are detecting, characterizing, and sizing defects, as well as characterizing the materials in which they are found. The objectives of ultrasonic testing range from the determination of fundamental microstructural characteristics such as grain size, porosity, texture and preferred grain orientation, to material properties related to failure mechanisms such as fatigue, creep, and fracture toughness.\nIn ultrasonic testing, a transducer containing a piezoelectric element is excited by an electrical pulse to transmit an ultrasonic pulse into a test object. The sound wave propagates through the test object and is reflected. The transducer receives the reflected wave and the reflected wave is converted by the transducer into an electrical signal and analyzed to determine whether a discontinuity exists in the test object. A flaw or discontinuity in the test object is characterized by certain anomalous profiles in the electrical signal that are viewable on an analog display, such as an oscilloscope or a recording device.\nThe electrical signal from a transducer representing the reflected sound wave must be amplified for input into a display or recording device. In order to be displayed, the amplified signal must fall within a certain dynamic response range that is defined by the maximum and minimum operating parameters of the respective display device. In many cases, the signal representing the acoustic wave includes multiple components. For example, in the case of a flaw occurring near the surface of an object, the echo caused by the near-surface defect is received within the interval of the initial pulse. In that case the flaw is not detectable by a visual display, or a recording device, since the amplitude of the echo is small relative to the initial pulse. Since the instrument receives them concurrently, the relatively small-magnitude echo signal from the near-surface flaw is essentially superimposed on the larger initial pulse or interface signal. The large difference in amplitude of the two simultaneous signals makes the smaller signal very difficult to detect.\nPreviously, analog logarithmic amplifiers have been used in attempts to compress the dynamic response range, but analog amplifiers are not particularly well suited to perform this due to the limited bandwidth and dynamic response range of analog logarithmic amplifiers. Analog techniques are limited by noise and accuracy problems.\nTherefore there is a need for a device for digitally processing simultaneous ultrasonic signals having widely varying amplitudes and combining them for display into a continuous linear digital signal having a wide dynamic range.\nThe apparatus and method of the present invention provides a plurality of linear amplifiers simultaneously processing an ultrasonic signal. Each amplifier of the plurality of linear amplifiers has a predetermined gain level suitable for achieving the desired output signal level for input to an analog to digital (A/D) converter for processing. The output of each amplifier is sampled by each respective A/D converter at a very high frequency to convert the analog signal output of each of the linear amplifiers to a digital signal. Logic circuits simultaneously monitor all of the output digital signals from the A/D converters. The logic circuits determine which output of the A/D converters has the greatest linear output and stores the selected output in a memory storage device. The saved output waveforms are subsequently combined into a continuous linear digital output that has a dynamic response range that is approximately the sum of the individual dynamic response ranges of the individual A/D converters. The combined continuous linear digital output waveform may be accurately converted by corresponding computing to logarithmic scaling to produce a waveform having a wide dynamic range comparable to the output of a logarithmic amplifier.\nAn advantage object of the present invention is that the device can detect small defects near the surface of a test object by eliminating the constant wave signal reflected from the top surface of the test object and detecting the small signals that are normally masked by the constant wave signal reflected from the top surface.\nAnother advantage of the present invention is that simultaneous reflected waveforms can be measured and recorded having a wide dynamic response range with no distortion of the respective waveforms.\nYet another advantage of the present invention is that a wide dynamic response range is provided for the measurement of signals reflected from various depths in a material characterized by high signal attenuation.\nOther features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of the preferred embodiment, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.\nWherever possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.\nAs indicated in\nAnalog signal S is simultaneously processed by at least one attenuators.\nLogic circuits 118 analyze the signal levels of the digitized outputs d1, d2 of the A/D converters 106, 114 or if additional paths are used the digitized outputs of all paths. The logic circuits 118 determine which of the converters 106, 114 has the greatest output, which is linear, as the amplitude of signal S fluctuates. The logic circuits 118 determine whether the digitized output signal from each converter falls between a predetermined saturation threshold and a predetermined minimum signal level. Those outputs falling outside the desired band are eliminated—i.e., outputs above the predetermined saturation level or below the minimum signal level. The selected converter output waveforms that fall between the saturation threshold and minimum levels are saved to a digital memory storage device (not shown). The saved output waveforms of signals with different amplitudes are subsequently combined by logic circuits 18 to form a continuous linear digital output for display on an oscilloscope 20 or other peripheral device connected to the amplifier output. At each sample point, N.sub.1, N.sub.2, N.sub.3 etc., which occur every 20 nanoseconds at 50 MHz sample rate, the outputs from multiple A/D converters are available. Thus for sample point N.sub.1, logic circuits 18 decide which output is within range and this amplitude is used in the logic circuit output. Next for sample point N.sub.2, logic circuits 18 decide which A/D output to use in the logic circuit output. This process is continued for each sample point. Every 6 dB of attenuation (approximately) at the input to the 14-bit A/D converter 114 corresponds to an extra bit of sensitivity and a doubling of response range of the resulting logic circuit output signal. The dynamic response range of the resulting logic circuit output signal is greater than 20-bit, which corresponds with the sum of the multiple dynamic response ranges of individual amplifier and A/D converter combinations. The digitized signal may be converted to a logarithmic scaling by a corresponding conversion algorithm implemented in the logic circuits 18 for compressing the dynamic response range of the combined output signal to a screen or recorder presentation. This conversion algorithm produces logarithmic output that is more accurate over a greater dynamic range than can be produced by existing techniques.\nThe method, for converting an analog signal into a plurality of digital components representing a reflected ultrasonic waveform for testing objects, is set forth in\nIt is known that small defects present near the surface of a test object are difficult to detect. The reflected waveform from the near-surface defect is very small, relative to the interface signal or surface reflection. The magnitude of the interface signal may be on the order of one hundred times the magnitude of the signal from the defect. Thus the larger signal overloads the amplifier, and the signal from the defect is contained within the larger waveform signal and is lost or undetectable. The interface may be subtracted from the amplifier output, since the magnitude and waveform of the interface signal is known. By eliminating the interface signal, smaller signals such as the near-surface flaw are selectively displayed, allowing the tester to obtain more accurate inspection results of near-surface defects. Also, where ultrasonic inspection techniques are employed to measure thickness of a test object, wide variations in amplitude may be eliminated by capturing the waveforms over a wide dynamic response range, allowing greater accuracy in thickness measurements.\nAnother advantage of the present invention is realized in the ultrasonic inspection of composite components which are characterized by high attenuation. The wide dynamic response range of the DLA permits accurate amplitude measurements of signals from various depths in test objects of composite materials, as well as testing composite objects with wide variations in thickness.\nFinally, the DLA allows the combined outputs of the stored waveforms to be easily processed into logarithmic scaling without the noise and accuracy limitations normally associated with the analog logarithmic amplifiers.\nWhile the invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this invention, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.']	['<urn:uuid:eaf63d67-2cc6-4b4a-8e48-c3f6d15a626a>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	11	58	2215
74	I'm into astronomy and I'm curious about fancy watches - how does this unique watch show the constellations of the sky, and what makes its calendar different from regular ones?	The watch displays constellations through a large domed blue quartz crystal at 12 o'clock that shows either northern or southern hemisphere star patterns. These constellations revolve throughout the year to match the actual night sky view. The watch includes a special hour hand with an elliptical opening marked with 'N' that helps view and orient the constellations. As for the calendar, it's unique because it follows the sidereal year (365.256363004 days) rather than the standard civil calendar. This makes it more astronomically accurate, as it tracks Earth's actual orbit relative to fixed stars rather than just the sun. The calendar maintains its accuracy for 158 years before requiring a one-day adjustment, unlike regular perpetual calendars that need correction every four years.	['The Shooting Star®\n5-Day Tourbillon Jumping Hours Retrograde Minutes with hemispherical universal time and hemispherical double moon phase\nBased on the principle that observing the stars has served as a basis for defining time since the dawn of humanity, Pascal Raffy and his watchmakers deliberately looked through the wrong side of their loupes. They were able to gain enough distance to observe the rhythm of the Earth’s revolutions on its axis—and of its elliptical journey around its star, or indeed the ceaseless circles drawn by its natural satellite, the moon. Metaphorically speaking, of course. Nevertheless, everyone undertook this mental exercise in order to transform the microscopic vision to which watchmakers are accustomed into a macroscopic vision. The simple change in perspective brought about by taking this step back helped the observers to gain an overview of the dance of the planets and to grasp its complexity with disconcerting clarity. The twenty-four time zones that divide our planet longitudinally, albeit in an abstract and arbitrary fashion, seem almost visible from such a distance. The daylight regions stand in logical contrast to those plunged into darkness. The inclination of the Earth’s axis helps us understand—depending on the season—the variable length of the day and night as we approach the North and South Poles. The moon phases can also be observed in such a way as to be instantly comprehensible.\nAs well as understanding the various astral phenomena related to the measurement of time, this newfound perspective also enables us to tell the time in all regions of the globe simultaneously. And it was precisely this broader universal vision that governed the development of this watch—an original tourbillon watch in many more ways than one. Seen from space, the spherical shape of the Earth enables us to observe only half of the surface at a time. Thus was born the idea of representing the entire globe in a single hemisphere. A cartographer was specially commissioned to design this atypical and hitherto unknown 3D map of the world. Thanks to this ingenious solution, the Earth’s surface can be seen in its entirety, without changing point of view.\nA first hemisphere was thus chosen to represent the Earth and enable the reading of universal time, which is displayed in three dimensions at 3 o’clock. A hand affixed to the North Pole—that is the axis of our hemisphere—follows its curve. It can be assigned to any one of the 24 time zones selected by the user. At its tip, a concentric ring displays the time in the chosen time zone, while the name of the city corresponding to that time zone appears on one of the two concentric rollers indexed to the hemisphere.\nThe time zone hand is another first. Never before had the manufacturer produced a hemispheric hand, with all the difficulties inherent in the high quality required. In addition to displaying the time and the name of the city corresponding to an easily adjustable time zone, the 24-hour ring that surrounds the globe enables instant reading of the time anywhere in the world. Simply follow a straight line from the center of the globe, passing through the selected geographical point. The tip of this line will point to the exact time in the selected place on the graduated ring. To link the hand of the second time zone to a specific city, simply press the center of the crown. With each successive press, the needle jumps by an angular value of 15°, representing the exact value of the time zone. This action also activates the rollers and the names of the cities corresponding to the time zones indicated by the hand are displayed in sequence.\nThe choice of two concentric rollers to indicate the cities offers the two-fold advantage of taking up little space whilst providing exemplary readability. The mechanism that drives them required great ingenuity. The outer roller displays 11 cities simultaneously, then makes way for a window, which opens an aperture to the second roller—arranged concentrically inside the first roller—and displaying the 12th city. This inner roller then turns in order to display the 13 subsequent cities in the aperture. The whole system is controlled by a column wheel.\nThe system, which is easy to use and to read, also required great ingenuity and demands extremely precise adjustments. The tension of each spring is perfectly calibrated for a flawless, reliable operation. To protect these settings and the entire mechanism, a ‘constant force’ correction was devised for which a patent was filed. When the user activates the corrector, the pressure of their finger can vary substantially from individual to individual. With a traditional system, the entire correction mechanism absorbs the pressure applied. But in the new correction system, the correction is transmitted to the mechanism when the user releases the pressure. It is thus the spring-loaded correction that transmits a measured and constant energy to the entire mechanism. This is in turn protected from excess pressure, for optimal adjustment and reliability in the long-term. The cylindrical form and engraving of the city names make for a particularly exquisite decoration. And to enhance their readability still further, the rollers are treated in black rhodium while the engraved names of the cities are lacquered in white. A single hemisphere is therefore sufficient to simultaneously display the exact time anywhere in the world. This information and its representation make it one of the most useful complications in existence.\nThis new perspective on the Earth and universal time also enables the moon to be observed. So it seemed self-evident to complement universal time with a moon phase indicator, and entirely consistent to represent the moon correspondingly, in the form of a hemisphere. Two circular apertures follow the curve of this lunar globe and indicate the age of the moon as seen from the northern and southern hemispheres respectively. The moon and the starry sky succeed each other in both windows and, although unorthodox, this representation of the time is both realistic and intuitive. The moon phase indicator is of course driven by a highly precise mechanism that only requires correction by one day every 122 years.\nThe hemispherical representation of universal time and that of the moon phases requires a particular construction in order to meet the qualitative and esthetic norms that are the hallmarks of BOVET 1822. Each hemisphere is therefore machined in a single piece and their surfaces engraved with the correct relief. The oceans are then filled with luminescent blue material. The craters on the moon are all in white luminous material while the sky and space glow a deep blue in the darkness.\nA common solution was found for both these constraints. On the one hand, these hemispheres had to move freely and with optimal performance, so as not to influence the impeccable chronometry of this tourbillon watch. On the other hand, the watchmakers wanted to avoid the use of a pivot around the central axis for esthetic reasons, as well as the need to extricate the pivot from the time zone hand at the Earth’s Pole. The original and patented mechanism devised to meet these constraints is composed of three adjustable ruby runners arranged around the exterior of the hemispheres. Enthusiasts will no doubt appreciate and even feel the incredible results of this system.\nThese two hemispheres occupy the space at 3 o’clock for universal time and at 9 o’clock for the moon phase indicator. Logically enough, the watchmakers used the space at 12 o’clock to display the hours and minutes and the power reserve. They once again returned to their unorthodox viewing angle to devise an indicator as natural and intuitive as the one referred to earlier. Several strata were superimposed to evoke a third hemisphere dominating the first two with all the symmetry and balance that is so dear to the House.\nAs near to the mainplate as possible, a flat sapphire disc displays the hours, which are revealed when positioned on a lacquered plate. This digital display makes for easy and immediate reading of the time. In the center of the display, a curved dial displays the exceptional five-day power reserve. A third stratum dominates this ensemble. This section indicates the minutes by means of a retrograde hand. The combination of jumping hours and retrograde minutes raises the technical problem of the synchronization of instantaneous jumps—a complication perfectly mastered in-house and which has already met with resounding success in other watches in the collection. As usual, the dials were manufactured in-house. The craftsmen at BOVET 1822 demonstrate the full extent of their talent in the dials of this Shooting Star. The juxtaposed surfaces of the curved dials result in a perfect surface, whether in white or in aventurine!\nThe Tourbillon Shooting Star is perfectly designed for travel because the corrector enables the hour disk to be adjusted without affecting the minutes, seconds, universal time or indexed time zone. The pushpiece is simply pressed and the watch is easily readjusted to the latest time zone being visited.\nTo drive all of the complications, the two barrels generate five days of power reserve, all controlled by a tourbillon balance oscillating at 21,600 vph. Three blued masses are positioned on the golden serge, inspired by the shape of the arches that adorned the balances of BOVET pocket watches in the 19th century. The DIMIER escapement and its specific centering guarantee exemplary performance. Of course, like all components used in the manufacture of BOVET movements, the Shooting Star is regulated by a hair spring manufactured in the in-house workshops—an art mastered by fewer than ten watchmaking companies around the world. Performing each of its revolutions in one minute, the tourbillon features a triple seconds-hand, unusually placed under the tourbillon and following a subtly tampoprinted graduation inside the crystal, for a clear and original display.\nThe decoration of the movement of this Tourbillon Shooting Star perfectly matches its originality, technical complexity and innovations. An entirely hand-engraved constellation of stars extends across the entire surface of the movement. Like many other symbols, a moon phase is entirely represented on the back, with captivating poetry. On the same side, two entirely hand-engraved hemispheres evoke the spherical nature of the terrestrial and lunar globes. The carriage and tourbillon bridges are also entirely hand-engraved, despite their delicate nature and the tiny amount of surface area available.\nThe technical intricacy of this spatial vision of time inspired the technicians and watchmakers at BOVET 1882 and its DIMIER 1738 Manufacture to devise a movement based on resolutely innovative methods, which led to the filing of two patents. This approach led to a totally original and modern architecture that remains firmly rooted in the values and demands of craftsmanship and high watchmaking that are the essence of BOVET. Thus, the incline that describes the movement between the top of the minutes dial and the tourbillon, and the use of the hemispheres, naturally necessitated a new direction for the design of the case which is completely consistent with the vision of this watch. A domed sapphire crystal with a very pronounced curve therefore crowns the case of this Tourbillon Shooting Star. But the designers did not stop there. To open the world of this tourbillon watch to the infinite, the watch middle follows a pronounced oblique incline along the 12 o’clock to 6 o’clock axis. The hours disk corrector is positioned at 12 o’clock, for a supremely ergonomic display and positioning that confirm the symmetry of the watch.\nThe presence of a total of seven domes, including the four hemispheres of the movement, the dials, the tourbillon carriage and the upper crystal lend the ultimate finishing touch to this watch.\nBefore the Tourbillon Récital 18 Shooting Star, the notion of infinity was defined by two closely related concepts alone: space and time. To these we must now add the passion of Pascal Raffy and the craftsmen of the House of BOVET, which has once again proved that it has no limits.', 'Bovet Récital 20 Astérium: The Galaxy On Your Wrist\nRare astronomical events have the ability to make people more aware of the details while also considering the bigger picture.\nThings like solar eclipses, meteor showers, or dancing aurora can have an effect on a person’s psyche that creates a deeper understanding of our place in the universe. Watching the moon blot out the sun for a few minutes (as it did across the U.S. on August 21, 2017) could be a transformative experience that makes one appreciate the little moments a bit more.\nWhen I gazed skyward to witness my first total solar eclipse, I was struck by how much I was unprepared for what I was about to experience. Every moment of the one minute and forty-four seconds of totality passed by in what I would call thick and creeping time. My experience of this time dilation was familiar to other unique moments in life where I seem to exist outside of time, however briefly, and get a glimpse of something perpetually hard to explain but extremely real to my being.\nJust like extreme sports, moments with a loved one, or near-death experiences, powerful events have a power to bring you into the current moment where past and future have no real meaning: there is only, and will ever only be, now. Of course, when the sun reappeared and the eclipse was only a memory, time sped up and my past and future rushed in to fill the cracks and occupy my mind.\nBut for just a few moments, I truly was.\nStrangely enough, I sometimes find little existential moments like these when I gaze into incredible mechanics and complex machines that defy expectations and provide an escape for an energetic mind. When those mechanics exist to convey the wonders of the universe, it’s even better.\nIn January 2017, Bovet announced a new piece that got me excited, and when I finally saw it in the metal it gave me one of those brief moments of escape from the unrelenting march of time. That piece is the Récital 20 Astérium and it combines a variety of unique and novel creations that give you plenty to think about.\nThoughts on time\nThe Bovet Récital 20 Astérium is one serious watch with a variety of astronomical indications that you may have seen before, but never like this.\nThe Astérium also features a unique take on the calendar that, actually, is focused more on consistent accuracy than easily averaged accuracy like nearly every other calendar out there.\nThe Astérium and many of its indications are driven by the annual calendar, which is kind of a misnomer. This calendar follows the sidereal year, which is the length of time it takes for earth to complete one revolution of its orbit as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars rather than just our sun).\nThis is an averaged calculation – earth’s orbit always varies due to a host of factors – that comes out to 365.256363004 days, which is usually averaged again to 365.25 days for ease of use.\nThe annual calendar in the Astérium (a sidereal calendar as explained above) uses this averaged 365.25 number to keep the astronomical indications accurate every year without the quarter-day drift of perpetual calendars (which only catch up every four years). With this more constant accuracy, the indications stay accurate to the celestial motions for 158 years before needing to be adjusted by one day, kind of like the slow mechanical moon phase drift.\nThe remainders on the average time, the numbers after 365.25 . . . 6363004, account for the slow buildup of error that eventually needs correcting. The adjustments of the Gregorian calendar, which is based on the 365.24219 solar year (aka tropical year), eventually make up for its cumulative error with leap years (and occasional skipped leap years).\nThough the difference is very minor, the Astérium’s calendar is basically detached from our civil Gregorian-based calendar so as to display a more accurate celestial position until the Gregorian calendar catches up every four years,. But it shows that the desire for Bovet was to chart the sky more accurately and thus indicate what is really going on up there.\nDisplays of the universe\nWhich leads to what all the astronomical indications are, and there are many.\nOn the rear of the case you find the actual annual calendar indication, a rotating hand with an image of the sun as the hand takes one full year to make a full revolution indicating earth’s trip around the sun. The days are listed on the case back bezel, while the months are etched onto the rear sapphire crystal.\nInside the ring of the months is the zodiac calendar, which is shown with the sun on the indicator as it passes through each sign. Moving inward we find the seasons, separated by the equinoxes and solstices. The back of the watch displays a handful of different indications with a single hand, which is the most useful implementation of a calendar I’ve seen. But that isn’t the end.\nMoving to the front of the watch a grand sight materializes: the night sky. Depending on what whether the northern or southern hemisphere has been selected by the watch’s owner, at 12 o’clock a large domed blue quartz crystal displays the proper set of constellations, which revolve throughout the year to match the view in the night sky. Underneath the quartz dome the hours are etched from 1 to 24 on a disk; a smaller disk with the months is also included. The hours are stationary, but the month disk moves with the sky chart and the hour hand rotates on top.\nThe hour hand is also the sky chart viewer as it has a large elliptical opening opposite the pointer (marked with an N for “north”) to indicate where the constellations are in the sky at any time and to aid in orientation. Since the hours are indicated to 24, allowing day and night to be differentiated on one scale, this means that the constellations in the sky at the same time every night shift throughout the year to match the motion of constellations as a result of our orbit around the sun. The month disk rotating with the quartz dome shows how the constellations are tied to the monthly position of earth’s orbit around the sun.\nPacked with more goodness\nIf these were all the indications on the Récital 20 Astérium, it would be considered a rather epic timepiece. But of course Bovet wasn’t finished yet.\nTo the left of the sky chart and hour display are located the domed moon phase and the equation of time indication. The moon phase rotates separately from the sky chart and annual calendar since they aren’t relative to each other. The retrograde equation of time indicator is directly linked to the annual calendar and sky chart as they are products of the same motion in the heavens.\nOn the right of the sky chart are the mirrored twins of the moon phase and equation of time, retrograde minutes, and a domed 10-day power reserve indicator. The minutes are on top with the dome underneath, just like on the opposite side.\nAnd here, too, the dome rotates on something very special.\nThe three domes are rotated from their centers, but supported on the periphery via a set of perpendicular ruby rollers. These were first introduced on the Récital 18 Shooting Star, and their return is a most welcome sight as these may be one of my favorite aspects of the movement construction since they are so uniquely suited to this layout – a layout that also results in some very incredible choices for layer construction.\nNumerous arched pillars support various plates and bridges leading to a dramatic three-dimensional assembly, with the movement operating on what must be more than a dozen different levels. The sheer height of the assembly could be daunting if not done in an extra-clever way.\nSince only a portion of the movement is high, it takes on a wedge shape that is shorter on the bottom at 6 o’clock and thicker on the top at 12 o’clock. To make sure the Récital 20 Astérium was as wearable as possible, the shape of the case follows the form of the wedge-shaped movement, which makes reading the tilted dial even easier.\nNot only does this make the watch seem more like a showpiece, but the sloping case emphasizes the last major component I have yet to mention: the double-face flying tourbillon mounted in the center of its assembly, allowing the observer to see the mechanism moving without a bridge interfering.\nBovet does this type of tourbillon support so well that it always looks like the tourbillon is truly floating beyond the movement. And, as the balance oscillates at the bottom of the case, a marker attached to the one-minute tourbillon cage indicates small portions of time in 20-second intervals.\nAll of this is nothing short of fantastic, but Bovet goes yet one step further and finishes everything to perfection, adding a brilliantly executed form of engraving called bris de verre or “broken glass.” It’s a specific chiseling technique that produces a result in the same vein as hand-hammering or the famous tremblage engraving of A. Lange & Söhne (see The A. Lange & Söhne Zeitwerk Handwerkskunst: I Can Just Feel It!).\nUsed almost across the entire rear of the movement and on many of the plates and bridge on the front of the movement, this chiseled texture adds a lot of contrast to the polished arches, beveled edges, and satinized surfaces.\nGiven the complexity of the movement it is surprising that 60 pieces were announced. Even considering that’s 60 pieces in total for all variations, it seems a high number for such an outstanding movement and watch. Given that I may go years before seeing another one, just like a solar eclipse or an intense meteor shower the moments I spent with this one are still sharp in my mind.\nThe variety of indications and the unique display of them makes the Récital 20 Astérium stand out as one of the best pieces from Bovet ever (and that is saying a lot, in my humble opinion).\nEven including the chiming pieces, this watch stands proudly as a horology and astronomy nerd’s dream. It focuses on accurate celestial mechanics instead of simply averaging them out like nearly every other watch does. Of course that makes it more difficult to create, but since when did difficulty stop motivated engineers and watchmakers?\nThe development and creation of the Récital 20 Astérium loudly and clearly highlights that there are still watchmakers who care about how a watch functions and what its purpose is. Such a technical astronomical timepiece is becoming rarer these days, so it is great to see new ways of doing old things developed by a brand. Bovet is constantly intriguing, and this piece doesn’t disappoint.\nNow if only I could say the same about meteor showers and bad weather.\nI guess I can’t win them all, so how about a breakdown!\n- Wowza Factor * 9.95 Space is king right now, and this piece is a lord among lords!\n- Late Night Lust Appeal * 102.3 » 1,003.220m/s2 It doesn’t take more than a glimpse or two of this watch to be lusting for hours on end, but closer inspection makes this as powerful as the sun’s gravity!\n- M.G.R. * 71.2 This nearly gets a perfect score for movement geekiness, the only thing lacking is something that makes a sound and it would be perfect in its own right!\n- Added-Functionitis * Critical It should be fairly obvious that immediate attention is required with this many added functions.

75	what happens when two separately growing crystals meet explain grain boundaries	Grain boundaries occur when two crystals that began growing separately meet each other. At these boundaries, the crystallographic direction of the lattice changes abruptly.	"['Crystalline solids have a very regular atomic structure: that is, the local positions of atoms with respect to each other are repeated at the atomic scale. These arrangements are called crystal structures, and their study is called crystallography. However, most crystalline materials are not perfect: the regular pattern of atomic arrangement is interrupted by crystal defects. The various types of defects are enumerated here.\nIt has been suggested that this section be split into a new article. (Discuss)\nPoint defects are defects which are not extended in space in any dimension. There is not strict limit for how small a ""point"" defect should be, but typically the term is used to mean defects which involve at most a few extra\nor missing atoms without an ordered structure of the defective positions. Larger defects in an ordered structure are usually considered dislocation loops. For historical reasons, many point defects especially in ionic crystals are called ""centers"": for example the vacancy in many ionic solids is called\nVacancies are sites which are usually occupied by an atom but which are unoccupied. If a neighboring atom moves to occupy the vacant site, the vacancy moves in the opposite direction to the site which used to be occupied by the moving atom. The stability of the surrounding crystal structure guarantees that the neighboring atoms will not simply collapse around the vacancy. In some materials, neighboring atoms actually move away from a vacancy, because they can better form bonds with atoms in the other directions. A vacancy (or pair of vacancies in an ionic solid) is sometimes called a Schottky defect.\nInterstitials are atoms which occupy a site in the crystal structure at which there is usually not an atom. They are generally high energy configurations. Small atoms in some crystals can occupy interstices without high energy, such as hydrogen in palladium.\nA nearby pair of a vacancy and an interstitial is often called a Frenkel defect or Frenkel pair\nImpurities occur because material are never 100% pure. In the case of an impurity, the atom is often incorporated at a regular atomic site in the crystal structure. This is neither a vacant site nor is the atom on an interstitial site and it is called a substitutional defect. The atom is not supposed to be anywhere in the crystal, and is thus an impurity.\nAnti-site defects occur in an ordered alloy. For example, some alloys have a regular structure in which every other atom is a different species, for illustration assume that type A atoms sit on the cube corners of a cubic lattice, and type B atoms sit in center of the cubes. If one cube has an A atom at its center, the atom is on a site usually occupied by an atom, but it is not the correct type. This is neither a vacancy nor an interstitial, nor an impurity.\nTopological defects are regions in a crystal where the normal chemical bonding environment is topologically different from the surroundings. For instance, in a perfect sheet of graphite (graphene) all atoms are in rings containing six atoms. If the sheet contains regions where the number of atoms in a ring is different from six, while the total number of atoms remains the same, a topological defect has formed. An example is the Stone Wales defect in nanotubes, which consists of two adjacent 5-membered and two 7-membered atom rings.\nAlso amorphous solids may contain defects. These are naturally somewhat hard to define, but sometimes their nature can be quite easily understood. For instance, in ideally bonded amorphous silica all Si atoms have 4 bonds to O atoms and all O atoms have 2 bonds to Si atom. Thus e.g. an O atom with only one Si bond can be considered a defect in silica.\nComplexes can form between different kinds of point defects. For example, if a vacancy encounters an impurity, the two may bind together if the impurity is too large for the lattice. Interstitials can form \'split interstitial\' or \'dumbbell\' structures where two atoms effectively share an atomic site, resulting in neither atom actually occupying the site.\nLine defects can be described by gauge theories.\nDislocations are linear defects around which some of the atoms of the crystal lattice are misaligned. There are two basic types of dislocations, the EDGE dislocation and the SCREW dislocation. (""MIXED"" dislocations combining aspects of both types are also common).\nEdge dislocations are caused by the termination of a plane of atoms in the middle of a crystal. In such a case, the adjacent planes are not straight, but instead bend around the edge of the terminating plane so that the crystal structure is perfectly ordered on either side. The analogy with a stack of paper is apt: if a half a piece of paper is inserted in a stack of paper, the defect in the stack is only noticeable at the edge of the half sheet.\nThe screw dislocation is more difficult to visualise, but basically comprises a structure in which a helical path is traced around the linear defect (dislocation line) by the atomic planes of atoms in the crystal lattice.\nThe presence of dislocations results in lattice strain (distortion). The direction and magnitude of such distortion is expressed in terms of a Burgers vector (b). For an edge type, b is perpendicular to the dislocation line, whereas in the cases of the screw type it is parallel. In metallic materials, b is aligned with close-packed crytallographic directions and its magnitude is equivalent to one interatomic spacing.\nDislocations can move if the atoms from one of the surrounding planes break their bonds and rebond with the atoms at the terminating edge.\nIt is the presence of dislocations and their ability to readily move (and interact) under the influence of stresses induced by external loads that leads to the characteristic malleability of metallic materials.\nDislocations can be observed using transmission electron microscopy, field ion microscopy and atom probe techniques.\nDeep level transient spectroscopy has been used for studying the electrical activity of dislocations in semiconductors, mainly silicon.\nDisinclinations are line defects corresponding to ""adding"" or ""subtracting"" an angle around a line. Basically, this means that if you track the crystal orientation around the line defect, you get a rotation.\nGrain boundaries occur where the crystallographic direction of the lattice abruptly changes. This usually occurs when two crystals begin growing separately and then meet.\nAnti phase boundaries occur in ordered alloys: in this case, the crystallographic direction remains the same, each side of the boundary has an opposite phase: For example if the ordering is usually ABABABAB, an anti phase boundary takes the form of ABABBABA.\nStacking faults occur in a number of crystal structures, but the common example is in close-packed structures. Face-centered cubic (fcc) structures differ from hexagonal close packed (hcp) structures only in stacking order: both structures have close packed atomic planes with sixfold symmetry -- the atoms form equilateral triangles. When stacking one of these layers on top of another, the atoms are not directly on top of one another -- the first two layers are identical for hcp and fcc, and labelled AB. If the third layer is placed so that its atoms are directly above those of the first layer, the stacking will be ABA -- this is the hcp structure, and it continues ABABABAB. However there is another location for the third layer, such that its atoms are not above the first layer. Instead, the fourth layer is placed so that its atoms are directly above the first layer. This produces the stacking ABCABCABC, and is actually a cubic arrangement of the atoms. A stacking fault is a one or two layer interruption in the stacking sequence, for example if the sequence ABCABABCAB were found in an fcc structure.\nVoids are small regions where there are no atoms, and can be thought of as clusters of vacancies.\nImpurities can cluster together to form small regions of a different phase. These are often called precipitates.']"	['<urn:uuid:d6ae072c-fd49-4b48-bae8-0764e20cf6de>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	11	24	1335
76	How do regular people help scientists track and study butterfly patterns throughout Ohio?	Nearly 230 volunteers from the Ohio Lepidopterists society monitor butterflies at 83 locations statewide, including parks and preserves. The volunteers choose a section of trail and record the species and numbers they see within 7.5 feet of either side, monitoring weekly from the beginning to end of the main butterfly flight season. They go out 15-30 times per year, making Ohio's monitoring records the most intensive in the United States.	"['Heat of climate change, roads and buildings likely to harm several species\nThe combined heat from climate change and urbanization is likely to reduce the number of eastern swallowtails and other native butterflies in Ohio and promote the spread of invasive relatives, a new study led by a Case Western Reserve University researcher shows.\nAmong 20 species monitored by the Ohio Lepidopterists society, eight showed significant delays in important early lifecycle events when the two factors were combined—a surprising response that may render the eight unfit for parts of the state where they now thrive.\nButterflies serve as important indicator species for how the broader ecosystem might be impacted, the researchers say. They are pursuing further studies to learn whether the negative impacts on multiple species add up to cause disruptions to the environment.\nOther studies have shown that butterflies respond to higher temperatures due either to climate change or turning farmland and forests into asphalt and concrete by first appearing—and reaching peak numbers—earlier in the year.\n""But when you combine the effects, it sort of throws a wrench in how you predict species\' responses,"" said Sarah Diamond, an assistant professor of biology at Case Western Reserve and lead author of the study, now online in the journal Ecology at http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/13-1848.1.\nThe findings, the researchers say, may be useful to predict effects of environmental changes over the next decades and develop strategies to respond, and can likely be applied worldwide\nDiamond worked with Heather Cayton, Tyson Wepprich, Clinton Jenkins, Rob Dunn and Nick Haddad of the department of biological sciences at North Carolina State University; and Leslie Ries, of the biology department at the University of Maryland.\nResearchers analyzed 13 years of butterfly monitoring records by lepidopterists society volunteers at 83 locations statewide. The monitoring sites include locations in parks and preserves throughout Ohio.\nNearly 230 Society monitors recorded species numbers from the first week of April through the first week of November. Their data was compared with temperature records.\nTemperatures were taken from the nearest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorological stations, which avoid the warming effects of urbanization.\nSites in southern Ohio ranged 2 to 3 degrees Celsius warmer than northern sites on a given day. That difference reflects the amount of warming climate change models predict for the Midwest later this century, enabling the researchers to see how the change may alter butterfly lifecycles.\nThe lepidopterists\' records showed that butterflies generally emerged up to three weeks earlier and reached peak numbers sooner in southern Ohio than mid- and northern Ohio.\nBiologists believe that advancing their lifecycle events a couple of weeks enables butterflies to take advantage of earlier flowering induced by warmer temperatures. The bigger payoff is a species may add another generation in a year, increasing its population and ability to compete.\nUrban heat tips pattern\nTo estimate the heat from urbanization, researchers calculated the percent of impervious surface within 1 kilometer of each monitoring site, using the National Land Cover Database. Research by others shows the percentage of impervious surface is correlated with specific increases in surface and air temperatures.\nWhen this heat was added to the already warmer temperatures in greater Cincinnati and Dayton, seven species delayed their initial appearances. Three of them, plus one other species, delayed their peak numbers.\n""Butterflies need warmth from the environment to develop,"" Ries said. ""As their environment gets warmer, they have more and more energy but at extremes, it\'s too hot and they die.\n""Before it becomes lethal, too much heat can slow growth,"" she said. ""That\'s why we see the delay.""\nThe delays may leave a species with fewer resources to feed and lay eggs or may expose them to great risk of predation, resulting in a smaller next generation, the scientists said. Such a scenario may lead to loss of local populations.\nThe eastern tiger swallowtail, pearl crescent and red admiral, all noted for their beauty, are among the eight species that delay and are more likely to suffer in the future in Ohio.\nInvasives, such as the cabbage white and European skipper, are more likely to thrive. These species are called ""weedy,"" meaning they can feed and lay eggs on a wide variety of plants. They were largely unaffected by the combined heat.\nThe researchers studied Ohio butterflies after Ries found the state has the most intensive monitoring records in the United States. While many other states are doing monitoring, most volunteers only go out about 7 times a year, Ohio volunteers go out 15 to 30 times per year. ""That really helps us track shifts in timing, something that is more difficult to do with less intensive protocols"" Ries said.\n""If our data can be used for some enlightenment, we\'re happy to have it used,"" said Jerry Weidman, who chairs the society committee in charge of monitoring.\nVolunteers generate the records. They choose a section of trail and record the species and numbers they see within 7.5 feet of either side, Weidman explained. They monitor weekly from the beginning to end of the main butterfly flight season\n""One lab could never do something of this scope,"" Diamond said. ""Citizen scientists can help us do things on a scale never thought possible.""\nThe researchers believe their findings are applicable nationally and globally. Patterns of temperatures varying by geography, and over time under climate change, coupled with gradients of rural to urban habitats, are widespread.\nDiamond and colleagues are now setting up growth chambers to study butterfly physiology in the lab. They will simulate environmental conditions, including climate change and urbanization to see what temperatures or other factors trigger changes in growth and behavior, and when. From that, they hope to develop predictions to help conserve each species.\nKevin Mayhood | Eurek Alert!\nHow to detect water contamination in situ?\n22.09.2016 | Tomsk Polytechnic University (TPU)\nQuantifying the chemical effects of air pollutants on oxidative stress and human health\n12.09.2016 | Max-Planck-Institut für Chemie\nThe Fraunhofer Institute for Organic Electronics, Electron Beam and Plasma Technology FEP has been developing various applications for OLED microdisplays based on organic semiconductors.

77	What was the size of the Roblin Steel site compared to Bethlehem Steel?	The Roblin Steel site was 12 acres while the Bethlehem Steel site was much larger at approximately 1650 acres.	"['Roblin Steel Environmental Restoration Program Site\nAfter remediation: ready for development\nFact Sheet - November 2012\nRoblin Steel Update: Cleanup Requirements Achieved!\nNew York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) has determined that the cleanup requirements to address contamination related to Former Roblin Steel Site (Dunkirk) (""site"") located at 320 South Roberts Road, Dunkirk, Chautauqua County under New York State\'s Environmental Restoration Program have been or will be met. Please see Site Location for the map.\nDEC has issued a Certificate of Completion (COC) regarding the site. A copy of the COC is available at the locations identified below under Where to Find Information.\nThe cleanup activities were performed with oversight provided by DEC.\nInstitutional and Engineering Controls\nInstitutional controls and engineering controls generally are designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to contaminants of concern. An institutional control is a non-physical restriction on use of the site, such as a deed restriction, when contamination left over after the cleanup action makes the site suitable for some, but not all uses. An engineering control is a physical barrier or method to manage contamination such as a cap or vapor barrier.\nThe former Roblin Steel facility has been vacant\nover twenty years\nThe following institutional controls have been put in place on the site:\n- Environmental Easement\n- Soil Management Plan\n- Local Groundwater Restriction\n- IC/EC Plan\n- Site Management Plan\n- Monitoring Plan\n- Land use Restriction\nThe following engineering controls have been put in place on the site:\n- Cover System with demarcation layer\nBy the Numbers\nDuring remediation: Concrete crushing during\nPhase II remedial activities\n12 acres - area of inactive industrial park\n20 - # of years site was abandoned\n583.26 tons - non-hazardous contaminated subsurface soil/fill excavated from site\n5,772.76 tons - surface soil/fill, debris/fill piles and wood block flooring excavated from site\n19,000 cubic yards - soil cover imported into site\n88,500 SF - area of vacant building demolished on site\n126,000 pounds - granular iron deposited into subsurface to address groundwater contamination\nCleaned Facility Numbers:\n0.5 tons - of PCB contaminated equipment\n20 cubic yards - of K061 debris\n55 gallons - of pesticide\n55 gallons - of Carbon Disulfide\n110 gallons - of acids\n165 gallons - of flammable liquid\n275 gallons - of asbestos (solid)\n330 gallons - of PCB oil\n688 empty drums\n1,865 gallons - of K061 oils\n3,544 gallons - of K061 liquids\nHistoric Uses: Artist rendering of inside of Roblin Steel\nbuilding when operated by ALCO\nSite developed, original contamination\nAugust: Site Investigation/Remedial Alternatives Report (SI/RAR) Work Plan\nMarch: Record of Decision (ROD)\nFebruary: Remedial Action Work Plan (RAWP)\nNovember: Phase I Remedial Activities\nMarch: Phase II Remedial Activities\nDuring remediation: Southwest corner after building demolition\nDEC issued the COC based on review and approval of a Final Engineering Report (FER). The FER includes:\n- A description of the cleanup activities completed;\n- Certification that cleanup requirements have been or will be achieved for the site;\n- A description of any institutional/engineering controls to be used; and\n- A certification that a site management plan for any engineering controls used at the site has been approved by DEC.\nA COC may be modified or revoked if, for example, there is a failure to comply with the terms of the order or agreement with DEC.\nThe site\'s address is 320 South Roberts Road (County Road 136) in the City of Dunkirk. The site is actually located approximately 500 feet northeast of the road. The 12-acre site is roughly triangular in shape and bounded to north and east by an active rail yard and railroad tracks respectively. The site is also bounded by two other brownfield sites; the former Alumax Extrusions facility (site #V00589) to the south and to the west the Edgewood Warehouse site (#E907032). Lake Erie is located approximately 4,000 feet to the northwest.\nThe site was initially developed as part of a larger industrial complex operated by the American Locomotive Company in the early 1900s for the manufacture of locomotives. Operations were later converted to the manufacture of process equipment (e.g. heat exchangers, pressure vessels, steel pipe, fittings and conduits). Roblin Steel acquired the property and operated a steel reclamation business until the 1980\'s; scrap steel was forged in electric arc furnaces into steel rods. The facility included dust collection baghouses, mills, a compressor house, an electrical substation and a variety of other process equipment. Prior site uses and operations that appear to have led to the site contamination include metal plating, machining, the use of metal cleaning solvents and the storage of fuel oil.\nPrevious investigations identified soil and groundwater contamination (including chlorinated solvents, heavy metals petroleum and PCBs) and asbestos containing materials in the building. USEPA removal action was completed in 1994 to remove over 700 drums of hazardous waste, piles of hazardous emission control dust, and other hazardous materials. A second USEPA removal action was completed in 2004 that included the delineation, excavation and off-site disposal of PCB-impacted concrete and surface soils. In 2001, Chautauqua County took ownership of the property and applied to New York State for funding to further investigate and remediate the site under the Environmental Restoration Program.\nAs part of the completed site remediation, all of the buildings on site were demolished and the entire site covered with a one foot layer of clean soil; the site remains vacant. Vegetation on site is limited to grass. Hyde Creek passes within approximately one hundred feet of the site\'s northeastern corner.\nThe site is located in an area zoned for industrial use. Land use in the site vicinity is characterized by a mixture of commercial, industrial and residential uses. Residential properties are situated to the northwest and south of the site, beyond the adjoining properties; the nearest home lies approximately 200 feet from the site\'s southern corner. Mixed commercial and light industrial properties are located further to the north and west of the site, while an undeveloped wooded area to the east.\nAdditional site details, including environmental and health assessment summaries, are available on DEC\'s website.\nWhere to Find Information\nProject documents are available at the following location to help the public stay informed.\nCity of Dunkirk\nAttn: Dunkirk City Hall\n342 Central Avenue\nDunkirk, NY 14048\nWho to Contact\nComments and questions are always welcome and should be directed as follows:\nProject Related Questions:\nNYS DEC, DER\n270 Michigan Ave\nBuffalo, NY 14203-2915\nSite-Related Health Questions:\n584 Delaware Ave\nBuffalo, NY 14202-1295\n620 Main Street\nBuffalo, NY 14202\nFor More Information\nWe encourage you to share this fact sheet with neighbors and tenants, and/or post this fact sheet in a prominent area of your building for others to see.\nHave site information such as this fact sheet sent right to your email inbox.

BSC closed its last operations in March, 1998. The site, part of which borders then Lehigh River, consists of approximately 1650 acres, on which are a coke production plant, steel iron making operations, finishing and forging operations, and a chemical plant. In May 2003, Bethlehem Steel Corporation went into bankruptcy and this Bethlehem Steel site was sold to an International Steel Group subsidiary, Tecumseh Redevelopment Corp. In May 2004, the Coke Works, Saucon, East Lehigh, and Greenway parcels were sold to Lehigh Valley Industrial Park, Inc, a local redevelopment firm and owners of several industrial parks. In 2004, Tecumseh Redevelopment sold Bethlehem Works to BethWorks Now. Tecumseh continued to own the 450 -Acre area. In 2004, a Dutch steelmaker, Mittal Steel, purchased ISG, including Tecumseh and the 450-Acre area. In December 2007, Majestic Realty Co. and Bethlehem Commerce Center Corp. purchased the 450-Acre area for warehousing.\nEPA, PADEP and Bethlehem Steel Corporation-Bethlehem Plant (BSC) formed a team in 1998 to proceed with the clean-up of the facility.

78	As a communications specialist exploring different transmission modes, what are the typical operating modes used for Winlink on different frequency bands like HF and VHF?	On HF, the normal mode of operation is Pactor (although other modes like Winmor are also used). On 2-meters (VHF), 220 MHz, and 440 MHz bands, the mode used is packet, operating at either 1200 or 9600 baud.	['Do you know what Winlink is and what it’s used for? Have you heard folks talking about Winlink and wondered what the heck is this system? Here’s a little help from Wikipedia:\nWinlink, also known as the Winlink 2000 Network, is a worldwide radio messaging system that uses amateur-band radio frequencies to provide radio interconnection services that include email with attachments, position reporting, weather bulletins, emergency relief communications, and message relay. The system is built and administered by volunteers and administered by the Amateur Radio Safety Foundation Inc., an American charitable entity and 501c(3) non-profit organization.\nOK, that doesn’t really get down to the brass tacks for us here in our local area. What do WE do with Winlink and what is it really?\nWell, it is indeed a worldwide radio messaging system. It provides Remote Message Servers (RMS’s) around the world that operate on a wide variety of frequencies and modes. The RMS’s provide direct connection to a Central Message Server (CMS) via internet. CMS’s are effectively e-mail servers associated with the Winlink system. There are five redundant CMS locations around the world including San Diego (California), Brentwood (Tennessee), Perth (Australia), Halifax (Canada), Wien (Austria). These servers constantly synchronize with each other. Now, we can ALSO operate in “local” stand alone mode and create our own CMS or CMS’s. This is especially helpful in case of a scenario where infrastructure, including internet, is knocked out and allows us to use the great features of the Winlink system to manage local message traffic.\nBut how does this really work? Well, your objective as a “client” would be to connect to an “RMS”. Making a connection to an RMS results in the Winlink system doing two things:\n- If you have message traffic to send, it will accept the traffic from you.\n- If there is traffic waiting to be delivered to you, it will indeed be delivered be delivered to you. Once those transactions are complete, they system will disconnect.\nOK, now you’re asking about frequency bands, modes, etc. Can’t blame you. The reality is that there are RMS’s operating on HF, 2-meters, 220 MHz, 440 MHz, and even on MESH networks. We actually have RMS’s here locally in Anchorage and the MatSu areas available on ALL these bands. On HF, the normal mode of operation is Pactor (although other modes are used, such as Winmor). On 2-meters, 220 MHz, and 440 MHz, the mode used is packet, at either 1200 or 9600 baud. Then of course there are the RMS’s operating on our MESH network at 3.4 GHz.\nThis is all great, but what about the darn software I have to run? Well, the Winlink system will indeed work with a number of “client” software packages, but the package of choice, at least our choice, is Winlink Express. Winlink express allows use of all the features of the Winlink system as a whole, including use of the various modes on different bands to get the job done.\nSo, what are the “local” RMS stations you ask? Here’s a list of local stations (and this will change somewhat as we develop and evolve the system):\n- HF (Center frequencies 3589.0 KHz, 7075.9 KHz, 7101.7 KHz, 10143.7 KHz – PACTOR 1, 2, and 3): WL7CVG – Located at Alaska Native Medical Center. This station is connected to the worldwide Winlink CMS system.\n- VHF (144.90 MHz, 1200 Baud Packet): WL7CVG-10 – Located on Elmendorf AFB at the EARS club station. This station is connected to the worldwide Winlink CMS system.\n- VHF (144.98 MHz, 1200 Baud Packet): WL7CVG-10 – Located at AARC Club Station – This works with our LOCAL MESH-synced messaging server and is NOT connected to the worldwide Winlink CMS system at this time.\n- VHF (144.98 MHz, 1200 Baud Packet): KL7AA-9 – Located at the ANMC Tuttle Drive warehouse. Station – This works with our LOCAL MESH-synced messaging server and is NOT connected to the worldwide Winlink CMS system at this time. We anticipate moving this RMS to another 2-meter frequency and shifting it to 9600 Baud Packet).\n- VHF (223.66 MHz, 9600 Baud Packet): WL7CVG-10 – Located at AARC Club Station – This works with our LOCAL MESH-synced messaging server and is NOT connected to the worldwide Winlink CMS system at this time.\n- UHF (441.175 MHz, 9600 Baud Packet): Located on Elmendorf AFB at the EARS club station. This works with our LOCAL MESH-synced messaging server and is NOT connected to the worldwide Winlink CMS system at this time.\nIn addition to sending messages using the Winlink system’s RMS/CMS features, there’s also an ability to move traffic peer-to-peer, or in other words, one station directly to another.\nAnother new feature we now have is the ability to interconnect all our local RMS’s via our Mesh network. This is transparent to the end user, but you just need to know that any message sent to a local Mesh-synced RMS is available for pickup via any other local Mesh-synced RMS.\nIf you’d like to learn more about Winlink, the Mesh Network, or our Anchorage ARES effort, join us at the club station on Working Wednesdays. We’re usually opened up by 1800L.']	['<urn:uuid:322116ab-d980-4847-9b1b-1a0458937522>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	25	38	863
79	What's the difference between paper-based and electronic data records when it comes to maintaining data integrity in pharmaceutical companies?	Data integrity requirements apply to both paper-based and electronic systems, though they present different challenges. Paper-based manual observations typically provide more visibility to potential data integrity risks compared to complex computer-based systems. For paper records, all data must be recorded in real time directly onto the GMP record, and these records need to be controlled through issuance and reconciliation procedures. For electronic systems, they must be properly configured with features like audit trails, unique user identities, appropriate access privileges, and protection against unauthorized changes or deletions. Both types of systems need to ensure data is attributable, legible, permanent, and maintained as original records or true copies.	['Bob McDowall, R.D. McDowall Ltd.\nKarl-Heinz Menges, Regierungspräsidium Darmstadt\nYves Samson, Kereon AG\n- You will learn the current regulatory requirements and regulatory expectations for an audit trail (review)\n- All GMP-relevant data (changes and deletions) should be audit trailed – you will learn how to identify GMP-relevant data\n- Event and audit logs: you will understand the differences between and what the regulators expect\n- How should an audit trail review be performed? You will get familiar with the content and the frequency of an audit trail review\n- Understand the current FDA and EU GMP regulations and guidance impacting data integrity from paper records to hybrid and electronic systems.\n- Understand the FDA requirements for data integrity, MHRA Data Integrity guidance July 2016 and WHO guidance from September 2015.\n- Learn what is required for a data governance system from senior management through to staff in laboratories, manufacturing and quality assurance.\n- Understand the data life cycle and how it is linked with the business process and where problems can occur for both paper records, hybrid systems and electronic systems.\nAudit Trail Reviews are required by international regulations like US 21 CFR Part 11 and EU GMP Guide Annex 11: Clause 9 requests:\n“Consideration should be given, based on a risk assessment, to building into the system the creation of a record of all GMP-relevant changes and deletions (a system generated “audit trail”). For change or deletion of GMP-relevant data the reason should be documented. Audit trails need to be available and convertible to a generally intelligible form and regularly reviewed”\nRegulators focus on the (creation), modification and deletion of (GMP-relevant) data while many IT systems are not able to generate audit trails at all or they are not able to generate audit trails for GMP-relevant data.\nTherefore, this course is designed to support you to identify GMP-relevant data and how to perform and document an Audit Trail review as part of a second person review.\nData Integrity is a global problem and currently a major concern with FDA and European Regulatory Agencies. Multiple FDA warning letters and EU GMP non-compliance reports have highlighted major data integrity failures and falsification in companies globally. The regulatory concern has been responded by the FDA issuing Compliance Program Guide that covers Pre-Approval Inspections. This document became effective in May 2012. The CPG objective 3 covers the laboratory data integrity audit. Furthermore in August 2014, the FDA issued Level 2 guidance on their web site about the sharing of login credentials for computerized systems and the use of test injections for testing into compliance.\nIn Europe, the UK’s MHRA issued two versions of a Guidance for Industry on Data Integrity in January and March 2015. This document outlines a data integrity governance system and principles for defining quality and data integrity into processes and systems. In addition, the guidance defines 19 terms and provides expectations and examples for many of them and therein is where the document’s value lies. A new draft version of the Guidance was published in July 2016. The WHO guidance is complimentary to the MHRA guidance in that it provides guidance for data governance and also expectations for records in both paper and electronic form.\nAs the regulators are tightening their inspection approaches it is important that managers, supervisors and users in regulated GMP laboratories understand the issues around data integrity and begin programs to ensure that their processes and systems ensure data integrity.\nThis course is designed for managers and staff from health care industries as well for auditors who are responsible for the organisation and execution of audit trail (reviews) in their companies.\nAudit Trail Review\nWhy Is An Audit Trail and Its Review Important?\nAudit trail vs. system log\n- Part 11 and Annex 11 / Chapter 4 requirements for audit trail\n- Regulatory requirements for audit trail review\n- Guidance documents for audit trail review\n- Do I really need an audit trail?\nWhat are GMP-relevant Data?\n- Audit trail content\n- Log files\n- What and when should I review?\n- Meaningful audit trails for a meaningful review\nReview of Audit Trail Entries\n- Annex 11 requires that audit trails monitor\n- GMP-relevant data – what are GMP-relevant data?\nTechnical Controls to Aid Second Person Review of Audit Trails\n- Guidance for frequent is “frequent review” of audit trails\n- Process versus system: avoiding missing data integrity issues when only focussing on a per system review\n- What are we looking for in an audit review?\n- Suspected data integrity violation - What do we need to do?\nWorkshop 1: Which Audit Trail to Review?\n- Technical considerations for audit trail review e.g.\n- Identifying data that has been changed or modified – how the system can help\n- Documenting the audit trail review has occurred\n- Review by exception – how technical controls can help\n- Have you specified and validated these functions?\nAttendees will be presented with an overview of the audit trails within an application and the content of each one.

To comply with regulations, companies need to optimize data integrity and the underlying strategies involved in compliance and accountability. The following article outlines the basic regulatory expectations surrounding data integrity, as well as the strategic, multi-tiered approach needed to establish a result-based system of accountability and develop a culture of quality, ethics, and compliance.\nAlongside risk assessments, electronic records, and outsourcing, data integrity has become increasingly important to regulatory agencies focusing on critical aspects of pharmaceutical quality management.\nThis became clear with the publication of the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Data Integrity Definitions and Guidance for Industry by the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) . The guidance confirmed that the fundamental concept of data integrity should not be taken lightly, and that the consequences of failure can be severe.\nBut to meet the challenge of successfully implementing a data integrity strategy, what does an organization need to do to ensure its processes meet the required quality standards? Furthermore, how do training, awareness, system design and control, and data management practices ensure success?\n2.0 What is Data?\nData integrity is not restricted to electronic data. The MHRA definition applies to all kinds of data, regardless of whether they are paper-based (manual) or generated within an electronic system.\nTo truly understand the regulatory requirements, it’s vital to establish a basic terminology. The MHRA defines “data” as information derived or obtained from raw data (e.g., a reported analytical result), while “metadata” is defined as the attributes of other data that provide context and meaning. Consequently, metadata describe the structure, data elements, interrelationships, and other characteristics of data.\nTo meet the requirements for data integrity, GMP facilities need to exercise discretion during implementation of both organizational and technical controls. The extent of the controls should be in line with the criticality of the data being generated and the complexity of the system or process being used.\nTo establish that data are trustworthy, or have not been tampered with or manipulated, the MHRA requires that data are:\n- Attributable to the person generating the data\n- Legible and permanent\n- An original record (or “true copy”)\nWhile these requirements may seem simple enough, there is another common misunderstanding about data integrity. Deliberate acts of fraud, falsification and/or provision of incorrect information are often considered to be the only causes of data integrity failures. This may not always be the case. Although fraud is a concern and data failure is one of the most obvious root causes of regulatory problems, data integrity breaches are even more difficult to identify, yet they are equally harmful if caused by an incorrect system configuration or poor system controls. Failure to meet regulatory requirements has serious ramifications and has in many cases around the world resulted in severe actions from regulatory agencies.\nAfter developing a proper understanding of data integrity definitions, expectations, and consequences of failure, it is critical to understand steps for ensuring data integrity.\n5.0 Responsible Integrity\nGMP-based facilities and analytical laboratories need to develop a culture of quality, ethics, and compliance, and establish a result-based system of accountability. In such a climate it is crucial that employees at all levels in an organization, whether operational, quality or manufacturing staff, clearly understand their responsibilities and are comfortable and confident that they are able to escalate concerns in any part of the organization before they become significant issues. Such an approach starts at the basic level; for example, each employee should recognize that s/he is accountable for his or her own signatures. However, in order to be successful, a positive culture designed to empower individual employees to report issues and recognize opportunities for improvements needs to be established at the senior leadership levels. In contrast, a culture of fear will only increase the potential for data manipulation and the risk of fraud and data integrity failures.\n6.0 Importance of Training\nTraining is essential for the quality and accuracy of data integrity practices. Internal quality auditors need to be experienced and competent in detecting data integrity deficiencies, and data verification activities must be part of the audit process.\nManufacturing personnel and/or technical laboratory staff must also have a complete and comprehensive understanding and appreciation for the procedures and policies that govern and secure data integrity. Because deviations will occur, as no facility is event-free, appropriately trained staff should be able to reinforce data integrity policies and procedures so as to significantly minimize their impact in the event that such a departure from protocol occurs.\n7.0 Human Error\nAlthough technical controls greatly reduce human error, the manner in which data is to be generated dictates the data integrity risk. Paper-based manual observations usually provide more visibility to potential data integrity risks than a configurable, complex, computer-based system. However, because failure with manual recordings does exist, all data must be recorded in real time directly onto the GMP record. These records also need to be controlled by issuance and reconciliation procedures for workbooks, batch records, and notebooks.\nLaboratory equipment and systems need be configured appropriately to enable traceability to the employee generating the data, to enable access to the original data (source data), and to provide visibility of any data changes and reasons for such changes. This can be accomplished by following a set of simple guidelines:\n- Enable audit trails on systems.\n- Limit system administrator access to a few distinct individuals. The number of administrators should take into account the size and nature of the organization.\n- Remove the ability for laboratory personnel to delete, overwrite, copy, alter or in any way manipulate data.\n- Ensure that each employee has a unique ID and accompanying password for the system.\n- Upgrade the software to ensure it is compliant with the Food and Drug Administration’s 21 CFR Part 11 and the European Medicine Agency’s Guidelines to Good Manufacturing Practice Annex 11.\nTo meet regulatory requirements, GMP organizations need to establish robust and sound programs that protect the data life cycle. Failure in just one area compromises the data integrity. Successful preservation of the data life cycle can only be achieved in organizations where a culture of quality, ethics and accountability is firmly established, a robust training program is employed, and organizational and technical controls are in place.\nJune 10, 2016 | Corresponding Author: Doug Chambers | doi: 10.14229/jadc.2016.06.01.001\nReceived: Aril 28, 2016 | Published online June 10, 2016 | This article has been peer reviewed by an independent editorial review board.\nFeatured Image: Data Courtesy: © University of Cambridge (UK)/Automatic Statistician.

80	tara hill ancient construction vs machu picchu ancient construction	Both Tara Hill and Machu Picchu showcase distinct ancient construction approaches. Tara features at least 24 separate monuments, including passage graves from the Neolithic era (3000-2400 BCE), ring forts, earthworks, and ritual enclosures. In contrast, Machu Picchu's construction methodology underwent significant changes around 1450 AD after a major earthquake. Initially built under Pachacútec's rule, the earthquake damage led the Incas to adopt a more seismic-resistant architecture featuring trapezoidal structures with giant stone blocks at the base and narrower upper walls, as well as a more rustic cellular architecture.	"['Nowhere in Ireland has richer associations than Temair, the ancient site of Tara. In prehistoric times it was already a major center for ritual, but it assumed even greater importance after the arrival of the Celts. The place featured prominently in early Irish legends and came to be regarded as the seat of the high kings of Ireland. As such, it became a potent symbol and rallying point of Irish unity and patriotism.\nTara is a complex site consisting of at least twenty-four separate monuments. The oldest of these is a passage grave from the Neolithic era (carbon-dated as 3000-2400 B.C.E.), although many of the structures were erected in the Bronze Age or the Iron Age, and not all were tombs. The site also includes a number of Raths (ring forts), earthworks, and ritual enclosures. Most of these were later given colourful names, linking them with ancient gods or kings. These include the Mound of the Hostages – a megalithic passage tomb and probably the oldest monument at the site – the Rath of the Synods. And the Banqueting Hall.\nFrom early times, Tara was regarded as a sacred site because of its links with the high king. The office of high king was usually held by the local ruler and did not signify any great military or territorial power, but it was hugely prestigious. The High King did not reside at Tara, but did participate in its ceremonies. The most important of these was the feis temrach (feast of Tara), which symbolized the ritual union between the king and the goddess of sovereignty. Prospective rulers also had to place a hand on the Lia Fail (Stone of Destiny), a mystic pillar stone reputed to shriek whenever it was touched by the rightful king. In later years, the Christian missionaries sought to exploit the reputation of the site by claiming that St. Patrick’s decisive confrontation with the pagan high king took place on the Hill of Tara.\nLismullin Henge • Gabhra Valley, Ireland\nby Jarrett A. Lobell, Archaeology Magazine\nEarly last year, archaeologists working on the route of a controversial highway near the village of Lismullin, Ireland, stumbled across a vast Iron Age ceremonial enclosure, or henge, surrounded by two concentric walls. The 2,000-year-old site is just over a mile from the Hill of Tara, traditional seat of the ancient Irish kings and site of St. Patrick’s conversion of the Irish to Christianity in the fifth century A.D. The discovery of the massive henge, measuring more than 260 feet in diameter, confirms the long-held belief that the area around the hill contains a rich complex of monuments.\nThe extraordinary amount of archaeological remains on the Hill of Tara–burial mounds, religious enclosures, stone structures, and rock art dating from the third millennium b.c. to the twelfth century A.D.–makes it Ireland’s most spiritually and archaeologically significant site. Construction of the new M3 highway, meant to ease traffic congestion around Dublin, threatens not only the Hill of Tara’s timeless quality, but also newly discovered archaeological sites in the surrounding valley.\nLismullin, seen above in an aerial shot taken during excavations, and other sites that stand in the way of the new road are now approved for destruction. Although archaeologists and concerned Irish politicians are rallying support worldwide for the protection of the Hill of Tara, the iconic site remains in great peril. At press time, the European Commission had initiated legal action against the Irish government over the M3, charging Ireland with failing to protect its own heritage.\nSome Tarawatch Events:\nIreland is unique in having a musical instrument, the harp, as its national emblem. This indicates the primacy of the harp in Irish culture. The sites currently under threat are inextricably linked with the harping and bardic traditions for more than 2,500 years. Tara was the gathering place for thousands of harpers to 142 kings, and the harp was an integral part of the ancient Irish parliament at Tara. The harp has been used in the coat of arms of Ireland since 1270 and is the symbol of the Irish State today. It is found in the seals of the President, Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Government Ministers, on State currency and is the insignia of the Irish Law Courts.\nPlease help save Tara.', ""Mega Earthquake Caused Major Shift in Inca Construction Methodology\nA major new scientific study revealed by Peru’s state-run news agency Andina has confirmed that construction of the ancient Inca city, Machu Picchu , located in modern day Peru, was interrupted in 1450 AD by a 'powerful earthquake’ that caused the Inca builders to design catastrophe-resistant architecture.\nWhat Was the Strength of The Violent Earthquake?\nOn the other side of the world in 1450 AD Johannes Gutenburg began operating the first mechanical printing press and the mysterious Voynich manuscript was brought to completion, but in ancient Peru, the mountains shook under the force of a violent earthquake. According to an article in The Peruvian Times , researchers from the Cusco-Pata Research Project have announced that the ancient landscape was hit by “a tremor of at least magnitude 6.5” during the reign of the 9th Inca Pachacútec.\nEarthquake recorded in about 1450 AD caused the separation of rocks in Machu Picchu. ( Andina)\nShift in the Earth Brings Forth Shift in Construction\nEvidence of the earthquake has been gathered by an international team of scientists since 2016, led by the Geological, Mining, and Metallurgical Institute (Ingemmet), and project coordinator Carlos Benavente Escobar. Escobar told reporters, “There was already construction underway with one type of architecture under Pachacutec. Then, we believe, in the middle of that construction of Machu Picchu there was a major earthquake.” Machu Picchu was the iconic mountain top summer estate of the 9th Inca ruler (Sapa) Pachacutec.\n- New Rock Paintings Discovered in Machu Picchu\n- Breakthrough Discovery at Machu Picchu is blocked by the Government\n- Archaeologists Discover Astronomical Observatory in Machu Picchu\nSample of seismic-resistant architecture (trapezoidal): Sacsayhuamán Archaeological Park. ( Andina)\nHow Was the Damage Evident?\nIt was “openings between rocks and stones” which acted as clues as the scientists knew such miss-alignments were “not typical of the Incas because they employed an impeccable, perfect construction.” The earthquake damage is most prevalent in the walls of the “Temple of the Sun” at Machu Picchu where Benavente said, “Some edges of the rocks are broken, which means that in the undulation of the earth, they hit each other which caused the breaks. After that, they continued the building in a different manner to complete what would become Machu Picchu.”\nIn the Sacsayhuamán Archaeological Park, there is also a separation between rocks produced by an earthquake of 1450. (Andina)\nHow Did the Incas Change Their Construction Methods?\nAn article in Porta Andeana explains that “After these deformations” caused by the earthquake, Pachacútec, having seen the underlying weakness in his current construction methodology, “arranged a modern architecture and placed masonry to repair the damage caused by the earthquake.” And the scientists also noted “Architectural change in the [agricultural] terraces.”\nAfter the quake, the Incas began building in what is being described as “a more rustic cellular architecture and continued to develop and perfect seismic-resistant trapezoidal structures, with giant stone blocks at the base with narrower upper walls.” Benavente concluded that “They knew how to coexist with diverse geologic dangers, like earthquakes, landslides, and avalanches.”\nSample of cellular architecture: Piquillacta Archaeological Complex. ( Andina)\nHow Can the Study of the Quake that Changed Inca Architecture Help Us Today?\nAiming to establish the geological origins of the earthquake that had such an impact on the Inca Empire, Benavente said “We are calibrating the last 14 radiocarbon ages to define what failure caused the earthquake, for the moment, it is suspected that it was the one in Tambomachay, located four kilometers from the Historic Center of Cusco.” “There is no doubt,” he says, “that the strong earthquake also caused the deformation of the walls of Sacsayhuamán, Tipón, and Tambomachay.”\nFieldwork at the Choquepuquio Archaeological Center. ( Andina)\n“For the first time in history, the techniques of paleoseismology, archaeo-seismology, and active tectonics have been combined in a study of this nature,” Benavente said. And he thinks it “necessary to help current-day planners analyze the seismic hazards of the Tambomachay and Pachatusan fault lines for the Cusco region.”\nSeparation of rocks in Machu Picchu due to an earthquake of at least magnitude 6.5, registered in approximately 1450 AD. ( Andina)\nWhat Has the Research Discovered?\nIn July this year Dr. Ken Tokeshi from Western Sydney University published a research paper , Earthquake risk to Inca's historical constructions in Machupicchu, presenting his “seismic risk analysis of the heritage structures at Machupicchu, identifying of the probable mode of failure of the structures concerned.” Like in this latest study, Dr. Tokeshi studied the “Results of the microtremor measurements to estimate the dynamic characteristics of the Inca stone structures.”\nHow Was the Affected Structure Used?\nWhile it is clear that Cuzco was the ancient capital city of the Inca Empire, the function of the structure at the suspected heart of the earthquake, ‘Tambomachay,’ remains something of a mystery. Consisting of elaborate stone-built canals and waterfalls running through the rock terraces, some archaeologists believe it might have been a military outpost guarding the primary approaches to Cusco, but others think it was a spa retreat for the social, political, and religious elite from Cuzco.\nTesista Lorena Rosell in the Sacsayhuamán Archaeological Park.

81	ancient greece water ritual significance restoration	Water held both ritual and practical significance in ancient Greece. The ancients used to bathe in the sea before performing their rituals for purification purposes. This spiritual connection to water continues in modern restoration efforts, as seen at the Palace of Knossos, where water supply and drainage systems were among the earliest functional features implemented around 1900 BC when the first palace was built.	"[""Ask a Greek what they love the most about their country, and they will say “the sea and the sun”. But no matter how clichéd this may sound, water and light are indeed the two main components of what makes the Greek landscape so unique and irresistible. Greek painter Maria Filopoulou takes up these two clichés unashamedly, in fact transforming their touristic banality into visual embraces that are intended to purify and transport the viewer to imaginary places of paradisiacal calm. “At first I didn’t want to paint seascapes”, she tells me over tea at her house in Kifisia, Athens. “I didn’t want to make postcards of Greek islands, you know? I was looking for something harsher, more esoteric.” From sprawling bays that seem to engulf the viewer to frieze-like, 4-meter-long compositions of underwater swimmers, Filopoulou takes the imagery of the Greek summer and transforms it into stunning painterly gestures that, as she says, are all about freedom.\nFilopoulou has been painting since she can remember, and moved to Paris in 1984 to study at the prestigious Ecole des Beaux-Arts. She had her first solo show in 1990 and hasn’t stopped since; in fact, her current exhibition at Galerie Dutko in Paris is her twentieth. (“You could say that I’m turning twenty this year”, she laughs.) Her living room is filled with her work: huge paintings of seascapes, each as big as a wall. “The sea is important to me, and Kifisia is far from the sea, so I tried to bring a bit of the sea here!” Evidently, the sea is her obsession: “The water is a relief for me. I enter the sea and I forget everything”. Her water-themed works include not only seascapes and swimmers, but also a series of paintings inspired by the famous waterfalls of Samothrace. Once a sacred island where people would go and participate in holy rites, the Greek island of Samothrace is home to many cascades and pools. “With the waterfall series I wanted to focus on the constant flow of the water in contrast to the immobile body of the bather”. What is striking about these waterfall pieces is the accuracy and delicate precision Filopoulou renders every splash and glint of the water with, as if she were a water goddess herself who conjures the roaring water on the spot.\nNevertheless, Filopoulou doesn’t rely on superficial imagery to create her work. It’s important for her to have personal memories and experiences from each place; this is why she keeps painting images inspired by places she visits often, like the Greek islands or the so-called Ancient Pool in Hierapolis, a hot-spring resort in Pamukkale, Turkey. “I've visited Pamukkale for seven years in a row, and would swim in this pool filled with ancient ruins. There’s so much you can do in a painting with this setting”. The Ancient Pool of Pamukkale is indeed a hot-spring pool of a former hotel that was demolished after the whole area was declared a Unesco World Heritage Site. Originally a Roman spa city, the pool had a portico built all around it, but an earthquake in 7th century AD brought it down and all the columns ended up inside the pool. This Atlantis-like imagery inspired a whole series of paintings by Filopoulou, where she paints naked swimmers floating over a seabed covered with ancient columns and ruins.\nLeafing through the catalogue of her most recent retrospective (Syros, 2009), Filopoulou explains how her work evolved from dark interior spaces to the vast openness and blinding light of the Greek landscape. “When I first went to Paris, I started painting closed spaces —rooms, fire escapes, stairwells... This sense of being enclosed by a space is something that runs throughout my work, right to this day. I feel that when I’m inside, I’m protected. And that makes me feel free.” This gradually evolved into her hothouse paintings soon after she returned to Greece, and her wide-angle paintings of old Greek houses. “But I often needed a change of scenery, that’s why I would go out with my sketch book and draw beaches, islands, the sea... Gradually this became the focus of my work. As you can see, I might have got a bit carried away!” For Filopoulou there’s a conscious connection between interior spaces and her underwater seascapes, in that they are both contained spaces that evoke a sense of protection. She often frames all sides of her canvases, the top with the reflecting sea surface, the bottom with the sea bed, and the two sides with rock formations. “This is for me like an embrace, almost like coming out of a sea cave to the light. I often go to Milos and dive inside the caves on the south coast, and my favourite game is to go inside the cave and then turn around to see the world outside.”\nThe third time I hear Filopoulou mention freedom, I ask her what it is that she needs to be free and protected from. “The madness of our times” she says. “With all the chaos and crisis and all those things, I need my remedy. Some might say that my paintings are too dreamy or fairytale-like, that they have nothing to do with present-day reality in Greece. Yet I think this is my antidote to that. That’s why I called my exhibition in Paris ‘The Antidote of Water’. The ancients used to bathe in the sea before performing their rituals, perhaps for the same reason that I feel relieved and cleansed when I swim. I just wanted to convey that personal feeling to the viewer.” Despite the madness and the crisis, Greece is the only place she could ever be: “Well, I could move to a warmer place, but not a colder place! There’s also an unimaginable boom in the arts here: so many great exhibitions, new galleries, festivals... I suppose, like the water, art is our antidote.”"", 'The Palace of Knossos, the largest of the Cretan palaces, and the city that arose around it are built on the top and slopes of the low hill of Kefala, where the River Kairatos meets the small Vlychia stream. Security, fertile land, water and proximity to the sea were the main reasons not only for the choice of the site as a place of habitation from earliest prehistoric times, but also for its subsequent prosperity and growth.\nThe first traces of habitation date back to the Neolithic period, when there appears to have been an extensive settlement on the site, parts of which have been identified in the “West” and “Central Court”. Parts of Prepalatial buildings have also been excavated in the “West Court”.\nThe first palace was built circa 1900 BC, following the levelling and landscaping of the hill. From the few parts of it that survive (“Magazine of the Giant Pithoi”, etc.), it seems that its basic layout was set out in sectors around the great “Central Court”. The water supply and drainage systems were already functional. The first palace was destroyed around 1700 BC and the new palace was erected in its place. It is this palace, with a few later additions, which survives to this day.\nIndented façades, flat roofs of different heights crowned with double horns, and upper storeys (two on the west and five on the east), combined with the wide variety of colours and building materials, all gave the exterior of the Palace an imposing aspect. Poros-stone ashlars were used in the masonry. The floors were paved with slabs of green schist pointed with red plaster. The columns, beams and doorframes were made of wood. Gypsum slabs covered the walls (in the form of marble revetment) and floors, giving the spaces an air of luxury. Gypsum was also used for the bases of columns and jambs, seats, stairs, etc. The decoration of the rooms was supplemented by colourful plaster and frescoes.\nOver the following years there were supplementary excavations, which were completed in 1930-31. After the Second World War, the British School of Archaeology continued the excavations with significant results, both in the area of the Palace itself and in the Minoan city surrounding it.\nThe necessity of restoring the Palace was evident from the first years of the excavation. The fragile building materials proved extremely sensitive to weathering. During the first phase of their restoration efforts, in 1905, Evans and his colleagues restricted themselves to protecting the ruins. After 1925, however, Evans attempted a radical reconstruction of the monument, with large-scale use of reinforced concrete. Upper storeys and architectural elements were reconstructed. The timber frames and wooden Minoan columns were made of concrete and painted to imitate the originals. The frescoes were restored and copies placed in different parts of the Palace.\nEvans’s interventions provoked a variety of reactions. It was noted that the archaeological data on which the reconstruction was based were not always clear. In other cases, the ancient remains cannot be distinguished from the interventions. The reconstructions are irreversible. However, many people believe that the interventions were necessary for the preservation of the monument. Moreover, they attract visitors’ interest and make it easier for them to understand the architecture of the Palace. Others, on the contrary, believe that the interventions largely present visitors with Evans’s ideas and the dominant aesthetic and ideological trends of his time. Today, however, Evans’s reconstruction of the Palace forms an integral part of the monument and its history.\nAfter the Second World War, extensive restoration work was carried out on the Palace by the Directors of the Heraklion Archaeological Museum N. Platon and S. Alexiou.

This is because sharks have no bones - their skeleton is made of cartilage which does not fossilize well. However, shark teeth are very hard and fossilize well, as evidenced by the 80-million-year-old fossilized shark teeth discovered in Israel.	"['A cache of 80-million-year-old shark teeth in Israel? How is this possible?\nIn Israel, scientists have discovered what they believe to be an unexplained cache of fossilized shark teeth. The find was made in the city of David in Jerusalem, that is, a most unexpected place for a shark-related discovery. Scientists theorize that the teeth were part of an ancient collection but were also brought to this location from afar. Analysis has shown that the fossils are approximately 80 million years old.\nEverything you need to know about the unexpected discovery of shark teeth in Israel\nThe shark teeth were discovered in a 2900-year-old layer. Archaeologists have investigated the basement of an Iron Age house. It was full of all sorts of rubbish, which was probably deliberately clogged up the basement before the building was rebuilt. Archaeologists have stumbled upon a large number of fish bones, which were probably thrown away as waste.\nHowever, among these bones, fossilized shark teeth were suddenly found. Already this very fact puzzled scientists because the nearest place where sharks could live in ancient times is 80 km from the place of discovery. But even more, researchers were amazed at the age of the fossils. Analysis has shown that it is about 80 million years old.\nYet, there is no existing evidence about why the cache was set up at this particular unexpected location. Researchers theorize that the shark teeth were part of a collection from the era of King Solomon.\nHowever, the fossilized teeth for some reason were dumped in the basement, not only along with the waste. In the same place, scientists discovered ceramics and hundreds of bulls – objects that were used at that time to seal confidential messages. The presence of bulls could indicate a possible connection between the excavated building and the administrative staff or the ruling class.\nInitially, researchers assumed that the shark teeth were nothing more than food waste from 3,000 years ago but further research pointed out that a tooth belonged to extinct species of late Cretaceous shark from no less than 66 million years ago.\nAfter that, the researchers withdrew their paper and conducted an isotopic analysis of strontium. He confirmed that the age of all 29 found shark teeth is 80 million years, that is, these teeth belonged to marine contemporaries of dinosaurs.\nThe research team also concluded that this collection was brought to the city of David from afar. By the way, earlier such unexplained collections were found in two more historical places in Israel.\nAccording to researchers, perhaps in the Iron Age, there was a certain fashion for collecting such items. Moreover, it was a period of prosperity for the Jewish court. But so far this is only a hypothesis.\nAs for the teeth, they have been identified. It has been established that the fossils belong to several species of shark, including representatives of the extinct group Squalicorax. These sharks, growing up to 2-5 meters in length, lived only in the Late Cretaceous period.\nJoin the discussion and participate in awesome giveaways in our mobile Telegram group.

They live in waters all over the world, in every ocean, and even in some rivers and lakes.\nSharks are a type of fish.\nUnlike bony fish, sharks have no bones; their skeleton is made of cartilage, which is a tough, fibrous substance, not nearly as hard as bone. Sharks also have no swim bladder (unlike bony fish).\nMAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SHARKS AND BONY FISH\n||Bones and cartilage\n||Can only swim forward.\n||Can swim forwards and backwards\n||Large oily liver\n||Gas-filled swim bladder\n||Gill slits but no gill cover\n||Covered gill slits\n||Eggs fertilized in female's body.\n||Eggs usually fertilized in the water.\n||Rough, sandpaper-like placoid scales\n||Slippery, overlapping scales\nThere are many different species of sharks that range in size from the size of a person's hand to bigger than a bus. Fully-grown sharks range in size from 7 inches (18 cm) long (the Spined Pygmy shark), up to 50 feet (15 m) long (the Whale shark). Most sharks are intermediate in size, and are about the same size as people, 5-7 feet (1.5-2.1 m) long. Half of the 368 shark species are under 39 inches (1 m) long.\nA scuba diver above a Whale shark. The Whale shark is the largest fish in the world; the basking shark is the second largest fish.\nSharks have a variety of body shapes. Most sharks have streamlined, torpedo-shaped bodies that glide easily through the water. Some bottom-dwelling sharks (e.g. the angelshark) have flattened bodies that allow them to hide in the sand of the ocean bed. Some sharks have an elongated body shape (e.g., cookiecutter sharks and wobbegongs). Sawsharks have elongated snouts, thresher sharks have a tremendously elongated upper tail fin which they use to stun prey, and hammerheads have extraordinarily wide heads. The goblin shark has a large, pointed protuberance on its head; its purpose is unknown.\nVARIETIES OF SHARKS\n|There are about 368 different species of sharks, which are divided into 30 families. These different families of sharks are very different in the way they look, live, and eat. They have different shapes, sizes, color, fins, teeth, habitat, diet, personality, method of reproduction, and other attributes. Some types of shark are very rare (like the great white shark and the megamouth) and some are quite common (like the dogfish shark and bull shark). Sharks belong to the group of cartilagenous fish, the Elasmobranchii, that includes the sharks, rays, and skates.\nThere are over 350 different species of sharks. The spiny dogfish shark is the most common shark.\nSharks are a type of fish that have no bones, only cartilage. Some parts of their skeleton, like their vertebrae, are calcified. Cartilage, a strong fibrous substance, is softer than bone; our nose and ears are made of cartilage.\nSharks (like the Goblin Shark pictured above) have no bones; their skeleton is made of cartilage.\nSharks belong to the group of fishes called Elasmobranchii, which also includes the rays, skates, and ratfish. The Elasmobranchii are all fish that have no bones, only cartilage.\nSharks may have up to 3,000 teeth at one time. Most sharks do not chew their food, but gulp it down whole it in large pieces. The teeth are arranged in rows; when one tooth is damaged or lost, it is replaced by another. Most sharks have about 5 rows of teeth at any time. The front set is the largest and does most of the work.\nSharks vary greatly in their diets, but they are all carnivores.\n- Some (like the great white, mako, tiger, and hammerhead) are swift predators that eat fish, squid, other sharks, and marine mammals.\n- Some (like the zebra horn shark, angelshark, and wobbegong) are slow-swimming predators that crush and eat shellfish (crabs and clams) from the ocean floor.\n- Others (like the whale shark, the basking shark, and the megamouth) are filter feeders that sieve tiny bits of plankton and small animals from the water as they swim with open mouths. They eat huge amounts of these tiny animals and plants.\nDO SHARKS SLEEP?\nFish don't sleep in the same way that we do, but they have active and inactive periods. Some sharks (like the nurse shark) have been observed resting motionless on the sea floor. Others have to keep moving in order to breathe.\nWhen some sharks (like the Great White or the Gray Reef shark) turn aggressive prior to an attack, they arch their back and throw back their head. This places their mouth in a better position for taking a big bite. They also move their tail more acutely (probably in preparation for a chase).\nSharks do not normally attack people, and only about 25 species of sharks are known to attack people. Sharks attack fewer than 100 people each year. Many more people are killed by bees or lightning.\nThe sharks that are the most dangerous to people are the great white shark, the tiger shark, the bull shark, and the oceanic whitetip shark. The bull shark is the most frequent attacker of people as it swims in very shallow waters where people swim and is a very plentiful shark. Some of the other sharks that are known to have attacked people include the gray shark, blue shark, hammerhead shark, mako shark, nurse shark, lemon shark, blacktip reef shark, wobbegongs, sandtiger, spitting sharks, and the porbeagle. Some people believe that sharks mistake people (especially people swimming on surf boards) for seals and sea lions, some of their favorite foods.\nOccasionally, a group of sharks will attack a food source (for example, a school of fish) in a maniacal fashion. They will wildly attack the food and anything in the area, even each other, sometimes wounding or eating fellow sharks.\nScientists have shown that sharks are relatively intelligent and can learn at a rate similar to that of rats and birds.\nSharks live in oceans and seas all over the world, and even in some rivers and lakes, especially in warmer waters. Some sharks live near the surface, some live deep in the water, and others live on or near the ocean floor. Pelagic sharks (living in the open ocean) include the great white shark, the basking shark, etc. Benthic sharks (living at the ocean floor) include the zebra horn shark, the wobbegongs, and the angelshark, which usually have flattened, camouflaged bodies that let them hide in the sea bed. Some sharks even venture many miles up into the fresh water of rivers like the Mississippi in the USA and the Amazon in Brazil. The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) sometimes ventures into fresh water.\nSome sharks live in relatively warm waters (hammerheads, bull sharks, and tiger sharks). Other sharks, such as the thresher, mako, basking and blue shark, live in temperate water (which is neither hot nor cold). Others, including the dogfish, Greenland, and goblin, live in cool waters. Some sharks stay in the same region their entire lives while others travel across oceans.\nMIGRATION OF SHARKS\nThere are three different types of sharks when it come to migratory patterns:\n- Local sharks - these sharks do not migrate, and range only about a hundred miles from their habitat. Examples include the bonnethead shark, and the nurse shark.\n- Coastal pelagic sharks - these sharks can migrate over 1,000 miles (1,600 km). Examples include the dusky shark, the blacktip sharks, the tiger shark, and the sandbar shark.\n- Highly pelagic sharks - these sharks migrate across oceans. Examples include the blue shark and the mako.\nEVOLUTION OF SHARKS\nSharks have existed for over 350 million years. They evolved over 100 million years before the dinosaurs did. This was long before people evolved. Most fossil evidence of early sharks is from fossilized teeth and a few skin impressions. Cladodonts, primitive sharks, had double-pointed teeth, were up to 6 feet (2 m) long lived about 360 million years ago (mya); they ate fish and crustaceans.\nFor more information on early sharks, click here.\nMegalodon (Carcharodon megalodon) was an ancient, meat-eating shark, living between 25-1.6 million years ago; it is extinct. It was over 40 feet (12 m) long, but this is only an estimate from fossil teeth that have been found. Its teeth resemble those of the great white shark but are almost 3 times larger; these teeth are each the size of a person's hand!\nShark fossils are rare because sharks have no bones, only cartilage, which does not fossilize well. Fossilized shark teeth are very hard and fossilize well.\nENDANGERED AND PROTECTED SPECIES\nThe largest sharks are decreasing in numbers around the world because of being hunted by people. The Great white shark, the Basking shark, and the Whale shark are all waning. The Great white is protected along the coast of California and South Africa.\nOver 35,000 Web Pages\nSample Pages for Prospective Subscribers, or click below\nEnchanted Learning Search\nSearch the Enchanted Learning website for:\nEnchantedLearning.com ------ How to cite a web page\nENCHANTED LEARNING and ZOOM DINOSAURS are registered trademarks of Enchanted Learning Software.\nZOOM is a registered trademark of WGBH Educational Foundation.\nZoom School is not affiliated with WGBH Educational Foundation.""]"	['<urn:uuid:a131f72c-6ab1-471b-a3b6-d952245cd209>', '<urn:uuid:38f71f70-53ce-4526-9d43-7c585fb0d061>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	11	50	2192
83	Being interested in military family history, I wonder how many of the Stevens brothers served in World War I, and how does this compare to the total number of NSW railway employees who enlisted?	Four Stevens brothers served in World War I: William Frederick (who died at Mons), George Edward (Ted) who served in India, James Albert (Jim) who served in France, and Moses who joined in 1915 and had an extended military career until 1937. This family's sacrifice was part of a larger pattern from the NSW Railways and Tramways Department, where 8,447 men enlisted out of a total workforce of 45,000 employees, with 1,210 ultimately losing their lives in service.	['Private 9120 William Frederick Stevens\nWilliam Frederick Stevens was the eldest of 7 children of William and Emily Stevens. Although a Gloucestershire boy by birth, the 1911 census record shows that by then the family had settled in Wroughton, Wiltshire and William was a Labourer in the Great Western Railway (GWR) works.\nWilliam was known in the family as ‘Banker’ but no one knows the origin of this nick name. He joined the 1st Battalion of the Wiltshire Regiment, and after a brief period of training was sent to France.\nSadly, Private 9120 William Frederick Stephens was injured in the Battle of Mons and lay for hours on the battlefield before he was found and returned to England. He died days later at the Royal Boscombe Hospital. He had a full military funeral that was reported in the Bournemouth Echo of Saturday 24th October 1914 and also in the Swindon Evening Advertiser on Tuesday 27th October 1914.\nThe wording of the tribute to William in the Swindon Evening Advertiser was as follows, it paints a vivid picture of the consequences of war:-\nA WROUGHTON SOLDIER’S DEATH & BURIAL\nMONS. HERO BURIED\nUNIQUE AND SOLEMN SERVICE\nA MILITARY FUNERAL\n“The Bournemouth Echo” of Saturday contains a long account of the death and burial of a Wroughton soldier at Boscombe, Bournemouth. It reads:-\nThe grim realities of the war are daily being brought home to the people of Bournemouth, and a scene witnessed at Boscombe this morning, when a young soldier who had died from wounds was laid in a soldier’s grave, gave a new and more solemn reminder of the stern meaning of war and of the many such burials happening beyond our ken.\nThe young hero over whom today the “Last Post” was sounded was Private William F. Stevens of the “C” Company, 1st Wiltshire Regiment, twenty-three years old, whose hip was badly shattered by a shrapnel wound at the Battle of Mons. He lay on the field of battle fifteen hours after being rendered helpless, and this fact, it is believed spoilt any chances he had of recovery, for since his admission to the Boscombe Military Hospital his case had been regarded as a critical, if not a hopeless one, and terminated fatally last Monday.\nThe bereaved parents, who were present at this morning’s solemn ceremony, have two more soldier sons – one in the Wiltshire Regiment now in France, and the third in India.\nThe grief of the parents, great as it obviously was, must have been assuaged by the consoling note of a military funeral and the sympathy of the onlookers.\nThe deceased soldier hails from Wroughton, near Swindon, but it was his humble parents’ wish that he should be buried where he died.\nA pathetic interest was added by the presence of the long cortege of soldiers of between twenty and thirty of deceased’s wounded comrades.\nThe little band of them – a strange mixture of all kinds of regiments – walked together, and with an emotion known only to themselves and unbetrayed by a firm upper lip, they paid their impressively silent tribute to their dead comrade.\nOne of the heroes peeped over a bandage which almost wholly concealed his face from view: another had the crown of his head swathed in white: while others were either nursing an injured arm or still obviously recovering from injuries to other parts of the body. All wore their khaki coats, most of them battle-stained from the strenuous days of the great retirement from Belgium.\nMilitary honours in the midst of this striking and unique setting seemed but an incidental feature of a memorable ceremony.\nThe other soldiers who made up the procession commenced to assemble in the vicinity of the Hospital about eleven o’clock. The units which lined up outside the Hospital and extended in a long double line towards King’s Park, included the “G” and “H” Companies of the 7th Hants Territorials under the command of Capt. Palmer, the 6th Hants Reserve Battery R.F.A., under the command of Capt. Langley Taylor with a firing party and bugle party, also of the 7th Hants.\nThe gun carriage and team which, drawn by six horses, waited outside the Hospital, belonged to the 1st Wessex Royal Engineers Field Company, and was in charge of Corpl. Pratt. The coffin, draped with the Union Jack, was borne from the Hospital to the gun carriage by some dozen of the 7th Hants Reserve Battalion, the bugle and firing party meanwhile standing at attention facing the entrance to the new front of the Hospital.\nThe procession to the Cemetery, via King’s Park, through the main entrance was headed by the 7th Hants Reserve Band under Sergt. Dowding, and was followed by the units named. Behind the gun carriage were cabs containing the mourners, including, first Mr. and Mrs. W. F. Stevens (deceased’s mother and father), who were accompanied by Sister Jones (of the “Empress Victoria” Ward in which the deceased died), and Mr. Gordon Saul, the Secretary to the Royal Victoria and West Hants Hospital. In succeeding cabs were: Surg-Gen Stevenson (officer-in-charge of the sick and wounded at the Hospital). Mr. D.H.W. Robson Burrows (Chairman of the Management Committee of the Royal Victoria and West Hants Hospital), Mr. Godwin Pratt (Hon. Secretary of the Sick and Wounded Committee), the Matron at the Boscombe Hospital (Mrs Samuel Smith), and other officials.\nThe rear of the procession was brought up by other members of the staff of the Hospital, including a considerable number of nurses(?) and lastly the R.A.M.C. ambulance section of the National Reserve, under Sergeant-Major Gurney.\nAmongst others in the procession were Capt. Wingate, representing Col. Godfrey (National Reserve), Sergt-Major Jones (Royal Artillery, Woolwich), and other officers.\nThe journey to the Cemetery was made to the accompaniment of Chopin’s Funeral March and other music. At the church in the burial ground the cortege was met by the Rev. John Hayes, chaplain to the Hospital, and senior curate at St. John’s Boscombe. The scene inside the little church was one to be remembered. The wounded and other soldiers occupied the major portion of it, and the bereaved parents occupied a position next to Sister Jones and the Matron. After the usual service the cortege proceeded to the graveside, where, despite the rain which had fallen almost incessantly, a large crowd had collected. After the committal portions of the service, there followed the firing of the three volleys and the sounding of the “Last Post”.\nThe coffin, of elm with brass fittings, was enclosed in a violet covering, and on a brass inscription plate was the inscription “William Frederick Stevens: died October 19th 1914 aged 23 years”.\nAttached to the floral tokens were the following:- “In loving memory from Father and Mother:” “In loving memory from his sweetheart Bessie:” “With much sympathy from the Royal Victoria and West Hants Hospital:” “From his friend, Mrs Samuel Smith:” “D. Crespighy, Bournemouth:” “For King and Country”. The token from the parents consisted of a harp with a broken string: several bouquets of flowers bearing the military colours were also laid on the grave. (Swindon Evening Advertiser, Tuesday, 27th October, 1914)\nWilliam is commemorated on the War Memorial in the village of Wroughton, where many members of the extended family still live.\nA timeline of William Frederick Stevens’ life\n10th November 1888 William is born in South Cerney, Gloucestershire, the eldest of 7 children of William and Emily Stevens (Nee Paradise)\n1901 census The 13 year old William is recorded as being a farm labourer in Harpsden, Oxfordshire.\n1911 census The Stevens family are recorded as living in Wroughton, Wiltshire and William, like so many other men living in the area, is a Labourer at the GWR works.\n19th October 1914 William died, aged just 25, at the Royal Boscombe Hospital, Hampshire, as a result of wounds received on the battlefields of Mons.\nBROTHERS IN ARMS\nTwo of William’s brothers, George Edward Stevens (known as Ted) and James Albert Stevens (Jim), were also serving at the time of William’s death; Ted in India and Jim in France alongside William. The family story is that Jim was the person who found William injured on the battlefield.\nA third brother, Moses Stevens, joined up in 1915 and after training in Weymouth he was drafted to France in 1916.\nMoses had a long career in the Army; he served initially in the Wiltshire Regiment and then in 1917 transferred to the Devonshire Regiment. Whilst with the Devonshire’s he was wounded at Passchendaele and was evacuated to England to recover. Returning to service he was sent to Italy where again he was wounded. He was discharged in March 1919, but in June 1919 he re-enlisted into the Royal Artillery, and during the next 18 years served in India in the Indian Signal Service and the Royal Corps of Signals, reaching the rank of Sergeant. He was finally discharged in June 1937.\nMoses married Nellie Maskell in Sept 1925 whilst on leave in England. Nellie and their first child, Harold, joined Moses in India in March 1927. It took 21 days at sea and 3 days and nights by rail. The family travelled across the Desert to Karachi where Moses was stationed. Two of his four children were born in India.\nUpon discharge from the Army Moses went to work for the Post Office, and when WW2 broke out he joined the 22nd Hampshire (32nd G.P.O.) Home Guard as a Captain.', 'Lives on the line\nLives on the Line is a commemorative artwork to acknowledge the contributions and sacrifices of the NSW railwaymen who enlisted during World War 1.\nIt is on permanent display at Trainworks rail museum. Commissioned by Transport Heritage NSW and Sydney Trains for the Anzac Centenary (2014–2018), Lives on the Line was conceived and designed by local artists Celeste Coucke and Stephen Fearnley.\nAt the outbreak of war in 1914, the NSW Railways and Tramways Department was the largest enterprise in the state, with 45,000 employees. Over the course of the war, 8,447 men from the department enlisted and 1,210 of these men died on active service.\nSome NSW railwaymen were recruited specifically to assist with operating railway lines for the Allied war effort in Europe but most served amongst other soldiers fighting on the frontline. In an era when road transportation and aviation were still in their infancy, the nature and scale of World War I suited the use of railways like no war before or since. Joseph Joffre, Commander-in- Chief of the French Army during the war declared: ‘This is a railway war… if we win this war it will be largely due to the railways.’\nThe aims of the project were to: honour, in a poignant and respectful way, the 8,447 NSW railwaymen who were involved in World War 1; create an evolving and participatory artwork which, at its conclusion, would serve as an enduring memorial; and to enable people from around the state to be involved in the creation of the artwork.\nEach of the railwaymen who enlisted is represented in the artwork by a handmade stoneware object, created by members of the public using press moulds and clay. The moulds were used to create facsimiles of objects from the collections of Transport Heritage NSW and the Australian War Memorial. These small, everyday objects represent the types of things that soldiers and railwaymen wore on their uniforms or on their person, the types of artefacts that became trapped in the mud of battlefields and later excavated.\nBetween August 2015 and March 2016, workshops were held in various locations across the state to give members of the public an opportunity to participate in the creation of the artwork. Through this community engagement program, thousands of people learnt about the contribution of the NSW Railways to World War 1 and were given a rare opportunity to help make a public artwork.\nThe project also involved over 2000 school students from local schools, including Bargo Public School, Chevalier College, Mittagong Public School, Moss Vale Public School, North Goulburn Public School, Robertson Public School, Thirlmere Public School, Windellama Public School and Wollondilly Anglican College.\nThe schools outreach program enabled the story of the contribution of the NSW Railways to World War 1 to be told to a new generation and, in making a piece of the artwork with their own hands, students gained a sense of ownership over both the artwork and the story.\nThe first section features the red and purple wool felt shoulder patch worn by the Australian railway operating companies on both broad gauge and light railway lines. The 6 th Australian Broad Gauge Railway Operating Company (6 th ABGROC) was formed in Sydney in December 1916, made up primarily by volunteers from the New South Wales Government Railways. They sailed in February 1916 and after a period of training in Britain, arrived in France in May 1917. After a period working at the main Railway Operating Division base at Audruicq (near Calais), in July 1917 they took control of the locomotive depot and exchange sidings at Bergues Exchange that was supporting the Ypres area.\nFor Christmas 1917, the 6 th ABGROC sent a hand drawn card to the Chief Commissioner of the New South Wales Railways, James Fraser. Seven pages of the card contain the signatures, regimental numbers and ranks of 269 of the enlisted men of the unit. These signatures have been reproduced and incised into the tiles as a tribute to the men of the 6 th ABGROC.\nThe pieces in the middle section were made by local school students and members of the public in workshops that were held throughout NSW. Plaster press moulds were made based on artefacts from the collections of Transport Heritage NSW and the Australian War Memorial. Clay was used to make stoneware facsimiles of the objects. Each of the objects was selected for its association with the NSW Railways of the era or Australian World War I soldiers – while some were recruited specifically to assist with rail operations, the majority served amongst other soldiers fighting on the frontline.\nThe final panel of the artwork features 1,210 star-like points of light to represent the Railway and Tramway Employees who died on active service. During the war the NSW Railways listed any men killed in action in Annual Reports. In the madness of it all many names were overlooked, or only added years later. The Honour Roll in 1921 records 1,210 employees who had ‘given their life for the cause of liberty and Empire’. Many more were wounded, some beyond hope of ever working productively again.']	['<urn:uuid:185d17f4-11da-4b03-9ea7-27f0aad2a142>', '<urn:uuid:de6146fa-3cfd-4ffe-95dc-c540d167c5e9>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	34	78	2437
84	graphical password system benefits based on face recognition time processing	Recognition of familiar faces takes only 20 milliseconds as part of a dedicated brain process. This makes face-based authentication like Passfaces extremely reliable since people never forget familiar faces, and causes it to exhibit some characteristics of a biometric authentication factor.	"['An authentication factor is a piece of information and process used to authenticate or verify the identity of a person or other entity requesting access to online resources. User authentication for most web sites and services today is accomplished by means of a single authentication factor: a password. Where a higher level of assurance is required (e.g. for access to on online banking service), a second factor is typically employed in addition to the password – hence “two factor authentication” (also called “multi factor authentication” or ""strong authentication"").\nThere are three main types of authentication factor:\nknowledge factors – e.g. passwords, PINs;\npossession factors – e.g. ID cards, tokens;\nhuman factors (aka biometrics) – e.g. fingerprints, iris scans.\nSome security practitioners argue that “true” two factor authentication requires two distinct types of factor; however, this is just a matter of semantics. There is nothing inherently less secure about using two factors of the same type.\nWho needs two factor authentication?\nPasswords alone provide very poor security. They can be guessed, phished and hacked and are clearly inadequate to protect high value online services such as Internet banking. Indeed, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC – the body responsible for promoting uniformity in the supervision of US financial institutions) has mandated two factor authentication for consumer online banking services.\nCompliance is also driving adoption of two factor authentication in other areas – for example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in healthcare, where the important issue is the confidentiality of user data (patient records). And as more and more of our personal information goes online, privacy – and the threat of identity theft – is increasingly an issue in applications as diverse as gaming and dating and as common as Facebook.\nFurther requirements for two factor authentication include: protection of company confidential data (e.g. customer information on salesforce.com), controlling access paid-for content (e.g. music/video downloads from iTunes) and, perhaps most importantly, demonstrating due care to customers and users.\nTwo way authentication is equally important\nPhishing is one of the most prevalent attacks on the Internet today and a primary enabler for fraud and identity theft. And the increasing sophistication of the phishers makes it very difficult for users to distinguish between genuine and fake sites. Thus, it is just as important to be able to authenticate the site to the user as it is to authenticate the user to the site. Where site-to-user and user-to-site authentication are combined, it is known as “two way authentication” or “mutual authentication” or even “bidirectional authentication”.\nPassfaces two way, two factor authentication\nPassfaces patented graphical password technology is unique in providing both two factor authentication and two way authentication in a single process. Passfaces also provides a comprehensive combination of other benefits – including security, usability, portability, ease of deployment, reliability and low cost – that makes it a compelling choice of two factor authentication system.\nPassfaces capitalizes on the universal human ability to remember and recognize faces and is completely intuitive to use – independent of age, language, education and culture. Although Passfaces is essentially a knowledge (authentication) factor, it is based on recognition – of familiar faces – rather than recall (as with a password or a PIN). Recognition is the most powerful form of memory: a part of the human brain is dedicated to the process and it takes us only 20 milliseconds to recognize someone we know. It seems that familiar faces are “hard-wired” in our brains – which, as well as making Passfaces extremely reliable (people never forget a familiar face), causes Passfaces to exhibit some characteristics of a biometric or human authentication factor.\nPassfaces two factor authentication is implemented entirely in server-side software with a user interface that works in any web browser. There are no tokens for users to lose or forget, no client software to install and no “crypto-cookies” to tie the user to a single machine. Passfaces leverages existing password infrastructure and requires no additional servers or databases; furthermore, Passfaces can be fully deployed in a Web environment within a few days rather than the weeks or months required by more complex alternatives.']"	['<urn:uuid:d4750f03-3d96-4fa5-a0ad-df5d1174162f>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	10	41	690
85	I have an old conviction for drug possession. What are the chances of getting a visa waiver for visiting the US, and how is this different if I want to move there permanently?	For temporary visits, you have better chances of getting a waiver. Most inadmissibilities, including drug offenses, can be waived for non-immigrant visas. The consular officer will evaluate your case based on three factors: risk of harm to society, seriousness of your violations, and your reasons for entering the US. However, for permanent immigration, drug-related offenses (except single possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana) cannot be waived at all. The process for temporary visa waivers takes 6-8 months, and you should not make travel plans until you receive the visa.	"['Applicants who have been arrested or charged with a crime are advised to apply for a visa well in advance of your intended date of travel. Please note this includes any offences involving the possession or use of a controlled substance. You will need to provide details of your conviction in the form of court records. Be aware that it is your responsibility to obtain these records should they be required.\nAt your visa interview, a consular officer will determine whether or not you are eligible for a U.S. visa. We are not able to advise whether or not you are eligible for a visa in advance of the interview.\nShould you be found ineligible, the interviewing consular officer will decide on whether or not to submit a request for a waiver of your ineligibility. This request is made on your behalf to U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Admissibility Review Office. The recommendation for a waiver is at the discretion of the interviewing consular officer and will be based on the nature, recency, and severity of your offense(s).\nApproval of a waiver can take six to eight months so it is strongly advised that you not make any travel bookings prior to receipt of the visa.\nTravelers with Criminal Records\nConvictions for certain crimes may make you ineligible to travel to the U.S. with the exception of a single DIC/DUI (see below). The only way to know for sure if your criminal record makes you ineligible is to apply for a visa. Only a consular officer can determine your visa eligibility. Please note that New Zealand’s Clean Slate Act does not apply to U.S. visa law. If you have a criminal record and attempt to travel without a visa, you may be refused entry into the United States.\nYou need to bring a copy of your Criminal History Report with you to the visa interview. The administration of criminal records is the responsibility of the New Zealand Ministry of Justice. You should use the ""Priv/F1 - Request by Individual"" form found on the Ministry of Justice website and follow the instructions listed there. Be sure to tick the box for your full record of convictions.\nEven if your conviction makes you ineligible to travel to the U.S., you may be able to obtain a temporary waiver of this ineligibility. You should discuss this with the consular officer at the time of the interview. Waiver processing can take more than 6-8 months, so if you think you may require a waiver, please apply early. We always recommend you do not make any financial commitments for travel until you have received a visa.\nA special note about applicants with DRINK DRIVING convictions: According to USCBP applicants with a single DIC/DUI conviction is NOT grounds to deny entry into the U.S; however, multiple DIC/DUI convictions or a DIC/DUI conviction in combination with other misdemeanor offenses can make a person inadmissible and require a waiver prior to entering the United States.\nIf you have had any minor traffic offenses which did not result in an arrest or conviction, you may use the VWP, provided you are otherwise qualified. If the traffic offense occurred while you were in the United States, and you have an outstanding fine against you or you did not attend your court hearing, it is possible there may be a warrant out for your arrest. You should resolve these issues before traveling by contacting the court where you were to appear. If you do not know the address of the court, information is available from the Internet at www.uscourts.gov/links.html.', 'By Steven D. Heller\nSo, you’re ready to invest in the American Dream. You’ve got the money and a squeaky clean transfer of funds from your personal accounts to your chosen U.S. investment. You are the poster child for EB-5 investors and your I-526 sailed through processing. You have just one problem: when you were 20 you were convicted of cocaine possession. Under current U.S. immigration law, you can never get an immigrant visa and that means your EB-5 American Dream has become a million-dollar nightmare.\nIt’s tempting to think the EB-5 program is all about the money, but there’s more to it. Like any visa application, EB-5 applicants must also satisfy basic admissibility requirements.\nThere are various grounds for visa refusal and possible ways to avoid and contest inadmissibility findings and whether waivers may be available. Sometimes, waivers may not be available to immigrants, but may be available to non-immigrants.\nHOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM\nSection 212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act lists ten categories of excludable aliens, individuals who are inadmissible to the United States due to past transgressions or present danger. Broadly, the categories relate to public health risks, security risks and past offenses. The categories are health; criminal; security threats, such as terrorism, members of the totalitarian party or involvement with the Nazi; public charge, like indigence; labor certification and credentials, such as where credential are a prerequisite for the visa classification; illegal entrants and immigration violators; documentation problems; ineligible for citizenship; aliens previously removed; and miscellaneous reasons, including practicing polygamists, child abductors, unlawful voters and former U.S. citizens who renounced citizenship to avoid taxation.\nAmong the ten categories, the ones that seem more likely to impact EB-5 applicants would be those relating to health, criminal records and immigration status violations and prior removals. These inadmissibilities may be temporary, time-limited or permanent. For example, health-related inadmissibilities, relating to a medical condition of public health concern, will typically be resolved by a finding that the condition no longer presents a problem. Similarly, provisions relating to “aliens previously removed,” which includes those who have overstayed an authorized stay in the US, are mostly limited to periods of 3, 5, 10 or 20 years, after which the excludability vanishes. The most serious bases of inadmissibility are those that don’t go away, including all of the security and criminal grounds, as well as prior misrepresentation to US immigration officials.\nMost inadmissibilities can be waived for non-immigrants, but waivers for immigrants are limited--and, remember, EB-5 is an immigrant visa.\nLet’s take a look at the big three.\nAll immigrants must submit to a full medical examination by a physician under contract with the U.S. government. For overseas visa processing, it’s handled by a designated panel physician and for adjustment of status within the US, it’s done by a designated civil surgeon. Under guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) the designated physician must assess a visa applicant’s physical and mental health. All visa applicants must document that they have been vaccinated against certain diseases, including mumps, measles and polio among others. Failure to provide proof of vaccination will result in visa denial. Communicable diseases of public health significance, such as tuberculosis, leprosy, gonorrhea and syphilis among others will also render an individual inadmissible to the United States as a Class A medical condition. Similarly, a finding that a visa applicant currently suffers from a physical or mental disorder that may present a risk of harm to people or property will also be subject to a Class A medical finding. This is particularly poignant in cases relating to recent drunk driving offences or offenses where drugs or alcohol affected judgment, like a bar fight or property damage.\nCertain criminal offences can render an individual inadmissible for life. These include controlled substance violations, crimes involving moral turpitude, multiple convictions with an aggregate sentence of confinement five years or more, prostitution, alien smuggling and money laundering. (1)\nThe concept of “crimes involving moral turpitude” (CIMTs) is confusing, even for legal professionals. Fundamentally, jurisprudence suggests a certain level of baseness, vileness or depravity associated with the crime - a purposeful, deliberate attempt to harm or defraud. Rape is a CIMT as is petty larceny and mail fraud. A guiding principle is whether an essential element of the crime requires knowledge of wrongfulness - intent. When a crime requires specific intent to commit an act, it will likely be deemed a CIMT.\nSignificantly, inadmissibility for CIMTs and controlled substance offences can be based not just on a conviction, but also on an official admission of guilt. Such admissions must be under oath, be based on the statute and personal statements to establish the CIMT, be made with an understanding of the elements of the crime, include all the factual elements that constitute the crime and be explicit, unequivocal and unqualified. (2)\nInadmissibility based on such admissions used to be quite rare, but in the past few years we have seen a significant increase in such findings, including a 2014 change in the State Department’s policy relating to police cautions in the United Kingdom, which recognizes cautions administered since July 2008 as constituting official admissions of guilt. (3)\nIn this last category, I combine provisions from Immigration and Naturalization Act -- INA§212(a)(6) -- which are about illegal entrants and immigration violators, and §212(a)(9), which is about overstays and aliens previously removed.\nMisrepresentation is serious. If you ever misrepresented yourself to gain entry to or a visa for the United States, you are inadmissible under INA§212(a)(6)(C)(i). Permanently .The misrepresentation must be wilful and material, meaning you knew you were misrepresenting yourself and the falsehood directly affected your admissibility. One example would be to fail to disclose a conviction for a controlled substance violation. Likewise, a historic false claim to U.S. citizenship will render an individual permanently ineligible for legal permanent resident status. (4)\nThose who have stayed beyond the time authorized at entry or who have been removed from the U.S. are subject to time-limited bar on re-entry to the U.S., anywhere from 3 to 20 years, depending on the nature of the violation. Overstays of six months to one year will incur a bar to re-entry of three years from the date of departure. (5)\nOverstays of a year or more will trigger a 10-year bar. (6) If you were actually removed from the United States pursuant to an immigration court order, you would be subject to 5, 10 or 20-year bar to re-entry.\nTIME IS ON YOUR SIDE WHILE COPING WITH INADMISSIBILITY\nMedical inadmissibilities can be overcome. Vaccination-related inadmissibility can be waived for individuals who have had the vaccination, but lack the documentation, where the vaccination is not medically appropriate or where a person objects to all vaccinations on religious or moral grounds. (7) Class A Medical inadmissibilities can be waived, but generally only if the visa applicant is the spouse or child of a US citizen or lawful permanent resident. (8) Given that waiver adjudication times exceed 6 months, those with Class A inadmissibilities may find it easier to wait until 12 months have passed in the hope that a reexamination will find the individual in full remission, which would downgrade the Class A to a Class B and the inadmissibility would be removed. (9)\nTo overcome a criminal inadmissibility, an immigrant visa applicant has two limited options: contest the finding or seek a waiver.\nNo harm, no foul\nNot all criminal offences will result in an inadmissibility finding. Offences that generally avoid inadmissibility include the following: Traffic offences, intoxicated driving, offences where a specific intent is not an essential element, political offenses and juvenile delinquency.\nIn some cases, post-conviction relief may eliminate criminal inadmissibility, such as a full and unconditional pardon issued by the U.S. President. A conviction overturned on appeal is not a conviction for immigration purposes, nor is a judgment vacated by the original court.\nSection 212(h) of the INA provides for discretionary waiver of inadmissibility based on criminal conduct, but only for individuals convicted of CIMTs -- except murder and torture and attempts to conspiracy to commit murder or torture or for someone who is convicted of a single offence of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana. That’s it. Any other drug-related offence, like that old cocaine possession conviction, cannot be waived for an immigrant visa.\nTo be eligible for a waiver, the applicant must establish that the crime occurred more than 15 years before application for a visa and admission would not be contrary to the national welfare, safety or security of the US, and that he or she has been rehabilitated. The applicant would also need to show that the spouse, parent, son or daughter is a US citizen or lawful permanent resident who would suffer extreme hardship if the individual were not allowed to live in the US. The extreme hardship standard is strict, and requires more than “common results of the bar, such as separation or financial problems.” (10)\nAvoiding inadmissibility based on immigration violations can be difficult. Of course, for time-limited bars to re-entry, satisfaction of the period of banishment will extinguish further inadmissibility, but for other grounds, or prior to the end date, the options are limited.\nSection 212(i) of the INA provides limited waiver eligibility based on showing extreme hardship to a U.S. spouse or parent, not including children. The waiver is only available for (6)(C)(i) misrepresentation; not for false claims to U.S. citizenship. (11)\nLike the (6)(C)(i) misrepresentation, the 3 and 10-year overstay bars can only be waived by showing extreme hardship to a US spouse or parent. (12)\nThe bars to re-entry following removal cannot be waived, but they can be excused if, prior to departing for the U.S., the individual obtains permission to reapply for admission. This is a purely discretionary determination.\nIf an immigrant waiver is not available, look at non-immigrant visa options\nWhen inadmissibilities render an immigrant visa unobtainable, a non-immigrant visa may be a viable option. Inadmissibilities apply to both immigrant and nonimmigrant visas, but waivers are more widely available for nonimmigrants, and for example any controlled substance offence can be waived for a non-immigrant visa, and the legal standard is lower.\nGETTING TO KNOW THE E AND L VISA OPTIONS\nWould-be EB-5 investors may find the E-2 Treaty Investor visa a reasonable substitute. The E-2, a non-immigrant investor visa, is based on bilateral trade agreements between the U.S. and other countries. Not all countries have E-2 agreements with the U.S., however, so it may not be available to all. See the U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual -- 9 FAM 402.9-10 -- for a current list of E-2 treaty countries. Like the EB-5, the E-2 is about investment in a US business. The standard term for an E-2 visa is five years. It can be renewed indefinitely. (13)\nNon-immigrant business visas are also available to owners and critical employees of non-U.S. companies engaged in substantial international trade when the majority of their international trade is with the U.S. This E-1 visa, like the E-2 above, is limited to nationals of countries that have a qualifying trade agreement with the United States.\nAnother option is the L-1 intracompany transfer visa. Individuals who have been employed with a non-U.S. company for at least one year out of the last three may be eligible for an L-1 visa to enable a temporary transfer to an affiliated company in the U.S. L-1 visas are limited to three years, renewable to a maximum of seven years. (14)\nTIME IS ALSO ON YOUR SIDE WITH NON-IMMIGRANT VISA WAIVERS\nPursuant to INA 212(d)(3), most inadmissibilities can be waived in the exercise of discretion for non-immigrant visas. The only inadmissibilities that cannot be waived are those relating to security. The standard for non-immigrant waivers is not statutory but based on case law (Matter of Hranka15), which has established a three-part test, including risk of harm to society if the applicant is admitted, seriousness of the applicant’s prior immigration or criminal law violations, and reasons for wishing to enter the U.S.\nProcedurally, requests for non-immigrant waivers are initiated on recommendation by the consular officer at the time of visa interview. The Foreign Affairs Manual requires assessment of the recency and seriousness of the underlying offence, reasons for proposed travel and balancing the positive and negative impact of allowing travel. (16)\nEveryone makes mistakes. Some can come back to haunt you. If you have erred in the past, it could affect admissibility and temporarily or permanently prevent you from obtaining an EB-5 visa, no matter how much money you spend. For most people, however, there are options.\n2. See 9 FAM 302.3-2(B)(4)(e). But n.b. an admission for a crime for which the individual was tried and acquitted cannot be the basis for an inadmissibility determination.\n3.See Practice Pointer: Dealing with U.K. Cautions at the U.S. Embassy, AILA InfoNet Doc 14021952 (16 December 2014).\n9. 9 FAM 302.2\n10.

86	What are the environmental concerns driving the development of degradable plastics, and what are the current limitations in their stimuli-responsive capabilities?	The increasing demand for plastic products has led to serious 'white pollution,' making the development of degradable plastics crucial for addressing environmental problems. However, these materials face significant limitations in their stimuli-responsive capabilities. The endogenous stimuli are heterogeneously distributed and change with disease progression, leading to unsatisfactory specific stimulation responses in different individuals, tissues, and organs. Additionally, the reaction continues in biological systems, causing responsive materials to consume stimuli and decrease response efficiency. Most importantly, the stimuli-responsive polymer nano materials have their sensitive groups shielded in hydrophobic cores, creating barriers against water molecules, glutathione, enzymes, and other biological macromolecules.	['Temporal barriers against hypersensitivity response: from degradable polymer photoreduction\nStimuli-responsive materials caused great concern in the past few decades. Have been based on a variety of polymeric drug carrier of endogenous and exogenous stimuli is designed. Wherein for pH, redox enzymes and the endogenous physiological stimuli responsive polymer having a nano-system has a high application value in drug and gene delivery and the like, in recent years become a materials science, biomedical and pharmaceutical field research focus. However, these bio-responsive polymer material effect in vivo application faces many challenges. First, endogenous stimuli in a heterogeneous distribution, and as the disease progresses and constantly changing, leading to specific stimulation response is not satisfactory in different individuals, tissues and organs. Second, since stimulating factor complex, and the different cell organelles an organism and is changing dynamically unbalanced state. In addition, reaction was continued for a biological system and responsive material body may further consume stimuli, resulting in decreased response efficiency. More importantly, most of the stimuli-responsive polymer nano materials sensitive groups in its hydrophobic core shielded or protected housing, the water supply position to bring molecules, glutathione (of GSH), enzymes and other biological macromolecules attack resistance barrier. Therefore, of great significance novel design of smart materials to overcome time and space barriers stimulate a response.\nRecently, Professor Ding Mingming College of Polymer Science and Engineering, Sichuan University, , Prof. Fu Qiang and Professor Tam Hong designed a since the light reducing Biodegradable polymer (PRSRP) , and reducing the stimulus sensitive groups together \\”locked\\” molecular \\”cage\\”, and using a light-sensitive group \\”lock\\” live stimuli. The photoreduction lesions from Biodegradable Polymer in response to a physiological environment can be realized intracellular levels of glutathione broken backbone. In the absence of a reducing agent, the polymer in situ by light \\”unlocked\\” reducing groups, to achieve reduction of the main chain from degradation, thereby overcoming obstacles temporal response stimuli, stimuli sensitive polymer to improve the response rate ( figure 1). To implement this strategy, research team first synthesized amphiphilic PRSRP different molecular weights, to form a layer of self-assembly found vesicular structures (FIG. 1) by a multi-stage in an aqueous solution. In situ FTIR, 1H NMR, GPC, and applied to study the mechanism MS photoreduction and products from degradation. Degradation of PRSRP using Spectra UV-Vis absorption kinetics, self-assembly found that the polymer has a faster degradation rate than the solution. Demonstrated using a fluorescent model drug responsive polymer having a more efficient drug release performance (FIG. 2) as compared to a conventional reduction of the light-sensitive PRSRP and self-assembly.\nFurther aspects of the study of the potential delivery of the drug intracellularly PRSRP found PRSRP anticancer drug doxorubicin can be carried Su enter tumor cells efficiently while maintaining complete self-assembled structure. In the light conditions, the nanocarrier in the cell in response to the performance of sensitive and rapid release of surplus properties, reduce the% inhibition more than four times. Further, PRSRP having good cell compatibility, but also reduction of the light to be readily degraded by small molecules clearance and metabolism, have a greater prospect in vivo. This overcomes the problems of steric study disorders, disorders osmotic stimuli responsive through molecular design, while avoiding the limitations of conventional light degradable polymer main chain is introduced need complex light-sensitive groups like, thus this strategy readily extended to other material systems , smart responsive polymer material is designed to provide a new idea.\nIn the above related outcomes \\”Photo-ResponsiveSelf-Reducible Polymers: Overcoming the Spatiotemporal Barriers for Hypersensitivity\\” was published in the \\”ACS Materials Letters\\” journals.

Article link: https: //doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialslett.0c00070', 'With the development of economy and the improvement of people’s living standards, the demand for plastic products is increasing day by day, and the “white pollution” brought by plastic is becoming more and more serious. Therefore, research and development of new degradable plastics become an important way to treat environmental problems. Polymer plastics can degrade under many conditions, and thermal degradation occurs under the action of heat. Mechanical degradation occurs under the action of mechanical force, oxidative degradation under the action of oxygen, and biochemical degradation under the action of chemical agents. Degradable plastics refer to plastics that are easily degraded in the natural environment by adding a certain amount of additives (such as starch, modified starch or other cellulose, photosensitizers, biodegraders, etc.) in the production process.\nAccording to their degradation mechanism, biodegradable plastics can be divided into photodegradable plastics, biodegradable plastics, photobiodegradable plastics and chemically degradable plastics.When the molecular chains of photodegradable plastics are destroyed by photochemical methods, the plastic loses its physical strength and embrittlements, then passes through nature\nThe corrosion of the boundary becomes a powder, which enters the soil and re-enters the biological cycle under the action of microorganisms. Biodegradable plastics can be divided into completely biodegradable plastics and biodegradable plastics according to their degradation mechanism and destruction mode. At present, starch plastics and polyester plastics are the most studied and applied.\nStarch plastic is particularly attractive because of its simple processing equipment and low price. Synthetic macromolecule biodegradable plastics refer to biodegradable plastics synthesized by chemical methods. It can be synthesized by studying the structure similar to that of natural polymer biodegradable plastics or the plastics with sensitive degradation functional groups.\nBiodestructive degradable plastics, also known as collapseable plastics, are a composite system of biodegradable polymers and general plastics, such as starch and polyolefin. They are combined together in a certain form, and the degradation in the natural environment is not complete, and may cause secondary pollution. In biodegradable polymers, the addition of photosensitizers can make the polymers both photodegradable and biodegradable.\nPhotobiodegradable polymer materials under certain conditions can make the degradation rate be effectively controlled, such as starch added photodegradable polymer material PE after degradation, make PE porous, specific surface area greatly increased, with oxygen, light, water contact probability greatly increased, PE degradation rate greatly increased.\nCompared with photodegradable plastics, biodegradable plastics have become a hot topic in the development of biodegradable plastics. Because biodegradable plastics are not too harsh on the environment, and it is easier to completely degrade small molecules under the right conditions. It has the advantages of small quality, easy processing, high strength and low price. Biodegradable plastics have a wide range of applications. In the United States mainly used in the production of decomposing garbage bags, shopping bags; In Western Europe, biodegradable plastics are used in shampoo bottles, garbage bags and single-use shopping bags. Biodegradable plastics are mainly applied in the following areas:\n(1) Packing materials\n(2) Agricultural mulch\n(3) Daily necessities\n(4) Disposable medical materials\n(5) Artificial bone, artificial skin, surgical bone nail, surgical suture\n(6) Textile fibers\n(7) Managing yellow sand and urban planning.\nWhen biodegradable plastics are used in bioengineering and medical degradable polymer materials, their characteristics of biodegradation can not be compared with that of root photodegradable plastics. The degraded low molecular substances can directly enter the metabolism of organisms, and have a wide range of application prospects in tissue culture, controlled release drugs, and internal implant materials.']	['<urn:uuid:fa9571cc-fca8-4437-bc53-0d234916c19e>', '<urn:uuid:621801f7-5fd2-4797-b486-c901d24ba663>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	21	99	1223
87	What practices should legal professionals adopt to minimize the risk of client complaints and maintain a successful practice?	Key practices include avoiding procrastination, as it's the most resented professional shortcoming by clients and leads to many State Bar grievances and malpractice claims. It's essential to obtain malpractice insurance (professional liability coverage). Lawyers should also treat all individuals - from clients to court clerks - with respect, maintain a positive outlook despite challenging cases, and seek help when needed rather than trying to know everything. The focus should be on service to clients, following Abraham Lincoln's perspective that helping clients work through problems was a primary goal, with payment being secondary.	['You’ve worked hard and invested much time and energy to earn your law degree.\nProtect it by placing it in a golden frame of professionalism.\nBegin by understanding the difference between professionalism and ethics. Ethics are the codified rules that establish a boundary between appropriate and inappropriate behavior in given circumstances. Cross this line and trouble awaits. In North Carolina, the Rules of Professional Conduct are found in Title 27 of the North Carolina Administrative Code and are available through the State Bar at its website (www.ncbar.com) and the Lawyers Handbook.\nProfessionalism, on the other hand, is a broader and more amorphous concept.\nWharton defines professionalism as “a code of honor mutually agreed on by mutual understanding and tacitly accepted by members of the legal profession.” Note the words “mutual understanding” and “tacitly accepted.” These phrases suggest that standards of professionalism aren’t etched in stone and can change over time.\nBack in the day, for instance, almost every lawyer showed up for work almost every day in business attire. Today, casual days are the norm.\nIn fact, the ethics rules recognize the larger context of professionalism. “The Rules do not … exhaust the moral and ethical considerations that should inform a lawyer, for no worthwhile human activity can be completely defined by legal rules,” according to Section 0.2.\nFollowing are some tips for building your career on the bedrock of professionalism.\n- Join the North Carolina Bar Association. Unlike the mandatory State Bar, the NCBA is a voluntary organization dedicated to improving the practice of law, providing continuing legal education, and serving its members through social activities. The NCBA emphasizes outreach for new lawyers. Sign up, join a committee, or attend the annual meeting this summer.\n- Join your local bar groups. In addition to judicial district bars, many cities and counties have voluntary local bar organizations. Some of these are structured, with dues and regular meetings, while others are no more formal than a group of regulars who convene every morning at the coffee shop across from the courthouse. Show up at the next gathering. Ask someone to introduce you to the group. Bring your business cards and spread the word on who you are and what you do.\n- Treat others as you want to be treated. This applies equally to clients, colleagues, court clerks, and the copy guy at Kinko’s.\n- Be positive. Practicing law can be grim work. Some clients are difficult and some cases are downers. Smile anyway. Projecting a positive outlook can turn lemons into lemonade.\n- Find a mentor. In Greek mythology, Mentor was a sage adviser who encouraged Odysseus to go forth and find his destiny. Every district has a handful of lawyers who are universally held in high esteem. Seek these people out. Give them a call, take them to lunch, or shadow them as they go through their day. Like the original Mentor, they will be flattered and delighted to assist you on your quest.\n- Don’t procrastinate. Lawyers who do their work promptly and on time will enjoy a long and prosperous career. A huge percentage of State Bar grievances and malpractice claims arise not because the lawyer was incompetent but simply because the promised work wasn’t delivered on time. According to the Rules, “No professional shortcoming is more resented by clients” than procrastination.\n- Obtain malpractice insurance. They don’t call it professional liability coverage for nothing.\n- Ask for help. Law school can be an isolating experience. You are competing with colleagues for clerkships and class rank, and you are expected to have the answers at exam time. In the real world, though, nobody knows it all. Don’t feel you have to. Watch out for signs of stress, fatigue or disabling anxiety. Talk to someone. Good lawyers will want to help. To them, you are not a competitor, but a new member of a special and storied profession.\n- Be alert for teachable moments. Take notes when good lawyers and judges do good things. Attend CLEs on professionalism and quality of life. Get in touch with the Chief Justice’s Commission on Professionalism, which provides “attention and assistance to ensure the practice of law remains a high calling, dedicated to the service of clients and the public good.”\n- Focus on service. When he was a backwoods lawyer, Abraham Lincoln said helping clients work through problems was a sure cure for despondency and self-pity. Getting paid for that service was gravy.\n- Get a copy of the Lawyer’s Professionalism Creed. You can find it at www.nccourts.org/Courts/CRS/Councils/Professionalism. Read it. Better yet, post a copy in your office.\n- Go placidly amid the noise and haste. Remember what peace there may be in silence. Strive to be happy.']	['<urn:uuid:b23055ea-817f-41e5-bb34-0df5588fe431>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	18	92	787
88	current challenges ensuring data accuracy compliance and regulatory requirements financial sector	In the financial sector, ensuring data accuracy and meeting regulatory requirements faces multiple challenges. CROs are particularly focused on emerging climate and ESG regulations, which are expected to become stricter in the next three years. Simultaneously, institutions must maintain data integrity through various measures, including input validation, output compliance checking, and consistent data format storage. Risk functions at major institutions are working to establish necessary processes and skills, while facing significant cost constraints due to market pressure from fintechs and other competitors. Early and proactive engagement with regulators is considered crucial for aligning compliance and control strategies.	['5 Risk Management Trends to Watch in 2023, as Seen by CROs Across the World\nEconomies and civilizations are experiencing multiple crises concurrently at this time. The era is marked by the simultaneous emergence and interaction of multiple, complex disruptions with widely varying causes and eventual outcomes. Climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, record inflation and monetary tightening, supply interruptions, and heightened geopolitical risk all raise important organizational resilience problems that must be addressed together.\nIn a constantly changing corporate environment, risk management is a competitive advantage in all industries, including finance. They are working towards becoming more able to withstand adversity. Scenario-based foresight, early indicator monitoring, and crisis-response capabilities can help them absorb shocks, pivot, and accelerate into new realities.\nCROs envision five fundamental changes that will shape risk management in the future.\n1. Three-lines-of-defense evolution\nExpectations about the role of the risk function are changing, and there should be more collaboration between the different lines of defense. CROs think that the first line of defense, the people in charge of certain processes and operations, are getting better at risk management and can therefore handle more risky decisions, such as those involved in underwriting, collections, fraud management, and in some cases, designing regulatory models.\nAs a result, the three-lines-of-defense paradigm is evolving in order to emphasize the risk function on traditional second-line activities, such as appetite setting and monitoring, policy development, the challenging role, and second-line controls and reporting. To be effective in its second-line role, the function should increase its knowledge of new types of risks that are coming up in cyber and tech security as well as climate change.\nNearly every respondent in our survey said that for financial risks, the roles and responsibilities of the first and second lines are clearly defined and well understood in their organization. However, for risks that are not financial, the divides are less distinct.\n2. Digitization: New tools, data, and an “old” problem\nThe risk function can rely on new technologies, tools, and more data, even if some of these building blocks still have “old” problems. All of the CROs who answered the survey said that digital transformation was very important to them.\nNevertheless, many CROs still believe that poor data quality will continue to plague them. More than half of those polled (58%) think that data challenges, notably poor data quality, will have a detrimental impact on advanced analytics applications. It is possible to resolve the vulnerabilities by researching and inventing new kinds of algorithms with the goal of improving the overall quality of risk judgments. The attempt can be aided by the establishment of an analytics centre within the bank.\nDespite being important to the risk function, reporting and monitoring continue to be arduous tasks that often need extra human effort and resources. Therefore, there is a dire need for improvements. However, digital budgets have expanded dramatically. Only 25% of CROs expect digitization budgets to rise. This means that much-needed improvements in reporting and monitoring will have to be achieved primarily through increasing risk-function efficiency.\nWith credit decision-making being digital and controls being automated, most CROs believe existing digital resources could be utilized to improve efficiency in conventional risk areas as well.\n3. Regulatory requirements\nCROs are keeping an eye on the development of climate and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) regulations, which are set to change and become stricter in the next three years. Climate change and ESG, according to CROs, will soon be among the key regulatory issues affecting the financial services sector.\nRisk functions at prominent institutions are attempting to establish the processes, specific skills, and organizational models necessary to lead regulatory efforts. Particular focus is being placed on agile working methods. Overall, early and proactive engagement with regulators is the most important way to make sure that compliance and control strategies match up with what regulators want.\n4. Market changes and new risk priorities\nAs risk levels may rise in the near future, banks are facing significant cost constraints. Fintechs and other low-cost newcomers to the market are putting pressure on existing, conventional business models. CROs are pretty split on how big they think future risk budgets will be. Most of those who see a decrease in real spending are from banks leading the digital transformation of the function. At the group level, these institutions are leading cost-cutting initiatives. The majority of CROs anticipate that risk budgets will reflect changing priorities and maturity in handling various risks.\n5. Value creation and presentation as a risk function\nLeading companies are beginning to pay attention to the value that those functions may and should produce. This useful shift shifts focus from bureaucratic, documentation-oriented exercises to execution and business objectives. With the right execution, a value-driven approach can streamline operations by eliminating unnecessary steps, cutting back on low-profit offerings, and combining risk evaluations into a single report. The path eventually leads to improved institutional performance. Successful institutions that are able to prioritize positive outcomes are more productive and responsive to all parties involved.\nFuture priorities for CROs\nCROs are making future-ready plans by directing multiple concurrent long-term initiatives. They want to deepen and accelerate the digital transformation of the function, win the risk talent war, and establish cutting-edge expertise in regulation, cybersecurity, analytics, and digital innovation. These initiatives continue even as risk managers deal with more pressing macroeconomic and political disturbances.\nRisk management skills are unquestionably more important than ever during this time of economic crisis and development. Digital procedures with robust analytics and data control are increasingly needed. The analytics engines and data infrastructure, two “hard” aspects of these transformations, require as much focus as the “soft” aspect, the upskilling of people.\nThe risk function’s involvement in institutional strategy and resilience is becoming more important to CROs. Under the pressure of many crises, the transition to a more strategic and comprehensive resilience function has intensified. Risk can predict how the economic and regulatory environment will change and spot new threats. Foresight in banking’s traditional areas of focus as well as in newer areas like ESG, cyber, and geopolitical changes can give a first-mover advantage. However, CEOs and CROs will only be able to use this valuable information if they can figure out which risk fits into the institutional strategy. When faced with adversity, resilient businesses quickly adapt to new circumstances and make decisive changes. As the conditions improve, they have the potential to transition into growth more quickly than those they left behind.', 'We all know that data is essential, but what do we need to ensure accurate and reliable data?\nMost people think of data accuracy and integrity as similar, but they are pretty different. Maintaining data quality is essential for businesses, but it can be hard to keep track of everything and ensure data is accurate across various departments and data sets.\nThis blog post will explore data accuracy vs. data integrity and tips on ensuring both in your data sets.\nData Accuracy vs Data Integrity\nWhat is Data Accuracy?\nData accuracy is the most vital aspect of data quality. It guarantees that your company’s business operations are based on reliable and proper data, which will lead to more profitable decision-making capabilities in all areas, including planning, forecasting, budgeting intelligence & more!\nWhat is Data Integrity?\nData integrity is the quality of data entered into a system. That means that data is complete, consistent, and accurate.\nIn technical terms, data integrity is “The measure of how well data is preserved during its life cycle.”\nData integrity is the accuracy and completeness of data. It ensures that data is not corrupted and can be trusted for further use. That involves ensuring that data is protected from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.\nExample of Data Accuracy\nLet’s say you’re a retailer and want to track inventory levels. If you have an accurate data set, you’ll be able to ensure you always have enough stock on hand to meet customer demand. You can also use data accuracy to predict trends to order stock in advance and stay ahead of the competition.\nExample of Data Integrity\nLet’s say you’re a data entry clerk and enter data into a spreadsheet. If you have data integrity, you’ll ensure that all data is entered correctly and completely. You’ll also check for errors and ensure data is consistent across different data sets.\nTypes of Data Integrity\nTwo types of data integrity need to be understood\n- Physical data integrity\n- Logical data integrity\n1. Physical data integrity\nPhysical data integrity is the accuracy and completeness of data stored in a database. This data integrity is essential because it ensures data is not corrupted and can be trusted for further use.\n2. Logical data integrity\nAs data are used in relational databases in various ways, logic integrity guarantees they remain unchanged.\nThere are four main types of logical data integrity: entity integrity, referential integrity, domain integrity, and user-defined integrity.\n- Entity integrity dictates that every row in a table must have a unique identifier. That is typically accomplished by having a primary key column (or set of columns) that can’t be NULL and doesn’t have any duplicate values.\n- Referential integrity ensures that any foreign keys in a table point to valid rows in the parent table. In other words, it ensures that there are no “orphan” rows with missing parent records.\n- Domain integrity defines the allowed values for each column in a table. For example, you might specify that a particular column can only contain integer values between 1 and 10.\n- User-defined integrity is any data integrity constraint that doesn’t fit into the other three categories. For example, this could be something like a “unique” constraint that ensures no two rows in a table have the same value for a particular column.\nData Integrity Key Metrics\nThere are a few key metrics to consider when looking at data integrity:\n- Data accuracy: How close the data is to the real-world data set. for example, a data accuracy of 95% means that the data is very close to the actual data set\n- Data completeness: How much data is included in a data set\n- Data security: Ensuring that data is safe from unauthorized access\n- Data governance: Ensuring that data is managed to meet the organization’s needs\n- Data validity: Ensuring data is valid (i.e., not corrupted) by checking for errors\n- Data uniqueness: Make sure data is unique (i.e., no duplicates)\n- Location intelligence: With location insight and analytics, make data more actionable by providing a layer of richness and complexity\n- Data enrichment: By adding data from external sources to internal data, you can give it more context, nuance, and significance. Adding business, consumer, or location details enhances your data’s completeness and context by giving you a more comprehensive and contextualized perspective.\nHow to Ensure Data Integrity\nThere are several ways to maintain data integrity, including but not limited to:\n- Validating input data against known constraints: When data is input into a system, it should be checked against known constraints, such as data type (e.g., integer, string), length, format, and range.\n- Checking output data for compliance with business rules: Data output from a system should be checked against business rules to ensure it is accurate and complete. Having a good data integrity policy in place is essential because it can help ensure that your data is trustworthy and can be relied on for critical decision-making.\n- Using data cleansing tools: Data cleansing tools can be used to identify and correct errors in data.\n- Storing data in a consistent format: Data should be stored in a consistent format across all data sets.\nRisks of not having Data Integrity\nThere are a few risks associated with data integrity:\nLoss in E-commerce\nInaccurate data leads to the wrong product being sent to the customer, which leads to a loss in e-commerce.\nInaccurate data can lead to financial loss, for example, if a company overpays for a product because the data about the cost of the product is inaccurate.\nInaccurate data can have severe consequences in the health care industry. For example, if a patient’s medical records are incorrect, it could lead to the wrong diagnosis and treatment.\nInaccurate data can lead to problems in the insurance industry. For example, if a company’s data about the cost of repairs to a car is incorrect, it could lead to the company overpaying for the repairs.\nBenefits of data integrity\nThere are many benefits of data integrity, but the following are some of the most important:\n- It provides the searchability and traceability of data to its source\n- With data integrity, we can easily search and track data\n- It helps to Get rid of redundant, inaccurate, or outdated data\n- It avoids the misclassification or improper storage of essential data\n- Data integrity helps ensure data security by ensuring data is safe from unauthorized access\n- Data integrity enables data governance, which is critical for managing data\n- It also helps to ensure data validity, which is vital for ensuring data is not corrupted\nDifference between Data Accuracy and Data Integrity\n|Data Accuracy||Data Integrity|\n|Data accuracy refers to the quality of data||Data integrity refers to the accuracy and completeness of data|\n|Essential for businesses to make sound decisions||Necessary to make sure that data has not been tampered with or corrupted|\n|Maintaining data accuracy requires processes for data entry, data management, and data security||Data integrity often requires data governance and security measures beyond those needed for data accuracy|\n|Data accuracy is important because inaccurate data can lead to human errors, wasted time, and wrong decisions||Data integrity is vital to maintaining the trustworthiness of data|\n|Ensuring data accuracy across different departments and data sets can be difficult||Data integrity only requires ensuring accuracy and completeness within a data set|\n|Data accuracy is typically measured in terms of how close a parameter estimate is to its actual value||Data integrity is generally measured in terms of the percentage of data that is complete and accurate|\n|Critical metrics of data accuracy are accuracy rate, completeness rate, consistency, and error rate||Key metrics of data integrity are data accuracy, data completeness, data security, data governance, Data Validity, Data Uniqueness, Location Intelligence, and Data enrichment|\n|Risks of not having data accuracy include wrong decision making, reputational damage, and failure in compliance||Risks of not having data integrity include loss in E-commerce, financial loss, wrong diagnosis, and overpaying Insurance|\n|Data accuracy is essential for businesses because it ensures sound decision-making.||Data integrity is vital for businesses because it helps maintain the trustworthiness of data sets.|\nWhy are both Data Accuracy and Data Integrity essential?\nData accuracy and integrity are essential to any organization because they help ensure that data is complete, consistent, and accurate.\nData accuracy and data integrity are two essential aspects of data management. Accuracy is how correct the data is, while integrity means the data has not been changed.\nUnfortunately, many companies focus on accuracy over integrity, which can lead to problems. However, data accuracy and integrity are essential to any organization because they help ensure that data is complete, consistent, and accurate.\nWe hope this article helped explain the differences between data accuracy and data integrity!']	['<urn:uuid:90260cd8-78e7-4444-9e5e-4b5dd6c6f456>', '<urn:uuid:fb1c30c4-a23f-47b5-a8cb-3533c1c24684>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	11	97	2538
89	As a parent trying to spot drug use early, what programs can help me learn about signs of substance abuse, and what are the common behavioral changes in teens using steroids?	The 'Hidden in Plain Sight' program offers an interactive experience where parents can explore a mock teenager's bedroom to identify drug paraphernalia and hiding places, while learning about substance use trends, signs, and symptoms. Regarding behavioral changes specific to steroid use, research has shown that anabolic steroid users display notably higher levels of assertion and impulsiveness. Users may experience sleep disorders and show increased aggression and violence due to alterations in brain development for aggressive inhibition. These behavioral changes are particularly concerning as steroid use has also been associated with increased use of cigarettes and alcohol.	['Audience: Professionals and parents\nThe Next Generation of Tobacco Addiction: This workshop provides information for professional and parents on the current trends of e-cigarette use in youth and young adults.

This toolkit is intended to help guide and raise awareness of opioid use and abuse among young student athletes and to provide evidence-based recommendations and information that will encourage and promote policy and practice changes that will strengthen schools, athletic departments, and community-based athletic programs.\nWellness Initiative for Senior Education (WISE) Program\nAudience: Older adults (60+)\nThe WISE program is an evidence-based wellness and prevention program targeting older adults. The program is designed to help older adults in NJ celebrate healthy aging, make healthy lifestyle choices, and avoid substance misuse. It provides valuable educational services to older adults on topics including nutrition and exercise, medication use, stress management, depression, and substance misuse. The curriculum is designed to take place once per week over a six-week period. Each lesson is 2 hours and includes a meal and a gift card incentive for each participant.', 'Anabolic – androgenic steroids (AAS) are synthetic compounds structurally related to testosterone that promote muscle growth and have masculinizing effects. They have been used by athletes who attempt to gain an edge in competition.\nAAS were discovered in 1935 and have been researched and synthesized since then to help reduce the androgenic (masculinizing) effects. The original objective of the medical community was to produce a drug that could treat breast cancer, bone loss, burns and recovery from surgery.\nAAS has also been used by psychiatrists to treat mood disorders in order to improve mental alertness, mood elevation and concentration (Uzych, 1992). It is possible the German army of World War II was the first illegitimate user of anabolic steroids (Daigle, 1990).\nThe Spread of AAS\nThe spread of AAS use in the male athletic community has been rapid. In the 1940’s AAS were used by Soviet Union and Eastern European weightlifting teams. The United States pharmaceutical industry responded in 1958 with the first Food and Drug Administration approved AAS (Fair, 1988). The early beginning of AAS use by a small number of Olympic level athletes has seen a spread to the greater athletic community.\nThe United States has attempted to control AAS use with the addition of anabolic steroids to Schedule III of the Controlled Substance Act and the Anabolic Steroid Act of 1990. This act was amended by the Anabolic Control Act of 2004 which included prohormones as part of the list of controlled substances (Murphy, 2005).\nDespite a ban on AAS by all major sporting organizations the use of anabolic steroids has increased among all levels of athletes including those at high school (Inaba and Cohen, 2007).\nWhen Only Winning Matters\nAn attitude that accepts only winning is often promoted by coaches and parents who push their athletes to keep up with their competition (Center of Addiction and Substance Abuse, 2000). The athletic environment that condones the win- at – all – cost approach appears to encourage AAS use and provides a context that appears to accept this strategy as rational (Goldberg et al., 1996).\nGoldberg et al. (1996) found high school football players who were committed to winning at – all – cost were more likely to use anabolic performance enhancing steroids. The extreme motivation to achieve in professional sports may be due to considerable financial rewards. African American parents are four times more likely than Anglo Americans to see their adolescent athlete as an opportunity for economic gain (Edwards, 1992).\nThis may be due to the perception created by successful African American professional athletes in high profile sports. Although African Americans constitute 13 percent of the general population, recent NFL surveys revealed that the NFL is made up of approximately 68% African-American athletes, while 76 percent of the National Basketball League.\nSide-Effects of Anabolic Steroid Abuse\nPersonality assessment characteristics of steroid users have revealed notably higher levels of assertion and impulsiveness. The misuse of anabolic – steroids has been linked to:\n- Sleep disorders\n- Homicidal ideation (NIDA, 2005)\nAggression and violence is often cited as a major problem with male athlete AAS users due to the alteration of brain development for aggressive inhibition. Recent neuroscience research has highlighted the link between testosterone and approach – avoidance behavior. The use of AAS has also been associated with the exploitation of cigarettes and alcohol.\nAchieving No Matter What\nThe extreme motivation to succeed athletically by some athletes who use AAS can be defined as an attempt to achieve in a conventional environment using unconventional means. Bamberger and Yeager (1995) found over 50% of the Olympic and aspiring Olympic athletes they interviewed stated they would use banned performance enhancing substances if they were not discovered and could be guaranteed first place in each of their competitions despite the possibility of death in the next five years.\nThis attitude appears to continue with today’s successful athlete’s use of anabolic steroids. Both Lance Armstrong (Cycling) and Marian Jones (Sprinting) exemplify the extreme need to get to the top of their chosen sport. Both Armstrong and Jones reached the highest levels of their sport and revealed AAS use.\nThese revelations resulted in criminal consequences for Jones and on – going legal action against Armstrong with both having all sporting successes removed from the record books. Sport often represents the role of the individual within their community and family.\nThe Family Intensive Sport Environment\nSport has become an integral part of the family in the United States. The psychological development of many young people is enmeshed in the process of achieving success in sport. This phenomenon has been described as a family intensive sport environment (Helledt, 1990). The family invests both time and financial resources into the development of the family athlete, which can result in tremendous pressure on the athlete to succeed.\nThe adolescent athlete that is overwhelmed by controlling parents, demanding training schedules and the pressure of academic standards may withdraw from family relationships to a world outside of conventional thought.\nParents who pressure their adolescent athlete with criticism often have high expectations of their athletic performance (Goodger et al. 2007). The pressure felt by the adolescent athlete could result in cognitive exhaustion and AAS use.\nFinding Fulfillment Through Success\nAthletes often find the fulfillment of many psychological needs through their successes in sport. The use of AAS is attractive to those who want to gain an unfair advantage over their competition in an effort to gain the many rewards.\nThe consequences of AAS abuse range from criminal offenses to health related concerns. The male athlete who understands that rewards in life come from internal satisfaction will no longer seek unhealthy methods to obtain the external rewards. Internal rewards become acknowledged as the best one can do within the rules of the competition.\nCommunity Discussion – Share your thoughts here!\nWhat steps can we take as an addiction community to bring awareness to the dangers of steroid use and the importance of inward satisfaction in competitive sports?\n- Center for Addiction and Abuse National Commission on Sports and Substance Abuse (2000).

90	How does the concept of public domain complicate the protection of traditional cultural expressions like folk songs?	The public domain status of traditional cultural expressions (folklore) creates challenging issues, particularly for indigenous peoples. For instance, while a traditional song may be considered public domain under IP law, recording that song creates new IP rights in the recording itself. This raises complex questions about the ownership of these new rights and how they should be managed in ways that respect the interests of the community who were the original custodians of the song under customary laws.	['Archives and Museums: Balancing Protection and Preservation of Cultural Heritage\nMuseums, archives, libraries, anthropologists and ethnologists play an invaluable role in preserving the rich cultural heritage of our planet. By recording and making available the music, arts, knowledge and traditions of indigenous communities, such institutions help to spread a broader understanding and respect for different cultures. However, some traditional communities are beginning to voice concerns that sometimes activities by museums and cultural specialists do not take adequate account of their rights and interests; and that documenting and displaying, say, a traditional song or a tribal symbol, make them vulnerable to misappropriation.\nHow can museums strike a balance between the preservation and the protection of cultural documentation? And how can the wider public have greater access to the rich collections housed by archives and museums? Traditional communities and cultural institutions have begun to seek intellectual property (IP) information and advice in relation to these questions. Greater clarity on how to identify relevant IP issues and options could benefit all stakeholders. This article outlines a few of the key questions and describes WIPO activities aimed at addressing them.\nThe ethnographic collections of museums and other institutions often include invaluable, even unique, records of ancient traditions, lost languages and community histories, which are vital to indigenous peoples’ sense of identity. The handling of secret and sacred materials within such collections can be a source of particularly acute concern. Indigenous peoples also cite numerous cases in which commercial users have exploited cultural heritage collections without seeking the consent of the relevant community, let alone acknowledging the source or sharing the commercial benefits. Some popular world music albums, such as “Return to Innocence,” included samples of traditional music that had originally been recorded and made publicly available for heritage preservation purposes.\nIn the words of expert Henrietta Fourmille, (Centre for Indigenous History and the Arts, University of Western Australia), the crux of the problem from an indigenous perspective is that the “information collected about us is simply not owned by us.”\nThis introduces questions about the role of IP law, policy and practice in activities aimed at preserving cultural heritage. Such questions arise for museums, libraries, archives and galleries in relation to their collections of original works, as well as derivative databases, catalogues, coffee-table books and postcards, etc. IP issues become more pressing as they set up digital libraries of their collections.\nTraditional cultural materials\nThe “public domain” character of traditional cultural expressions (folklore), which has been the subject of criticism especially by indigenous peoples, raises interesting and challenging issues. For example, while a traditional song may be treated by IP law as in the public domain, recording that song creates IP rights in the recording. To whom do these new rights belong, and how should they be managed in ways that take into account the interests of the community in whom the custody of the song had been entrusted under customary laws?\nFurther questions to consider include:\n- What IP rights do researchers and cultural institutions hold? And how can these rights be best managed in the interests of safeguarding culture, promoting cultural diversity, fostering creativity and cultural exchange, and facilitating the public’s access to and enjoyment of diverse cultural expressions?\n- Which existing IP rules and practices can assist researchers and cultural institutions in fulfilling their mandates? (This might include tailored licensing approaches, or use of specific copyright and related rights exceptions and limitations.)\nThese issues arise frequently in practice. The Toulumne tribe of California recently used copyright laws to stop the sale of CDs and videos of its sacred dances. There are other cases in which recording a piece of traditional art, and exercising IP rights in that recording, has helped to protect the original work against misuse (see box).\nBut exercise of IP rights may not always be the answer. The point is to step back, identify objectives and determine an overall strategy which takes into account the range of IP-related issues and options.\n|Using a researcher’s records to protect indigenous rock art|\nIn Australia in 1997, t-shirts began appearing in the market depicting images from indigenous rock paintings found in the Deaf Adder Creek region. These rock art paintings have special cultural significance to Australian indigenous life and custom.\nThe indigenous custodial group had no remedy under copyright against the t-shirt manufacturers, as the original artist was unknown, and the paintings were so old that any copyright would have expired. However, drawings and photographs of the rock art images had been published by a researcher funded by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Eric Brandl, in 1973, thus creating new copyright. It was from this publication that the t-shirt manufacturers had apparently copied the images. With the help of the Institute and the Brandl family, the indigenous group was able to get the t-shirt company to stop production, claiming infringement of copyright in Brandl’s drawings and photographs.\nTo read the full case study, compiled for WIPO by indigenous lawyer Ms.Terri Janke, see Minding Culture: Case Studies on Intellectual Property and Traditional Cultural Expressions, (WIPO Publication No. 781).\nWIPO is working with the stakeholders to respond to a widely-expressed need for technical information on these issues. A current project aims to develop a set of IP‑related “good practices”, practical guidelines and other resources for cultural specialists, indigenous communities, creators and users. Such resources may also benefit institutions establishing inventories of intangible cultural heritage, as provided for under the recently-adopted United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention on Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage. The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues has recommended development of these kinds of resources.\nMany institutions already have policies on research, collection and preservation, as well as codes of ethics. Indigenous declarations also address these questions. Few existing resources, however, address IP issues in detail, nor questions related to the treatment of traditional knowledge and cultural expressions. A first step in WIPO’s project, therefore, is to gather and publish, in a searchable online database, examples of existing materials, including relevant copyright provisions.\nClarifying IP issues and options in relation to safeguarding cultural heritage should help strengthen synergies between the protection of cultural documentation and its preservation, while contributing towards the respect for traditional cultures. All stakeholders stand to benefit from equitable and secure access to the collections of museums and archives, facilitating a wider exchange of cultural expressions between the peoples and communities of this culturally rich and varied world.']	['<urn:uuid:0c69d548-95e2-49e9-b430-4045bb8408e5>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	17	78	1073
91	Can you explain what makes fluoride so beneficial for protecting our teeth against cavities and decay?	Fluoride benefits teeth by creating a structure called fluorapatite, which forms when fluoride ions replace hydroxyl ions in the tooth's natural hydroxyapatite structure. This fluorapatite structure is stronger and more resistant to acids than the original hydroxyapatite. The enamel's natural hydroxyapatite is calcium-deficient and can be easily dissolved by acids, while fluorapatite provides better protection against acid damage.	['buffering capacity – Saliva and the fluid in dental plaque possess the ability to buffer. Buffering adjusts the pH of any solution such as saliva or plaque fluid, and can resist changes in pH. Buffering capacity is the degree of buffering that can be brought about.\nchelation – As it applies to the oral cavity, chelation is the process whereby citric acid has the ability to demineralize enamel to a much greater degree than its pH can explain. Through its chelating properties, citric acid removes calcium from the enamel surface, and through chelation forms a compound from which the calcium cannot be released. Therefore, the calcium is not available to diffuse back into the tooth. Citric acid also has the ability to chelate calcium in saliva, reducing the remineralizing effect.\ndemineralization – The chemical process by which minerals (mainly calcium) are removed from the dental hard tissues – enamel, dentin, and cementum. The chemical process occurs through dissolution by acids or by chelation, and the rate of demineralization will vary due to the degree of supersaturation of the immediate environment of the tooth and the presence of fluoride. In optimal circumstances, the minerals may be replaced through the process of remineralization.\ndentin hypersensitivity – Tooth pain that is characterized by brief, sharp, well-localized pain in response to thermal, evaporative, tactile, osmotic, or chemical stimuli that cannot be ascribed to any other dental disease or condition. Exposed dentin is a feature, and therefore the condition is associated with enamel wear (usually erosion) or gingival recession.\ndeveloped countries – A term not frequently used today in classifying countries, as no definitive definition exists. The term is used to describe countries with industrialized economies and higher levels of gross domestic product. Developed countries are able to spend more on health systems. These systems are typically treatment-oriented and focus services on the needs of the individual rather than the community.\nerosion – Localized loss of dental hard tissue that is chemically etched away from the tooth surface by acids or chelating agents. Can be referred to as Acid Erosion or Acid Wear. Teeth exhibiting signs of erosion lose their surface texture (perichymata), may appear more yellow, and have an altered shape.\nfluorapatite – A crystal structure in tooth mineral (Ca10 (PO4)6 F2) resulting from the replacement of hydroxyl ions (OH-) in the hydroxyapatite structure with fluoride ions (F-). Fluorapatite (also commonly referred to as fluoroapatite, fluorhydroxyapatite or fluorohydroxyapatite) is stronger and more acid resistant than hydroxyapatite.\nGERD – Gastroesophageal reflux disease; the reflux of hydrochloric acid generated in the stomach that travels to the mouth. Erosion will occur upon the acid’s contact with enamel surfaces.\nhydroxyapatite – Crystals of calcium phosphate – (Ca10 (PO4)6 OH2) that form the mineral structure of teeth and bone. Enamel comprises approximately 98% hydroxyapatite (by weight). Much of the hydroxyapatite in enamel, however, is a calcium-deficient carbonated hydroxyapatite, the crystals of which are readily dissolved by acids. The addition of fluoride creates fluorapatite, which is less soluble and more acid-resistant.\nions - Atoms or molecules that carry either a positive or a negative electric charge in a solution. For example, sodium chloride (NaCl, common table salt) in water dissociates into Na+ and Cl– ions.\nprevalent – Widespread; widely or commonly occurring.\nremineralization – The chemical process by which minerals (mainly calcium) are replaced into the substance of the dental hard tissues – enamel, dentin and cementum. The process requires an ideal environment that includes supersaturation with calcium and phosphate ions, and adequate buffering. In the presence of fluoride, remineralization is enhanced.\ntooth wear – The non-carious loss of tooth tissue through the processes of attrition, abfraction, abrasion, or erosion, occurring alone or combined (most typically abrasion and erosion).\nxerostomia – A subjective assessment of mouth dryness, usually but not always associated with low levels of saliva production. Inadequate production of saliva occurs for many reasons, most commonly as an unwanted effect of many prescription and over-the-counter medicines. Saliva is necessary for maintaining a healthy mouth, and, in relation to dental caries, is essential for remineralization.']	['<urn:uuid:6c215068-fb9c-4b4a-9514-f2f9dea5fbf1>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	16	58	676
92	looking for cable for my car battery what are different types and max heat they can take	There are both PVC and cross-linked types of battery cable available. PVC battery cable like SGT is rated to 80°C and can be used in starters or battery grounds. Cross-linked battery cables (SGX and STX types) are rated to 125°C and offer better resistance to heat, abrasion, and aging than PVC cable. STX has the thinnest wall, making it popular for automotive applications with limited space.	"['What types of insulation are on automotive wire?\nThere are two main categories of automotive wire – PVC and Cross-Linked. The biggest difference between the two categories is temperature range. Cross-linked automotive wire can withstand much higher temperatures than PVC automotive wire.\nThe three main types of PVC automotive wire are:\n- GPT - used for general circuit wiring and rated to 80 °C\n- TWP - lead-free, thin wall automotive wire rated to 105 °C\n- HDT - heavy wall automotive wiring rated to 80 °C\nPVC is insulation is extruded, which is created by heating PVC and then extruding it through a die on the stranding. This insulation can be melted with a heat source, changing the form.\nThe three most common types of cross-linked automotive wire are:\n- GXL – thin wall, most common type, works with most standard automotive connectors, rated to 125 °C\n- SXL – standard wall, rated to 125 °C\n- TXL – extra thin wall, best for applications that require minimal size and weight, rated to 125 °C\nCross-linked insulation is created by extruding the material through a tube, under heat and pressure, in order to \'cross-link\' or change the molecules of the insulation to another state.\nClick here to watch our video on automotive wire or read the transcript!\nHow do you determine the Gauge (AWG) of the automotive wire?\nMake a small cut about 1/2"" long and remove the insulation on the automotive wire. Then you will need to count the individual strands of copper. Next use a micrometer and measure one of the strands. Also count the total number of strands that are present in the automotive wire. Look at the following information to determine the gauge of your automotive wire.\n- 7/.028 = 20 (7 strands that measure .028 each equals 20 gauge)\n- 16/.030 = 18 AWG\n- 19/.029 = 16 AWG\n- 19/.027 = 14 AWG\n- 19/.025 = 12 AWG\n- 19/.023 = 10 AWG\n- 19/.021 = 8 AWG\n- 37/.021 = 6 AWG\nWhat are some of the different types of battery cable?\nBattery cable is large automotive cable. Like smaller types of automotive wire, it is available in PVC and cross-linked forms. One type of PVC battery cable is SGT cable. It is rated to 80°C. SGT can be used in starters or battery grounds.\nCross-linked battery cables can also be used in starter and battery ground applications, but they are more resistant to heat, abrasion, and aging than PVC cable. Two types of cross-linked battery cable are SGX and STX. They are rated to 125°C. Of the three types of battery cable, STX has the thinnest wall, making it a popular choice for automotive applications with limited space.\nHow can I customize my automotive wire?\nAWC offers several customization services for automotive wire. Both PVC and cross- linked automotive wire can be printed with custom text or company logos. They can also be striped. Up to three stripes, called tracers, can be added to the cable’s jacket. Both striping and printing make your automotive wire easy to identify, saving you time. PVC automotive wire may also be dyed for easy identification.\nWhat are other common types of automotive wire and cable and what kinds of applications are they used for?\nAside from the automotive primary wire and battery cable mentioned above, trailer cable, automotive brake cable, ignition wire, fusible link wire and SRML wire (high temperature motor lead wire) are all considered automotive wire and cable. Trailer cable can be used on trailers and trucks as well as in other applications where resistance to weather, oil, and grease is necessary. SRML wire is flexible and fire resistant and can be used as motor lead wire or as lead wire for high temperature electrical equipment applications. Automotive brake cable is used for electric brakes in cars, trucks, and trailers. Common applications for primary wire include general circuit wiring and wiring in engine compartments while battery cable is intended for use in starters and battery ground circuits. Car speaker wire is designed for use in radios, music systems, public address systems, and other low voltage applications.\nWhat are some specifications and standards I should consider when choosing automotive cable?\nCommon standards for the automotive industry include those created by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), Underwriters Laboratories (UL), and the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA). All of these organizations develop standards for the automotive industry to encourage the manufacture and use of safe and high quality automotive wire and cable. More important specifications to consider are those set by individual car manufacturers. For instance, all of Allied’s primary wire meets both Ford and Chrysler specifications.']"	['<urn:uuid:58a8c33e-3f36-4694-b91a-08dd525cc59d>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	17	66	790
93	ghana cocoa farmers land rights documentation tree ownership challenges financing	In Ghana, cocoa farmers face complex land tenure situations with three main customary interests: customary freehold (9%), asideε (45%), and abunu (46%). While land rights documentation has been successful, with 190 farms surveyed and 37% held by women, tree ownership remains problematic. Current law gives the state rights to naturally occurring trees, creating conflicts with customary practices. The financial support structure includes the European Investment Bank's €170 million backing for the National Development Bank, which will help provide long-term financing to agribusiness. Additionally, private sector partners like ECOM are implementing rehabilitation programs that include financing models for farm renovation and tree planting.	['By Richard Adorsu-\nNEW AFRICA BUSINESS NEWS (NABN) Accra- President Akufo Addo of Ghana, Werner Hoyer, President of the European Investment Bank and Thomas Östros, Vice President, formally agreed to €170 million EIB backing for the new National Development Bank of Ghana.\nThe EIB backing represents the largest ever engagement in Ghana by a world international public bank and most significant support for a national development institution in Africa. Once operational in the coming weeks the National Development Bank of Ghana will increase access to long-term finance and boost job creation for thousands of businesses in key sectors, including agribusiness, manufacturing, ICT tourism and other services across Ghana.\n“The European Investment Bank is a key partner for Ghana and Africa. As discussed with President Hoyer today, Ghana and the European Investment Bank share the same goals, and our close partnership will accelerate economic growth in Ghana in the future. The EIB’s backing for the new National Development Bank will support Ghana’s vision of empowering our private sector to embrace new business opportunities, create skilled jobs and successfully overcome COVID-19 challenges. The EIB’s unique technical, environmental and financing expertise is supporting priority business investment and delivering the green transition in Ghana and across Africa,” said President, Akufo Addo.\n“Since the start of the pandemic, the EIB has worked closely with visionary governments and private sector partners across Africa to ensure that together we can tackle the health, economic and social impact of COVID-19. Together with experts from the Ghanaian government, international financial partners and the EU Delegation in Accra the EIB is pleased to support the new National Development Bank of Ghana. The new institution will transform private sector investment across Ghana, enabling thousands of entrepreneurs and businesses to access long term financing in local currency and strengthen resilience to COVID-19. Over the last 45 years the EIB has provided more than €626 million to directly support entrepreneurs, agriculture, industry and energy investment across Ghana including the original and renovated Kpong Dam recently inaugurated by President Akufo Addo. As part of Team Europe and thanks to its local presence in Western Africa, the European Investment Bank aims to strengthen its support for\nambitious investment in Ghana in the years ahead,” said Werner Hoyer, President of the European Investment Bank.\n“The European Union has a long-standing partnership with Ghana and we share a broad common agenda to tackle global challenges, such as climate change and pandemics. Today’s new agreement to support the new National Development Bank of Ghana will boost private sector growth and economic resilience to COVID-19 and builds on the European Investment Bank’s enduring engagement to support high-impact investment in Ghana, in a true Team Europe spirit,” said Jutta Urpilainen, European Commissioner for International Partnerships.\nThe new National Development Bank of Ghana will provide long-term wholesale financing, including working capital and investment loans, to the private sector through commercial banks.\nThe new institution will transform access to finance by small business and larger companies across Ghana and unlock investment in agribusiness, manufacturing, informational technology and tourism.\nThe National Development Bank of Ghana has been created by the Government of Ghana and supported by the European Investment Bank, the World Bank and the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) through the German Development Bank KfW.\nThe construction of the original Kpong Dam in 1976 to harness power of the Volta River was the first energy project in Ghana financed by the European Investment Bank. The EIB is now providing €12.5 million for renovation of the Kpong Dam, alongside the French Development Agency, AFD. The renovated plant will be more efficient, reliable and safe, as well as saving an estimated 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year by contributing 1000 GWh of low cost hydro energy a year to the national grid.\nOver the last 45 years, the European Investment Bank has provided more than €626 million for investment by entrepreneurs, agriculture, industry and energy across Ghana.\nFor New Africa Business News Richard Adorsu Reports, Africa Correspondent\nAFRICA’S MOST READ AND FASTEST GROWING GLOBAL NEWSPAPER – www.newafricabusinessnews.com', 'Worldwide, forests are being lost at an alarming rate, driven by the expansion of internationally traded commodities. In response, companies are making efforts to reduce and eliminate deforestation from their supply chains. In 2016, Hershey’s and Ecom Agroindustrial Corp (ECOM) began collaborating with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Tenure and Global Climate Change (TGCC) Program that helped leverage private sector funding to address land and tree tenure constraints that inhibit cocoa productivity and contribute to deforestation around smallholder cocoa farming in Ghana. This work resulted in an assessment and recommendations for a future pilot, captured in the report Land and Natural Resource Governance and Tenure for Enabling Sustainable Cocoa Cultivation in Ghana. Over the 11-month period from February to December 2017, USAID implemented a pilot in Nyame Nnae, a cocoa farming community in the Asankrangwa district of Ghana with implementing partners Tetra Tech and Winrock International. The pilot had four specific objectives:\n- Increase tenure security of smallholder cocoa farmers through clarifying and documenting the rights of landholders and tenants that discourage removing old cocoa trees under stranger tenancy (abunu) contracts.\n- Promote the increase in carbon stocks in cocoa farms over the long term by explaining new Forestry Commission policy on tree tenure and documenting tenants’ and landlords’ beneficial interests in shade trees.\n- Replant old, unproductive cocoa farms to increase productivity over the next five to 10 years. This requires developing a financing model to replant old cocoa farms and provide extension services to farmers.\n- Develop lessons and recommendations for the Government of Ghana, Ghana’s Cocoa Forest REDD+ Program, the World Cocoa Foundation, Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA) 2020 partners, and others working on related topics with smallholder farmers that will allow the pilot to be replicated and scaled up over time.\nIMPACTS – LAND TENURE\nThe pilot focused on improving tenure in Nyame Nnae community in the Western Region. Nyame Nnae was chosen to carry out a tenure intervention based on community interest and factors like a high proportion of non-indigene farmers and a clear land constraint. There are three main customary interests in land in Nyame Nnae: customary freehold (9 percent), asideε (migrant farmer freehold – 45 percent), and abunu (46 percent). The project captured and documented land and tree rights as practiced; it did not try to convert these customary rights into statutory rights. The project engaged legal consultants to draft three customary land rights templates based on these prevailing customary norms. A local organization, Landmapp, was subcontracted to complete mapping of community boundaries and individual cocoa farms and store electronic records. ECOM’s extension agents were trained in tenure principles and provided with training materials and simple, laminated fact sheets to help them resolve land disputes, monitor and assess tenure in their field work, and augment their suite of future trainings. In total, the boundaries of Nyame Nnae community were mapped and 190 farms were surveyed and tenure rights documented, with 37 percent held by women.\nDuring the life of the intervention, the importance of clarifying landowner and tenant relationships through customary contracts emerged as equally important in documenting tenure terms as having a mapped document for the landowner. Clear dispute resolution structures were found to exist within the Asankrangwa stool, though community members were not always well informed about their rights. The team provided training on dispute resolution to community elders, emphasizing disputes and negotiations relating to cocoa farm rehabilitation and negotiated abunu arrangements. At the end of the project, 92 percent of those who received documentation thought it was worthwhile. Community members added that the process provided additional security and information on farm size, and will help reduce conflict. The primary factors that informed farmers’ participation in the project included interests in documentation of land to secure and protect their future investments and to aid in accessing financing options; a desire to know more about site planning; and, interest in farm management more broadly.\nIMPACTS – TREE TENURE\nCurrent law vests rights to naturally occurring trees with the state, which expropriates all rights over timber exploitation and vests them in the government. Despite this legal framework, it became clear that the community views tenure over trees and forest products through the lens of customary land rights, even if this differs from statutory law. The community does, however, distinguish customary rights over trees from timber trees, for which control is vested in the Forestry Commission by formal law. The community views timber trees as being owned by the government.\nThe interplay between government policy, timber extraction, and planting trees laying claim to land ownership creates perverse outcomes: planted trees are pulled up by customary land holders; land disputes emerge between tree planters and customary land holders; and, there are disincentives to plant commercial trees. While these conflicts were not directly observed within Nyame Nnae, the Forestry Commission is aware of challenges with the current law and policy. New policy approaches are being considered and tested. Upon analysis, many aspects of the tree registration system proposed by the Forestry Commission were still in flux and do not go far enough, as the system maintains the distinction between planted and naturally occurring trees. This distinction causes confusion and scope for abuse, as failure to register planted shade trees may result in de facto treatment as naturally occurring and therefore subject to state expropriation. The administrative costs of registering trees are also steep. The team decided not to test the draft tree tenure registration documentation because of reservations about the proposed policy changes, their long-term efficacy, and the potential to create confusion.\nIMPACTS – FINANCIAL MODEL FOR FARM REHABILITATION\nFarm level rehabilitation was carried out on a total of 50 ha spread over 71 self-selected farms and was financed by private sector partner ECOM. Ten of these farms were within Nyame Nnae community (four women and six men) and 61 (12 women and 49 men) were spread across multiple different cocoa communities where ECOM operates. To help ECOM implement agroforestry practices in farm rehabilitation, 20 ECOM extension agents participated in TGCC’s training of trainers agroforestry course.\nTo better understand how to finance rehabilitation, ECOM and TGCC developed a financial model for cocoa farm rehabilitation. Under the model ECOM rehabilitates and manages all farm activities over three years while the farmer learns farm rehabilitation and management techniques and diversifies their income with cash crops. This approach differs from using model farms, which have had mixed success. In this model a farmer provides three acres of old cocoa trees to be cleared and has additional cocoa farms elsewhere, which will continue producing cocoa. Two of the three acres are replanted with cocoa, shade trees (if needed), maize, and plantains, and the third acre is planted with maize and plantains only. Plantain and maize is then planted with two crops of maize and one of plantain harvested per year. The models show that ECOM’s rehabilitation and management costs are repaid over three years, and a profit share or royalty payment paid to the farmer provides enough cash for the farmers to continue activities once ECOM no longer provides support.\nOTHER LESSONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe pilot overall, as measured by beneficiary satisfaction, was highly successful. Both men and women farmers, landlords and tenants, and leaders of Asankrangwa stool voiced their appreciation and satisfaction with accomplishments. The following list of final lessons and recommendations were drawn from the pilot:\n- Build understanding of the relevance of land tenure and identify feasible interventions for private sector interests. Partners need to be provided with targeted and actionable information to participate.\n- Time is required to fully apply learning and adaptive management principles. While lessons were learned in the pilot, they could not always be integrated into practice due to short timeframes.\n- Document rights in advance of land disputes, where possible. Clarifying tenure can help to avoid disputes more easily than resolving disputes.\n- For effective land rights documentation, focus on process, engagement and documenting the status “on the ground.” Rather than forcing customary rights to be converted to statutory leaseholds, use formal legal contracts to document the existing customary rights of farmers.\n- Formalizing land rights in Ghana requires more than simply documentation. Engagement of the National House of Chiefs was important to codify land rights in traditional areas and discuss the relationship between indigene and stranger farmers.\n- Food security and nutrition is an issue for cocoa farmers. Rehabilitation efforts must consider food security needs, particularly during the years before cocoa trees start producing.\n- The Nyame Nnae pilot site is only one of multiple theories of change linking property rights to deforestation in Ghana. This pilot lessens the threat on a nearby gazetted forest and increases incentives to reduce deforestation of remnant and secondary forests within the community that now set in motion can be monitored in future years. Options for reducing deforestation at a larger landscape lever were identified and scaling up will need to demonstrate avoided deforestation impact.\n- Not all smallholder farmers are equal; other rehabilitation pilots being tested are geared toward the privileged. The ECOM financial model can be sustainable, but will be difficult to scale up and reach poorer farmers without multiple plots or stranger farmers with insecure tenure.\n- While documenting land rights was a success, tree rights documentation still needs to be considered. For farmers to fully benefit from their land rights, they need to have rights to all resources on their property.\n- The project successfully demonstrated that a public-private partnership linking tenure documentation, alternative dispute resolution, community engagement, and financial modelling with cocoa rehabilitation was feasible. Cocoa companies welcome the addition of new services to their portfolio.\n- Scalability remains a challenge. Wrapping the cost of documentation into cocoa farm rehabilitation should be explored in any future work.\n- The government’s acceptance of formalization pilots is still a question. A wholesale mind shift that recognizes the need to build shade back into cocoa systems and improve productivity of cocoa on less land is starting to occur, but requires additional political will.\n- Spend time on gender dynamics and social inclusion. Interventions must be designed so that community members better understand how women and different status groups engage within the community.\n- A public-private model can be considered to help bear the costs of public goods. Private sector firms are offering services to their suppliers, and welcome the ability to work with public institutions and public policy.\n- After all is said and done, consent of traditional authorities is the central ingredient for success. Traditional leaders need to be full partners in the process of documenting rights and should not just use the system to extract fees.\nThe generalized approach of using land administration, broadening access to finance, and assisting farmers with cocoa rehabilitation is broadly relevant to other geographies and commodities with adequate nuancing and tailoring to the context and constraints faced. There is a wealth of diverse land administration tools and approaches to draw upon, depending on the nature of tenure insecurity and financial constraints faced by small farmers. The approach is also broadly relevant for reducing deforestation although time is needed to determine the full impacts achieved. The GIS survey data collected by the pilot is broadly applicable to monitoring deforestation in the future with scaling, but further work would be required to determine how avoided deforestation impact could be measured and predicted.\nWithin this context, the setting has been established for ongoing efforts by the private and public sectors to develop a strategy for lowering cost and designing innovations that improve the livelihoods of Ghana’s cocoa farmers, promote sustainable cocoa cultivation that reduce deforestation pressures, improve the profitability of the chocolate industry, and provide consumers worldwide with high quality chocolate sourced from Ghana.']	['<urn:uuid:a224af98-f330-4843-9bb8-7e9d64b2c4fe>', '<urn:uuid:4f2de92d-0591-4b84-a6c4-bcf9290e5ddc>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	10	102	2636
94	As a safety engineer working with industrial robots, I'm curious about the relationship between machinery instruction manuals and robot safety regulations - how do these documents work together to ensure workplace safety?	Instruction manuals and safety regulations work together in several key ways. According to standards like ISO 20607, instruction manuals must include safety-relevant content and information about residual risks for machinery. They are required to cover all phases of the machine's lifecycle, from installation to dismantling. For industrial robots specifically, while OSHA has no dedicated robot standard, they rely on consensus standards like ANSI/RIA R15.06 for safety requirements. A critical connection is that both instruction manuals and safety compliance require proper risk assessments - manufacturers must document risks in manuals, and facilities must conduct comprehensive risk assessments of robot systems to avoid OSHA citations. The risk assessments need to cover both routine operations and non-routine conditions like maintenance and programming.	['Instructions are one of the basic items that users expect to get when they purchase a product, and yet these important documents are often poorly written, badly translated, and incomplete. Key product features are badly described, and information on features, settings and hazards may be absent. All of this despite the fact that the minimum requirements for instruction manuals have been defined in the machinery standards since at least the early 1990’s. A way to avoid creating poor manuals was needed.\nBecause information for use is part of the Hierarchy of Controls, ISO 12100 and other standards have provided general guidance on the content of machinery manuals, but never on the design of the manual itself. ISO and IEC created a joint project to develop a common standard for manuals and instructions for use. Members from ISO/TC 10, Technical drawings, product definitions and related documentation and IEC/TC 3, Documentation and graphical symbols worked on creating IEC 62079.\nIn 2001, IEC published IEC 62079, Preparation of instructions – Structuring, content and presentation. This standard was the beginning of the efforts to create a common design requirement for the instructions provided by product manufacturers to users. IEC 62079 was withdrawn and republished as IEC 82079 – 1, Preparation of instructions for use – Structuring, content and presentation – Part 1: General principles and detailed requirements. The second edition of this standard was published in 2019.\nIn 2014, ISO/TC 199 started work on a standard focused on the needs of machine builders and users. The origin of this standard comes from Europe, with consideration of the EU Machinery Directive, EN 415 – 3, ISO 10218, and a seed document from the Netherlands. The resulting standard, ISO 20607, Safety of machinery — Instruction handbook — General drafting principles has just completed the final stage of review (FDIS) and is in the process of publication. The document is scheduled for publication in June 2019.\nWhat’s in ISO 20607?\nSince you are reading this post, you will want to know what this new standard is about. Unfortunately, I can’t give you too much information about the content of the standard due to confidentiality obligations placed on expert members by ISO, but I can tell you a little bit about what’s inside. Let’s have a look at the scope of the document.\nThis document specifies requirements for the machine manufacturer for preparation of the safety-relevant parts of an instruction handbook for machinery.\n— provides further specifications to the general requirements on information for use given in ISO 12100:2010, 6.4.5; and\n— deals with the safety-related content, the corresponding structure and presentation of the instruction handbook, taking into account all phases of the life cycle of the machine.\nNOTE 1 The strategy for risk reduction at the machine is given in ISO 12100:2010, Clause 6, and includes inherently safe design measures, safeguarding and complementary risk reduction measures as well as information for use.\nNOTE 2 Annex A contains a correspondence table between ISO 12100:2010, 6.4, and this document.\nNOTE 3 Information for conception and preparation of instructions in general is available in IEC/IEEE 82079 – 1.\nThis document establishes the principles which are indispensable to provide information on residual risks.\nThis document does not address requirements for declaration of noise and vibration emissions.\nThis document is not applicable to machinery manufactured before the date of its publication.\nAs you can see, the standard builds upon ISO 12100 and IEC 82079 – 1, with the focus on machinery.\nTable of Contents\nHere’s the Table of Contents. I’m leaving out the Scope, Normative References and Terms and Definitions, as those appear in every standard.\n4 Principles and general information\n4.2 Target group for the instruction handbook\n4.3 Information needs\n4.4 Comprehensible terminology and wording\n4.5 Presentation of the instruction handbook\n4.6 Information from component or subsystem suppliers\n4.8 Warnings, hazard and safety symbols used in the instruction handbook\n4.10 Residual risks\n4.10.2 Signals and warning devices provided with the machine\n4.11 IT security vulnerabilities\n5 Content and structure of the instruction handbook\n5.2 Instruction handbook content\n5.2.1 Basic parts of an introduction handbook\n5.2.3 Machine overview\n5.2.4 Transportation, handling and storage\n5.2.5 Assembly, installation and commissioning\n5.2.6 Original equipment manufacturer settings\n5.2.8 Product or capacity changeover\n5.2.9 Inspection, testing and maintenance\n5.2.10 Cleaning and sanitizing\n5.2.11 Fault finding/troubleshooting and repair\n5.2.12 Dismantling, disabling and scrapping\n5.2.13 Documents and drawings\n6 Language and formulation/style guide\n6.2 Language version(s)\n6.3 Formulation guidance for instructions\n6.4 Simple wording for instructions\n7 Forms of publication\nAnnex A (informative) Correspondence between ISO 12100:2010, 6.4, and this document\nAnnex B (informative) Presentation and formatting\nAnnex C (informative) Recommendations for writing instructions\nAnnex ZA (informative) Relationship between this European Standard and the essential requirements of Directive 2006/42/EC aimed to be covered\nAs you can see, the standard covers the design and content of machinery manuals quite thoroughly. If you are a technical writer or manage the technical writing department for a machine builder, you should be using this standard. There are some additional technical writing standards that you could consider, like ANSI Z535.6, American National Standard for Product Safety Information in Product Manuals, Instructions, and Other Collateral Materials, (Download ANSI standards) which provides excellent guidance on integrating hazard warnings into instructions, and of course, the requirements of the relevant type C standard for your product.\nIf you’ve got questions or would like more information on ISO 20607, please get in touch.

As the world of industrial automation progresses, the number of employees and robots working in close quarters with each other continues to grow. With the increase in automation and the use of mobile and industrial robots, regulations are being updated to address the potential hazards posed by the changes in equipment and routine and non-routine tasks around robots in the workplace. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is training their inspectors to be aware of these regulatory changes and become familiar with industrial robot use. Not being aware of your facility’s requirements or of the changes in robot regulations could cost you.\nRecently, CTI attended the annual International Robotics Safety Conference, hosted by the Robotics Industries Association (RIA). At the conference, we spoke with representatives from OSHA, who explained the plans and actions put in place to train inspectors to better identify the hazards around industrial robots, as well as a plan to work on updating regulations to better protect employees from these identified hazards.\nRobots are machines, and as such must be safeguarded in ways like those presented for any hazardous remotely controlled machine. As with any other machine, there are countless hazards that could be present in and around a robot system. These hazards could vary depending on the design of the robot cell, placement inside the facility, level of interaction with employees, program or software being run, or end effector being used. Some common hazards are slip, trip, and fall inside the cell, contact with moving parts, dropped parts or end effectors, being pinned by the robot arm, etc. These hazards could be magnified while in Teach mode, unless mechanical and engineering safeguards are in place. The most effective way of identifying hazards is by conducting a comprehensive risk assessment before the system is operational, and after all parts, guards, and work practices are in place.\nARE THERE ANY REGULATIONS FOR ROBOTS?\nWhile there is currently no OSHA standard specifically covering industrial robots, there are several consensus standards, that OSHA refers to, covering safeguarding performance criteria, risk assessment methodologies, and general safety requirements. Consensus standards are voluntary standards developed through the cooperation of multiple parties, typically governing agencies and industry groups, who have an interest in participating in the development and/or use of the standards. OSHA commonly refers to consensus standards when there is no specific regulation covering the topic (e.g. NFPA standards on combustible dust). OSHA is very aware that they do not know everything about every subject for every industry. RIA and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) have put together the current robot safety standards and have partnered with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to further promote and update regulations on the topics related to robot safety.\nIf OSHA were to arrive at your facility and inspect a robot or robot system, the first thing the inspector would ask for is a copy of the last risk assessment conducted on the system. If a risk assessment has not been conducted on the system, they could push for a willful violation, as the risk assessment is required by law. Despite no standard in 29 CFR 1910 governing industrial robots, violations and citations can and have been issued on robot system. The primary regulations to be cited for violations with a robot system are Lockout/Tagout and the Control of Hazardous Energy (1910.147), Machine Safeguarding (1910.212), and the General Duty Clause (Section 5(a)(1)). OSHA does also regularly contact original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and robot system integrators to determine the level of safety provided at installation of the equipment as compared to the hazards present at the time of the inspection or injury. As is the way of industrial safety, the employer is the party with the legal responsibility to recognize and mitigate hazards in the workplace.\nHOW DOES OSHA SEE ROBOT SAFETY?\nOSHA’s view on robot safety is that if the employer is meeting the requirements of the consensus standards, specifically ANSI/RIA R15.06 – Safety Requirements for Robots and Robot Systems, then there will not be any issues. However, one of the primary findings from inspections is that, while machine safeguarding and the control of hazardous energy are typically front of mind for employers, comprehensive risk assessments are not being conducted or revised after the installation of new equipment. A risk assessment is required by R15.06 and specified further in ANSI/RIA B11.0 – Safety of Machinery – General Requirements and Risk Assessment. Some facilities have them done by the robot integrators and installers, but fail to conduct them after changes to equipment, policies or procedures, or tooling and layout specifications.\nMany robot accidents and violations do not usually occur during normal operation and practices. These incidents typically occur during non-routine operating conditions (e.g. programming, maintenance, setup, part/tool changes, and while in Teach mode). It is imperative to select an effective safety system for your robots that is based on all jobs and tasks conducted by the robot and within the robot system. This can be done through safety controls, limiting boundaries, safeguards, etc. Through a comprehensive risk assessment all tasks and corresponding hazards can be identified, hazard ratings applied, and corrective actions can be determined and prioritized.\nHOW TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE\nCTI has years of experience conducting both qualitative and quantitative risk assessments on robots and robot systems. CTI is also a member of the R15.06 rule making committee and is in contact with OSHA representative on how the updating of rules and regulations impact employers and industry sectors. Contact CTI for more information on risk assessments and how to ensure your facility’s industrial robots and robot systems are in compliance with all governing standards and regulations.']	['<urn:uuid:d1f1f73a-7b90-4d14-80cc-ea0fdebb893d>', '<urn:uuid:19933ddd-652b-4e96-a35c-746807e8197e>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	32	119	1928
95	I love movies and space. What was product placement like in 2001: A Space Odyssey, and how has space business evolved since then?	2001: A Space Odyssey featured thoughtful product placement with companies like Pan Am, IBM, and Hilton appearing naturally to enhance the film's realism. Many of these brands, like Bell System and Howard Johnson's, didn't survive to 2001. As for space business evolution, it has become increasingly commercialized, with space-related startups attracting over $18.4 billion in investment from 2000 to 2017. Today, private companies like Virgin Galactic and SpaceX offer space tourism services, while others explore opportunities in satellite services, space mining, and infrastructure development. Unlike the past where space exploration was government-driven, private companies now seek to make the cosmos profitable, though they still rely significantly on government contracts.	"['As advertising agencies seek out new ways to recover the eyeballs being lost to Tivo and online gaming just to name a couple of distractions from network tv, product placement in films and television will become even more prevalent than it is today. There is even a growing trend towards the genesis of television: branded entertainment, where the content is produced exclusively as a means to advertise the product. It is a lot harder to strip off the advertising when it is embedded in the content.\nOne of the first films to make prominent use of recognizable brands on screen was Stanley Kubrick\'s 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Kubrick had a vision to make the future that we saw on the screen believable and a faithful extrapolation of 1968 technology to 2001. To achieve that effect, he contacted fifty companies and asked them to provide designs for forward looking products to be used in the movie and many did. None of these inclusions are in the order of the modern incongruous can of soda, label magically pointing to the camera. The type of product placement practiced in the movie was in essence an extrapolation of the corporate exhibits in the then popular World\'s Fairs. Where company logos appear, they are there only to enhance the verisimilitude of the film. Here are some of the most visible examples:\n- Pan Am - Pan Am was at the top of their game in the 1960s, the company was synonymous with luxurious, cutting edge air travel so it is only appropriate that their space shuttle would be the carrier of choice to the space station. The docking sequence choreographed to a waltz, shows the then familiar blue globe logo on the arriving ship. Pan Am did not make it to the millenium unfortunately.\n- IBM - In 1968, IBM was the computer company. Their logo is clearly visible on the displays of the space shuttle. It also makes an appearance on the tablets that Dave uses to watch the news aboard the Discovery and on other assorted hardware such as the forearm mounted controls of Dave\'s spacesuit. There is also the infamous one-letter-removed-from-IBM HAL 9000 computer. Arthur C. Clarke claims that this was coincidental and that he would have changed the name if he had realized this.\n- Bell Picture Phone - In a very famous scene, Dr. Heywood Floyd makes a call to his young daughter from the orbiting space station on a Bell picture phone booth with a window that clearly shows the rotation of the station. The Bell System was of course defunct by 2001 having morphed into AT&T.\n- American Express Card - American Express submitted a ""smart ring"" that was not used in the film. However, though it is not very clear in the film, Dr. Floyd pays for the call with an American Express credit card that he inserts into the phone.\n- Aeroflot - One of the few brands appearing in the movie that made it to 2001 is the Russian flag carrier, Aeroflot. In the scene where Dr. Floyd bumps into Russian colleagues, the stewardesses accompanying them are carrying bags with the Aeroflot logo.\n- Hilton Hotels - The scene above is set in the orbital station in what is presumably the lobby of the station\'s Orbitrer Hilton Hotel. There is also a sign promoting the Hover Hilton.\n- Howard Johnson\'s - In the space station a sign is visible for the Howard Johnson\'s Earthlight Room.\n- General Motors - Once aboard the Pan Am lunar lander Aries the onboard viewscreens show General Motors prototype cars.\n- Parker Pens - With elegant spareness of stage artifice, Kubrick shorthands weightlessness by having a Parker pen hover in the air next to a sleeping Dr. Floyd, where it is retrieved by the stewardess and placed back in his shirt pocket.\n- RCA/Whirlpool - The stewardess aboard the Aries get meals from the RCA/Whirlpool zero gravity food preparation unit.\n- Hamilton - Proto digital watch worn by Frank Poole aboard Discovery. An analog version was produced by Hamilton in small quantities under the name Odysee (due to copyright issues Hamilton could not reference the film). They still show up occasionally on ebay.\n- Parker Brothers - Parker Brothers provided a version of pentominoes that Frank Poole was to play with HAL on a computer screen but the game was changed to chess. In the expectation that there would be demand for the game they produced a board version called Universe which had a limited run when the scene got scrapped. The game survives today as the popular Cathedral game.\n/msg me if you have other examples I missed', 'On 12th April 1961, cosmonaut Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin became the first man in space when he completed one orbit of the earth in the Russian Vostok spacecraft. A similar, yet equally extraordinary event occurred 43 years later when, on 21st June 2004, Mike Melvill crossed the 100-km boundary line that marks the edge of space in the rocket-powered aircraft SpaceShipOne. With this achievement, he became the world’s first commercial astronaut, securing the US$10 million Ansari X Prize for the SpaceShipOne team.\nMelvill’s flight harnessed all the latest aeronautical technology – the culmination of more than 45 years of human space exploration. However, SpaceShipOne’s mission is memorable for what it did not use: a single government dollar.\n“Making the cosmos profitable may prove harder than putting a man on the moon.”\nSince that pivotal moment, space has become increasingly commercialised. According to analytics and research firm Bryce Space and Technology, space-related start-ups attracted over US$18.4 billion of investment from 2000 to 2017.\nHundreds of new companies have formed, countless entrepreneurs have mobilised, and along with a few charismatic billionaires, they have all entered a different kind of space race. The idealistic milestones of the Cold War space race are no longer relevant – this contest is far more pragmatic. Making the cosmos profitable, however, may prove harder than putting a man on the moon.\nThe new space companies looking to build a free market beyond the Kármán line – the boundary where space begins: 100 km above sea level – all face a nagging incongruity. Unlike public agencies such as NASA and the European Space Agency, privately funded companies must eventually turn a profit. Currently, however, the only reliable way of generating profit has been through contract work for publicly funded space agencies.\nSatellite, equipment and crew launches, along with research opportunities paid for by public coffers, have enabled the burgeoning private space industry to grow. Moreover, government support for private companies in space is only set to increase. The most recent budget presented to the US Congress calls for NASA to end direct funding for the International Space Station by 2025, effectively handing off earth’s lower orbit and the maintenance of the ISS to outside agencies. Another more lucrative opportunity for new space companies came in late 2018 when NASA announced the allocation of US$2.6 billion over the next decade for private companies to fly small payloads to the moon.\nNASA is candid about their rationale to contract private companies for lunar exploration and development. The move may have a basis in cost-cutting, but NASA‘s stated intention is to increase competitiveness thereby encouraging the complete commercialisation of space. The realisation of this goal, however, is not unlike our knowledge of deep space: nobody knows what it will look like or how to get there.\nAn Economy in a Vacuum\nIn terms of funding, current activities in space are entirely public or a mixture of both public and private. For true space commerce to exist, private sector companies must offer products or services for private sector customers using solely private sector capital. Presently, satellite television is one of the only viable industries which meets these stipulations, but other commercial endeavours are starting to take off.\nPrivate space travel or space tourism is perhaps the most visible expression of the commercialisation of space. Regardless of its viability, it’s certainly the most publicised among the services offered by the private sector through companies like Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic. The company plans to launch its first paying passenger in 2019, with more lining up ready to pay US$250,000 for an extraterrestrial ride. The potential scope of space tourism was further elucidated in September 2018 when Elon Musk’s SpaceX announced it would ferry Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa around the moon in 2023.\nCommodities are another consideration: the precipitous demand for metals resulting from the exponential growth of populations reliant on digital technologies has private companies looking elsewhere for resources. Not only has this recent push generated extensive interest in excavating the ocean’s floor, but it has also seen the inception of several new space mining companies. In the near future, the private industry hopes to make significant profits by securing valuable minerals from asteroids and other celestial bodies.\nA 2017 report by investment firm Goldman Sachs declared that the financial and technological barriers presented by asteroid mining were low – even comparable to terrestrial mining operations. The Government of Luxembourg is invested: their Space Resources initiative, worth US$227 million, seeks to establish Luxembourg as the European hub for space resources.\nStill, there are some who believe the best opportunities for the commercialisation of space lie in the immediately viable GPS and imaging sectors. Orbiting satellites that can provide everything from communication to spectrum optics services for private industry can turn real profit today rather than sometime in the next 30 years.\nThen there’s logistics – closer to the ground and less glamorous but arguably as important are the start-ups developing practical solutions for space infrastructure. Life support systems, crew habitats, traffic management and food products are the framework that other, more grandiose ventures will depend on over the next several decades.']"	['<urn:uuid:c7f7b86f-649d-4886-a401-da5f2e919075>', '<urn:uuid:fce92499-5b39-4dba-aa72-a1ccea93ab90>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	23	109	1637
96	researching american maritime history when did us fleet lose dominance ocean transport	The American maritime fleet's domination of the seas came to an end following the wreck of the Arctic in 1854.	"['This specific ISBN edition is currently not available.View all copies of this ISBN edition:\nThe 1854 collision at sea between the Arctic and the Vesta, a much smaller French steamship, set in motion one of the most harrowing events in maritime history, with enormous and tragic consequences. David W. Shaw, who brings decades of experience as a seaman to his writing, has based this riveting tale on the firsthand testimony of the few who survived the wreck, including its heroic captain, James C. Luce. It is the story of the brave and dutiful Luce fighting his mutinous crew as they take the lifeboats, leaving hundreds of men, women, and children to suffer a cruel and painful death. It is also the story of those who survived the frigid waters and those who perished -- including Luce\'s own frail son, who died as the grief-stricken captain helplessly watched. Not only did 400 people die by daybreak, the wreck brought to an end the domination of the seas by the American maritime fleet. Utterly compelling, beautifully written, and a fascinating, heretofore little-known slice of American history, The Sea Shall Embrace Them is a stirring narrative that puts the reader on the deck as a shipful of men, women, and children do battle both with a mighty ocean and with their own baser instincts to survive.\n""synopsis"" may belong to another edition of this title.\nBy the mid-19th century, steamships were eclipsing traditional sailing ships in the lucrative transatlantic trade. The largest of these, the American Arctic, collided with a smaller vessel in 1854 with a frightful, and unnecessary, loss of life. David W. Shaw\'s The Sea Shall Embrace Them tells the story of this disaster, eerily similar in many ways to the later sinking of the Titanic. Shaw lays out the immediate and secondary causes of the disaster: bad weather, no established shipping lanes, the ship\'s owners\' preference for speed rather than prudence, and an appalling lack of safety precautions. As well, he describes the suffering and grotesque deaths of many aboard and dozens of acts of pure cowardice on the part of the crew. The writing for the most part is vivid and effective, though the physical layout of the ship is somewhat murky. The story of the Arctic is not only sad and the tragedy avoidable, but one that, as Shaw points out, would be repeated many times in the decades to follow. --H. O\'BillovitchAbout the Author:\nDavid W. Shaw brings decades of experience as a seaman to his writing.

97	What needs to be included on my food product labels?	Product labels must include: the product name, manufacturer's name and address, net weight of the product in ounces/pounds with gram weight equivalent, and a complete list of ingredients in order of predominance by weight.	"['Food & Drug Protection Division\nStarting a home-based food business\nThe following steps will guide you through the ""Application for Home Processor Inspection""\nStep 1. Verify that your product can be manufactured at home.\nLow-risk packaged foods are the only products allowed to be produced at home. These can include:\nPlease contact the Raleigh office at (984) 236-4820 for information with the regards to the production of shelf stable sauces, dressings, salsas, pickles, and acidified foods. All of these products will require laboratory testing.\n- Baked goods\n- Jams and jellies\n- Dried mixes\n- Some sauces and liquids\n- Pickles and acidified foods\nN.C. State University\'s Food Science Department will analyze products for risk. For more information, go to: http://ncsu.edu/foodscience/extension_program/food_product_testing.html\nAll high-risk products must be produced in a non-home based commercial facility . These include, but are not limited to:\n- Refrigerated or frozen products\n- Low-acid canned foods\n- Dairy products\n- Seafood products\n- Bottled water\nIf you are uncertain if your canned goods are low-acid or acidified, contact a Food Compliance Officer at (984) 236-4820 for guidance.\nStep 2. Do you have a pet that comes in your home at any time (even if only at night)?\nIf so, you cannot manufacture foods in your home. This practice is a violation of the Good Manufacturing Practices.\nStep 3. Check your home processing area to ensure it meets federal food safety requirements.\nYour home processing area must meet the standards set by:\n- Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 110) also know as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)\n- N.C. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\nAdditional regulations are required for pickled (acidified) foods:\n- Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 114) Acidified Foods\n- Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 108) Emergency Permit Control\n- Food contact surfaces must be smooth and easily cleanable.\n- No pets in the home at any time.\n- Restroom and hand washing facilities- must have hot and cold running water easily accessible from processing area. Kitchen sink is for food preparation only, hand washing must be done in a separate sink.\n- Thermometer must be kept in refrigerator to monitor temperature.\n- Waste must be carried away from the house in an acceptable fashion (sewer or septic system)\n- All light bulbs in the kitchen must have protective shields or be shatter-proof.\nStep 4. Check local license and zoning information\nIf you have determined that you qualify as a home-based business, check with your local government for compliance with local zoning laws. Also check your neighborhood organizations to be sure a home-based business is allowed in your neighborhood. County government links: https://www.ncacc.org\nStep 5. Well water inspection\nIf your home has municipal/city water, you will need a copy of your most recent bill.\nIf your only water source is from a well, the water must be tested for coliform bacteria before an inspection is made. Test results within 1 year of your application and must be attached with your completed application. Water testing is available from private companies or your local health department.\nStep 6. Develop your business plan\nProvide a brief description of your business to be included with your application to become a home processor. The following items should be included:\n- Detailed list of specific products by name that will be produced in the home kitchen\n- Indicate where the home kitchen is located (i.e. home kitchen, converted kitchen in basement or garage, etc.)\n- Ingredients used and the suppliers\n- A plan for storage for supplies, equipment, and finished product\n- A general production flow- including procedures and equipment used\n- How you plan to transport products to customers (i.e. personal vehicle, food truck, etc.)\n- List potential locations where you plan to sell your product (i.e. local businesses, retail from home, etc.)\nThe NCDA&CS Marketing Division can provide additional help developing a business plan. Visit www.ncagr.gov/markets/agbizmarketing.htm\nStep 7. Food product labels\nAny products to be sold to consumers must be packaged to protect them from contamination. A label must be affixed to the package with:\n1. Product name\n2. Manufacturers name and address\n3. Net weight of the product in ounces/pounds and the gram weight equivalent\n4. Complete list of ingredients in order of predominance by weight\nThe label must declare all of the components of the ingredient you use [ie: for the ingredient self-rising flour you would see “enriched bleached wheat flour(contains bleached wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamin mononitrate, riboflavin and folic acid), salt, sodium bicarbonate, monocalcium phosphate, sodium aluminum phosphate, calcium sulfate.)”]. The easiest way is to copy directly from the ingredient package for each of the ingredients. Any duplications of an ingredient can be deleted after listing where it is most concentrated (ie: sugar may occur as sugar itself, and also in chocolate chips).\nAny food individually packaged for self-service sale must be labeled and adequately packaged to protect them from contamination. Foods “custom made” or “on demand” for sale as a single unit (ie: wedding cake, cake for a restaurant to serve, or a dozen cookies in bulk package for a restaurant to serve) can be exempt from individual labels. Also, if the product is served on demand from a secure bulk container or display case when the customer asks you for it, you can be exempt. However the ingredient information must be available upon request by the consumer. If you do not make comparative nutrition claims (ex. low fat, sugar free) you may be exempt from including the nutrition facts panel information on your product as a small business.\nMore information on labeling requirements is available at:\nStep 8: Complete the Application for Home Processing Inspection\nEmail the completed form to:\nMail the completed form to:\nKaye J. Snipes\n|Complete the Application for Home Processor Inspection (link to PDF)|\nWithin four (4) to six (6) weeks of sending your application, a Food Regulatory Specialist will contact you to arrange a home processing facility inspection. You will be sent a copy of all relevant federal and state regulations for your review and to prepare your facility for inspection.\nAfter sending your completed application, please check your Email periodically for correspondence from our Regulatory Specialists. Inspection appointments are typically made over email. For applicants without email access, appointments will be made by phone.\nSend questions regarding home processing to firstname.lastname@example.org.\nAfter receipt of your application the Food Regulatory Specialist may determine that product testing is required to ensure your product can be manufactured in a home kitchen.\nThe following products may need to have product testing:\n- Acidified foods (ex Pickles): pH testing\n- Dressings/sauces: pH\n- “Moist” breads/cakes, and some pies: Aw (water activity) and pH\n- Any questionable products: Aw and/or pH\nProduct testing is available through N.C. State University or other commercial labs\nThe inspection process:\nInspectors may require product testing (water activity and/or pH) BEFORE the inspection to ensure your product is safe for home processing.\nA home-based kitchen inspection checks the kitchen to be sure it is clean, constructed of suitable materials and is free of any pest activity (insect or rodent). Remember that indoor pets would also be considered pests. No indoor pets or pests are allowed.\nStandard household equipment and appliances are acceptable. The equipment and appliances can be used for both personal and commercial use. Standard household sinks are acceptable. The kitchen should be free of decorative materials which could collect dust. Running water at a suitable temperature and pressure is required. There is not a specific temperature requirement for hot water, as long as it is hot enough to accomplish cleaning and sanitizing of equipment and utensils.\nWaste should be conveyed away from the house in an acceptable fashion (Sewer or Septic Tank)\nAny lights in the kitchen or any processing or packaging areas should be shielded against accidental breakage.\nThe inspection will be focused on the kitchen and other areas where processing and packaging of products may take place. Areas of the house in which materials, ingredients and equipment are stored will also be inspected. Inspectors may also walk around the exterior of the house to verify that the foundation is intact and will not allow for the entry of pests.\nA permit is not issued, but inspectors will alert the homeowner to any possible violations of the N.C. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\nFile for a tax number\nThere are several types of tax numbers. If a business is planning to have sales, a Sales & Use Tax number (NC-BR) is required. Businesses having employees are required to obtain a Federal Employer Identification number (SS-4 form) along with a N.C. withholding tax number. The N.C. Business License Information Office can provide application forms to businesses for these numbers.\nRegister business name\nThe type of business structure determines where a business name (assumed name) should be registered. A Certificate of Assumed Name for sole proprietorships and partnerships must be filed with the Register of Deeds in the county or counties where businesses plan to operate. Corporations or Limited Liability Companies must register their business names with the N.C. Secretary of State, Corporations Division.\nApply for a UPC code\nMany retailers now require a Uniform Product Code (UPC) for each product they carry. A UPC code allows automated checkout stands to read the name of the manufacturer and the specific product from the bar code.\nThe Uniform Code Council Inc. (UCC) is the central management and information center for manufacturers, distributors and retailers participating in the UPC system. This organization is not a government agency. It is an administrative council that exists specifically to develop standard product and shipping container codes, control the issuing of company identification codes, provide detailed information and to coordinate the efforts of all participants. Although membership in the UCC is voluntary, it is required to obtain a UPC identification number.\nUniform Code Council Inc.\n7887 Washington Village Dr.\nDayton, OH 45459\n(937) 435-3870 or (800) 543-8137\nNCDA Marketing: Apply for Got To Be NC Membership Today!']"	['<urn:uuid:e8bf950e-8dcc-4e8b-9c3f-fed45b4668ca>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	10	34	1667
98	how pilots avoid dangers from aircraft objects and what steps organizations take to prevent accidents	Regarding objects in aircraft, Foreign Object Debris (FOD) is a serious threat that requires pilots to account for everything taken into the cockpit and every tool used in repairs. Items like pens, loose change, or tools can migrate within the cockpit and jam flight controls, potentially causing serious incidents. As for organizational prevention, aviation organizations implement Safety Management Systems and foster a positive safety culture where everyone feels responsible for avoiding unsafe practices. This includes trained instructors following common syllabi, airworthiness inspections by certified personnel, and encouraging pilots to seek regular refresher training. The goal is to move beyond reactive systems to anticipate and reduce accident frequency.	['Articles from our club member Kevin Price on Safety\nWhere are we going?\nMy topic for today concerns tow operations…or perhaps I should say destinations. First and foremost, let me say that in my 1.5 years or so of flying at CCSC I have been generally impressed with our tow pilots. No one has scared me yet (or even come close to it), and I find they are amazingly consistent in terms of airspeed control and smoothness. They are typically very good about taking us upwind and toward an area of promising lift, so much so that some of us may have become complacent about where we are being taken.\nThe Tow Handbook says to “Plan your flight path to be upwind of the glider port at release altitude.” While that guidance is generally followed, occasionally traffic conflicts, a change in winds or some other factor results in reaching release altitude some distance downwind of the gliderport. When winds are light, I suppose it doesn’t matter much if at all. But what is light? Is my light your light? Also, how many tow pilots…or glider pilots…know the exact winds aloft for the day? For those that have flown aircraft with wind readouts, you’ll know that quite significant wind shifts and speed changes can occur within just a couple of thousand feet. (Once at Ft Wayne I saw the wind go from a 50 knot crosswind at pattern altitude to less than a 10 knot headwind on final.)\nTo help us all know the winds aloft for the day, Brian Stoops is working to put a white board on the trailer which will include the weather, NOTAMS, etc for the day. Each PIC is responsible for knowing that information and it will now be much easier to obtain it. As part of your preflight preparations, are you forming a mental picture of where you want to be when you release? Why let the tow pilot take you where you don’t want ..or perhaps even shouldn’t… go? Are you monitoring where you are being towed? Remember those tow plane steering signals you practiced for and performed on your FAA checkride? Well, it would be nice to put those to use from time to time, both for practice (for you and the tow pilot) as well as for practical reasons (i.e., you don’t like where you are going).\nFly safe! – Kevin Price\nHaving flown fighter aircraft for many years, I have been asked from time to time if I ever had to eject. The quick answer is no; the longer answer is…almost. How does this question relate to glider safety? Give me a couple of minutes and I think you will see.\nA number of years ago I was going through fighter lead-in training at Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo, New Mexico. We accomplished our training in AT-38 aircraft, a derivative of the sleek T-38 aircraft which has been the Air Force’s high performance trainer for nearly 50 years. The training consisted of formation flying, low level navigation, weapon delivery, and Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM…”dog-fighting”).\nOn one mission I was a hapless passenger in the backseat with an Instructor Pilot (IP) who was doing BFM. During the very last set, the offensive aircraft closed in for a simulated gun shot. To defeat a gunshot, one has to move the aircraft out-of-plane from the bullet stream during the time of flight of the bullets. This is typically done by unloading the aircraft, rolling some number of degrees, and re-applying some positive G’s. An alternative is to push forward on the stick and use negative G’s to spoil the tracking solution. This particular time the IP chose the negative G maneuver…banging my helmeted head against the canopy while having me…a new student…wonder what the heck he was doing. After all, I was new to this stuff.\nImmediately after this maneuver he yelled at me over the intercom asking if I had my hand on the throttles. I said no. He then responded with a “uh-oh” and I knew we had a problem. Both throttles were solidly stuck…they could not be retarded. The good news though is that the were stuck in the right place…93% on an AT-38. If they had been higher, we would have had too much power to land; any lower, and we would have not had enough power to continue flying. The pilot handled the situation very well. He shut down one engine on the way back to base, put the speedbrakes out to slow us down (otherwise we would have still been to fast to land even on one engine), and upon touchdown he shutdown the remaining engine. We coasted to a stop. This easily and certainly could have turned out much differently.\nSo, what caused the throttles to get stuck? It turns out that a mechanic had accidentally left a wrench in the engine bay. The negative G unload caused the wrench to migrate to a highly undesirable location — into the throttle cables that modulate the engine. This almost resulted in the loss of an aircraft…and our reliance on some rather old ejection seat technology.\nForeign Object Debris (FOD) is an enemy of all aircraft. While fighters are especially vulnerable due to dynamic maneuvering and their complex systems, gliders are also susceptible to FOD and its consequences. Our older 2-33’s with their open flooring are clearly at risk to FOD. However, a pen, loose change, sunglasses, etc dropped by a pilot or their passenger can migrate within the cockpit of any glider and get into the flight controls. Likewise, a tool unaccounted for during repairs or annual inspections can also cause serious problems.\nThe best way to prevent a FOD related incident or accident is of course to account for everything taken into the aircraft and every tool used to repair them. Take a look too as you enter the cockpit for stuff that others may have left . That said, what if you encounter a jammed flight control inflight? Hopefully you have a parachute and sufficient altitude to use it. If neither is the case, then what? You’ll need to get creative. If it is the elevator and it is in a favorable position, hopefully that will take you to a safe landing field. If the elevator is positioned such that your nose is rising and perhaps leading to a stall, maybe you can roll the aircraft to get the nose back below the horizon. (The nose will certainly fall as you approach 90 degrees of bank.) If your aircraft has a trim tab, you may be able to use it to control your pitch. If the ailerons are jammed, perhaps the rudder will allow you to change heading. If the spoilers/airbrakes are stuck closed, slip the aircraft to lose altitude. If the spoilers/airbrakes are stuck open…get the nose down to keep airspeed and pick a landing spot accordingly. Regardless of which flight control is jammed, assess whether the aircraft is landable as is. If so, recommend landing versus trying to fix the flight controls by force. (In my AT-38 story above, the pilot did not try to force the throttles. His concern was that if he forcefully pulled them aft he would not be able to advance them again to flyable thrust. We landed…he made the right decision.) If the problem is with the rudder or ailerons, you might try cycling between positive and negative G’s to free what may be FOD in the controls. All of these are merely ideas…things to think through on the ground just in case you encounter such a problem one of these days.\nIn closing, FOD can lead to incidents, accidents, and fatalities. We all must apply due diligence by accounting for everything we take into the cockpit and every tool we use to work on the aircraft.\nFly safe! – Kevin Price\nSAFETY CORNER … TREES … THE ONES YOU MAY NOT BE SEEING!\nCCSC pilots demonstrate a healthy respect for the trees on the approach end of runway 09. Those trees are very obvious and the natural instinct is to give them wide vertical berth during landing. What about the those trees though at the approach end of runway 27? Trees, what trees?\nI am not referring to the trees that set back about 700 feet from Elbon Road. You’d have to really mess up a pattern for those to be a problem during landing. The concern is the narrow line of trees oriented parallel with the runway 27 landing lanes. While most pilots land on the south side of runway 27 and so do not come close to these trees, occasionally a slight pattern overshoot, the need to deconflict from aircraft that just landed, or perhaps the need to land on a drier part of the runway can bring a pilot close to these rather tall trees. When this happens, it is easy to be so focused on the landing that the pilot can lose consideration of these trees, especially considering the very long wingspan of a glider.\nDuring my field check last year the instructor spoke up (good!) about his concern with the trees as I approached runway 27 to land. For this pattern, I had to offset a bit north due to traffic that had just landed. That, combined with being on a not-steep approach, brought my right wing a bit close to the tree line. Here’ a picture from that flight…with accurate altitude and ground track information… from SeeYou:\nI have seen others come quite close to this tree line both vertically and laterally, and I am not sure they were fully aware. Again, it seems it is particularly easy to forget about those long wings and this tree line when focusing on the end game of the landing.\nAnyhow, please pay special attention to these trees when your landing approach is not well to the south or north side of runway 27. Likewise, if you see someone come uncomfortably close to the trees, do them a favor and let them know what you saw. Crew Chiefs, Ground Crews, and especially Instructors, please keep an eye out for this trend item.\nFly safe! – Kevin Price', 'Managing Flying Risk – Culture and Safety Management System\nThe most effective and strategic way to maintain a reasonable level of risk is to ensure that the Association has a positive safety culture. Safety culture is the “way of operating” within the organisation that influences safe behaviours and consists of shared beliefs, practices and attitudes. The ultimate ambition is for everyone in the organisation to feel responsible for helping to avoid unsafe practices, and to consider the impact on safety of their own activities. Instructors, introductory flight pilots, inspectors, and others in key positions need to ensure their decisions are made with an awareness of the safety implications.\nBy changing a way of operating, it may be possible to avoid a hazard becoming an accident. A positive safety culture is generated from the “top down”and relies on a high degree of trust, respect and communication between all elements of the organisation. Everyone involved must believe without doubt that they will be supported in any reasonable decisions made in the interests of safety.\nSafety Management System\nBy adopting a holistic Safety Management System that meets the needs of the sport, clubs, pilots and aircraft operators, the BGA aims to move beyond the traditional reactive systems to try to anticipate areas of exposure and change ways of working to reduce the frequency of particular kinds of accident. The ‘BGA Safety Management System Manual’ is available here.\nPilot training is carried out by trained and monitored instructors to a common syllabus that has been and continues to be developed by the BGA Training Standards Manager and Instructing and Examining Committee. Instructors are supported by club Chief Flying Instructors and Regional Examiners and Coaches. Recognition of risk and how to manage it are key elements of ‘Threat and Error Management’ that is taught during gliding training.\nAirworthiness is the responsibility of owners and achieved through compliance and support by the BGA airworthiness system which includes BGA inspectors who are guided and supported by the BGA Chief Technical Officer and Technical Committee. Inspectors certify maintenance and repairs beyond that which a pilot/owner is permitted to carry out.\nPilots under training are supervised and supported by instructors. Qualified pilots, ie pilots who hold a valid licence or BGA Bronze Endorsement with Cross Country Endorsement, are responsible for managing their own exposure to risk, subject to club requirements. If the pilot is carrying a passenger, the pilot’s responsibility extends to the passenger.\nPilots are encouraged to seek advice from their CFI or another senior instructor. Periodic refresher training is an excellent method of confirming that appropriate skills remain in place, for example “spinning”, or “field landing” refresher training in a motor glider. Pilots should note that two instructional flights in 24 months form part of the SPL recency requirement.\nThere are very few new hazards in gliding. It is possible to suggest a prescription for a safe glider pilot:\n- prepares carefully before flight\n- never endangers others\n- keeps an effective lookout\n- can cope with winch emergencies\n- does not cause tug upsets\n- does not inadvertently stall/spin\n- can land in the chosen place\n- picks a field early\n- takes care on the ground\n- and, if an instructor, takes control promptly when the student makes a potentially dangerous error']	['<urn:uuid:b922fb1c-06e7-4e90-ac95-05a152e697fc>', '<urn:uuid:661811b8-5f82-4e01-b993-3972524c38c7>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T01:11:32.010355	15	107	2250
99	As a physiologist studying cell repair mechanisms, I'm curious about how metabolism relates to tissue healing - what are the energy-related processes in cell metabolism during healing, and what specific healing phases require this energy?	Metabolism provides energy for all cell activities through catabolism, which breaks down complex substances and releases kinetic energy needed for body functions. During soft tissue healing, this energy is specifically used in multiple healing phases: in the acute inflammatory phase for activating neutrophils and macrophages, in the proliferation phase for fibroblast migration and collagen production (24-48 hours after injury), and in the remodeling phase for tissue reorganization. ATP is particularly utilized during the inflammatory phase for the healing process.	['The following points highlight the fifteen essential characteristics of living beings. The characteristics are: 1. Cellular Structure 2. Metabolism 3. Growth 4. Reproduction 5. Consciousness 6. Organisation 7. Energy 8. Homeostasis 9. Variations 10. Adaptations 11. Healing and Repair 12. Disposal of Wastes 13. Movements 14. Life Span 15. Death.\nCharacteristic # 1. Cellular Structure:\nIt is defining property of living beings. Each living being is a complex entity which is formed of one or more cells. The cells are made of protoplasm, popularly called living matter. Composition of living matter is known. However, we have not yet been able to create protoplasm because of lack of organisation of biomolecules. Protoplasm and cellular structure are absent in viruses.\nCharacteristic # 2. Metabolism:\nAll organisms operate a network of thousands of chemical reactions. The sum total of all chemical reactions occurring in an organism due to specific interactions amongst different types of molecules within the interior of cells is called metabolism (Gk. metabole— change).\nMetabolism is defining property of living beings. All activities of an organism including growth, movements, development, responsiveness, reproduction, etc. are due to metabolism. No non-living object shows metabolism.\nHowever, metabolic reactions can be carried out outside the body of an organism in cell free systems. Such reactions are neither living nor non-living. The isolated in vitro metabolic reactions can, however, be called biological reactions or living reactions as they involve bio-chemicals.\nCharacteristic # 3. Growth:\nGrowth is irreversible increase in mass of an individual. A multicellular organism increases its mass by cell division. In plants growth continues throughout life as they have meristematic areas where cell divisions occur regularly.\nIn animals, growth occurs to a certain age after which cells divide only to replace worn out and lost cells. Unicellular organisms also grow by cell division. However, cell division is also a means of reproduction in them. In higher animals and plants, growth and reproduction are mutually exclusive.\nLiving organisms show internal growth due to addition of materials and formation of cells inside the body. Such a method is called intussusception (L. intus — within, suscipere— to receive). A dead organism does not grow. However, some non-living articles can increase in size, e.g., mountains, boulders, crystals, stones.\nIt is due to addition of similar materials to their outer surface. The process is called accretion (L. accrescere — to increase). In living beings growth producing substances are of two types, protoplasmic and apoplasmic.\nProtoplasmic substances are components of living matter like cytoplasm and nucleus. Apoplasmic substances (Gk. apo- away, plastos – formed) are non-living materials formed by the cells which become component of tissues, e.g., cell wall, fibres of connective tissue, matrix of bone and cartilage.\nChemically growth is a result of difference between anabolism and catabolism. Growth occurs when anabolism exceeds catabolism. There will be no growth if anabolism and catabolism are equal. Degrowth or negative growth can occur when catabolism exceeds anabolism.\nCharacteristic # 4. Reproduction:\nIt is the formation of new individuals of the similar kind — life arises from pre-existing life. Reproduction is not essential for survival of the individuals. It is required for perpetuation of a population.\nAbility for reproduction develops when a young individual becomes mature. Reproduction is of two types, asexual and sexual. Asexual reproduction is uniparental while sexual reproduction is generally bi-parental.\nAsexual reproduction is the formation of new individuals from specialised or un-specialised parts of a single parent without the formation and fusion of gametes. It occurs by spores, binary fission, multiple fission, fragmentation and regeneration. Sexual reproduction involves the formation and fusion of two types of sex cells or gametes. The fusion product or zygote gives rise to an offspring.\nIn unicellular organisms, growth and reproduction are synonyms. Many organisms do not reproduce, e.g., mules, sterile worker bees, infertile human couples. Therefore, reproduction is not an all inclusive characteristic of living organism. However, no non-living object has the power to reproduce or replicate.\nMetabolism is of two kinds, catabolism and anabolism. Anabolism includes all the “building up” reactions.\nIt is also called constructive metabolism since it involves the synthesis of complex substances from simpler ones, e.g., synthesis of organic compounds from CO2 and HO2 during photosynthesis, formation of starch from glucose, production of proteins from amino acids, formation of lipids from fatty acids and alcohols. Energy is stored (as potential energy) in the process.\nCatabolism (= katabolism) constitutes “breakdown reactions”. It is also known as destructive metabolism because it involves breaking of complex substances into simpler ones. Potential energy present in the complex substances is converted into kinetic energy. Respiration is an example of catabolism. It releases energy for performing different body activities.\nDifferences between Anabolism and Catabolism:\n1. It is the sum total of building up or constructive processes.\n2. Anabolism produces complex materials from simpler ones.\n3. It stores energy.\n4. Kinetic energy is changed into potential energy.\n5. Anabolism is required for growth, maintenance and storage.\n6. Fewer types of precursors form diverse products (reactions diverge).\n1. Catabolism is the sum total of breakdown or destructive processes.\n2. It forms simple substances from complex ones.\n3. It releases energy.\n4. Potential energy is changed into kinetic energy.\n5. Catabolism is required for performing various activities of living beings.\n6. Many types of larger substances breakdown to form fewer types of simple molecules (reactions converge).\nCharacteristic # 5. Consciousness:\nIt is awareness of the surroundings and response to external stimuli. The external stimuli can be physical, chemical or biological. The stimuli are perceived by sense organs in higher animals, e.g., eyes, ears, nose. Plants do not possess such sophisticated sense organs.\nHowever, they do respond to external factors such as light, water, temperature, pollutants, other organisms, etc. Photoperiods (duration of daily exposure to light) influence reproduction in those animals and plants which breed during particular season (seasonal breeders).\nAll organisms, from primitive prokaryotes to most advanced and complex eukaryotes, are able to sense and respond to environmental factors. Organisms also handle chemicals entering their bodies. Human beings have an additional faculty of self consciousness (awareness of self). Consciousness is said to be the defining property of living organisms.\nIf a patient is lying in coma and is supported by machines for various functions, self consciousness and consciousness to external environment are supposed to be absent. Some of these patients never come back to normal life. They can neither be called living nor non-living or dead.\nCharacteristic # 6. Organisation:\nA living being has an organisation, that is, the living being consists of several components and subcomponents which cooperate with one another for the well being of the whole organism. A living being has multiple level organisations.\nEach level of organisation has its own properties which are not found in its constituents. A cellular organelle develops a property not found in its interacting molecular components. A living cell has its own characteristics not found in its organelles. A tissue is able to have a trait not found in its constituent cells.\nCharacteristic # 7. Energy:\nLiving beings constantly require energy not only to perform various activities of the body but also to overcome entropy or tendency to randomness. The source of energy is food. It is required by every cell of the body.\nCharacteristic # 8. Homeostasis (Homoeostasis):\nA favourable internal environment suitable for the functioning of body organs is present in every living being. It is quite different from the external environment.\nChanges in external environment do not have much impact on the internal environment as the living beings have a self regulated system to adjust and maintain the internal environment. The phenomenon is called homeostasis (Gk. homois — alike, stasis standing). Homeostasis is also present in each cell of a multicellular organism.\nCharacteristic # 9. Variations:\nLiving beings possess variations and have the ability to evolve with time.\nCharacteristic # 10. Adaptations (L. ad— toward, apt— adjust):\nUseful inheritable variations or changes inform, function and behaviour which help an organism to adjust well and successfully in its environment are called adaptations. An organism is considered best adapted to an environment when it possesses inherited traits that enhance its survival and ability to reproduce in that environment.\nAdaptations allow the organisms to overcome seasonal and other changes in the environment. They are of two types, short term adaptations (e.g., hibernation in most amphibians and reptiles and some mammals) and long term adaptations (e.g., the claws of different birds are well adapted to suit their perching habits).\nCharacteristic # 11. Healing and Repair:\nLiving beings can repair and heal the broken and injured parts.\nCharacteristic # 12. Disposal of Wastes:\nWastes generated by living beings are regularly disposed off.\nCharacteristic # 13. Movements:\nLiving beings show movements of their parts. Some are able to move from place to place. The phenomenon is called locomotion.\nCharacteristic # 14. Life Span:\nEvery living organism has a definite life span of birth, growth, maturity, senescence and death.\nCharacteristic # 15. Death:\nThe stoppage of various life activities by an individual organism accompanied by increase in entropy is called death. Death occurs due to ageing, disease, accident and predation.\nAgeing normally occurs in all organisms after a period of reproductive maturity. It is, however, absent in some cases where the organism multiplies by binary fission, e.g., Amoeba, bacteria. A fully grown Amoeba or a bacterium divides into two daughters. In the process it loses its independent existence. Here, natural death is absent and the organism is immortal.\nLiving organisms are, therefore, self replicating, evolving and self regulatory interactive systems capable of responding to external stimuli, sharing a common genetic material to varying degree both horizontally and vertically.', 'Soft Tissue Healing\nOriginal Editor - Bo Hellinckx\n- 1 Definition/Description\n- 2 Phases of healing\n- 3 Types\n- 4 Physiotherapy management\n- 5 Clinical bottom line\n- 6 Reference\nSoft tissue healing is defined as the replacement of destroyed tissue by living tissue in the body. This process consists of two parts - regeneration and repair. During the regeneration component, specialized tissue is replaced by the proliferation of surrounding undamaged specialized cells. In the repair component, lost tissue is replaced b granulation tissue which matures into scar tissue.\nPhases of healing\nThe different healing phases is not mutually exclusive and tend to overlap quite a lot.\nShort phase immediately after injury, lasting about 6-8 hours, and up to 24 hours after a crush injury. The time of the bleeding will depend on the extend of the soft tissue injury and the management thereof. The more vascular the injured structures, the more bleeding will occur.\nThe goal of the inflammation phase is to stop the bleeding phase. This is achieved by vasoconstriction, retraction of injured blood vessels, fibrin deposition and clotting. The blood supply to the area increases in this time, causing oedema and redness. This phase starts rapidly within a 6-8 hours after the soft tissue injury, reaches the maximal reaction between 1-3 days and gradually resolves in a few weeks. Phagocytosis also happens during this phase.\nThe acute inflammatory involves activities that generate exudates - plasma-like fluid that exudes out of tissue or its capillaries and is composed of protein and granular leukocytes (white blood cells). Chronic inflammatory response is of prolonged duration and involves the presence of nongranular leukocytes and the production of scar tissue.\nThe acute phase involves three mechanisms that act to stop blood loss from the wound:\n- Local vasoconstriction occurs, lasting a few seconds to as long as 10 min. Larger vessels constrict due to neurotransmitters and capillaries and smaller arterioles and venules constrict due to the influence of serotonin and catecholamines released from platelets. The resulting reduction in the volume of blood flow in the region promotes increased blood viscosity or resistance to the flow, which further reduces blood loss at the injury site.\n- The platelet reaction provokes clotting as individual cells irreversibly combine with each other and with fibrin to form a mechanical plug that occludes the end of a ruptured blood vessel. The platelets also produce an array of chemical mediators in the inflammatory phase: serotonin, adrenaline, noradrenaline, and histamine. Also ATP is use for energy in the healing process.\n- Fibrinogen molecules are converted into fibrin for clot formation through two different pathways. Following vasoconstriction, vasodilation is brought on by a local axon reflex and the complement and kinin cascades, approximately 20 proteins that normally circulate in the blood in inactive form become active to promote variety of activities essential for healing. Phagocytosis- is the activation of neutrophils and macrophages to rid the injured site debris and infectious agents. As the blood flows to the injured area slows, these cells are redistributed to the periphery, where they begin to adhere to the endothelial lining. Mast cells and basophils are also stimulated to release histamine, further promoting vasodilatation. Bradykinin also promotes vasodilation and increase blood vessel wall permeability, contributing to the formation of tissue exudates.\nApproximately 1 hour post-injury, swelling, or edema, occurs as the vascular walls become more permeable and increased pressure within the vessels forces a plasma exudate out into the interstitial tissues. These only happen for a few minutes in cases of mild trauma, with a return to normal permeability in 20-30 minutes.\nMore severe traumas can results in a prolonged state of increased permeability, and sometimes result in delayed onset of increased permeability, with swelling not apparent until some time has elapsed since the original injury. Mast cells are connective tissue cells that carry heparin, which prolongs clotting and histamine. Platelets and basophil leukocytes also transport histamine, which serves as a vasodilator and increases blood vessel permeability.\nBradykinin, a major plasma protease present during inflammation, increases vessel permeability and stimulates nerve endings to cause pain.\nDuring this phase, collagen is produced to form scar tissue. This phase starts between 24-48 hours after injury, but lasts up to 2-3 weeks, when the bulk of the scar tissue is formed. Revascuarisation and fibroblast migration happens during this phase.\nFibroplasia and granulation tissue formation\nFormation of granulation tissue is a central event during the proliferative phase. Its formation occurs 3-5 days following injury and overlaps with the preceding inflammatory phase. Granulation tissue includes inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, and neovasculature in a matrix of fibronectin, collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and proteoglycans.\nEpithelialization is the formation of epithelium over a denuded surface. It involves the migration of cells at the wound edges over a distance of less than 1 mm, from one side of the incision to the other. Incisional wounds are epithelialized within 24-48 hours after injury. This epithelial layer provides a seal between the underlying wound and the environment.\nThe process begins within hours of tissue injury. Epidermal cells at the wound edges undergo structural changes, allowing them to detach from their connections to other epidermal cells and to their basement membrane. Intracellular actin microfilaments are formed, allowing the epidermal cells to creep across the wound surface. As the cells migrate, they dissect the wound and separate the overlying eschar from the underlying viable tissue. Wounds in a moist environment demonstrate a faster and more direct course of epithelialization. Occlusive and semiocclusive dressings applied in the first 48 hours after injury may maintain tissue humidity and optimize epithelialization.\nWhen epithelialization is complete, the epidermal cell assumes its original form, and new desmosomal linkages to other epidermal cells and hemidesmosomal linkages to the basement membrane are restored.\nThe fibroblast is a critical component of granulation tissue. Fibroblasts are responsible for the production of collagen, elastin, fibronectin, glycosaminoglycans, and proteases. Fibroblasts grow in the wound as the number of inflammation cells decrease. The demand for inflammation disappears as the chemotactic factors that call inflammatory cells to the wound are no longer produced and as those already present in the wound are inactivated.\nFibroplasia begins 3-5 days after injury and may last as long as 14 days. Skin fibroblasts and mesenchymal cells differentiate to perform migratory and contractile capabilities. Fibroblasts migrate and proliferate in response to fibronectin, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, and C5a. Fibronectin serves as an anchor for the myofibroblast as it migrates within the wound.\nA rich blood supply is vital to sustain newly formed tissue and is appreciated in the erythema of a newly formed scar. The macrophage is essential to the stimulation of angiogenesis and produces macrophage-derived angiogenic factor in response to low tissue oxygenation. This factor functions as a chemo-attractant for endothelial cells. Basic fibroblast growth factor secreted by the macrophage and vascular endothelial growth factor secreted by the epidermal cell are also important to angiogenesis.\nAngiogenesis results in greater blood flow to the wound and, consequently, increased perfusion of healing factors. Angiogenesis ceases as the demand for new blood vessels ceases. New blood vessels that become unnecessary disappear by apoptosis.\nContraction results in a decrease in wound size, appreciated from end to end along an incision; a 2-cm incision may measure 1.8cm after contraction. The maximal rate of contraction is 0.75 mm/d and depends on the degree of tissue laxity and shape of the wound. Loose tissues contract more than tissues with poor laxity, and square wounds tend to contract more than circular wounds. Wound contraction depends on the myofibroblast located at the periphery of the wound, its connection to components of the extracellular matrix, and myofibroblast proliferation.\nRadiation and drugs, which inhibit cell division, have been noted to delay wound contraction. Contraction does not seem to depend on collagen synthesis.\nThe remodeling phase starts around the peak of the proliferation phase. The result of this phase is an organised, quality and functional scar similar to the tissue it is busy repairing. The ultimate endpoint following remodeling depends on the tissue type. In non-central nervous system (CNS) tissue that undergoes primary healing, very little remodeling occurs because of the lack of extra-cellular matrix produced during repair. Secondary healing, in contrast, involves fiber alignment and contraction to reduce the wound size and to reestablish tissue strength. Complete recovery of original tissue strength is rarely obtained in secondary healing because repaired tissue remains less organized than non-injured tissue, which results in scar formation. Collagen-rich scars are characterized morphologically by a lack of specific organization of cellular and matrix elements that comprise the surrounding uninjured tissue. In CNS tissue where there is no repair or regeneration of injured neurons, there is also relatively little reestablishment of structural integrity in the region. Instead, during CNS remodeling, the glial scar around the lesion becomes denser as astrocytic processes become more intertwined and more or less isolates but does not repair the injured region.\n- Partial-thickness cutaneous tissue remodeling\n- Stabilized bone remodeling\n- Peripheral nervous system remodeling\n- Full-thickness cutaneous tissue remodeling\n- Unstabilized bone remodeling\nRemodeling in the CNS is limited, because of the need to protect the CNS from the body’s robust inflammatory responses, reactive astrocytic processes become further intertwined, forming a dense sheath around the wound site .\nRestoration of continuity occurs directly by fibrous adhesion, without formation of granulation tissue; it results in a thin scar.\nWound healing occurs by union by adhesion of granulating surfaces, when the edges of the wound are far apart and cannot be brought together. Granulations form from the base and sides of the wound toward the surface.\nWound healing occurs by the gradual filling of a wound cavity by granulations and a cicatrix.\nThis classification is based on a treatment protocol of Clanton et al., but it is similar to other classifications. It is possible that some phases overlap, dependable on the individual response to healing and the type of injury. Not every patient undergoes all phases to achieve a full rehabilitation.\nPhase 1: Acute phase (1 - 7 days)\n- Goal: Minimize inflammation and pain.\nPhase 2: Subacute phase (Day 3 - < 3 weeks)\nThis phase starts when signs of inflammation begin to reduce. Inflammation signs are heat, swelling, redness and pain.\n- Goal: Prevent muscle atrophy\n- Pain-free full range of motion: concentric strengthening\n- If any pain present: decrease intensity of exercises\nPhase 3: Remodeling phase: ( 1 - 6 weeks)\n- Stretching to avoid a decrease in flexibility\n- Eccentric strengthening\n- It is important to make sure that the muscle is already regenerated, to prevent risk of re-injury\nPhase 4: Functional phase: (2 weeks - 6 months)\n- Goal: Return to sport without re-injury.\n- Increase their strength, endurance, speed, agility, flexibility and proprioception until the normal values of patient.\n- Sport specific activities\nPhase 5: Return to competition phase: (3 weeks to 6 months)\n- Goal: Avoid a re-injury\n- Criteria: Full range of motion, strength, coordination and psychological readiness\n- Address deficits in criteria\n- Progressive agility and trunk stabilization\nSoft tissue healing is a natural process that occurs in the body after an injury. This process happens without the need for medication and therapy, but this can play an important role in cases where problems are identified in this natural process, such as repeated trauma, inhibited response or delayed reactions. The aim would then be to facilitate and stimulate the soft tissue healing process. It is also important to realise that inappropriate therapy will inhibit these events. It is thus very important to be selective of the most appropriate therapy at each stage.\n- Walter JB, Israel MS. General Pathology, Churchill Livingstone. Six.

As for creme brulee, it needs to be refrigerated for at least 2 hours after baking and can be chilled overnight. Both desserts require refrigeration, but the cream cheese braid should be consumed within 3-4 days while creme brulee can be made ahead and stored overnight before the final torching step.	"['- 1/4 cup golden raisins, soaked in 1 Tbsp orange juice for 30-60 min (optional)\n- 1 cup Hodgson Mill Whole Wheat Flour\n- 2 - 2 1/2 cups Hodgson Mill Best for Bread Flour, divided, plus 1 cup more for kneading\n- 2 tsp Hodgson Mill Vital Wheat Gluten\n- 1/2 tsp nutmeg\n- 1 package Hodgson Mill Yeast, fast rise, or active dry\n- 3/4 cup milk\n- 1/4 cup butter\n- 1/2 cup sugar\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 1 egg\n- 1 tsp vanilla\n- 1/4 cup orange juice, room temperature or warmer\n- 1 tsp orange zest\n- 1 tsp lemon zest\n- 8 oz cream cheese, 1 package, softened\n- 1/4 cup sugar\n- 1 tsp lemon zest\n- 1 tsp vanilla\n- 1 egg yolk, lightly beaten\n- 2 tsp water\n- 2/3 cup powdered sugar\n- 1 Tbsp lemon juice, fresh\n- 1 tsp cinnamon\nMix whole wheat flour, 1 1/2 cups bread flour, vital wheat gluten, nutmeg and yeast in a large bowl. In a saucepan over low heat, heat milk and butter until butter is melted and mixture is warm (120º to 130º). Add sugar and salt, and stir until dissolved.\nAdd melted butter and milk mixture to dry flour mixture. Add egg, vanilla, room temperature orange juice, and lemon and orange zest and mix until well combined. Continue mixing and slowly add in the remaining 1 cup of bread flour until dough is workable. It will be a bit sticky.\nKnead on a floured surface until smooth, about 15 minutes. Shape into a ball. Place in greased bowl, turn over once or twice to coat the dough with oil. Cover, let rise until doubled, approximately 60 – 90 minutes.\nWhile dough is rising make cream cheese filling. In a medium mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar, lemon zest, and vanilla until smooth. Beat just until combined, don’t over mix. Refrigerate until ready to use.\nOn a lightly floured work surface, (or Silpat®, or parchment paper), roll the dough into a 12 x 14-inch rectangle, ¼ inch thick. If the dough shrinks back when rolled, let it rest for a few minutes, then roll again. Be careful to roll it out to an even thickness, and don’t worry too much about a perfect rectangle—you’ll cut off the corners anyway.\nAlong one long (14-inch) side of the dough make parallel, 4-inch-long cuts that are 1 inch apart (like piano keys), with a pizza cutter or sharp knife. Repeat on the opposite side, making sure to line up these cuts with those you’ve already made on the other side.\nSpoon the cream cheese filling down the center of the rectangle. Leaving 1 inch on the top and bottom unfilled. Sprinkle golden raisins soaked in orange juice on top of the cream cheese filling.\nCut off the first set of strips of dough on both the top and bottom of the rectangle, so you have a top & bottom lip of dough to fold up over the pastry. Begin folding the cut side strips of dough in pairs over the filling at an angle, alternating left, then right, as if you were braiding, until you reach the other end. Trim excess dough leaving enough to tuck the ends underneath the braid.\nTransfer to baking sheet. (If rolled out on parchment paper, it’s easy to slide onto a sheet). Cover. (I used loose plastic wrap covered by a towel). Let rise in warm place until double, about 30 to 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 375º F.\nJust before putting in oven, make an egg wash by mixing egg yolk with 2 teaspoons water and lightly brush over the top of the braid.\nBake on baking sheet for 15 to 25 minutes until golden brown. Check after 15 minutes; it will be starting to brown deeply, so cover with foil, shiny side down, and continue cooking – the top is done before the braid is cooked through. After 5-10 more minutes remove from oven. Let cool 10 minutes.\nPrepare the lemon glaze by mixing powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth. Drizzle glaze over braid.\nNotes: Keep in refrigerator after cooled, for up to 3-4 days. Takes 3 1/2 – 4 hours total prep time, depending on warmth of your kitchen. You may also prepare the recipe up to the point where it’s filled with cream cheese, cover loosely with plastic wrap sprayed with nonstick cooking spray and then refrigerate overnight. The next morning remove from refrigerator and let rise for 45-60 minutes, remove plastic wrap, then bake as usual.\nYields 12 servings.\nPrint this Recipe', ""Do you love creme brûlée, but don’t have the time or patience to make it from scratch?
