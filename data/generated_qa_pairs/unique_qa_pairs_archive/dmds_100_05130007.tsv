1	I'm looking to fly a new aircraft but heard some are tricky to handle when it's windy. What's the recommended top speed for flying a Twin Commander in rough weather?	In light-to-moderate turbulence, Twin Commander aircraft have a maximum speed limit of 180 knots indicated airspeed (IAS), which is clearly marked on the windshield post. When encountering severe turbulence, you must reduce speed even further to maneuvering speed (Va). The lighter the aircraft's weight, the lower this Va speed must be - which can be 40 knots or more below the 180-knot limit. It's crucial to respect these speed limitations to prevent structural damage to the airframe, particularly the empennage which is typically the weakest link.	['After administering about a dozen Twin Commander transition courses and twice as many currency courses in the last two years, I have concluded that the three most important things to consider when moving up from a piston aircraft to a turbine Twin Commander are:\nI subscribe to the adage that “movement is life” and most of the time speed also equates to life, but too much speed can also work against you. Speed (a noun) is a way of measuring how quickly something is moving or being done.\nThe first speed consideration is the engines. Whether your new Twin Commander has the Dash 5 or the Dash 10 version of the TPE-331 engine, it probably turns faster (speed) and produces more horsepower than previous engines you have flown behind. One of the single most critical and necessary items in transition training is learning the proper care and feeding of these great Garrett (Honeywell now, but I’ll use the old-school name) engines.\nThe second speed consideration is airspeed control, which we achieve by applying some operational tips and tricks during all phases of flight. From takeoff to landing, instrument procedures or visual flying, speed control, and therefore time management, is a most important item to be considered when transitioning to a faster turbine Twin Commander. These great airplanes are known for their superior speed, aren’t they? So how do we best manage that greater speed? By first recognizing that faster is not always better.\nThe third speed consideration is about respecting and understanding the structural limitations of this airplane’s design as relates to airspeed. The very reason you are transitioning to a turbine airplane is probably related to wanting more speed. We all want faster, higher, farther, don’t we? The turbine Twin Commander is known as a speed demon, and an efficient one at that. Understanding the “why” as well as the “how” of staying within the structural limits of this great aircraft is a vital and necessary element of transition training to a turbine Twin Commander.\nLet’s look at each of the three speed considerations in more detail.\nSPEED 1: THE ENGINES\nWe start with the speed of the turbine section, which is approximately 41,340 rpm (this is not a typo). The front end of the engine (propeller) only turns at 1590 rpm at 100%. Hence, we have a reduction gearbox ratio of 26:1. That is, while your prop does one revolution, your turbine section just did 26 revolutions per minute. Much of the efficiency of this engine comes from very high rpm (and low torque) in the turbine section that is converted to low rpm (and high torque) and sent to the propeller though a big reduction gearbox.\nMuch has been said and written about starting a Garrett engine, and this is also where pilots used to Pratt turboprops must realize that the Garrett is an animal of a different design. Try not to understand a Garrett engine based on your knowledge of a Pratt. Do a memory dump and start fresh. Piston-engine pilots are easier to train on the Garrett engine than are Pratt pilots.\nA tip about keeping the start normal: temperature is not the only thing you must monitor during a Garrett engine start; you must also monitor the speed, that is, the engine rpm and start time. It typically takes between 20-40 seconds to start a Garrett engine under normal circumstances and temperatures. Monitoring your rpm (speed) during this phase is almost as critical as monitoring temperature. Speed is life in this case—if your rpm ceases to continue to rise, you will more than likely get a hot start. Therefore, your first indication of a potential hot start is not temperature, but speed or rpm.\nDo not rely on hearsay or so-called educated guesswork to operate the Garrett engines. This is not an engine to experiment with; you must know how to properly manage this much speed and horsepower. Only use approved training materials sanctioned by the engine or airframe manufacturer, and experienced and approved training instructors. In other words, slow down and take the time required to learn the engine.\nSPEED 2: AIRSPEED CONTROL\nOne of the most appealing aspects of the turbine Twin Commander is its awesome speed. Often while administering a transition training course, I find myself spending considerable time giving the new Twin Commander pilot instruction on how not to use all this wonderful speed.\nTake VFR pattern work, for example. We typically want to use maximum available horsepower for any takeoff. So, we execute a beautiful takeoff roll, liftoff and climbout, clean the airplane up, and turn downwind to practice our landings. Problem is, we never decreased our power setting and now we are indicating 180-200 kts. This is not a safe airspeed for pattern work. Decreasing your power setting by well over 50% of your takeoff power is a little counterintuitive to most piston-engine pilots, yet that is what you need to do. If, for example, you were indicating 600 hp per engine on takeoff, you would need to reduce to about 300 hp per side upon reaching a safe altitude and entering the traffic pattern.\nAnother example related to speed that seems to be unique to the turbine Twin Commander happens during the landing phase. An interesting aspect of flying the Twin Commander is that there seemingly is an absence of the sensation of speed. The sound and feel of the airplane is much the same at 80 knots as it is at 180 knots. When maneuvering at low altitude and low airspeed, it is very easy to allow the airplane to slow to a stalling speed without realizing you are doing so, or being way too fast and not realizing it. Consequently, the first few landings with a new Twin Commander pilot usually are either too fast or too slow. Most new pilots seem to want to err on what they consider the safe side of the equation, and end up doing the approach and the landing much too fast.\nDuring an instrument approach procedure, speed control is critical. If you start too fast you will more than likely end up too fast. You could overshoot altitudes, bust minimums, and even pass up the airport (I have seen this done), or at least pass up a good portion of the airport (runway behind you) while on rollout. Teaching transition pilots how not to fly an instrument approach (meaning not too fast), is one of the areas we emphasize in transition training for Twin Commanders. Slow down so you can stay ahead of the airplane during an approach and landing.\nSPEED 3: STRUCTURAL LIMITATIONS\nEvery turbine Twin Commander comes with a maximum turbulence-penetration speed. These speeds relate directly to the structural strength of the airframe design, with the empennage usually being the weakest link. Excessive speed is the quickest way to bend or break your new turbine Twin Commander airplane.\nWith most Twin Commander models there is a big 180-kt IAS placard on the windshield post, applicable to flying in light-to-moderate turbulence. This same placard directs you to fly no faster than Va (maneuvering speed) if encountering severe turbulence. Depending on your operating weight this can be 40 kts or more less than the 180-kt limit. Many transition pilots seem to be surprised these airspeeds are so low, considering how fast the Twin Commander can go. The lighter the airplane’s weight, the lower the Va speed. This also seems to be counterintuitive to some transition pilots, who think that the lighter the airplane the faster I can go, right? Wrong! The lighter you are, the slower you must go in any kind of turbulence to keep from bending your airplane.\nThis caution is especially true, and maybe much more so, in the 690A, B and C model Twin Commanders converted to Dash 10T engines. These airplanes still have all the same airspeed limitations as the original design, but now with a Dash 10T engine you have an aircraft that is capable of cruising at FL270 at or very near MMO. While not a concern in and of itself, if you do not slow the airplane down to published turbulence-penetration speeds in turbulence you could exceed the structural limits of the fuselage, empennage or wing, causing major damage, or worse. If you are already cruising close to max speed, or MMO, and you begin a descent without a reduction in engine power first, you will be over MMO is a few seconds. So, reduce power prior to nose-over for a descent.\nTo review, the three most important things about transitioning into a turbine Twin Commander are:\nSpeed 1: Know your engine and manage this great powerplant’s speed and horsepower. Slow down and learn the engine.\nSpeed 2: Faster is not always better. Slow down in the pattern and on an instrument approach. Speed control (usually means slower) is key to a successful flight. Slow down to stay ahead.\nSpeed 3: Respect the airframe design limitations, especially in turbulence and descents from altitude. Slow down to save the airplane and your day.\nMost of all, enjoy your new turbine Twin Commander.\nJ.R.

2	In analyzing cases of people with multiple identities throughout history, how do documented historical cases compare to modern clinical perspectives on the authenticity of such conditions?	Historical cases like Nicolas Savin, who claimed multiple identities (a French soldier and Russian resident), demonstrate how people can enact different identities within specific sociocultural contexts. This parallels modern clinical perspectives on dissociative identity disorder (DID) where both sociocognitive and trauma models agree that identities are 'enacted' but disagree on the mechanism. The sociocognitive perspective suggests these enactments follow 'rule-governed social constructions' while trauma model proponents view them as desperate coping strategies. Both historical and clinical cases show these enacted identities exist within specific cultural frameworks rather than as completely distinct biological entities.	"[""The “Last Veteran” of Napoléon’s 1812 Grande Armée or How a Great Mystery Was Solved\nThe Campaign of 1814: Introduction\nBy Victor Totfalyshin (Russia) and Yves\nToward the end of the 1880s-earlier 1890s, some local history buffs of the town of Saratov (now, a major seaport of the Volga River) noticed that they live, side by side, with an old bloke named Nicolai Andreevich Savin (Russian: Николай Андреевич Савен/Савин) who, to their surprise, was called the last veteran – a grognard – of the once Napoleon’s 1812 mighty Grande Armée. Was that true or too good to be true?\nAccording to his own story, this old man introduced himself everywhere as Jean-Baptiste (or Jean-Baptiste-Nicolas) Savin, of French noble origin and a graduate of the Jesuit College at Tours , who later took part in numerous campaigns of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, including the expedition to Egypt, 1798-1801. As he narrated his story further – being decorated a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor for his bravery at the siege of Saragossa and appointed lieutenant of the 2nd Hussar Regiment (part of Marshal Ney’s 3rd Corps) – Savin was wounded at the Battle of Borodino and taken prisoner at the Berezina’s crossing. Sent to Saratov as POW he, nonetheless, decided – after his release – to settle in this town permanently. So he lived in Saratov for the next 82 years, where he became acquainted with the local elite, including the then Governor, Alexei Panchylidzev (tenure 1808-1826). Unfortunately, according to Savin’s own statement his identity papers got all burned during the 1848 City Hall fire.\nIn 1881, a local writer, Nicolas Khovansky, was one of the first inquiring minds who wrote about this famous inhabitant of Saratov: “Savin is 126 year old now… but he looks very fresh… does reading without glasses, but has hearing problem.”\nPerhaps, this very publication had appeared, somehow, in St.-Petersburg from where it was picked up by Le Petit Parisien. In 1885, the French newspaper informed its public (in an anonymous article, though) of this “patriarch” – “a “Methuselah” who is capable to carry off heavy loads … a 130 years old man who still possesses a very serene memory and good sight but is hearing impartial.”\nThen events slowly started to unfold. On May 1, 1888 Savin received a letter from Lyon, addressed to the “former Grande Armée officer and teacher of a local high school,” sent by certain Hippolyte Delestre who claimed to be his “the most legally bound nephew.” “Please, come to live with us, dear uncle – wrote Delestre – both my wife, children and grandchildren will most certainly embrace you with family care and unconditional love.”\nAt the same time another person took an interest in Savin – the editor-and-chief of the Bratskaya Pomosh’ [Brotherly Help] magazine named Peter Ustimovich – who obtained for him to receive 300 rubles of the Tsar’s pension (1887) and also arranged his first picture to be taken in the local Saratov’s photo shop (1888). In 1889 Ustimovich published an article in his magazine; first, in Russian and then in French. The French version of the article was sent to Paris’ Le Figaro which also included Savin’s home address, but at that time no consequences followed.\nThen the second wave of publicity came about – and at this time, more successfully. The Russian General and professional military historian of the 1812 Russian campaign, Konstantin Voensky (who stayed in Samara on a business trip from 1893 to 1896) wrote a small biographical essay on Savin – narrating in graphic details his life and military adventures – which was published in June’s issue of 1894 the Novoe Vremya [New Era] magazine.\nThis was a breakthrough; the French press responded widely and from 1894 to 1900 published more than a dozen big and small articles which, in turn, produced mass mail sent to the Novoe Vremya editor, the Saratov local police and, of course, directly to Savin himself.\nThe French Le Figaro was most proactive. The newspaper richly cited Savin’s interview which he gave to Voyensky, along with an extended call for help, including a financial support. So, donations poured; it is safe to assume that all the money – one way or another – had reached the old man. The prove of this is found in Savin’s answer, which was published by Le Figaro as well; apparently, Savin asked “[my] good friend, K. Voensky, to write a note of appreciation to all co-countrymen of my dear patrie who still remember the old soldier of Egyptian campaign, the Battle of Austerlitz and the Berezina…”\nThe publicity thus continued. In the summer of 1894, Mr. Pierre Richard, a deputy of the département de la Seine petitioned the Chancellery of the Legion of Honor with a motion where he expressed his desire to see Savin being decorated with the Officer’s Cross of that distinctive award. This was passed over; however, Savin did receive the Médaille de Sainte-Hélène (est. in 1857 to honor participants of the Napoleonic wars, - E.V.) presented to him by the then Saratov’s Governor General, Count Boris Meshersky in late summer 1894. Private letters also poured in; many writers “recognized” in Savin their long disappeared relative. Some collectors wrote, too – they wanted his autograph as a “precious gift of a Napoleonic veteran.” Others asked for his portrait, yet others – a picture for business publications.\nFinally, on October 16, 1894, the French War Ministry sent to the Russian officials a note, in which they were informed of 400 francs annuity awarded to Savin by the French government.\nAt the same time the first shadow of a doubt had appeared, as well. Thus, Finnish Colonel Freiman (who had some family roots in Saratov, as well) performed a private investigation using his connections at the French archives. He revealed his findings to Savin: “a) your name does not appear in the roster of Legion of Honor [as a recipient during the Napoleonic time], and b) there is no documentation, which reflects your service in the 2nd Hussar Regiment of the Grande Armée.” In a polite manner he asked Savin to provide any proof that “would immediately clarify the situation.” Another similar inquiry was sent by the veterans of the Crimean War 1853-55; earlier, in July 1894, the French Embassy in St.-Petersburg sent their official inquiry to Saratov’s officials, as well.\nOn September 20, 1894, the chief of the Saratov Police issued a memo, which read that “Nicolai Andreevich Savin, 126 years of age, a former lieutenant of Napoleon’s army resides, permanently, in Saratov at his daughter’s house... He has a certificate, issued on October 9, 1847 (No. 16362), which identifies him as a Russian subject; another document is a license No. 290, issued on March 27, 1835, which allows him to teach French language in high school… other documents were destroyed by fire…”\nSo where was the truth? So far it appeared that General Voensky, who did a great job on Savin’s publicity, somehow “avoided” – or ignored? – some obvious historical facts at the expense of an idealistic picture he himself drew on Savin’s. Thus, he should have known that the 2nd Hussar Regiment did not take part in 1812 Russian campaign but fought in Spain; there was no Savin name listed in the roster of the officers POWs sent to Saratov (a roster, which Voyensky had an access to). Finally, the Chancellery office of the Legion of Honor did not confirm in Savin’s its recipient (as it should appear in de Lacépède’s 2 vols compendium, which listed all awardees 1804-1814 – E.V.). Many other facts seemed odd, too – especially his date of birth (which was frequently changed from publication to publication); but... once created “heroic” picture honeyed by the improvement of modern French-Russian political and diplomatic relations hooked up the audience.\nSavin died in December 1894 but publicity continued. On December 17, 1894, Le Figaro informed their readers on funeral of “lieutenant Savin, which was paid in full by the Saratov’s municipality.” Next, the French settlers in St.-Petersburg erected – on their own accord and using their own finances – a small monument at the Saratov cemetery and Le Petit Parisien wrote about this event on August 1, 1896. So the “the history became legend; the legend became myth…” and it lived ever since. In 1999, at the place where Savin’s house once stood, the commemorative plaque was inaugurated.\nOnly in 2002, Viktor Totfalyshin, a Russian professor of history at the Saratov University, put further scrutiny to the story, both created and cherished by General Voensky. It appeared right on the spot that the only Hussar regiment under Marshal Ney’s command was the 11th (Holland), which did not list Savin on its rosters and there is no record of Savin’s being wounded at the Battle of Borodino, as well. Further, the list of officers POWs, which was sent to Saratov’s officials on February 15, 1813 does not have his name either.\nSeeing an obvious mystification, Totfalushin performed a diligent research and published his findings, first in the local University’s Press. According to a newly discovered document – a general list of POWs written by the Russian lower scriber – a certain “Nikolai Savin” did, in fact, exist but as a simple NCO of the “24th Jäger Regiment” of Napoleon’s 1812 Grande Armée. After being taken prisoner, he was sent to Khvalynsk (of Saratov’s county); there, in 1813, he swore allegiance to Russia, became middle class, and got married to Praskovya Sergeeva with whom he bore four children (this fact was proven to be true). In 1836 Savin petitioned the Russian government for permission to return back to France, but it was denied, because according to the Russian cannon law of 1826 such permission could be granted only to 1) unmarried POWs, or 2) married but childless POWs. So, Savin was neither.\nNext, Totfalushin found that the Savins moved to Saratov only in 1839 and this information did effectively eliminate the fact him being acquainted with Governor Panchylidzev (as stated above, his tenure was from 1808 to 1826). Additionally, a few pieces of correspondence was found authored by Savin, which indicated his grammarless use of his mother’s tongue and this eliminated another Savin’s claim in General Voyensky’s epic story that Savin once was known as a French tutor. Further, yet another Savin’s claim was dethroned. The Jesuits’ College at Tours – which, again, according to his own story, Savin was a student of – was dissolved in April 1762 by Louis XV, that is, a long before the earliest possible known day of his birth.\nNow, let’s move to Savin’s real identity. What kind of “24th Jäger Regiment” did the Russian scriber have in mind when he composed a roster of the French POWs? Traditionally, the term “Jäger” in the Russian transliteration could represent either French “Chasseur a Cheval” or “Light Infantry” regiments. Mr. Yves Gauthier, the French colleague of Totfalushin’s did check the French War archive. At first, the roster of the 24th Chasseur a Cheval regiment provided no result. But his examination of the 24th Light Infantry Regiment finally paid off. There was, in fact, a certain man named Pierre Felix Savin (regimental roster No. 10429) born on July 13, 1792, in Rouen.\nBut was this the same Savin or his namesake? From the regimental records Gauthier find that Savin volunteered to the Grande Armée on August 26, 1811 and was first assigned to the 2nd Light Infantry Regiment. Next, on January 1, 1812 Savin was transferred to the 24th Light Infantry Regiment – a regiment in which Savin undertook his Russian campaign with. The regimental record indicates that he “was left behind in Russia; presumably dead or taken prisoner. Stricken off the regimental roster on August 11, 1814.” This information was confirmed by examination of the 2nd Light Infantry regimental roster, which revealed additional information of Savin’s mother (Hourdet Savin) and the young soldier’s civil profession – a cabinet-maker .\nSo far so good. But why – or how – did Pierre Felix became Nickolas-Nicolay? This is not entirely clear, so Totfalushin offers some options. It is well known – and this soon became a crucial element in our story – that family ties in Normandy (where Savin was originally from) were so important that relatives often took each others’ names and/or surnames.\nWhen French genealogists examined the Savin registration records back in Rouen, they discovered that Pierre Felix Savin had an older cousin named Nicolas who bore, in August 1801, a son named Jean-Baptiste. It is almost certainly that – when becoming a POW – Pierre Felix did take a name of one of his close cousins and, therefore, we have our character intact. Other pieces from the puzzle – Saratov, marriage, children – finally were all confirmed, as well.\nTherefore, there was no noble, no officer of the 2nd Hussars, no hero of the Austerlitz and the Berizina or a decoration with the Legion of Honor received for bravery at the siege of Saragossa… In fact, there was one of the many young men who dreamt of glory, which made him to volunteer to the Napoléon’s Grande Armée. But… the destiny decided otherwise and instead of a triumph, a 19-years old soldier became POW, after which he dragged a miserable existence for 82 more years in the remote province of the then Russian Empire – and only stories “from the past” and desperate search for notoriety could fulfill his dreams which in reality never came true. He died in the age of 103 and was buried at the Saratov’s local cemetery leaving behind a remembrance, which will remain – even in this “decorative” form – for many years to come.\nPictures courtesy of Totfalyshin's and Gauthier’s collection\n Saratovsky listok, September 30, 1881 issue.\n Le Petit Parisien, April 30, 1885 issue.\n Russian National Library (ОР РНБ, Ф. 152.

First appearing in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) published in 1980, proponents of the disorder have claimed that DID is woefully underdiagnosed, especially among those with a history of sexual trauma, with a true prevalence upwards of 20% across inpatient and outpatient psychiatric settings.1\nBut others have suggested that DID is by definition overdiagnosed because they claim it isn\'t a real disorder.2-4 Instead, they argue, it’s a diagnosis manufactured by those claiming to have it based on a blueprint established in Hollywood with the “based-on-a-true-story” films The Three Faces of Eve (1957) and Sybil (1976). A related charge is that DID is largely “iatrogenic”—that is, a product of a small handful of self-proclaimed experts that have managed to “sell” the disorder to psychotherapists and their patients, similar to how hysteria based on false memories of ritual Satanic abuse in children sprang up in the 1980s and later faded.\nWhy is there so much disagreement over this controversial entity? The main point of contention is that while we’re all familiar with dissociation—the idea that we can have out of body experiences in the face of trauma like sexual assault or can zone out, seemingly unconscious of our surroundings while driving on the freeway—it’s more difficult to fathom the kind of extreme dissociation that’s a defining feature of DID. Indeed, it can seem incredible to those who have never seen or experienced DID that one\'s identity and sense of self can fragment into two or more, or even dozens of, distinct personalities or “alters” with different names, genders, ages, and recollected pasts, each potentially unaware of the other.\nAfter all, we might ask ourselves, ""If multiple personalities go by different names, who it is that gives them those names?"" Just as there’s only one logical answer to that question, skeptics likewise claim that the other characteristics of alters must likewise be manufactured by the individual who purportedly has DID.\nA Sociocognitive Perspective\nHow then can we best understand the undeniable fact that some people do present with the symptoms of DID? There\'s no doubt that such people exist, but in what sense do their dissociative identities exist and if they don’t, does that mean that those who manifest them are “faking it?”\nUniversity of Wisconsin psychiatrist Dr. Charles Raison offers an answer that reflects how many psychiatrists think of DID:\n“There is no doubt that some people behave as if they have multiple personalities. And not all of them have been to therapists who have trained them to interpret their dissociative experiences in this way. Does this mean that dissociative identity disorder exists? In my opinion it depends on what we mean by ""exists."" Yes, dissociative identity disorder exists if by exists we mean there are people who complain of its symptoms and suffer its consequences. Do I think that some people have many biologically distinct entities packed into their heads? No. I think that some people dissociate so badly that either on their own or as a result of therapeutic experiences it becomes the case that the most convincing way for them to see their own experience is as if it is happening to multiple people.”5\nIn 1994—the same year that DSM-IV replaced the term ""multiple personality"" in MPD with ""dissociative identity"" in DID—Carlton University psychologist Nicholas Spanos published an influential paper that similarly characterized MPD through a sociocultural perspective:\n“In short, the sociocognitive perspective suggests that patients learn to construe themselves as possessing multiple selves, learn to present themselves in terms of this construal, and learn to reorganize and elaborate on their personal biography so as to make it congruent with their understanding of what it means to be a multiple.”6\nSpanos chose the word “enactment” to describe how people identifying as having DID follow “rule-governed social constructions” with “multiple identities [that] are established, legitimated, maintained, and altered through social interaction.” People with DID, he wrote, are “actively involved in using available information to create a social impression that is congruent with their perception of situational demands and with the interpersonal goals they are attempting to achieve.”6\nWhile there are many psychiatrists and psychologists who agree that DID is socioculturally constructed as Spanos argues,2-4, 7-8 there are many others—often including clinicians who work with DID and researchers who study it—who dispute the sociocognitive account in favor of a trauma model.9-13 Within this seemingly two-sided debate, there are several legitimate and meaningful points of contention—such as to what extent DID is really iatrogenic or how to best treat it—whose resolution is thwarted when the debate is reduced to arguments about whether DID is “real” or “fake.” In fact, the sociocultural model and the trauma model aren\'t really mutually exclusive—according to a unifying biopsychosocial model, DID can be both a trauma reaction as well as highly shaped by sociocultural factors—and may share some potential overlap.14,15\nWithin the sociocognitive model, “enactment” doesn\'t mean the same thing as ""fabrication"" or “faking it,"" which suggests more of a conscious and deliberate act of deception. If, as Spanos suggests, we instead think of DID as similar to other phenomena including hypnotic suggestion, past-life regression, spirit or demonic possession—to which I would add speaking in tongues, alien abduction experiences, or having imaginary friends as children—we can better appreciate how the enactment of multiple identities might arise consciously, unconsciously, or semi-consciously within the bounds of a certain sociocultural framework.\nIn other words, while asking whether DID exists or not and whether those with DID are faking it or not implies only two possible answers, the reality is something more nuanced and complex. For example, when people are “possessed by a demon” or the “Holy Spirit” during a culturally-sanctioned trance ritual or describe “past lives” during psychotherapy, they’re not simply “making it up” for the sake of making it up or for “attention.” While that could be the case (e.g., it is possible to simulate or “malinger” DID16 just as the woman upon which the movie Sybil was based later admitted to “lying” about her alters17), enacting demonic possession, like enacting DID, instead suggests an experience that involves tapping into something within one’s psyche that draws upon an existing sociocultural framework such as a religious practice, séance, psychotherapy session, or something else.\nWhile none of those examples of cultural ritual imply that anyone is “faking it” or merely ""acting,"" the sociocognitive model does make clear that demons, past lives, or distinct personalities don’t really exist apart from being enactments—or creations—of one’s mind.\nThis perspective isn’t actually very far afield from that of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Richard Kluft, one of the leading proponents of the trauma model and the legitimacy of DID as a “real” mental disorder (see Kluft\'s interesting backstory on the fight to keep DID in DSM-III-R here). For example, Kluft characterizes the personalities or identities of DID as:\n“…behaviorally enacted with noteworthy role-taking and role-playing dimensions and sensitive to intrapsychic, interpersonal, and environmental stimuli… The personalities are not unconscious in the traditional psychoanalytic sense… [and] arise as desperate coping strategies in an overwhelmed child [that] initially have an adaptational and defensive design… The patient forms and auto-hypnotically envisions an illusory embodiment of an identity that could manage the adaptation that is believed to be required. What is envisioned with a great sense of reality is believed to be real, and the mind undergoes a cognitive restructuring that accepts and interprets what is believed to be real as real, and makes it possible to act as if it were real.”1\nSo it is that both Spanos and Kluft use the term “enacted” to account for the multiple identities of DID. The devil of what exactly that means—that is, why and by what mechanism those enactments occur—is in the details, with variability between models as to whether or to what extent such enactments are best understood as volitional fantasies or unconscious creations and whether or to what extent they’re causally linked to trauma.\nIn addition to conceding overlap, another way to resolve these differences is to acknowledge that such diversity not only reflects variations from one from model to another, but also from one culture, social setting, or individual to another. For those with DID, the term ""enactment"" will no doubt resonate with some better than others.\nIn my next post, we’ll take a closer look at how culture, social factors, and individual differences are changing how we think about and understand the concept of “multiplicity” in DID and to what extent this phenomenon is best understood or framed as a mental disorder.\nTo read more:\n► Enacted Identities: Multiplicity, Plurality, and Tulpamancy\n1.

3	What are the transport advantages of the Walvis Bay port for African trade, and what are the main shipping routes and vessel types commonly used in the Indian Ocean for cargo transportation?	Walvis Bay offers advantages as it provides faster, safer, and more economical routes for Zambian and DRC businesses, with direct rail links and a dry port facility. It's closer to European and American markets compared to traditional ports like Dar-as-Salaam and Durban. As for Indian Ocean shipping, it primarily consists of three types: dhows (traditional sailing vessels now equipped with auxiliary engines), dry-cargo carriers (mostly containerized ships), and tankers. The main shipping routes include passages via the Cape of Good Hope, Suez Canal, and Strait of Malacca, with tankers primarily moving from Persian Gulf ports across the northern Indian Ocean.	['The article below was published in the latest edition of the FTW Publication with a focus on Zambia\nWalvis Bay has become a more attractive gateway for Zambian and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) imports and exports since a Zambian dry port facility has become operational within the boundaries of the Walvis Bay port itself, says Africa Union Cargo marketing and sales manager Traolach Moylan.\n“The Africa Union Cargo / Zambia Dry Port represents an opportunity for Zambia to diversify from its traditional dependence on the ports of Dar-as-Salaam and Durban and to make use of a west coast port that is closer to the European and American customers and suppliers,” he says.\n“We feel that the security issues, infrastructure problems and delays in other ports and corridors, Walvis Bay is the by far the best route for all businesses to utilise.\n“It is important to note that, although the facility is referred to as the ‘Zambia Dry Port’, it has the potential to deliver the benefits of route diversity to other central African Countries”.\nThe Zambia Dry Port offers a range of logistics, warehousing and multi-modal transport options.\nThere is a direct rail link into the Zambia Dry Port. “We offer a one-stop service for shipping, road and rail transport.\n“The focus is on handling import and export cargo mainly for landlocked countries around the Trans-Caprivi Corridor (Zambia, southern DRC, Western Zimbabwe, Namibia and parts of southern Angola).\n“We have concentrated on forming strong relationships with the Walvis Bay Corridor Group, Namport, Haut Katanga Regional Government and both the Namibian and Zambian Governments to promote the Walvis Bay – Ndola – Lubumbashi corridor as the fastest, safest, most practical and economical route for Zambian and Southern DRC businesses to utilise.\n“We also work hand in hand with the Zambian Ambassador in Windhoek, Namibia, the High Commissioner Stella Libongani, in the promotion of this route and port,” he says.\nIncreased demand for the facilities and services being offered by the Zambia Dry Port in the port of Walvis Bay has been met with ongoing investment in the facility, according to Africa Union Cargo marketing and sales manager Traolach Moylan.\n“We have a very positive outlook for the future trends of cargo growth.\n“Namport’s huge investment in the development of the new container facility in Walvis Bay Port, and TransNamib’s focus on the rail network are creating tremendous opportunities for the region.\n“It is critical that all local and international businesses work together and recognise the importance of the Walvis Bay port and corridors leading from it,” he says.\nAfrica Union Cargo holds the concession for the development and operation of the dry port facility.\n“We have fully developed Phase 1 of the Zambia Dry Port. Currently we are in the final stages of Phase 2 on our depot that will triple our operational space in the Zambia Dry Port with a final operational bonded warehouse of 30 000 square metres.\n“We expect the work to be finished by the end of this year, when it will be fully operational,” he says. The investment in the dry port has been spurred by the upgrading of the port of Walvis Bay and supporting infrastructure.\n“We see growing demand for products in landlocked and bordering countries, specifically in Zambia and the DRC. The supporting logistics infrastructure is critical to the success of the corridor and the Zambia Dry Port,” he says.\nAfrica Union Cargo is working with transporters and shippers to attract return loads along the corridor and so to reduce the costs that an empty leg adds. “We are working on several forums to assist with building return load volumes in order to make Walvis Bay more attractive to our clients than other ports. “While we will always be in competition with the ports on the eastern seaboard, our data shows that, even for east-bound cargo, Walvis Bay offers a more cost-effective option thanks to more frequent calls by the major shipping lines, our superior port facilities, and better and safer infrastructure,” he says.\nAfrican Union Cargo has entered into a joint venture partnership with Shanghai-based Jiangsu Golden Coast to open up direct market links with China for importers and exporters in the region.\nThe joint venture, Sino-Africa Union International Trading, will introduce Chinese buyers of commodities such as timber, dimension stone and copper to suppliers in Namibia, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), says Africa Union Cargo marketing and sales manager Traolach Moylan.\n“In return we can offer a port to port service with our joint venture partners for much-needed imported commodities in Namibia, Zambia and Southern DRC.\n“It is our goal to boost trading that will further increase cargo transport and further grow Walvis Bay as a cargo hub to the SADC and central African regions.\n“Our JV partners will be joining us in our new headquarters in Walvis Bay,” he says.', 'Indian OceanArticle Free Pass\n- Physiography and geology\n- Economic aspects\n- Study and exploration\nTrade and transportation\nThe economic development of the littoral countries since the mid-20th century has been uneven, following attainment of independence by most states. The formation of regional trade blocs led to an increase in sea trade and the development of new products. Most Indian Ocean states have continued to export raw materials and import manufactured goods produced elsewhere, with a few exceptions like Australia, India, and South Africa. Petroleum dominates commerce, as the Indian Ocean has come to be an important throughway for transport of crude oil to Europe, North America, and East Asia. Other major commodities include iron, coal, rubber, and tea. Iron ore from Western Australia and from India and South Africa is shipped to Japan, while coal is exported to the United Kingdom from Australia via the Indian Ocean. Processed seafood has emerged as a major export item from the littoral states. In addition, tourism has grown in importance on many of the islands.\nShipping in the Indian Ocean can be divided into three components: dhows, dry-cargo carriers, and tankers. For more than two millennia the small, lateen-rigged sailing vessels called dhows were predominant. The dhow trade was particularly important in the western Indian Ocean, where these vessels could take advantage of the monsoon winds; a great variety of products were transported between ports on the coast of East Africa and ports on the Arabian Peninsula and on the west coast of India (notably Mumbai, Mangalore, and Surat). Most dhow traffic has been supplanted by larger, powered ships and by land transport, and the remaining dhows have been equipped with auxiliary engines.\nMuch of the Indian Ocean’s dry-cargo shipping is now containerized. Most container ships enter and exit the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope, the Suez Canal and Red Sea, and the Strait of Malacca. South Africa and India have their own merchant fleets, but most of the other littoral states have only a few merchant vessels and depend on the ships of other countries to carry their cargoes. Most other dry cargo is transported by bulk carriers, mainly those used to carry iron ore from India, southern Africa, and western Australia to Japan and Europe. An important route from western Australia is via the Sunda Strait and the South China Sea to Japan. Major ports of the Indian Ocean include Durban (S.Af.), Maputo (Mozam.), and Djibouti (Djib.) along the African coast; Aden (Yemen) on the Arabian Peninsula; Karachi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata on the Indian subcontinent and Colombo in Sri Lanka; and Melbourne, Port Adelaide Enfield, and Port Hedland in Australia.\nTanker traffic moves primarily from ports in the Persian Gulf across the northern Indian Ocean to the Strait of Malacca and from the Persian Gulf south along the coast of Africa and around the Cape of Good Hope. The route via the Suez Canal has become far less important as the size of tankers has surpassed the canal’s capacity; the size of these tankers, however, compensates for the longer distances now required to move oil from the Persian Gulf to Europe. The largest tankers must now use the Lombok Strait through the Lesser Sunda Islands to carry oil to Japan, since their drafts are too great for the route through the Malacca and Singapore straits.\nEnvironmental impact of human activity\nEuropean colonial exploitation of Indian Ocean resources resulted in the first clear evidence of the degradation of both the terrestrial and oceanic environments. Deforestation, cultivation, and guano mining have had undesirable effects on terrestrial ecosystems. Guano mining, which removed vegetation and scraped the land surface, has caused the destruction of much native flora and fauna, and hunting and the introduction of exotic species have altered the ecological balance that previously existed. Man-made threats to the oceanic environment are of more recent origin. One is the quantity of domestic and industrial waste that has accumulated in nearshore waters as a result of increased urbanization and industrialization along the coast. This has been most evident in India, which is the most populous country of the region. Another is the concern caused by the transport of large quantities of crude oil across the ocean and its adjacent semienclosed seas. Oil spills from normal tanker operations and occasional large-scale tanker catastrophes have had deleterious effects on phytoplankton and zooplankton, both necessary parts of the food chain of commercial fisheries. The East African coast, the Arabian Sea, and the approaches to the Strait of Malacca are areas in which the threat of oil pollution and major phytoplankton productivity coincide.\nStudy and exploration\nThere is evidence that the Egyptians explored the Indian Ocean as early as about 2300 bc, when they sent maritime expeditions to the “land of Punt,” which was somewhere on the Somali coast. The expeditions, which may have begun even earlier—perhaps about 2900 bc, were numerous until about 2200 bc. Egyptian annals make no mention of journeys to Punt during the period 2200–2100 bc, but they began again in the 11th dynasty (2081–1938 bc), and records mention them continuously until the 20th dynasty (1190–1075 bc).\nEarly trade in the northwestern Indian Ocean was aided by an irrigation canal (navigable in high water) through the Isthmus of Suez that was built by the Egyptians during the 12th dynasty (1938–c. 1756 bc) and operated almost continuously until it was filled in ad 775. Early seafarers made good use of their knowledge of the monsoons and their associated currents; Arab sailors in their lateen-rigged dhows traded along the East African coast as far south as Sofala (present-day Nova Sofala, Mozam.) and north into the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. The writings of medieval Arab and Persian pilots from the 9th to the 15th century include detailed sailing instructions and information on navigation, winds, currents, coasts, islands, and ports from Sofala to China. It was on an Indian trading vessel that the Russian voyager Afanasy Nikitin reached India in 1469. Vasco da Gama, sailing around Africa in 1497, signed on an Arabian pilot at Malindi before he crossed the Indian Ocean to reach the western shores of India.\nThe Dutch, English, and French followed the Portuguese to the Indian Ocean. In 1521 the Spanish navigator Juan Sebastián del Cano crossed the central part of the ocean, continuing the first voyage of circumnavigation of the globe after the death of the original commander, Ferdinand Magellan, in the Philippine Islands. The Dutch navigator Abel Tasman, pursuing voyages of discovery in the eastern Indian Ocean from 1642 to 1644, explored the northern coast of Australia and discovered the island of Tasmania. The southern waters of the Indian Ocean were explored by James Cook in 1772. Beginning in 1806 the Indian Ocean was crossed repeatedly by Russian ships commanded by Adam Johann Krusenstern, Otto von Kotzebue, and others.\nBetween 1819 and 1821 the expedition of the Russian explorer Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen that circumnavigated Antarctica penetrated the Indian Ocean south of the 60th parallel. A number of important voyages to Antarctica followed in the 19th and early 20th centuries, led by the explorers Charles Wilkes (American), Jules-Sébastien-César Dumont d’Urville and Jean-Baptiste-Étienne-Auguste Charcot (French), James Clark Ross (Scottish), and others.\nDo you know anything more about this topic that you’d like to share?']	['<urn:uuid:188e185d-6c47-49c7-b1ed-592afdbf99fb>', '<urn:uuid:7fb9026d-89c8-490b-86f4-9787510e31d1>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	32	100	2029
4	As a UX researcher studying evaluation methods what is meant by wireframe prototyping and what are its potential drawbacks in heuristic assessment	A wireframe is a simple visual mockup of an interface using basic shapes, without design elements like colors, fonts or images. It's used to communicate layout ideas in early project stages. While wireframes are useful for early business approval, they can be problematic in heuristic evaluation since evaluators may be biased by their personal experiences and may overlook issues that are important to end users. Additionally, heuristic evaluation of wireframes might not be comprehensive enough as it tends to focus too much on design principles while missing issues relevant to actual users.	['A wireframe is a visual representation or a mockup of an interface using only simple shapes. They’re void of any design elements such as colors, fonts or images and they’re used to communicate ideas and represent the layout of a website in the early stages of a project.\nThey are usually done before the design phase commencement to get the business approval on the structure of the design itself.\nIt is important that:\n- Elements on the page have a good aspect ratio for the content they contain.\n- The white-space should give elements room to breathe, and should never be so large that connected elements get lost.\n- If the more than one header is shown, the headers adding relevant information should be large, whilst others should be either small (e.g. where the header is mostly implied by the content) or omitted (where the header is completely implied by the content).\n- Vertical space is used wisely.\n- As a rule of thumb, multi-line text and headers that repeat down the page should be left justified. Lone lines can be centered. With tabular data and forms, the left column can be right justified.\n- To Avoid:\n- Extraneous lines & ‘chartjunk’\n- Unnecessarily repeated elements on the same page.\n- Inconsistent layout choices.\n- Information of minimal relevance to common tasks.\nBlockchain is an example of a distributed public ledger; that is, a shared record system for transactions. It’s been described as “a technology that allows people who don’t know each other to trust a shared record of events”.\nThe idea is that every party involved in a particular type of transaction holds a copy of the entire ledger; there are no centralized databases. Anyone can enter a transaction onto the system, and at regular intervals these transactions are batched together into “blocks.” The blocks are then formed into “chains” (hence the name) using cryptographic technology that provides high levels of security. The chronological chain of transactional information is created in such a way that each block that is added protects the information in the previous one.\nSource: A beginner’s guide to blockchain by Gemalto\nUsability Evaluation assesses the extent to which an interactive system is easy and pleasant to use.\n- Formative evaluation: when conducted early on in the design process with low fidelity prototypes – this evaluation required the designer to collect the data (e.g. time to complete the task, clicks, etc…).\n- Summative evaluation: when conducted with high fidelity prototypes or a near final interface – this evaluation might produce data on how the user interacted with the system (e.g. log data)\n- Low fidelity prototypes require testing in a controlled environment (e.g. a lab)\n- High Fidelity prototype can be tested in the wild (e.g. the user’s phone or a kiosk)\nWe will be able to ascertain if the design is efficient by evaluating various task completion measures. These include time to completion of the task, number of clicks, or number of errors while performing a task.\nNotice that we can infer learnability and memorability by using some of the same measures I just mentioned.\nLearnability refers to how easy it is to complete a task successfully. We can get an objective measure of this by looking at the data for number of clicks to complete a task, or amount of time to complete a task, and then compare these to expert performance.\nWe can measure amount of time or number of clicks to complete a task over repeated trials to get a measure of memorability.\nWe also need to have indicators of the subjective user satisfaction while executing the task.\nThese can be both cognitive or emotional aspects of the task completion. We are going to refer to cognitive measures as those that relate to the mental effort it required to complete the task. For example, were the steps required to complete the task intuitive?\nHere’s a sample of the kind of data matrix you might collect after a usability session. This is not exhaustive. It’s just an example.\nIt’s important to remember that the usability measures we just discussed must be considered in relation to either the values rate using the status quo interface, right, the current practices of the user.\nOr if were designing a completely new interaction, we can compare the user’s values to some other objective measures of success. For example, the values that are obtained when the design team, you might consider these people experts, use a novel design.\nAdvance evaluation techniques are:\n- Heuristic Evaluation\n- Cognitive walk trough\nOnce the evaluation data is collected and analyzed, the designer is in a position to iterate on the design. This may lead to another round of alternative designs. It might lead to prototype building and more evaluation. When do you stop? Well, one rule of thumb is that you stop when you have met your design objectives. And this translates to an evaluation cycle that shows that the user can interact with your design in an effortless and enjoyable manner.\nTo learn more, check on:\nUsability Evaluation 101 by Usability.Gov\nInteraction Design – Chapter 15 – Usability Evaluation.\nWQUsability – More than Easy to use.\nUsability 101 – Introduction to Usability – by Nielsen Norman Group\n“Teenagers who like to sleep in late need an easy way to eat breakfast on the go because they don’t have time to eat breakfast before leaving their home and yet breakfast is the most important meal of the day.”\nFirst list as many ideas cross your mind\n- Healthy smoothie hold the backpack/car/scooter/etc… drinking holder.\n- Breakfast bars that attached to the phone arm holder.\n- Frozen nutty fruits licorice sticks to be consumed on the go.\n- Yogurt easily resealable with a stick attached.\n- Granola in a top zip bag easy mixer.\nThen, remove any physical constraint limiting the flow of ideas.\nEliminating a constraint\nThe teens consume breakfast by themselves at home.\n- Mini muffin sandwiches in a top zip bag for easy sharing.\n- Mini sharer plate for bus/car consumption (with friends).\n- Music food-box container with the latest hits for impromptu parties.\n- Friends-sharing application for a healthy lifestyle (exercise counts, calories counts, track of eating habit).\n- VR Breakfast Go app.\nThen, make an association with any event related to the target audience.\nMake an analogy\nIf eating breakfast on the go was like having a fun party.\n- Bright colorful breakfast food and drinks.\n- Carillon type food boxes.\n- Friends having breakfast together at each home on rotation.\n- Friends bringing breakfast food to share.\n- Theme breakfast parties on the go.\nThen, go for the maximum.\nTeenagers need to eat 10 apples every morning for breakfast to be healthy\n- Large apple juice made of 10 apples.\n- An apple pie to be eaten daily.\n- 10 apple/peanut butters sandwiches.\n- A 10 apples waist holder for an easy eat on a go.\n- A waist that includes holders for: a.

Sharing breakfast with friends should improve the overall experience.\nBreakfast bars that attached to the phone arm holder – because it uses the unexplored and hidden functionality of an existing gadget.\nMost Sustainable idea\nFrozen nutty fruits licorice sticks to be consumed on the go – no waste produced, all are eatable pieces.\nOther prototyping techniques that do not fit into the definition of High or Low fidelity categories are:\n- Wizard of Oz technique: Used to model/mimic functionality of a product by having a human perform the task usually performed by the computer. The user is unaware that the product is not functional. Usually the “wizard” sits in a back room, observes the user’s actions, and simulates the system’s responses in real-time. For input device testing the “wizard” will typically watch live video feeds from cameras trained on the participant’s hand(s), and simulate the effects of the observed manipulations. Often users are unaware (until after the experiment) that the system was not real.\n- Saves time and money when compared to building a functional system.\n- Setting the stage time.\n- Required multiple well trained people\n- The user might then have unrealistic expectations.\nProof of Concept Video Technique: fictional video that shows a “working system” in a variety of scenarios.\nMetaphor Technique: is meant to help the user build a relevant mental model of how a new design functions. The metaphor communicates the functionality of the novel design compared to systems that the user already knows and is familiar with.\nLow Fidelity Prototypes include:\nSketching – is a free-hand depiction of images related to the final design.\nStoryboards – are common way to provide a narrative putting the design into context. It provides an opportunity to see how the user will engage with a given scenario. The below storyboard is from RuoCheng.me.\nCard-Based prototype – allows us to see at the sequence of iterations the user might have with the designed interface.\nUsability.com/Prototyping – includes an excellent graph by Tracy Lepore visually showing the evolution from sketch to design.\nLo-Fi vs. Hi-Fi Prototyping: how real does the real thing have to be? by Florian N.

What’s a designer to do? You can either choose the heuristics that are most suited for your project or you can create custom heuristics from all the available heuristics. The most popular heuristics are the Nielsen, Ben Shneiderman’s Eight Golden Rules, and Gerhardt-Powals’ Cognitive Engineering Principles.\nNielsen heuristics were developed by Jakob Nielsen of the Nielsen Norman Group in 1994. These usability heuristics are the most commonly used in UI design because they focus on creating a simple and seamless experience for users. Nielsen emphasizes on the visibility of system status so that users are always aware of what is happening through the use of progress bars and timers. These heuristics also call for error prevention instead of focusing on the creation of error messages. Minimalism is a core principle of Nielsen heuristics with a focus on uniformity, simplicity, flexibility, and user control. A severity rating is used to detriment how usability problems should be prioritized. Nielsen heuristics are most useful when testing the usability of specific elements of a design.\nBen Shneiderman’s eight golden rules of interface design promote the heuristics of consistency, shortcuts for super users, continuous feedback, and clear dialogue that guides users. These heuristics also advocate for a simple way of handling errors and a forgiving system that allows users to undo or redo their actions. Shneiderman’s heuristics require that users have a strong sense of control and that there is no cognitive overload. Just like Nielsen’s heuristics, Shneiderman’s heuristics are well suited for testing individual components.\nGerhardt-Powals’ Cognitive Engineering Principles are useful in evaluating usability problems holistically by looking at how a system interacts with users. The heuristics highlight the importance of reducing the cognitive load of users and presenting information clearly to reduce uncertainty which causes errors and time-wasting. New information should be presented using a language that users understand and naming should be done according to function. When grouping data Gerhardt-Powals advises doing it logically and consistently while only displaying useful data. These heuristics are useful when testing the high-level usability and how information flows in a system.\nPros of Heuristic Evaluation\nHeuristic evaluation is preferred to user testing because of how accessible it is. It is easy for companies to use their in-house staff as usability experts to pinpoint usability issues in a prototype or wireframe. Heuristics analysis is also easy to set up and implement because it doesn’t involve many players.\nHere are the benefits of heuristic evaluation:\nHeuristic evaluations can be done by in house UX/UI designers who test a design as expert users. Employees from other departments can be novice users and if a company does not have any in-house experts they can hire one or two external usability experts. This makes the process inexpensive because a company does not have to pay the cost of user testing.\nHeuristic evaluation can be set up and completed very fast as compared to other usability testing methods.\nCan be deployed early in the design process\nHeuristic evaluation can be done as soon as the prototype is out because of its quick and inexpensive nature. This improves the design process as obvious usability issues are caught and dealt with early.\nHas few ethical problems\nThere are few ethical issues when doing heuristic evaluation because usability testing is done in a virtual environment. When using other methods such as user testing ethical issues with test subjects can come up.\nFocusing and eye-opening experience\nThe processes of setting up the heuristic analysis and choosing the usability principles that will be used to test the system help in understanding how the overall system works and how different components work together.\nIt’s a technically sound process\nHeuristic analysis is done by experts who have a deep understanding of the common usability issues and can pinpoint errors such as the use of jargon instead of plain language or the users’ language.\nCons of Heuristic Evaluation\nEven though heuristic evaluation is a great way of inspecting design usability it has disadvantages with the main one being bias from the usability experts. Moreover, if the wrong heuristics are chosen, the whole process will be doomed even before it begins.\nHere are the cons of heuristic evaluation:\nCan be biased\nHeuristic evaluations are based on the observations and opinions of evaluators who can be biased because of their personal experiences, attitudes, and inclinations. Moreover, when in-house experts are used, they may be unable to give an objective review of their creation. This means that some of the usability issues raised might not help users.\nDoes not involve end users\nUsability testing that does not involve end-user research is incomplete. Expert users have a high efficiency of use and might overlook some issues that might be important to novice end users. These testers might also not run into unwanted states because of their level of knowledge.\nIt might be difficult to get qualified experts\nIt is not enough for those who do heuristic evaluations to be user experience experts, they should also have a deep understanding of the problem that the design wants to solve. If the right expert can not be found, then the entire process might be wasted because it might not reflect the opinions of end users.\nThe wrong heuristics might be selected\nIf the wrong heuristics are selected or an important heuristic is not selected, the whole process might be doomed from the start regardless of how qualified the experts are.\nIt is not comprehensive\nHeuristic evaluation cannot unearth all the usability issues that a design has. It might focus too much on design principles or assume that users will use the design in a logical order and leave out issues that are important to the end user.\nHow to Conduct a Heuristic Evaluation\nThe process of carrying out a heuristic evaluation is the same regardless of the industry or nature of the design project. The first phase is the planning phase where the heuristic evaluation process is mapped out. The second phase is the executing phase where the actual heuristic evaluation takes place. Finally, the reviewing phase examines the results of the evaluation and recommends a plan of action.\nThe first step in the planning phase is to define the heuristics that are going to be used during the evaluation. These heuristics should be chosen carefully based on market research, previous user testing, and the principles of careful design. Next, the evaluators should be selected. The best evaluators are those that have industry knowledge and usability expertise, Aim for at least two evaluators to create diversity, reduce the effect of biases, and catch more usability problems.\nDuring the evaluation, the first step is briefing the evaluators so that they understand the heuristics that are going to be used and how the system functions. The evaluators will then interact with the system so that they can understand it and how it works. Next, the evaluators will evaluate the system based on the pre-determined heuristics and how separate components work with the whole system. They will note any usability problems that they find and it is also good practice to record the sessions.\nHere, the evaluators will present their findings and you will collate their findings into one master document. Afterward, the evaluators should list concrete steps that can be used to improve the usability issues that they found and how the design process can be improved. The evaluators should explain their use of the system experience and if they found any error-prone conditions in the system.']	['<urn:uuid:43731ef2-9289-4ffa-b2b0-12d42fe110d4>', '<urn:uuid:28814588-5662-495e-b5a3-0ff953a8074f>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	22	92	3027
5	As a quality control specialist, I'm concerned about error prevention in aircraft assembly. How many points typically need to be tightened down in a subassembly at Airbus, and what's the potential cost impact of errors?	A typical subassembly at Airbus has 400,000 points that need to be tightened down, requiring over 1,100 basic tightening tools. Having even a single location being tightened down incorrectly could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.	['The Airbus platform for the “Factory of the Future” uses smart tools for real-time collaboration on manufacturing.\nName of Organization: Airbus\nLocation: Blagnac, France\nBusiness Opportunity or Challenge Encountered:\nDesigning, building and monitoring aircraft is a demanding task, requiring tight integration of people, processes and technology. The price of failure is too high for errors or mistakes in the production process. To meet these challenges, Airbus, a European consortium producing the Airbus family of passenger aircraft, a corporate jet, the Beluga supertransport and a military transport, is moving toward a vision of the “Factory of the Future,” which employs real-time integration of various production components.\nThe challenge for Airbus is to upgrade and update manufacturing processes where manual operations are still predominant. Manufacturing and assembly of aircraft, which involve tens of thousands of steps that must be followed by operators, and a single mistake in the process could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to fix, making the room for error very small. A typical subassembly may have 400,000 points that need to be tightened down, which requires over 1,100 basic tightening tools. Having even a single location being tightened down incorrectly could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n“Millions of people every year place their trust in airbus aircraft to safely travel around the world,” says Bernard Dupuis, head of manufacturing technology research at Airbus. “That requires assembly of heavy large components. But most of these processes are still manually intensive. Our ‘Factory of the Future’ is a research project aimed to employ emerging technology address this challenging requirement to increase quality and productivity and industry evolution on all programs“\nHow This Business Opportunity or Challenge Was Met:\nA vital component of Airbus’ Factory of the Future is to provide real-time views of its production processes. To address this need, the company has been developing a range of smart tools in conjunction with smart glasses to provide real-time streaming video to production operators.\nInformation sent to and from these headsets is integrated with various production systems. Advanced image-processing techniques help operators to track tools, and enable them to display real-time status of processes on operators’ screens.\n“If everything is okay we can go to the next step,” says Dupuis. “If there is a process that is failing, we are able at task that process immediately.”\nAirbus is developing three smart tool families for different manufacturing processes: drilling, measuring, and quality data logging and tightening. Adding such intelligence to the tools and shop-floor systems will help to simplify the production process and provide improved efficiency by managing and checking the tasks the operator is completing. Using the National Instruments (NI) System on Module, the Airbus manufacturing leaders were able to quickly prototype smart tools using NI’s approach to system design.\nThis approach to Airbus’s Factory of the Future vision – employing Internet of Things technologies along with smart machines and wearable devices — is helping to bring its systems together, as well as coordinate and share data.\nCore to this effort is a platform approach that promotes greater linking, as well as sharing of projects and data across the enterprise.\n“When we are integrating a project, we have issues regarding communication, regarding reuse,” explains Sébastien Boria, R&D technology leader for Airbus. “Thus, we are defining that new architecture based on software and hardware, and sharing of algorithms.”\nAirbus’ Factory of the Future platform makes extensive use of commercial off-the-shelf modules. Another key component for improving efficiency in the Factory of the Future is smarter tools. These smart devices are designed to communicate with a main infrastructure or locally with operators or other tools, but only when it is required provide situational awareness and make real-time decisions based on local and distributed intelligence in the network.\nMeasurable/Quantifiable and “Soft” Benefits:\nAirbus’ Factory of the Future platform lets operators and machines collaborate in the same physical environment.\n“The Factory of the Future requires innovative thinking, and novel approaches to our production process,” says Dupuis “We believe cyber physical systems and data analytics are key technology elements to bring this vision into reality.”\nThe smart tools are helping to simplify the production process and improve efficiency by removing physical data logs and manuals. Operators must focus on their operational tasks, during which they need to keep their hands free for using the appropriate tools. Most of the previous initiatives linked to “paperless projects” were focused on “paper suppression,” or replacing paper with tablets, but they still consumed “passive/dead data.” Smart tools enable another alternative” “data in context” or live data, which is generated and consumed continuously.\nBy adding intelligence to the system, the smart tools understand the actions that the operator must perform next and automatically adjust the tools to the proper settings, which simplifies the task for the operator. Once the action is completed, the smart tools can also monitor and log the results of the action, which improves the efficiency of the production process. A smart tightening tool understands which task the operator is about to perform using vision to process its surroundings and automatically set the torque. The device can record the outcome of the task in a central database to ensure the location was set properly. With the central manufacturing execution system database and the distributed intelligence of the devices, production managers can precisely pinpoint the procedures and processes that need to be reviewed during quality control and certification.\n“All of these devices and systems that make up factory of the future must be integrated as a co-existing system of systems,” says Dupuis. “In this next phase, we are addressing handheld smart tools so we can automatically control processes.” The team has also launched an Airbus software development kit to help disseminate the technology across its many manufacturing sites.\n(Sources: National Instruments, Industrial Internet Consortium)\nWant more?

6	How old are the walls of Carcassonne?	The defensive walls of Carcassonne date back to late antiquity, with the initial construction occurring in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries. The original Roman wall was approximately 1,200 meters long. The current fortifications, which largely follow the Roman defensive line, extend over 3 kilometers and consist of two lines of walls and a castle. The Roman walls, still visible over two-thirds of their length, were characterized by horseshoe-shaped bastions and masonry made of rubble cores faced with dressed ashlars and courses of bricks.	['France’s fabled Riviera is a wondrous place – the time-honoured playground of...\nDiscover the Fortified City of Carcassonne…\nThe historic city of Carcassonne is an excellent example of a medieval fortified town whose massive defences were constructed on walls dating from late antiquity. It is of exceptional significance by virtue of the restoration work carried out in the second half of the 19th century by Viollet-le-Duc, which had a profound influence on subsequent developments in conservation principles and practice.\nSince the pre-Roman period, a fortified settlement has existed on the hill where Carcassonne now stands. The earliest known occupation of the site dates from the 6th century BC, when a protohistoric hill fort (oppidum ) was built on this rocky spur overlooking the valley of the Aude and the ancient routes linking the Atlantic with the Mediterranean and the Iberian peninsula with the rest of Europe. In the 1st century BC, this settlement, Carcaso Volcarum Tectosagum, became the Latin Colonia Iulia Carcaso in 27 BC. During the turbulent years of the late 3rd and early 4th centuries, it was protected by the construction of a defensive wall some 1,200 m long. The fortifications, consisting of two lines of walls and a castle, which is itself surrounded by fortifications, extend over a total length of 3 km. Their line largely follows that of the Roman defences, and these are clearly visible over two-thirds of the total length. The Roman walls were strengthened by horseshoe-shaped bastions at roughly regular intervals. The masonry is in characteristic late Roman style: rubble cores faced with courses of dressed ashlars intersected by courses of bricks and built on concrete foundations. The Porte Narbonnaise on the eastern side and the Porte de l’Aude on the west are particularly elaborate defensive works.\nIt came under Visigothic rule in the 5th century and resisted repeated attempts by the Franks to capture it. The Arabs were more successful in 724, but were driven out in 759, after a siege led by Pepin the Short. The Visigothic period saw the creation of a bishopric at Carcassonne, some time in the 6th century. It is probably that a cathedral was built here, on the site of the present Romanesque cathedral, on which work began in June 1096.\nThe 12th-century count’s castle was built over the western part of the Roman walls; it was surrounded by a rectangular fortified enclosure in 1226. By the end of the 13th century the town had assumed its definitive appearance as a medieval fortress. A local revolt in 1262 caused the king to expel most of the inhabitants. He allowed them to settle on the other side of the river, where the new town that they set up was itself fortified in 1347.\nThe main body of the cathedral, dedicated to St Nazaire and St Celse, consists of a central six-bayed nave with an interrupted barrel vault and two narrow side-aisles rising to almost the same height and fully vaulted. The transverse arches of the barrel vaulting spring alternately from square columns surrounded by embedded columns and round pillars. The original Romanesque choir was replaced in the later 13th century by an imposing High Gothic structure. This is a large transept with a six-sided apse at its eastern end. It is at variance with the practice in the High Gothic cathedrals of northern France, where the choir itself was stressed; accenting the transept is more in keeping with a Romanesque tradition, which here is gothicized. Its exterior, like that of most southern French Gothic churches, has no flying buttresses, stability being assured by means of the interior vaulting. It contains some important sculpture, notably the 13th-century tomb of Bishop Radulph. The stained glass in the windows of the apse and the transept is of exceptionally high quality. Three periods can be distinguished: late 13th century, early 14th century and 16th century.\nCarcassonne is also of exceptional importance because of the lengthy restoration campaign undertaken in the latter half of the 19th century by Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, one of the founders of the modern science of conservation.

7	non overlapping magisteria gould dawkins different views science religion relationship	Dawkins strongly disagrees with Gould's concept of 'non-overlapping magisteria' where religion and science belong to separate domains. Dawkins argues that questions about God's existence should be considered strictly scientific questions, as they are inherently connected to cosmological queries about the origins of human life and universe. Unlike predecessors like Huxley, Russell and Gould who identified as agnostics, Dawkins advocates for outright atheism and argues against the idea that such a position is dogmatic due to lack of empirical evidence.	"[""Contrary to the mainstream religious belief, incredulity and skepticism regarding the ultimate nature of truth, existence of God and eschatological claims of scripture is not an entirely modern phenomenon. In his famous thought experiment Hayy Ibn Yaqzan, Ibn Tufayl the famous Muslim philosopher of 12th century Spain, aesthetically described discovery of God as the “joy without lapse, unending bliss, infinite rapture and delight” and inability to find Him as “infinite torture”. The curious and always speculative protagonist of the fable remains incessantly engaged between cosmological antinomies such as those put forward by contests between classical Greek eternalism and scriptural creationism; or the ones related to human origins such as spontaneous generation (understandably so, considering the scientific milieu of 12th century) or simple creationism as proposed by orthodox religion.\nIbn Tufayl’s classic as well as other such theologically flavored thought experiments of pre-modern period, for instance Avicenna’s “Floating Man”, can be characteristically distinguished from modernist discourse in three important ways: their peculiar guarded speculative approach towards theology, the careful selection of premises mostly leading towards theistic conclusions and most importantly aesthetics of literary exposition.\nThere were of course exceptions raising more formal agnostic queries regarding nature of God, for example the physician Zakariya Razi and Avicenna himself; however these undertakings, even though penned by intellectuals who were primarily scientists did not go as far as to purport an outright rejection of faith. In modern times, the western philosophical tradition having roots in enlightenment, especially Kant and Hume, provided basis for a scientific endeavor that gave rise to more formal and popular agnosticism – and indirectly atheism – whose main proponents were among logicians, paleontologists and physicists whose writings while popularizing science as it was never done before in the history of scientific culture, also extended the domain of science to purely philosophical realms including metaphysics, ethics and theology. Yet, the religion was never presented so antagonistically in opposition to reason as it is done so remarkably by Richard Dawkins in God Delusion.\nBased upon extreme scientific naturalism, Dawkins’ thesis casts the proposition that atheism is a natural consequence of human evolution. All kind of religious faith, being impossible to be vindicated empirically, is necessarily dissonant with reason. Religion, as interpreted by Dawkins, is at the the root of much that is going wrong in the world. Moreover, the idea of God in human consciousness can be explained away as a naturally evolved impulse to believe in an omniscient and omnipotent entity, an indulgence which is byproduct of “something useful” or simply speaking an error in the grand evolutionary process.\nUnlike some of his predecessors, for instance Thomas Huxley, Bertrand Russell and Stephen. J. Gould, who chose to describe themselves as agnostics rather than atheists, Dawkins does not accept the idea that outright atheism is simply dogmatic due to its unwarranted metaphysical claims about the non-existence of God without enough empirical evidence. Therefore, religion and science does not belong to two “non-overlapping magisteria” – a term coined by Gould – limited to their respective domains. Consequently, any question or claim related to existence of God should be strictly considered a scientific question; simply, because it cannot circumvent other cosmological queries concerning origins of human life and universe.\nThe approach of Dawkins is rightly expressed as militant atheism by many intellectuals as he is in favor of dismantling all practical religion and every procedure that facilitates or establishes basis for its survival. As explained succinctly by Karen Armstrong in her new book The Case for God, the approach taken by Dawkins has a peculiar reductionist tendency which is remarkably similar to religious extremists as each considers the other as the “epitome of evil”. In both discourses, oversimplifications and gross generalizations necessitate wrong premises, ultimately bringing out the absolute worst of the other; no wonder therefore, why Dawkins invoke the likes of Ibn Warraq and Christopher Hitchens to argue that a tolerant and respectable view of religion is equally reprehensible for all the wrongs committed by religious extremists. Indeed, the superficiality of logical analysis in such discourses does not demand intellectually laborious critique as similarities are not hard to draw.\nThe nature of God, as understood by Dawkins to present his case against religion, is vulgarly anthropomorphic. The reader is almost duped into believing that all theists, irrespective of the particular creed they ascribe to, believe in some kind of spirit out there; a kind of superhuman entity which Dawkins pejoratively equates with Russell’s ‘Cosmic Teapot’ or ‘Flying Spaghetti Monster’. The idea of universal symbolism towards some transcendent ineffable entity beyond the capacity of vocation of language seems alien to Dawkins’ naturalist preoccupancy. The religious belief, therefore, as he vociferously advocates, is something stupid, naive and incapable to be hold by an intelligent and unbiased rational being.\nDue to his proclivity towards oversimplification in matters metaphysical, Dawkins seems to advertently disregard the inherent ineradicability of unknowing in the nature of acquired religious truth. He does not acknowledge the fact that no theist claims explicitly that he is in possession of the ultimate sacred truth, except the reductionism loving religious extremists. The scripture itself closes the door on such kind of claim by contending that “there is nothing like the likeness of Him“. All we have are symbols pointing towards the nature of ultimate truth concerning God and sundry eschatological issues.\nProbably due to his aphilosophical bent, Dawkins is apparently unable to comprehend that for a theist, there is beauty in this astonishment; a sense of awe that tends to make him humbly aware regarding the degree of obscurity of his own self in the macrocosm. But he would at least agree that science, no matter how much it achieves in reducing complexity that surrounds us, also shares this sense of awe with religion as it also had to consistently rely on an act of faith.\nOn this particular note, conjuring probability model to disregard the so-called God hypothesis is outrageously strange. Dawkins’ conclusion that “God almost certainly does not exist” cannot be philosophically taken as a knowledge producing utterance unless ‘probability’ is taken as synonymous for ‘truth’; a subtle yet important point, that was profoundly framed by Karl Popper in his Logic of Scientific Discovery:\n…we must not look upon science as a ‘body of knowledge’, but rather as a ‘system of hypothesis’; that is to say, as a system of guesses or anticipation which in principle cannot be justified but with which we work as long as they stand up to tests, and of which we are never justified in saying that we know that they are ‘true’ or ‘more or less certain’ or even ‘probable'”.\nBecause of strict evolutionary perspective that he sets up for himself, it was incumbent for Dawkins to give some kind of Darwinian origins to morality. Ultimately entailing the biological evolution of human intellect, this is perhaps the crassest assertion of the book; amounting to claim that our ancestors were less capable or probably less intellectually equipped to be objective in apprehending the ultimate reality. As Iqbal mentions in his second lecture on nature of religious experience, any such view regarding intellect being a product of evolution would “bring science into conflict with its own objective principle of investigation”. To find an appropriate expression of this conflict, he quotes Wildon Carr:\nIf intellect is a product of evolution the whole mechanistic concept of the nature and origin of life is absurd, and the principle that science has adopted must clearly be revised […] How can the intellect, a mode of apprehending reality, be itself an evolution of something which only exists as an abstraction of that mode of apprehending, which is the intellect? If intellect is an evolution of life, then the concept of the life which can evolve intellect as a particular mode of apprehending reality must be the concept of a more concrete activity than that of any abstract mechanical movement which the intellect can present to itself by analyzing its apprehended content.\nDawkins wishes to portray the book as a consciousness raiser of sorts: regarding atheism being more reasonable than agnosticism, religion being the root of all evil, religious education being equal to child abuse, religion and morality being completely uncorrelated and atheism being an objective conclusion not to be ashamed of rather the only rational position one can possibly hold with a sense of pride. I think some of the aims were partially achieved, especially raising the atheist pride by providing a kind of polemicist manual to hold tightly.\nBut perhaps the real strength of the book lies in questioning the innermost religious convictions of the people who are equally awed by the respective magisteria of religion and science and want to bridge gaps. Regarding the kind of evidence that would convince him regarding the existence of God, Bertrand Russell once replied that if a voice from the sky would reveal to him each and every thing that is going to happen in next few hours and that would eventually happen also, he may consider the possibility of existence of God. I sincerely doubt that even in the face of such evidence, Richard Dawkins would even come close in considering the truthfulness of God hypothesis. To borrow the quip that he himself quotes in the book, he does not merely believe in non-existence of God, he knows.""]"	['<urn:uuid:db402283-bc89-44fc-9da8-22bf13ea18b5>']	open-ended	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	10	79	1553
8	best time catch northern pike location shallow water temperature	Northern pike are best caught in early summer just after ice-out when they concentrate in shallow bays waiting to ambush prey. During this time, water temperatures are cooler (below 58°F) and pike can be found in sluggish streams and shallow, weedy places along prominent bars and structural elements. Later in the season as temperatures warm, pike disperse into deeper or flowing water looking for larger forage.	"['Pike like to eat. Therefore they spend most of their time on major food-gathering areas, which for the most part means a major structure like a bar (shoal). Sunken islands are bars, too, and points, of course, may be portions of bars. In a reservoir with large creek arms, pike key on bars in a creek arm. In flowing rivers, they hold on or near bars within river lakes, backwaters, or side channels. And in lakes or reservoirs without major creek arms, the best spots tend to be combination areas with bars, points near bays, or small creek arms.\nThe larger and more prominent the structure, or better yet, combination of structures, the more likely these areas are to consistently attract forage that consistently attract pike. One big structural element I fished at least five times on trips to a remote lake in Manitoba lies within a big bay off the main lake. This one-acre sunken island rises from 45 to 10 feet of water. A 25-foot-deep saddle connects the island to shore. The top of the island offers lots of rocks and a few weeds. The weeds, however, aren’t important to this structure.\nThe combination of the saddle and hump protruding halfway across the bay, like a long arm, gathers wandering baitfish and pike. Six of the eight big pike I’ve caught here (18 to 23 pounds) were using the drop-off breakline on the saddle side of the island. Two fish were in the saddle.\nWhile Ice fishing pike, I never have seen a distinctive saddle portion of any major structural element not attract the most pike, even when the outside or sharp-dropping portion of the island looks good, too. Saddles are that important. If the saddle weren’t present, the deep edge of the bar would have been more important.\nProminent structural elements gather pike. West Okoboji is a deep clear body of water out of place in the landscape. It’s one of North America’s most intensely used bodies of water, rivaling Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, and Lake Minnetonka, Minnesota. The number and average size of the pike is reduced compared to my Manitoba hot spot, but the structural story’s the same. Major structural elements attract the pike. With many such elements to fish, two bars that block the entrance of two major bays, Smith’s Bay and Emerson’s Bay, consistently draw fish. The pike move along weededges, rock edges, and drop-off edges on the inside and outside of the bars.\nStructural Variety—After considering the prominence of a structural element, consider its structural variety. Weedgrowth attracts forage. So does rock-rubble and other rock combinations. Weeds and rock in combination with sand transitions in shallow water draw pike shallow during portions of the winter season. But when pike drop deep, as they often do during midwinter, rock-rubble drop-off edges and especially deep rock humps near shallow cover usually are where they hold.\nPike suspend in some lakes. But most suspend relative to prominent structural elements. Don’t worry about those that don’t, because I know of no consistent way to find them. Worry, though, about pike movement based on the portion of the winter season. Think shallow, deep, and deep and shallow during early-, mid-, and late-ice.\nEarly-ice, think shallow—Early-ice usually means good fishing. Some pike are deep because some forage is deep. But at early-ice, most pike—many of them large—have settled into a routine centered around prominent shallow foraging areas.\nShallow at early-ice means plankton, which means zooplankton, which means small fish, which means larger fish. As the season progresses and the ice thickens, light penetration decreases along with water temperature. Shallow is no longer so inviting or advantageous.\nAnother reason pike tend to be shallow early is because for months they haven’t been bothered by fishermen or boat traffic. Activity on open water or on ice makes a difference. Pike and other fish populations drift deeper as the season progresses. Deeper water means stability to carry fish through midwinter. But lack of fishing pressure and activity on the ice lengthens the time pike stay shallow. Pressure hastens the retreat to deeper water. By midseason, only seldom-fished lakes have many large pike holding shallow.\nEarly in the season, concentrate on shallow edges on or along prominent bars. Again, bars include sunken islands. The outside or deep side of the weededge usually is the key. Increase the odds of contacting pike by fishing pockets (inside turns) and points in the edge. Weedless pockets in weedgrowth on top of bars, sometimes well away from a drop-off edge or the outside edges of a weedline, also attract pike.\nThink combinations. Points or turns in bars or weedlines that coincide with rock bottom and drop-offs attract pike. Look for points that drop off in stairstep fashion as opposed to points that crash immediately into deep water. The best weededges don’t grow to the edge of a sharp drop-off, but have a clear holding-ramp kind of area before the drop-off. Timber, by the way, may replace weeds as a primary source of attractive shallow cover. And don’t forget current areas early, although their productivity declines quickly and doesn’t pick up again until late-ice.\nMidseason, think deep—Pike fishing often turns difficult. Look for deeper rocks and generally forget weededges. Look for rocky drop-offs or rock humps near shallow holding areas. Isolated midlake humps may be worth fishing if obvious areas are being pressured. Pike fishermen who don’t fish deeper rocky structural elements usually catch smaller pike. Another option is a trip to a remote lake where the pike haven’t been bothered, which is the reason we sometimes travel to Manitoba.\nI’ve jigged pike from 55 feet (fishing for walleyes), by the way, and caught them on tip-ups set 50 feet deep (fishing for pike). Agreed, however, that in most prime lakes, most bigger pike come from 15 to 35 feet of water during midwinter. Granted, too, depth is relative. Twelve feet is relatively deep in a body of water where weedgrowth ends at 6 feet and maximum depth is 25 feet.\nLate season, think shallow and deep—In lakes where the pike season runs until ice-out, look for bigger pike to gradually abandon deep water and roam shallow again as ice-out approaches. Deeper weededges on sections of bars adjacent to shallow spawning bays are good spots. Check weedgrowth near current, too. It’s one of the best times of year to catch a huge pike.\nA prominent structural element like a bar with a variety of habitat including points that drop off into deep water are the primary key to pike location during winter. Prominent bars gather baitfish and pike, and combination habitat holds them.\nLarge bays also gather traveling baitfish and pike. If there’s enough deep water and enough combination habitat, pike may use a bay all winter. The biggest pike tend to use bays during early and late season, however, and prefer main-lake habitat during midwinter.\nFeeder Creek A—Current attracts pike at early-ice and late-ice. Concentrate on the weed breaks at the mouth of the creek.\nBay B—Good depth leading into this bay. Big pike likely use the weededge all winter. Primarily a first-ice and late-ice spot, however, for during midwinter, larger pike tend to move to main-lake areas.\nBar C—Combinations here include weeds, rock, and sand on a bar that protrudes into the lake, plus rocky points that drop into deep water. Structural combinations plus the combinations of Bay B near Bar C make this area potentially one of the most consistent pike producers in the lake.\nBar D—Should hold pike all season. Plenty of weededges, rock edges, rock drop-offs, plus two rocky sunken islands for midwinter pike use. Anglers could spend the entire season exploring the options on this bar.\nBar E—Another good one, but without the total combinations of Bay B, Bar C, or Bar D. Worth fishing only if better areas are pressured by other anglers.\nBay F—Because of its size and depth, this bay could be considered a separate lake. During early season, fish the inside corner near the outlet and the weed point. Try the saddle between the weed point and the sunken island, and the sunken island during midwinter. Or try the weededge in the not-so-prominent inside turn on the north shore.\nIsland G—Too small and isolated to hold many pike, but worth checking during midwinter when prominent lake areas get lots of fishing pressure. The key is fishing it before anyone else catches the few (but likely large) pike holding there.\nIsland H—Same as Island G. However, Island H is a more traveled area. Pike holding near Creek A or in Bay B, for example, could move to Island H as winter progresses.', 'The Northwest Territories has a relatively dry, cold climate, with long winters and warm summers drenched in sunlight. Temperatures can range from highs of +30°C (85°F) in summer to - 40°C (-40°F) in winter.\nSouth of the Arctic Circle, during the summer months, the sun rises early in the morning and sets late at night with 21 1/2 hours of daylight on June 21, north of the Arctic Circle, the sun does not set below the horizon in summer. This is truly the Land of the Midnight Sun.\nOn the water – for the most part the bugs leave you alone. During June and the first part of July the mosquito’s are at their height. The mosquito’s thin out after July 15. Black flies are not too bad, but they can be annoying. Black fly season is later in the year from later August to mid September. Sunrise and sunset and after or before a rain are the most active times.\nFortunately if you’re on the water bugs aren’t an issue. On land, during certain times in the summer, they can be formidable, but with appropriate insect repellant or a good bug hat or jacket your trip will be enjoyable. Horse and deer flies are out during mid summer when the temperature is at it warmest and the wind is calm.\nBring good deep woods bug repellant and a bug jacket or bug hat for those hikes in the woods. We have plenty of bug hats for those evenings you want to take a hike in the back woods for those fabulous pictures of the Lodge.\nPrimary Sport fish\nArctic Grayling – the sailfish of the north! Most beautiful of all northern species. These fish are elusive in the summer but can be caught with spring and fly fishing gear through out the fishing season. They are best fished in spring just after ice out.\nNorthern Pike – the most exciting fish to catch. Pike are found in sluggish streams and shallow, weedy places in lakes, as well as in cold, clear, rocky waters. The pike generally hides in wait for prey, holding perfectly still for long periods, and is then capable of remarkable acceleration, sometimes propelling it a metre into the air (though it rarely leaves the surface).\nLake Trout – the most abundant sport fish in the lake. Lake trout is not a trout but is actually is classified as a char, the lodge record weighing almost 47 lbs. The lake trout is a slow growing fish; it is also very late to mature. Lakers as they are commonly called can be caught trolling, spin fishing or jigging. Lake trout are dependent on cold, oxygen-rich waters. Lakers can be found spawning in the channel between the two lakes in late August to late September.\nLake Whitefish – hard to catch but can be seen jumping in the evening. The reclusive lake whitefish prefers to swim in the company of a school of fellow whitefish in the gloomy, cool water at depths of up to 200 feet and deeper as summer’s heat climbs, the main reason it requires extra skill to catch one.\nWalleye – easy to catch and simple orange and yellow rubber tail 3/8 oz jigs is all you need. These fish are a fisherman\'s favourite but they are only caught in Johnston and Barker lakes, only a 10 min air charter flight from the lodge. These fish are available in depths of 5 to 10 feet and like dark tea stained warmer water. Walleye can be found in the inlet streams as well as rocky points. Pike are found in the same areas as the walleye and you are assured to catch pike when jigging.\nSecondary Bait fish\nBurbot – generally caught in the winter through the ice. The burbot is often maligned as being too ugly to be worth an angler\'s time, however, hidden by its mottled green camouflage is a valuable food and recreational fish.\nCisco – common bait fish in the lake. They usually run in schools and it is common to see balls of these bait fish on the depth finder. When you see bait balls get ready for some great lake trout action.\nWhite Sucker – usually found in the stream or on sandy bottom, forage fish for pike. Suckers are soft-rayed fishes that possess a toothless, protractile mouth with distinctive thick lips. The white sucker is a bottom feeding fish and spends most of their time in shallow, warm waters. In bays, estuaries and tributary rivers, both species make their homes in holes and areas around waterfalls or other underwater obstructions.\nIf you are between the ages of 16 and 65, you must carry an NWT fishing license with you every time you go fishing. Licenses are available at the lodge.\nWe have an abundance of fish on both Graham and Duncan lakes. Our guests regularly reel in Northern Pike up to 50 inches, Grayling up to 22 inches and Lake Trout in the 40 lbs range.\nNorthern Pike are best caught in the early summer just after ice out and the spawn has been completed. You will often find them in the shallow bays waiting in ambush for their prey. This is the best time as you can hunt for the big ones and watch the aggressive pike smash the top water lures at every opportunity. Pike are a lot of fun for the fly fisher persons as the pike will generally “stalk” their prey and take a streamer that is fished on top of the water. Later in the year they disburse into deeper or flowing water looking for larger forage such as suckers and grayling. The pike are less concentrated but still can be caught in the shallow bays on sunny days. We have two rivers and several outpost lakes that we fish for the pike. Spend a day catching these fish and you will be amazed how fast the day goes by. Expect to catch lots and big ones too!\nThe average weight for a Lake Trout in early summer in the 5 to 7 pound range, with many caught in the 10 lb to 20 lb range. In the fall the lake trout fishing gets even better with the average lake trout caught is about 2 lbs heavier than in the early summer. The current Lodge record is 47 inches or 40+ lbs caught and released in June 2016. In September, you may even catch a glimpse of spawning trout after dark in the channel between the 2 lakes. You will see hundreds of spawning pairs so thick that you could almost walk across their backs. It is fun to take a flashlight or under a full moon watch these fish as they go through there reproduction phase.\nThe average Walleye caught in Johnston and Barker lakes is about 3 lbs, however these fish can grow as large as 10 lbs. These fish are best caught about 2 to 3 weeks after ice has cleared from the lake. You will probaly expereince the best walleye fishing in June and September with catches of over 100 fish for each angler commonly reported.\nArctic Grayling is the other popular sport fish in the lake. Often found in the McRae River and the Braden-Davis channel at the Lodge these fish will rise to a fly or pursuer a small spinner. Grayling are found on the lakes in rocky areas and are pound for pound the fiercest fighting fish in the lake. Use ultra light spinning gear or fly fishing gear to catch these beautiful sailfish of the North. Early summer is the best time to catch these fish, but you can catch these fish all summer long.\nIt is common to for a person experience daily catches of 20 to 30 trout per person. Top that off with another 20 pike and a 6 grayling you will have a fine day of fishing at Yellow Dog Lodge. You can also try for the Grand slam of 4 species. Top that off with a bonus of a whitefish and you now have 5 species you can catch at our lodge.\nWe’re happy to take you for shore lunch but we encourage catch and release. Let them go and let them grow. You will have even more fun catching them again next year when they are bigger.\nEach angler that visited us seemed to have there own preferences and all seemed to do equally well. The local fishermen regularly use a bait harness for catching lake trout. Using 7 inch frozen cisco seemed to be typical. A variety of large spoons and plugs were also used.\nEarly season to mid summer the Lake Trout can be caught right off or decks or docks, and are abundant throughout the lakes. Catches of 20 to 30 fish per day per person are common. Lake Trout are sensitive to weather, sunlight and temperature. Bring your favorite lures with you or we would be happy to supply you with what you need. When the water temperature warms to 60F the trout will go deeper and jigs and buzz bombs are the best lures, however trout will eat a cisco trolled, use a 1 oz or 4 oz slip weight to get the bait down deeper. When the water temperature drops below 58F the trout run shallower. Late August and September is when you will get the largest size. You can see hundreds of them in the channel between the 2 lakes. They are hungry and will eat just about anything.\nNorthern Pike are best fished in the early summer when they are concentrated in the shallows, when you can see them and the weeds have not yet grown to the surface. There is nothing more exciting when you can see a “40+ inch torpedo” heading for your lure. Once summer heats up the pike are more dispersed and can be caught in deeper water. Pike fight like heck and when aggressive will actually jump out of the water to strike a lure and tail walk across the surface. We have seen tackle if left unattended go overboard with a pike on the end dragging the rod through the weeds.\nWalleye are best fished with jigs and twister tail baits. Natural minnows work ine with walley rigs. Small sinking or suspending rapellas trolled slow with work when trying to find the fish. Fish for them on rocky points, sunmerged reef and inlet streams. More often than naught, pike are intermixed with walleys and you may need a wire or heavy mono leader to keep from loosing your bait.\nDon’t forget the fly-fishing opportunities as Arctic Grayling are readily available in the area, actually right off the dock beside the lodge! These grayling are beautiful and fun to catch. They are very powerful for their size and can be caught on small spinners on and flies. If you are not careful you can hook into a pike feeding on the grayling. Then you are in for a treat, pike on light tackle with no leader!\nFor more information please download the PDF.\nNote: Restrictions of weight apply; no more than 50 lbs or 20 kgs per person is allowed on the charter aircraft.

Temperature and wind conditions can vary greatly so “be prepared” and bring good quality warm clothing and protection from the insects and sun.\nPlease download the PDF for a complete check list of recomended items to bring.\nPosted by Gord Gin December 15, 2016:\nWe are open for private guest functions during the winters. Please book well ahead to resurve your winter excursion. We also offer the best Aurora viewing in the NWT from August 15 to Sept 30. Escape the City of Yellowknife and away from the ambient lights of the city to our Wilderness lodge.\nOur expected summer season start date is: June 1, 2017 That date is depandant on the spring ice breakup allowing us to access the lodge via float plane. If the ice breakup is not an issue, we will open June 8, 2017.\nBears can be dangerous but if you follow some guidelines, you can stay safe.\n- Let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return.\n- Hike in a group, and keep children close at hand.\n- Make your presence known (call out)or sing\n- Hike during daylight hours & stay on the trail.\n- Watch for bear signs: scat, claw marks, diggings, logs or stumps torn apart, etc.\n- Do not leave food or garbage out in the open.\nBlack Bear Encounters\nBlack bears should always be considered unpredictable and potentially dangerous. A black bear will usually detect your presence and flee the area before you notice unless the bear has been conditioned to people and their foods.\nIf a black bear is visible, but not close, alter your route so that you will move away from its area.\nIf a black bear approaches, do not run. Remain calm, continue facing the bear and slowly back away. If the bear continues to approach, try to group together and pick up small children. Try to scare the bear away by shouting and acting aggressively.\nIf a black bear attacks, it is suggested to fight back using everything in your power fists, sticks, rocks.\nThe aurora borealis is also called the northern lights since it is only visible from the Northern Hemisphere. The aurora borealis is visible at the lodge from mid August to October and from January to April. The amount of sunlight available that time of year is diminished so you may watch the magical light show that nature provides. The Aurora is like the weather, the Aurora is a result of space weather.\nTypically the aurora appears either as a diffuse glow or as ""curtains"" that approximately extend in the east-west direction. At some times, they form ""quiet arcs""; at others (""active aurora""), they evolve and change constantly. Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each lined up with the local direction of the magnetic field lines, suggesting that aurora is shaped by the earth\'s magnetic field. Indeed, satellites show aurora electrons to be guided by magnetic field lines, spiraling around them while moving earthwards.\nAurora appears when electrons and protons, flying through space from the sun on the solar winds, penetrate the earth\'s magnetic field at its weakest points -- the North and South Pole. These electrons and protons collide with oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the Earth\'s atmosphere, producing the Northern Lights. The different concentrations of gases present in the atmosphere will cause the aurora to change color. The most common color is green which indicates a high concentration of molecular oxygen. In rare cases the aurora may seem blue and violet; in this case the molecular nitrogen levels are elevated.\nBring you camera with a good solid tripod and catch the lights as they become more visible in late August. One way to view them is from our hot tub. On a clear night you can hear the sounds of the trout jumping and the water rippling in the background while you gaze up at the stars.\nSome other links for you are:']"	['<urn:uuid:d280cf15-cafe-4a5b-ba48-e339781d20ea>', '<urn:uuid:c417ceab-5971-4a7f-97ce-4fa0f1417cad>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	9	66	4147
9	Why should you avoid riding your brakes downhill?	Riding your brakes when descending can cause them to overheat and fail. You should slow down and shift into a lower gear instead.	['Lay of the Land\nThroughout the Rockies, roads wind in and out of valleys and ascend high mountain passes, where weather can be unpredictable even in summer. An example is Independence Pass, which reaches an elevation of 12,095 feet. Connecting Aspen with the Arkansas Valley, Colorado Highway 82 crosses the Sawatch Range at this point, taking you through the White River National Forest. Mountain roads are not like city freeways, as they a lot of wear and tear from the climate and environmental factors. They commonly twist and turn, take you up and down steep grades and close to sheer drop-offs, making it imperative to stay alert.\nTips for Driving Mountain Passes\nTake care when driving in the mountains! By following some simple rules, you can stay safe.\n- Let faster traffic pass you\nWhen you are moving slowly up steep grades or on winding roads and you find traffic is backing up behind you, pull over and let the other cars pass. You don’t have to go faster than you feel comfortable. It’s common courtesy and keeps you from traveling too fast.\n- Slow down for those sharp curves\nKeep your speed down when you are driving mountain roads. When you aren’t used to all those sharp curves, and going too fast, your car can drift too far towards the centerline or near the edge of a cliff.\n- Don’t ride your brakes (and perhaps have them fail as a result)\nWhen you begin to descend after crossing a mountain pass, slow down and shift into a lower gear. Riding your brakes can overheat them and cause them to fail. Speeds can also get out of hand otherwise.\n- Pull over if you feel altitude sickness coming on\nAltitude sickness manifests with dizziness or lightheadedness. Symptoms can sometimes get severe. When you cross a mountain pass, the air gets thin and you may experience a lack of oxygen. Pull over and take slow, deep breaths until you adapt. Then you can continue driving.\nTips for Driving on Snow\nSnowy conditions can occur in the mountains even in the summer months. Be ready for it!\n- Always check conditions before you start out\nPrior to driving over a mountain pass at any time of year, check the conditions of the road and have a second route ready in case the pass is blocked, closed or has inclement weather.\n- Keep your speed down\nAlways be aware that the faster you’re driving, the more difficult it is to control your car on an icy or snow-covered road. Adjust your speed for the conditions, and take it easy!\n- Leave a lot of space between you and the car ahead\nStay well behind the car in front of you. You don’t want to have to slam on your brakes suddenly on a snow-covered road or if ice is present. Never tailgate.\n- Take chains\nAt higher elevations, conditions can change rapidly, so always have your chains with you.\n- Be prepared for any eventuality\nCarry emergency equipment in your trunk, like jumper cables, a spare tire, flashlight, flares – and yes, don’t forget an ice scraper. It would be a good idea to also have a blanket or two and some food and water. Make sure your car has plenty of gas.']	['<urn:uuid:1764f157-3167-4423-9734-7b46563f8a99>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	8	23	550
10	What archaeological evidence suggests there was significant cultural transition in the area where the Huaca Pucllana pyramid stands?	The Huaca Pucllana pyramid shows evidence of cultural transition through archaeological findings. While it was initially built by the Lima culture, which flourished between 200 AD and 700 AD, archaeologists have discovered a tomb with human remains and artifacts from the later Wari culture, which was present in the area between 500 and 900 AD.	['Best Places to Visit in Lima\nAt first glance, Lima seems endlessly stretching from the sea to the hills, a sprawling metropolis nothing like the tourist image of brightly dressed Andean villagers posing with their camels in front of towering peaks. But a closer look reveals that this gigantic city, home to about a third of Peru’s population, has its own attractions that are as fascinating and colorful as the interior landscape you draw.\nSo take time to explore this vibrant city, visit its outstanding museums, and set the historical and cultural scene for what you’ll see elsewhere in Peru. Admire its colonial architecture, beautifully punctuated by intricately carved wooden balconies and Baroque-style décor.\nDine with the locals at some of South America’s best restaurants, wander through expansive green parks, and relax in Lima’s bustling seaside suburbs. Founded in 1535 under Francisco Pizarro, you’ll understand why the Spanish conquistadors called Lima the “king of the city”.\nFollow our list of the Best Places to Visit in Lima to find the fascinating places to visit in this exciting city.\n10 Best Places to Visit in Lima\nLet’s explore the top 10 Most Beautiful and Best Places to Visit in Lima:\n1. Plaza de Armas\nAlso known as the Plaza Mayor, this wide square is Lima’s historic center and the most logical starting point for sightseeing. Much of the original city was lost in the 1746 earthquake – the only original structure in Lima’s Plaza de Armas is the bronze fountain in the center, built in 1651.\nIts buildings were rebuilt after the earthquake and are today a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Besides the cathedral, the square is surrounded by the Archbishop’s Palace, the Casa del Oidor, and the Palacio del Gobierno, the presidential residence built by José San Martín on July 28, 1821, when Peru declared independence. You can see the Changing of the Guard here at noon on weekdays, and it has always been a popular attraction for tourists.\nFrom Plaza de Armas to Plaza San Martin, the pedestrian-only Jiron de la Union is a mix of old and new, with restaurants and shops. Here you will find La Merced Church, which was completed in the late 1700s and has an ornate Baroque Colonial façade.\nOne of the oldest and best preserved colonial mansions in South America, Casa de Aliaga dates back to the city’s early days. It has been run by the Aliaga family for 17 generations since 1535, making it the oldest single family owned and resident in South America. The colonial-style cottages are from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries and are open for guided tours by prior reservation.\n2. Convento de San Francisco\nThe San Francisco church and monastery are famous for its catacombs where the bones of about 10,000 people were buried when it was the first cemetery in Lima. Below the church is a labyrinth of narrow aisles lined with bones on both sides.\nIn one area, a large circular hole is filled with bones and skulls arranged in a geometric pattern like a work of art. If the ritual were to be held high, the sound would echo eerily in the catacombs.\nVisiting them is not suitable for the claustrophobic as the ceilings are low and the doors between rooms are even lower and require people to take shelter when entering. But the catacombs are at the end of the church tour, so you can skip them.\nThere is so much more to see here. The upstairs library holds thousands of old books, and the cloister houses an impressive collection of religious art. He is best known for his Last Supper fresco, which shows the apostles eating guinea pigs and a demon standing next to Judas.\nConsecrated in 1673, the San Francisco Church and Convent is one of the best preserved colonial churches in the city, having withstood the earthquakes of 1687 and 1746, although it was badly damaged in the 1970 earthquake.\nAddress: Jiron Lampa y Ancash, Lima\nOfficial website: http://museocatacumbas.com/\n3. Magic Water Tour in Park of the Reserve\nThe Magic Water Tour opened in Conservation Park in 2007 and attracted 2 million visitors in one year. It holds the record for the largest fountain complex in the world with its 13 separate fountains.\nThe largest, Fuente Mágica, draws more than 80 meters of water, while the Fuente Túnel de las Sorpresas (Tunnel of Surprises) is a 35-metre length, walkable water tunnel. In Fuente de la Fantasia you can see lasers and painting shows, jets synchronized with music.\nAddress: Madre de Dios, Lima\n4. Parque del Amor (Park of Love)\nYou won’t find a more romantic place to watch the sunset than the Parque del Amor (Love Park) on the Miraflores Malecón. Mosaic designs, consisting of small tiles covering undulating walls, are often compared to the designs created by Antoni Gaudí for Park Guell in Barcelona, Spain.\nThe poems of Peruvian poets, including Abelardo Sanchez León and Augusto Tamayo Vargas, were mosaiced. The trail winds up from the top of the flower-covered cliff and leads to El Beso (The Kiss), a large sculpture of an embracing couple by Peruvian sculptor Victor Delfín, in the center of the park.\nParque del Amor is open every evening until 23:00.\nLocated on the sea cliffs south of central Lima, Miraflores is a neighborhood of modern glass and steel commercial buildings, some beautiful old colonial houses, and plenty of green space. Here you will find stylish shops and restaurants serving the “new Peruvian” cuisine that has caught the world’s attention in the culinary world.\nBeautiful parks and green spaces stretch along the cliff top overlooking the water, and sail blades can often be seen drifting off the cliff above surfers in the waves below. Expect slightly higher prices in this wealthier neighborhood.\nBesides browsing the shops and tasting new Peruvian dishes, you’ll find plenty to do here. Those interested in pre-Columbian culture should visit the Amano Museum to see a chronological collection of Peruvian ceramics and textiles.\nPre-Columbian cultures including the Chimu and Nazca are well represented, while the Amano Museum is known for its outstanding textile collection from the lesser-known Chancai culture of the north coast. Tours must be booked in advance.\nAddress: Retiro 160, Miraflores\n6. Museo de la Nacion (National Museum)\nThe largest museum in Lima, the National Museum is the best place to explore ancient Peruvian history and learn about Peruvian culture. The museum covers the entire archaeological history of Peru, from its first inhabitants to the Inca Empire.\nCeramics and textile exhibits and scale models of archaeological sites such as Machu Picchu and the Nazca Lines are arranged in chronological order, showing the progression from one culture to the next. Most impressive is the replica of Lord Sipan’s tomb, the first Moche mummy found at Vacara Jada in Sipan, Peru. Most screens are marked and explained in Spanish and English.\nAddress: Av. Javier Prado Este 2465, San Borja\n7. Larco Museum\nSouth of central Lima in Pueblo Libre is the Rafael Larco Herrera Museum, commonly known as the Larco Museum. This 18th-century governor’s mansion was built on the site of a 7th-century pre-Columbian pyramid.\nThe Larco Museum houses more than 40,000 Peruvian pottery, most of which come from the Moche and Chimu cultures. Not all of these are displayed at the same time. It’s also a collection of fine gold work, along with some textiles, stonework and metalwork, that make it one of Lima’s most popular attractions.\nAddress: Av. Bolivar 1515, Pueblo Libre, Lima\nOfficial website: www.museolarco.org\n8. Santo Domingo\nBuilt in 1540 on land given to Dominican Priest Vicente Valverde by Francisco Pizarro, Santo Domingo church and monastery is one of the oldest, most historic churches in Lima. Here you will find the remains of the Holy Rosary of Lima; San Juan Marcias; and San Martin de Pores, America’s first black saint.\nThe Saint Rose statue was gifted to Santo Domingo by Pope Clement X. The monastery is famous for its tiled mosaics depicting the life of San Domenico de Guzmán, who founded the Dominican Order. Inside the colorful monastery is a peaceful green garden. The church is a short walk northwest of Plaza de Armas in central Lima.\n9. Huaca Pucllana\nThe pyramid-shaped temple of Huaca Pucllana is located in the heart of Miraflores and is now surrounded by buildings. Constructed of adobe and clay bricks – a building material that could not last more than 1,000 years in any other climate – the pyramid consists of seven tiered platforms.\nThe Lima culture, which built the pyramids, flourished on Peru’s central coast between 200 AD and 700 AD. It is known from the artifacts found here that it is important both as a ceremonial and administrative center.\nThe area is divided into two parts, one with evidence showing it was used to feed fish, and the other as an administrative area. A tomb with human remains was found here, and artifacts from the late Wari culture flourished in the area between 500 and 900 AD.\nAddress: Calle General Borgoño cuadra 8, Lima\n10. National Museum of Archeology\nThe National Museum of Archeology, Anthropology and History is not as large as the National Museum and does an excellent job of exploring Peru’s history from prehistoric times to colonial times. The display is well organized, the amount of material won’t overwhelm you, and it’s easier to understand.\nThe variety is impressive, with priceless ceramics, stone carvings, obelisks, wrapped mummies, tombs, jewellery, tapestries, and gold and metalwork, many of which are displayed in scale models of the archaeological site.\nThe ceramics collection includes pieces dating from 2800 BC, and sculpted obelisks include the granite Tello Obelisk and the famous Estela Raimondi. Parents should note that some ceramic figures may not be suitable for children. The museum contains the adjacent houses where Jose de San Martin and Simon Bolivar once lived.\nAddress: Plaza Bolivar, Pueblo Libre, Lima\nHope you like our choice of the best places to visit in Lima.

11	native american way of life buffalo relationship	The Native American relationship with buffalo was deeply spiritual and practical. The Lakota people considered buffalo as relatives, and during traditional buffalo jumps, they worked to minimize the animals' suffering. This spiritual connection was part of their ceremonial journey linked to the sun's passage through constellations. The buffalo were central to Plains Indian life, initially hunted only for subsistence. However, with the arrival of the fur trade, Native Americans began participating in commercial hunting, trading buffalo robes for manufactured goods like cooking pots, knives, and guns. This shift in hunting practices, combined with widespread commercial hunting by frontiersmen, contributed to the near extinction of the species, which has only recently recovered through modern conservation efforts.	"[""TOUCHING INDIAN WAYS\nTOUCHING INDIAN WAYS\nTour lets you walk in footsteps of history as seen by America’s earliest inhabitants\n- CHICAGO SUN TIMES\n“People often ask me, ‘What was Crazy Horse like?’ ”says Serle Chapman, standing in 2-foot-tall prairie grass dappled with wild sage and backed by Bear Butte, the Plains Indians’ most sacred of places.\nA group of eight tourists from across the United States, England and Australia listen, spellbound, despite the frigid October mist.\n“I tell them, ‘I think he was beautiful.'”\n“Perhaps not the word that most would use to describe this iconic Lakota leader. But then most have heard only of Crazy Horse the warrior — not Crazy Horse the romantic who relinquished his Shirt Wearer (war leader) status in a peace agreement that included the protection and gentle treatment of the woman he loved. Neither Hollywood nor the mainstream publishing industry is likely to tell you such stories — at least not accurately.\nThat’s why Chapman and wife Sarah founded Sheridan, Wyoming- and Montana-based Go Native America, offering an exhaustive series of tours that take participants deep into Indian Country to experience firsthand the sights, sounds, tastes and histories of America’s first inhabitants. A primary aim is simply to contest what many call the “bastardization” of the Native experience. Yet, for many participants, the result is a journey not just physical, but emotional, spiritual and often life-changing.\nDescribed by the Associated Press as “one of America’s 50 most influential writers,” Chapman is the best-selling author and photographer of seven books, including Of Earth and Elders, the award-winning Promise: Bozeman’s Trail to Destiny and We, The People, which includes a forward written by former President Bill Clinton. A tireless supporter of Native youth and education programs, Chapman has received commendations from U.S. and world leaders, including Nelson Mandela and former U.S. Senators John Edwards and Ben Nighthorse Campbell (a member of the Council of Chiefs of the Northern Cheyenne Nation). His own forebears include legendary frontier scout Amos Chapman and Mary Chapman, also known as Long Neck Woman, the daughter of Southern Cheyenne Chief Sleeping Bear and adopted daughter of Chief Stone Calf. Go Native America is listed in National Geographic Traveler’s “50 Tours of a Lifetime,” and Chapman made Wanderlust magazine’s top six tour guides worldwide.\nChapman’s knowledge of America’s indigenous peoples and their histories is surpassed only by his passion for sharing it. So it’s no surprise that the Chapmans go out of their way to bring tour participants as close as possible to walking in the very footsteps of people whose stories they’re hearing.\nMy group’s 13-day journey, titled “Elk Medicine,” took us to various locales in South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming and Montana, via a rented passenger bus and one-night stays at Best Westerns, Holiday Inns and one-room cabins in valley of the Badlands National Park. It began with an entrance into the Black Hills in the traditional Lakota way — through Buffalo Gap, South Dakota, population 164, according to the 2000 U.S. Census. Here, among what is now a National Grasslands property boasting 591,000 acres of prairie intermingled with rocky badlands, herds of buffalo entered the Hills on their migratory journeys centuries ago.\n“The landscape here seems to pulse with a heartbeat,” tour participant Jan Yoxall wrote of the experience in her Southeast England-based blog, MedicineBowlCafe. “It speaks to those who take the time to listen and as Serle relates the Lakota stories to us, the wind suddenly builds up as if reinforcing what he is telling us, then it disappears suddenly.”\nHere, Chapman speaks of the traditional Lakota way of lifeway, the ceremonial journey that is linked to the sun’s passage through the constellations and the relationship between the buffalo and human beings. At Vore Buffalo Jump, he explains the mechanics and the spiritual aspects of buffalo jumps, which involved enticing small groups of buffalo from the herds and running them over the edges of cliff formations. As the animals crashed below, tribal women would finish them off as quickly as possible to alleviate their suffering.\n“Their perceptional reality was that the buffalo was a relative,” Chapman says.\nChapman also shared the Native version of the story of the Battle of Little Bighorn, a k a Custer’s Last Stand. It’s true that the famed U.S. Army Cavalry Commander was outnumbered, outmaneuvered and outsmarted by a large coalition of Lakota and Cheyenne warriors. You’ll read that in any history book. But oral histories among the Native peoples suggest that two women, one Lakota, one Cheyenne fought among those who finished off the flamboyant Custer.\nThe day continued with a walk through Custer State Park in search of wild buffalo and elk, and a visit to Wind Cave, revered as the Lakota Nation’s place of genesis. And our group ended our first evening with the He Sapa Wacipi-Black Hills Powwow, a virtual kaleidoscope of color, culture, music, dance and drumbeats.\nThroughout the trip, we would visit many places of interest and of reverence: the Museum of the Fur Trade; the site of the original Red Cloud Agency; the Allison Treaty Grounds, the start of the struggle for the Black Hills that led to the “Great Sioux War of 1876,” deliberately provoked by the Grant administration (the subsequent illegal military seizure of the Black Hills violated the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, and the legal conflict continues today), and the Medicine Wheel in the snowy reaches of the Bighorn Mountains, an ancient place of prayer and meditation.\nSeveral stops drew deep emotional reactions, particularly our visit to Wounded Knee. Several of us stood sobbing at the gated edge of the mass grave bearing victims of the slaughter that marks one of America’s darkest hours. (HBO’s recent Emmy-honored “Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,” by the way, won little praise from the locals, who call the film, at best, a fictionalized history.)\nGuests you’ll meet along the way on a Go Native America tour include people like Ernie LaPointe, who must have more second cousins than anybody on the planet. Seems everyone wants to be the great-grandchild of Lakota statesman, holy man and Sun Dancer Sitting Bull. But only LaPointe and his sisters have the documents and the oral history to prove that claim. As proud of his French heritage as he is of his Lakota lineage, LaPointe shakes his head in frustration at the countless strangers who claim a blood connection to his family.\n“I tell them, ‘somewhere in the Spirit World, your ancestor is hurting,’ ” he says. “‘He is sad because you don’t want to be his family. You want to be someone else’s.'”\nOur group also met Lakota traditionalist Wilmer Stampede Mesteth, a recognized spiritual leader on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and respected Oglala Lakota historian and educator. Mesteth is an ardent preservationist of Lakota culture who, in 1972, defied religious prohibitions to help reintroduce the Sun Dance. He also has worked to preserve the victory songs from the Battle of the Little Bighorn and, after 20 years of training and promotion, successfully brought back a traditional Lakota game thought lost to assimilation.\nWhat you won’t get on a Go Native America tour is an ego-tripped oration about how Natives can do no wrong. Chapman possesses an uncanny knack for describing characters in ways totally relatable in today’s terms. His stories vividly illustrate Red Cloud as a powerful motivator, a shrewd politician and a forceful negotiator, and Yellow Wolf as an ingenious international trade leader whose abilities would rival any political or corporate powerhouse on the scene today.\nThe scenes of modern reservation life stand in stark contrast to the untouched beauty of the lands surrounding them. Poverty, addiction and suicide rates are far greater among America’s indigenous peoples than among any other group living within the nation’s borders today. Several in my tour group bought hand-beaded necklaces from three women who lived, along with 14 others, in a two-bedroom mobile home near Wounded Knee — a small but appreciated gesture followed by vows to do more to help.\nPerhaps it’s the heartbreaking histories and the ongoing hardships that make us all better appreciate the immeasurable value of the lands that Native Americans hold in such reverence. Nowhere is that more evident than the place where our tour group spent its last day — Tongue River Canyon. Here, Crazy Horse would find respite for days at the time, among the brilliant colors of the foliage and the lullaby-like sounds of the stream. It is a scene indescribable — like stepping into a painting, and, like Crazy Horse himself and those who lived, loved and fought alongside him, beautiful."", 'The American West once had its own sea: A great, sweeping, endless ocean of waving grasslands, expanding across the western United States from Canada to Mexico. It was a vast land of pristine and fertile ground, stretching off from horizon to horizon, unspoiled by man’s limitless ambitions. And like every sea, it teemed with life. Rabbits and grouse hid in the grass, wary of the foxes and coyotes prowling in the darkness. Antelope bounced across the vast expanses of open land, staying ahead of the packs of wolves that swept down from the islands of plateaus and ridges standing along the plains. And then, of course, there were the bison. The whales of the grasslands, the American buffalo once traveled the prairie in mobs whose numbers rivaled the number of stars in the sky. They were at one time in history the most populous big game animal in the entire country, with herds stretching for miles, the dust from their movements often blocking out the sun itself. And then, one day, they were just gone.\nThe fall of the great American bison herds has been well documented, and it is well known that they were hunted to near-extinction. As man moved west in search of new land, the inevitable tide of civilization clashed with the buffalo. The land the creatures occupied was needed for development. That massive sea of grass they lived on and the soil from which it grew was perfect for the incoming cattle and agriculture the pioneers needed to feed the oncoming masses of humanity looking to settle the West. What was more, the bison themselves were valuable. Their hides made clothing, leather goods, and blankets; their tongues and bone marrow were considered delicacies; and their gall bladders were thought to have medicinal qualities. Buffalo hunting, then, became not only a sport but an occupation.\nFrontiersmen moved across the prairie in search of the animals, shooting as many of them as they could and cutting the hides and tongues from the carcasses. Although the animals had always been hunted, the Plains Indians—who previously hunted them only for subsistence and had vast knowledge of the herds and their movements—with the coming of the fur trade in the United States, also began to hunt buffalo for profit. Natives in the West had acquired horses and improved weapons, and quickly became involved in the “robe trade”—trading buffalo robes for manufactured trade items such as cooking pots, knives, and guns, as well as cloth, glass, tobacco, sugar, and flour. Though the natives respected and loved the bison, it was a classic case of rising material expectations. Around 1830, as the demand for beaver pelts was replaced by silk, buffalo robes became the currency of trade for almost every trapper, mountain man, cowboy, and Indian seeking their fortune in the “New World.” Over the next 60 years the bison herds, which at one time numbered almost 50 million animals, were cut down to fewer than 1,000 animals by 1880. The few remaining animals hid in distant corners of the country. The West was “won,” and the mighty bison had nearly vanished with the victory, never to return again—or so it was thought.\nIn 1905, with bison numbers still dwindling, President Theodore Roosevelt, arguably the greatest conservationist of our nation’s history, along with William Hornady and Ernest Baynes, formed the American Bison Society (ABS). Working with both the Bronx Zoo—where Hornady served as director—and more prominently Yellowstone National Park, which had already established a bison preserve in 1902 containing two dozen animals, the American Bison Society set out to prevent the bison from going completely extinct and create awareness of the importance of the animal. They banned all hunting of bison and emplaced protective measures on areas they inhabited. They worked with Congress to make the American bison the country’s national mammal and then set about repopulation efforts.\nIn 1907, they shipped 15 buffalo from the Bronx Zoo to the Wichita Mountains in Oklahoma, which became the first official animal reintroduction in North American history. They also founded and established herds in South Dakota and Nebraska. Two years later, ABS successfully petitioned Congress to establish a permanent national bison range in northern Montana. Thanks to ABS’s efforts, by 1920, the bison’s population had grown from fewer than 1,000 animals to nearly 12,000. Once all of the herds were established and secure, the American Bison Society disbanded in 1935, but their actions served as a catalyst for the country, sparking a desire to bring the bison back.\nToday there are more than half a million American bison living in North America. Although most of these animals are semi-domesticated livestock whose meat has created its own niche market, or fenced-in animals on private ranches, there are around 20,000 wild, free-roaming bison in the country—a population that continues to grow. Alaska, Arizona, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming all have wild buffalo populations that one can hunt via lottery drawings. These hunts support future bison conservation, with most of the funds for the lottery draws going toward shaping the health and longevity of the wild herds.\nHunting bison today is ambitious: although the North American bison’s population has returned to substantial numbers, hunting them has changed from stalking massive herds in relatively small areas to hunting small groups of animals throughout massive areas of land. Hunters lucky enough to draw a tag find the bison a worthy and challenging game animal. In most states the hunters’ success rate for bison is less than 50 percent, but the volume of delicious, high-quality meat, along with the robe and massive skull more than make up for the possibility of coming up empty in the hunt. By hunting bison today we are contributing to and enjoying a great American success story. The American bison stands not only as a symbol of the country but as a symbol of the power of conservation, proving that a species can be brought back from the brink.']"	['<urn:uuid:b748cf98-4e41-4829-a3b2-6edea4f72983>', '<urn:uuid:f769a7f4-88bd-4030-840e-3a6a3c78aafc>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	7	115	2431
12	steps disassemble clean worm gear level wind mechanism fishing reel	To clean the level wind mechanism, first turn the worm gear to move the line guide to one side. Remove the pawl cover and pull out the pawl from the line guide assembly. Slide off the worm gear clip and pull out the worm gear. Clean off dirt and old grease, run a cotton swab through the worm gear cover and line guide. When reassembling, put one drop of oil on the tip and one on the white collar below the gear, ensure the top tip of line guide seats in the slot of top frame post.	['The Abu Garcia Ambassadeur fishing reels can cast a mile, as well as haul in monster catfish and they’ll stand up to decades of use and abuse and keep on performing.\nKeeping your fishing reels clean and well lubricated assures optimum performance. If you don’t have the time or the desire to take your catfish reels apart, your local reel repair shop will clean reels for around 20–30 bucks each. If you like to tinker, taking apart an Abu reel is relatively easy, if you keep some key points in mind.\nHere’s a guide to cleaning your fishing reels. As always, one may find some easier methods, but here’s my method.\nThese basic steps for cleaning and lubricating a fishing reel will work for all baitcast fishing reels. Some of the parts may have slight variations but the overall process will be the same.\nHere’s how to clean and lubricate an Abu Garcia Ambassadeur fishing reel.\nBig thanks to Steven Gonzales for the assistance with this post!\nTools and Supplies Needed\nHere’s what you’ll need to get started cleaning your fishing reels.\n- 10mm open ended wrench\n- Flat tip screwdriver\n- Simple Green or Oxy Clean\n- Clean towel or rag\n- Something to put parts in\n- A toothbrush or cleaning brush\n- Cal’s Drag Grease\n- Ultrasonic Cleaner (Optional)\n- Replacement Parts (As Needed)\nIf you find parts need to be replaced during the cleaning process you can find parts readily available on eBay or even through your local bait and tackle shop.\nIf you’re not sure what you’re looking for or need a reel schematic most of the Abu Garcia Schematics are available online through Abu Garcia.\nSouthwestern Parts and Service is also a great resource for schematics and parts.\nYou can use any reel lube and oil that you prefer. I use a variety of lubricants but the Abu Garcia brand products work well because they do their job well and can be found at most stores.\nFrom my screwdriver kit, I only use the 1.4mm flat tip and the #1 Phillips screwdrivers. The extra flat tip screwdriver is available in the event that the 3 thumbscrews are too tight on the Abu faceplate, but most importantly, for the pawl cover.\nTo clean the parts you can use Simple Green or Oxy Clean. Be careful not to get any over spray on to your line, unless your cleaning agent is biodegradable. This reduces the chances of affecting the properties of your line.\nIf you’re really going to be cleaning a lot of reels you can use an ultrasonic cleaner to clean the parts. We’ve gone to this system because of the volume of fishing reels to clean it really helps expedite the process and the investment is minimal if you buy one like this. We use a mixture of water and a small amount of Simple Green and it makes the cleaning process a breeze.\nBefore you begin, you don’t have remove your fishing line, just put a piece of electrical tape on the line. This comes in handy when putting the reel back together, because it keeps your loose line from getting caught between the spool and the frame. If it’s time to change out your fishing line then go ahead and remove it. Here’s an awesome DIY fishing line stripper you can build for pennies.\nDon’t forget to work in a well-controlled area. There are a few tiny parts, and they can easily be flung off….never to be seen again.\nWe’ll break the reel down into 4 major parts:\nAll parts are referenced as if you are holding the reel in the casting position, with the level wind pointed away from you.\nHow To Clean Abu Garcia Ambassadeur Fishing Reels\nAlthough we’ll begin by removing the right faceplate first, we’ll go over this part of the reel last. This section has the most moving parts and consumes the majority of the percentage of your time when cleaning the reel.\nStart by removing the 3 thumb screws on the right faceplate. Use a flat tip screwdriver, if the screws are too tight. The right faceplate assembly will come off the frame and the spool will come off the spool axle.\nNext, remove the 3 screws on the left faceplate with a #1 Philips screwdriver.\nClean out the faceplate of any dirt and debris. Check the teeth on the cog wheel to ensure that the gear isn’t stripped. Apply the grease/lube along both sets of teeth on the cog wheel. I put one drop of oil in the axle seat (hole in the faceplate) and one on the cog wheel spindle. You can set this faceplate aside, because that’s all there is to that piece.\nNow, we will work with the level wind. Turn the worm gear, so that line guide moves all the way over to one side. You’ll need to do this in order to clear the reel foot with a screwdriver. Remove the pawl cover with the screwdriver. Pull the pawl out from the line guide assembly, taking care not to lose it (small part).\nSlide the worm gear clip off of the worm gear and set this piece aside. Pull out the worm gear and the entire assembly will come apart.\nAgain, take care, here. The worm gear sleeve at the other end of the worm gear cover could come loose (small part). If you have a C4 reel, you will have a bearing in place of the sleeve.\nClean off any dirt or old grease. Run a cotton swab through the worm gear cover and line guide to get out any dirt or debris. Clean the pawl tip as well, since this is what runs through the grooves on the worm gear.\nAs far as the frame is concerned, I usually clean it for cosmetic purposes, but you really don’t want any dirt in and around the ingress points like where the spool makes contact and where the worm gear cover sits. The thumb guard snaps on, and you can remove it to give it a more thorough cleaning.\nLet’s put this assembly back together:\nOn the worm gear itself, put one drop of oil on the tip and one drop on the white collar just below the gear. Slide the worm gear into the worm gear cover. When sliding the assembly back into the frame, remember that the worm gear is tabbed, so it will flush into the frame when seated correctly. If the plastic sleeve fell out of the worm gear cover, make sure it’s oriented correctly. If you have problems seating the assembly, usually, it’s because the sleeve is backwards.\nHere’s where having a third hand comes in handy. Slide the complete worm gear assembly back into the frame. While it may take a little patience and some finger fumbling, you want to remember 3 key points:\nEnsure the top tip of the line guide seats inside the slot of the top frame post.\nEnsure the bearing doesn’t fall out and onto the floor…..never to be seen again (yup…learned that one the hard way).\nMake sure the tabs of the worm gear cover fit snugly into the reel frame on the sleeve/bearing side.\nWhen you reinstall the worm gear clip, make sure it seats between the white collar and the gear. Flip the frame over and move your line guide back over to one side. Pop in the pawl and move your line guide slightly, until your pawl is almost flush and is inside the grooves on the worm gear. Screw your pawl cover back on and turn the worm gear to verify function.\nMove the line guide to the center and place a drop of oil on either side of the line guide onto the grooves of the worm gear (here is one place that you can use two drops). Move your line guide across back and forth to spread the oil around. I also place a drop of oil in the groove on the thumb guard post, where the top potion of the line guide slides across.\nNow, you are done with this section. Place this aside, and grab your spool.\nPull off the plastic spool pinion gear. Place a drop of oil on the spool bearing and pop the spool pinion gear back on.\nNote: Older Abu’s may have a brass bushing instead of the bearing. I recommend replacing the bushing with a spool bearing for a much smoother reel. If you wish to do this:\nSpool bearing – part number 13472\nThe part number is the same for the 4000 – 6000 series.\nNow, flip the spool over and place a drop of oil on this bearing as well. There is no need to remove the spool brake. That’s it for the spool. Now for the good stuff…..\nThe spool axle is held in by a little black clip inside the spool tension knob. Loosen the spool tension knob and pull the axle out.\nUsing a #1 Philips screwdrivers, remove the handle cap.\nHere, you will see a small C-clip. Be VERY careful with this clip. I’ve lost way too many, so I keep spares handy. This C-clip not only keeps your handle nut from getting loose, but it keeps your handle gear shaft tight and down to align your gears inside the faceplate (just some FYI). If you lose this, it isn’t the end of the world, but you could notice some skipping issues with your reel. Not a fun time.\nWith your 1.4mm flat tip screwdriver, carefully wedge the tip in between the C-clip and the handle post. Once again, be careful not to fling this clip off into the infinite reaches of space.\nRemove the handle nut with the 10mm open ended wrench and remove the handle. There will be a handle spacer plate right underneath the handle, so take care when removing the handle.\nNow unscrew your star drag. Turn your assembly over and two metal tension plates will come out off of the shaft.\nTurn your assembly right side up again and remove the two inner faceplate screws. Lift the faceplate off of your brake plate assembly.\nGrab the handle shaft gear and remove that entire assembly off of the brake plate post.\nRemove the excess grease from the brake plate assembly. There is a little copper washer that sits on the brake plate post.\nRemove any excess grease and wipe it clean. Place a small drop of oil at the base of the post and place the washer back on top of the oil.\nNext, remove the drive gear from the handle drive shaft, including all the metal and felt drag washers, plus the anti-reverse bearing sleeve.\nClean off all the grease from the handle drive shaft.\nTurn the drive gear upside down and you should see a black felt washer. Carefully, clean any and all excess grease and oil. Grease and oil will seep into this assembly and the washers and will cause slippage with your drag. Place that black felt washer back onto your handle drive shaft.\nWipe off any and all oil and grease from the remaining felt and metal washers.\nPlace your drive gear back onto the handle drive shaft.\nNow, place all the washers back onto the drive gear in the order that you see in this picture from left to right.\nA felt washer goes on the drive gear first, then the round washer.\nNext, add another felt washer, then the round tabbed metal washer.\nFinally, add the last felt washer, then the round washer with the raised collar.\nOn the brake plate assembly, add one more drop of oil on top of the copper washer that sits on the post, and slide the drive gear assembly back onto the post.\nApply a light amount of grease between the brake plate pinion gear and the drive gear.\nClean the anti-reverse bearing sleeve and place it back on the drive gear assembly.\nClean out the faceplate. Place one drop of oil in the axle seat and two drops inside the anti-reverse bearing.\nGo back and second check the washers on your drive gear. Make sure the washer with the tabbed ends is sitting correctly in its grooves.\nSlide your faceplate back onto the brake plate assembly, minding the alignment of the push button release, so that you get a proper seat. Screw down the faceplate with the two inner screws.\nNow you will be reinstalling the two metal tension plates. Orientation is important. The easiest way to remember, is that the tension plates should mimic the open and closed parenthesis shapes as they fit onto the handle drive shaft like so: ( ) The plate curving upwards should go on first, then the plate curving down.\nAt this point, I tighten my spool tension knob almost all the way down, because it’s easier to get to.\nScrew your star drag back on.\nTurn your assembly over and place a drop of oil in the hole of your metal spool pinion gear.\nSlide the axle (brass collar side in) back into the spool pinion gear until you hear it click. It should do a slight lock into the black clip inside the spool tension knob. Once it’s in, you can back off on the spool tension knob. On the inside of the metal collar that surrounds the gear/axle, place two drops oil. You can put the drops anywhere, but I usually put them at opposite ends of each other for even distribution. This will help to lube the brake blocks on the spool for smoother casting.\nSet the assembly aside for now. Grab the frame and screw on the left faceplate.\nBack to the right faceplate assembly, slide your spool onto the spool axle, ensuring that the brake blocks are not protruding out of the collar and that the brake block assembly is aligned with the gear for a perfect seat.\nWith both assemblies oriented this way, I like to pop the frame assembly on from the top. This way, I know my spool is still seated correctly. Take care and don’t force the pieces together. Ensure your alignment is correct. Once the assemblies have snapped into place, tighten down the 3 thumbscrews.\nReinstall the handle spacer plate, with the two outer ends flat against the star drag.\nApply a drop of oil at the base of each paddle on the handle and turn the paddle a few times to spread it out.\nPlace the handle back on the shaft and tighten the nut with the wrench. Before re-attaching the C-clip, check the alignment of the handle nut cap.\nOnce again, very carefully, pop the C-clip back onto the post.\nScrew down the handle nut cover and you are done!\nThis article is part of an ongoing tutorial on rods and reels for catfish, check out the Ultimate Guide To Catfish Reels and the Ultimate Guide To Catfish Rods for even more in depth information on choosing and using rods and reels for catfish.']	['<urn:uuid:98264bf6-d432-4bba-b5e7-aee10372c326>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	10	97	2511
13	As a sleep researcher, what explains the complex link between breathing difficulties and behavior?	Sleep-disordered breathing can significantly impact behavior through disrupted sleep patterns and reduced oxygen levels. When airways are blocked during sleep, it leads to interruptions in natural sleep patterns, causing drops in blood oxygen levels and arousal into lighter sleep stages. These disruptions result in poor-quality, restless sleep, which can manifest as irritability, difficulty concentrating, and hyperactivity. Children may become moody, inattentive, and disruptive both at home and at school. Some children appear sleepy during the day while others may seem overly busy. Importantly, sleep-disordered breathing can be a contributing factor to attention deficit disorders and is sometimes misdiagnosed as ADHD. The condition can also negatively impact a child's intellect and academic performance.	['Overview of Sleep Disordered Breathing\nSleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a general term for breathing difficulties that occur during sleep. SDB can range from frequent, mild snoring to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition involving repeated episodes of partial or complete blockage of the airway during sleep. Blockage of the airways during sleep disrupts the natural pattern of sleep. Such interruptions can result in a decrease in heart rate, rise in blood pressure, and arousal into a lighter stage of sleep. Oxygen levels in the blood can also drop. Approximately 10% of children snore regularly, and about 2-4 % of the pediatric population has OSA. Recent research indicates that even mild SDB or snoring may cause many of the same problems as OSA in children.\nSymptoms of Obstructive Sleep Apnea\nSnoring that is loud and present on most nights is the most obvious symptom of sleep-disordered breathing in children. The snoring may be loud and irregular. Gasping and snorting noises may also be present. Because of the lack of good-quality, restful sleep, a child with SDB may be irritable or have difficulty concentrating in school. Some children seem sleepy during the day while others may seem overly busy or exhibit hyperactivity. Bed-wetting is also frequently seen in children with sleep apnea.\nEnlarged tonsils and adenoids are a common cause of airway narrowing that causes or contributes to SDB. Overweight children are at increased risk for SDB and OSA because of airway narrowing from fat depositis. Children with abnormalities involving the lower jaw or tongue or neuromuscular deficits have a higher risk of developing sleep disordered breathing.\nPotential Consequences of Untreated Pediatric Sleep Disordered Breathing\n- Social: Loud snoring can become a significant social problem if a child shares a room with siblings or at sleepovers and summer camp.\n- Behavior and learning: Children with SDB may become moody, inattentive, and disruptive both at home and at school. Sleep-disordered breathing can also be a contributing factor to attention deficit disorders in some children.\n- Enuresis (bed wetting): SDB can cause increased nighttime urine production, which may lead to bedwetting.\n- Growth: Children with SDB may not produce enough growth hormone, resulting in abnormally slow growth and development.\n- Obesity: SBD may cause the body to have increased resistance to insulin or daytime fatigue with resultant decrease in physical activity. These factors can contribute to obesity.\n- Cardiovascular: OSA can be associated with an increased risk of high blood pressure or other heart and lung problems.\nDiagnosis of Sleep Apnea\nSleep disordered breathing should be considered in a child who has frequent loud snoring, gasping or snorting while sleeping. Sleep may be unusually restless or the child may have unexplained bed wetting in conjunction with snoring. Behavioral symptoms can include changes in mood, misbehavior, and poor school performance. Not every child with academic or behavioral issues will have SDB, but if a child snores loudly on a regular basis and is experiencing mood, behavior, or school performance problems, sleep disordered breathing should be considered.\nThese symptoms should be discussed with the child’s pediatrician or an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat specialist). In most cases, the diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing is made by history and physical examination.\nIn certain cases, the physician may recommend further testing. A sleep study, or polysomnography, is a test for the diagnosis of sleep apnea. This study is performed while the child is sleeping in a sleep laboratory or hospital. Several measurements are taken through the night including brain waves, oxygen levels, airflow, muscle movement and breathing.\nTreatment for Sleep Disordered Breathing\nBecause enlarged tonsils and adenoids are the most common cause for SDB in children, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (removal of the tonsils and adenoids, T&A) are typically first-line therapy. Many children with sleep apnea show both short and long- term improvement in their sleep and behavior after T&A. Most children do not require overnight admission in the hospital and go home a few hours after surgery. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are typically used to control pain.\nOther treatment options include weight loss, the use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) or additional surgical procedures may sometimes be required. These are used less often in children and may be used if sleep apnea persists after T&A.', 'Snoring, Obstructive sleep apnea, OSAS, Adenotonsillar hypertrophy\nIntroduction to sleep apnea:\nParents are quick to mention some things to their pediatrician: fevers, seizures, and bleeding. Snoring is another important symptom that your child’s doctor needs to know about, though it often goes unreported.\nAny child who snores may have obstructive sleep apnea, and may not be getting adequate sleep.\nNot all kids with sleep apnea snore. Even when they do, sleep apnea is often overlooked. Instead, the child may be diagnosed with a behavioral disorder — most commonly ADHD.\nWhat is sleep apnea?\nMost people make some quiet snoring noises when they have (or are recovering from) a cold but this quickly resolves after the cold. Some people snore even when not ill, and some snore loud enough that others can easily hear them. In these cases, snoring may be the sign of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), where there is prolonged partial blocking, or intermittent blocking, of breathing during sleep. The obstruction is usually caused by large tonsils or adenoids, which may be temporarily enlarged by infection or allergies.\nChildren with sleep apnea do not get sound sleep. They may also get suboptimal oxygen to the brain at night. Obstructive sleep apnea can have a serious negative impact on a child’s intellect and behavior.\nOSAS can cause growth problems. It has also been linked to ADHD, poor school performance, learning difficulties, bedwetting, high blood pressures, lung disease, heart disease, and rarely even death.\nOSAS is different from primary snoring (PS), the name given to snoring that doesn’t cause sleep disruption or breathing problems. Primary snoring is more common than OSAS.\nWho gets sleep apnea?\nOSAS occurs in about 2 percent of children. The peak age is 2 to 5 years old, but it can occur at any age.\nIn older children and adults, it is more common among the obese. It is also common in those with sickle cell disease, Down syndrome, birth injuries, or any other condition that might narrow the upper airway.\nWhat are the symptoms of sleep apnea?\nClassically, those with sleep apnea snore quite loudly for a bit, then are silent (sometimes not appearing to breathe), then snort briefly, move about, and resume snoring. If snoring is accompanied by nighttime breathing difficulty and pauses in breathing, then it may well be sleep apnea.\nHowever, many children with OSAS do not follow this classic pattern. OSAS and PS cannot be reliably distinguished from each other based on the symptoms alone.\nOther common symptoms of sleep apnea include mouth breathing, restless sleep, difficulty paying attention during the day, decreased academic performance, oppositional behavior, and restlessness.\nIs sleep apnea contagious?\nHow long does sleep apnea last?\nChildren often outgrow OSAS within several years.\nHow is sleep apnea diagnosed?\nSnoring should be brought to the attention of your pediatrician. You might want to make a cassette tape of your child’s sleep noises to bring with you.\nOSAS and PS cannot be reliably distinguished from each other based on the physical examination and history alone. Other tests must be used. A sleep study is the gold standard test for telling the difference. Thus, snoring needs to be reported to the doctor, and when snoring lasts longer than a brief respiratory infection, or fails to respond to allergy treatment, it deserves thorough evaluation. Often pediatricians enlist the help of ear-nose-and-throat, neurology, or pulmonary specialists to help distinguish between the two.\nHow is it treated?\nBecause enlarged tonsils and adenoids usually cause the obstruction, removing them can usually solve the problem.\nSometimes the obstruction is treated with gentle positive air pressure in the airway at night – nasal CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure).\nSupplemental oxygen, and correction of anemia may provide additional help.\nDecongestants, steroids, antibiotics, or other medicines might reduce snoring caused by enlarged tonsils or adenoids in PS but are unlikely to be of much help with true obstructive sleep apnea.\nHow can it be prevented?\nEarly treatment of primary snoring might prevent the cycle that leads to obstructive sleep apnea. Preventing or treating obesity and nasal congestion can also help protect children from OSAS.\nRelated A-to-Z Information:\nAdenovirus, Allergies (Allergic Rhinitis), Anemia (Low hemoglobin), Asthma, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),Bronchiolitis,Cerebral Palsy, Cleft Lip and Palate, Common Cold, Congenital Heart Disease, Cough, Croup, Depression, Down Syndrome, Enuresis (Bedwetting), Epilepsy, Gastroesophageal Reflux, Head Banging,Obesity, Pertussis (Whooping cough), Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), TonsillitisReviewed by: Khanh-Van Le-Bucklin, Liat Simkhay Snyder\nLast reviewed: November 14, 2013']	['<urn:uuid:1c65d884-1552-484a-b284-e5c385e52f62>', '<urn:uuid:9b43af25-b707-4570-8bd6-f922846db900>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	14	112	1449
14	My friend says he's deaf but can hear some things. How's that possible?	Deafness is not an all-or-nothing condition. While some individuals are completely deaf, others have varying degrees of functional hearing loss. These degrees are categorized as mild, moderate, severe, and profound. People who refer to themselves as deaf usually have either severe hearing loss (inability to hear sounds below 80 decibels) or profound hearing loss (inability to hear sounds below 95 decibels).	"['Types of Auditory Disabilities\nTypes of Auditory Disabilities\nIn some ways, the content of this section is more than you need to know in order to make web content accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing, but it is included here in the hope that with increased understanding comes increased appreciation to such individuals, and an increased commitment to providing content that is accessible to them.\nThe key principle of web accessibility for users with auditory disabilities is:\n- Perceivable: because they cannot perceive (hear) auditory content\nIt should be noted that the use of the word ""disabilities"" in the title of this section is a controversial choice, considering the attitude of many people in the deaf community. More than any of the other groups of individuals commonly labeled as ""disabled,"" those who are deaf are much less inclined to think of their condition as a disability. We\'ll read more about this in the last section of this article - Deaf Culture. Still, we have retained the word ""disability"" in this section, not to provoke controversy, but to underscore the fact that those who are deaf cannot hear audio content, and this is the critical point for web developers to remember.\nDeafness is not an all-or-nothing condition. Although there are individuals who are completely deaf, there are also individuals with varying degrees of functional hearing loss. Degrees of hearing loss are often categorized as mild, moderate, severe, profound. Those who refer to themselves as deaf usually have either severe or profound hearing loss. Those with lesser degrees of hearing loss are commonly referred to as hard-of-hearing.\nDegrees of Hearing Loss\n- Mild hearing loss:\n- The inability to hear sounds below about 30 decibels. Speech can be difficult to understand, especially if background noises are present.\n- Moderate hearing loss:\n- The inability to hear sounds below about 50 decibels. A hearing aid may be required.\n- Severe hearing loss:\n- The inability to hear sounds below about 80 decibels. Hearing aids are useful in some cases, but are inadequate in others. Some individuals with severe hearing loss communicate principally through sign language; others rely on lip-reading techniques.\n- Profound hearing loss:\n- The absence of the ability to hear, or the inability to hear sounds below about 95 decibels. Like those with severe hearing loss, some individuals with profound hearing loss communicate principally through sign language; others rely on lip-reading techniques.\nClassifications of Hearing Loss\nConductive hearing loss is the result of damage or blockage of the moving parts of the ear. The bones of a healthy inner ear—the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil) and stapes (stirrup)—vibrate in response to sounds. Diseases or injury can lead to the inability of these bones to vibrate properly, preventing the proper detection of auditory information.\nNeural hearing loss (nerve deafness) occurs when the hair cells in the cochlea or the auditory nerve is damaged, thus preventing the auditory information from getting to the brain. The bones of the inner ear may vibrate correctly, but the nerves are unable to properly transmit this information for processing by the brain.\nHigh tone hearing loss is, as its name implies, the loss of the ability to hear high tones. One of the most important social consequences is that women\'s voices are more difficult to understand.\nLow tone hearing loss is the inability to hear low tones. Male voices are difficult to hear and understand.\nDeaf-blindness is the condition of being both deaf and blind. Individuals who are deaf-blind often communicate by sign language, but they must be able to feel the signs the other person is making, by essentially holding the hands of the other person while conversing. When accessing web content, they generally use refreshable Braille devices that allow them to access all of the textual content of the web page, including alternative text for images.\nCauses of Hearing Loss\nMost deafness occurs early in life, most often through genetic or perinatal causes. Deafness can also occur as a result of middle ear infections (otitis media), which are most common in young children. It is also possible to experience deafness later in life, though traumatic injury or diseases. Additionally, hearing loss is a common part of the aging process, especially in men.']"	['<urn:uuid:8600cc4c-da26-49c7-b64a-8bafcb5f368f>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	13	61	710
15	Which takes longer to harvest, regular corn or Pima cotton?	Regular corn has one harvest during the fall season, when combines break off corn ears from stalks. Pima cotton harvest is a slower process - historically cotton fields had to be picked by hand three to four times each harvest season, and even with modern roller gins, it is described as a 'slow process' that 'takes time' compared to regular saw gins.

Corn is rated 68 percent good to excellent.\nHow many times a year is corn harvested?\nIn the Midwest there’s only one growing season. Corn, soybeans, and wheat can only be harvested once. Forage crops for cattle can often be harvested multiple times as they regrow.\nWhat is in season Illinois?\nSeasonal Illinois Produce From A to Z\n- Apples: July through November.\n- Arugula: May through September.\n- Asparagus: April through June.\n- Basil: July through September.\n- Beets: May through October.\n- Blackberries: July into August.\n- Blueberries: July into August.\n- Broccoli: June through October.\nWhat happens if you harvest corn too early?\nHarvesting Corn at the Right Time Will Result in Peak Flavor and Texture. The key to harvesting corn is timing. If you pick it too early, it won’t reach maximum sweetness and might be too hard. If you wait too long, the kernels may be too tough and starchy.\nWhy do farmers let their corn die?\nField corn, also sometimes called “cow corn,” stays in the fields until the ears dry because corn is very high in moisture and must be dry to be processed. That is why farmers leave stalks in the field until they are golden brown in the fall. Some of that corn is saved to provide seed for the next season’s corn crop.\nHow is corn harvested?\nAfter it matures, corn is harvested in the fall with a grain combine. Combines have row dividers that pick up the corn stalks as the combine moves through the field. The corn ears are broken off from the corn stalk and dragged into the combine, and the stalks are dropped back on the ground.\nWhat type of crop is corn?\nCorn is a tall annual cereal grass (Zea mays) that is widely grown for its large elongated ears of starchy seeds.\nHow much corn is harvested in the United States?\nThe total production of corn in the US for the year 2019 is reported to be 13.016 billion bushels, of which the major use is for manufacture of ethanol and its co-product (Distillers’ Dried Grains with Solubles), accounting for 37% (27% + 10%), or 4,845 million bushels (3,552 + 1,293).\nHow many times a year can cotton be harvested?\nBecause cotton is a plant that will be killed by the frost is is often grown as an annual if you’re growing it farther north with the plants dying and being replanted each year. Traditionally, cotton fields had to be picked by hand three and four times each harvest season.\nWhat do farmers do with corn cobs?\nBut little or no work has been done on the economics from the farmer’s perspective of harvesting and collecting just the cobs off the field. The primary use for cobs today is utilizing the nutrients and tilling them back into the ground.\nWhy do farmers combine at night?\n“We like to do it at night because the corn is cooler at night,” Dan said. “It takes less effort to get the heat out of the corn at night. If we harvest during the day, it’s way too hot and the corn goes into a starch.” After harvest, the corn is kept cool at the packing shed and is quickly sorted and boxed up on ice.\nWhat fruits are in season in the spring?', 'Can Pima make a case for West Texas cotton acres?\nby Jayci Bishop\nCentered in the Cotton Belt, West Texas is widely known for producing millions of Upland cotton bales. However, Pima cotton recently started appearing on farms throughout the High Plains and Rolling Plains of Texas.\nRising enthusiasm for Pima cotton production caused Maple Co-op Gin to construct the area’s first roller gin for the 2020 crop. Before the 2020 crop, just under 15,000 acres of Pima cotton were planted predominantly near the El Paso area. Of the 38,000 planted acres of 2020 Pima cotton in Texas, only 11,000 were in the El Paso region. The remaining acres were scattered throughout the 5.4 million cotton acres in Texas’ High Plains and Rolling Plains. Marvin McCaul, Gin Manager of Maple Co-op since 1983, said they had a few growers decide to grow Pima cotton for a couple of years, and they watched it closely. Once the co-op realized that it was a viable option in this area, they decided to install a roller gin.\n“We had extra ginning capacity and there was a need for it,” McCaul said. “Pima growers were hauling their Pima harvest long distances to places like Las Cruces or El Paso, and it was costing them a fortune. We thought Pima was going to make and it did two years in a row. So, we thought we would invest in a roller gin and see if we could make it work.”\nDavid Canale, PCCA Director of Pima Marketing, said Maple Co-op Gin’s decision has helped increase interest in Pima in this area.\n“Pima has been grown in this area in very small amounts for years,” Canale said. “In the past, growers experimented with maybe 5-10 acres because of the higher loan value and to see what it would do. Pima loses loan eligibility and any price premium if it is stripper harvested and saw ginned, which was all that was available in this area. With more pickers as well as a roller gin now available, it has increased interest.”\nToday, Maple Co-op Gin operates two gin plants – one of which is a roller gin. McCaul said there are differences between managing a saw gin and a roller gin.\n“It is a slow process,” McCaul said. “It is a lot different than the saw gin. It takes time, and these gin stands are not as fast, so we have to run several of them to get that kind of volume. We plan to add more roller gin stands this year.”\nThe infrastructure improvements played a role in the rise in Pima acres, but the price growers can receive for their crop is appealing to growers. McCaul sees Pima gaining attention as an economically and agronomically feasible Upland alternative.\n“It seems to do well here on the Plains. It grades well, too,” McCaul said. “Prob- ably the biggest thing about it is just the loan value alone is about 90 cents. In years past, that is almost double the value you will receive for Upland cotton in the loan. That price is really attractive if you are able to grow it for the same input costs. This cotton is non-GMO, so it is all conventional. They have to plow and not spray chemicals over the top, which can be difficult. It also needs water, but if they can make two bales to the acre at that loan value, it can be a good alternative.”\nCanale said this is a good time for Pima cotton with the current market conditions. “This is an exciting time for Pima as prices have rebounded from the de- pressed levels we have witnessed the past few years,” Canale said. “Pima is a niche market, and it was affected more than Upland cotton by the trade war between the U.S. and China. The coronavirus pandemic shutdowns also weighed on prices in 2020. Production has fallen the past few years in the U.S. and worldwide, and with lower spinner inventories, prices have improved immensely.”\nLike most Upland cotton produced in this area, Pima cotton is exported to other countries.\n“Pima is spun worldwide, but the main users are India, China, Pakistan, and Egypt,” Canale said. “Typically, these four countries represent roughly 85 percent of worldwide consumption. Pakistan is the only large user that does not produce Pima. On the other hand, the U.S., Egypt, and China account for 90 percent of worldwide production. Egypt, like the U.S., is a net exporter and the main com- petition for American Pima exports.”\nWhat is Pima cotton?\nPima is an Extra-Long Staple (ELS) cotton variety. ELS cotton is recognized for cotton that has a minimum fiber length of 1-3/8”, 34.925 mm or measured in 32nds is 44 staple or longer. For simplicity, PCCA uses the term Pima. Pima cotton differs from Upland not only in physical characteristics like length and strength but also in harvesting and ginning. Whereas most upland cotton in PCCA’s area is stripped and saw ginned, Pima is picked and roller ginned. If Pima cotton is stripped and saw ginned, it is loan ineligible, and its value is greatly diminished.\nWhat is a roller gin?\nA roller gin uses a rotary knife to separate the seed from the lint in the ginning process, and it is primarily used to gin Pima cotton.\nWhat products are made with Pima cotton?\nPima is typically used in luxury apparel and home goods, such as sheets and towels. It is a long staple, high-strength fiber which allows goods made from it to be softer and more durable than the same goods made with a shorter fiber.\nHow do you market Pima cotton?\nMarketing channels are similar to Upland cotton but are also very different. Pima represents just over one percent of all cotton produced globally, making it a niche market. There are not futures or options markets for Pima, which means there isn’t an effective hedging strategy for Pima cotton.\nDoes PCCA offer a marketing option for Pima cotton?\nYes, PCCA is offering a Pima Marketing Pool to growers this year.

16	how many years total spent jail political activist poncke princen indonesia	Princen served a total of 8½ years in prison under both Sukarno and Soeharto regimes for his defence of human rights.	"['|Subject: SMH: Jill Jolliffe on Princen\nSydney Morning Herald\nMarch 14, 2002 Thursday\nDutch \'traitor\' Became A Pro-Timorese Indonesian\nJill Jolliffe,Jill Jolliffe Is The Herald\'s Correspondent\nBODY: Johannes Cornelis Princen, Human rights activist, 1925 - 2002\nJohannes Princen, who has died in Jakarta, was an extraordinary figure who played a fearless role in upholding human rights in Indonesia. Born in The Hague, he was raised by free-thinking parents and influenced by anarchist ideals in his youth.\nDuring World War II ""Poncke"" Princen was captured by the Germans and spent time in a Nazi concentration camp. He later enlisted in the Dutch army and was sent to Indonesia to fight in the so-called ""police action"" to restore Dutch colonial rule against Indonesian nationalists.\nHe quickly sympathised with the Indonesian nationalists, and in 1948 deserted to fight with them against his compatriots. Indonesia\'s founding president, Sukarno, decorated him with the Guerilla Star, Indonesia\'s highest honour, as a result. He took out Indonesian citizenship, converted to Islam and was elected to the Indonesian Parliament in 1956.\nHis stand caused great bitterness in Holland, where he was branded as a traitor and banned from returning to his homeland until the closing years of his life.\nIn death, however, Dutch cabinet minister Jan Pronk paid a cautious tribute to him. ""Poncke Princen was no hero, martyr or saint, but first and foremost a human rights activist,"" he told Radio Netherlands.\nUnlike many opponents of the Soeharto regime who had never criticised the populist Sukarno, his record on political freedom was thoroughgoing. He was imprisoned by both Sukarno and Soeharto for his defence of human rights, serving a total of 81/2 years in prison.\nIn the early 1970s he was a founder of the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute. Despite his critical role, his prestige in Indonesia always remained high because of his role in the independence struggle, and in the early 1990s he was a founding member of the Group of Fifty, a movement for democratic reform which included conservative military figures who had fallen out with Soeharto.\nBut he stood out from others because of his early stand in support of East Timorese self-determination, a cause which was taboo even in the most progressive circles, where nationalism reigned supreme.\nIn later years he suffered mutilating surgery for skin cancer and then a series of near-fatal strokes. Yet his luminous spirit shone through his crippled wreck of a body, and he continued his work as before.\nAfter the imprisonment of East Timor\'s resistance hero Xanana Gusmao in 1992, the two formed a friendship, although Princen was only able to visit him personally after the reformasi movement gained force in 1998.\nAfter the 1991 Santa Cruz massacre in Dili he gave sanctuary in his house to five young East Timorese who had fled their homeland. A stand-off with the Indonesian military followed, but he successfully negotiated with the Jakarta military commander, General Hendro-priono then perceived as a liberal harbinger of reformasi for their safe passage to Jakarta airport, from whence they travelled to freedom in Portugal.\nGusmao, who is likely to be East Timor\'s first president after elections next month, said in Dili that he was deeply saddened by Princen\'s death. He said his first contact with him had been when he was still leading the guerilla struggle in East Timor\'s mountains.\nThey corresponded from that time, a link which continued during the Timorese leader\'s imprisonment in Jakarta.\n""After the reformasi movement began, he visited me at the first opportunity,"" Gusmao recalled. ""It was a very emotional meeting, and I thanked him for the support he had given to our people. He then came frequently and we usually discussed the evolution of the democratic struggle in Indonesia. He encouraged us in our struggle. East Timor owes a lot to him.""\nThe Timorese leader\'s Australian wife, Kirsty Sword, also knew Princen from her work with the Timorese underground after 1990. ""I can still remember him telling me the story of how he came to be in Indonesia. He told how the Indonesians proudly refused to hand him over to the Dutch during the early years of Sukarno,"" she recalled.\n""He said \'Soeharto would be glad to hand me over today\'. He was almost alone in taking up the cause of East Timor in Indonesia. Despite being a vocal critic, he had enormous respect in Indonesia, and was considered almost untouchable.""\nNote: For those who would like to fax ""the powers that be"" - CallCenter is a Native 32-bit Voice Telephony software application integrated with fax and data communications... and it\'s free of charge!

17	How did ancient Egyptians protect tomb paintings from damage in both past and present?	In ancient Egypt, tomb paintings were protected by being placed in sealed tomb chambers. In modern times, conservators use various protection methods - for example, in Anen's tomb they built protective display boxes over restored wall reliefs and constructed slanted walls to divert rainwater, while at the Nelson-Atkins Museum they control humidity levels at 50% ± 5% RH to prevent salt damage to painted limestone artifacts.	"['Serving Statue of the Baker Nebes, Egyptian, 5th Dynasty, ca. 2494-2345 B.C.E. Painted limestone, 9 3/4 x 11 x 4 3/8 inches (24.8 x 27.9 x 11.1 cm). The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, Missouri. Purchase: William Rockhill Nelson Trust, 35-17\nThe term “serving"" statue is adopted here, rather than “servant”, to more neutrally reflect the figure’s function without assuming his identity, since it is speculated these types of statues could have represented friends or relatives of the deceased (1-2). Serving statues were placed in the serdab chamber of the deceased’s tomb to aid them in the afterlife and, if representing the deceased’s dependent, to help ensure their dependent’s access as well.\nThe object is a painted limestone serving statue belonging to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art (NAMA 35-17).\nThe statue depicts a figure kneeling on a platform, feet tucked behind him, kneading dough and/or forming cakes or loaves.\nIDENTITY & INTERPRETATION\nWith the help of Dr. Ann Macy Roth, an inscription on the proper left side of the platform/base was translated, and the object’s contextual background investigated.\nPreviously interpreted as a generic, nameless representation of a servant kneading dough, the inscription was found to read “Baker Nebes”, identifying the individual by both name and trade.\nRTI - Specular Enhancement\nThe title “baker” is not commonly seen in Egyptian works. There are some examples of named bakers on tomb chapel wall reliefs, though there is no current knowledge of “baker” being inscribed on any other Old Kingdom serving statue. The name “Nebes” has not yet been found in the literature either, however there is a dearth of resources to consult about Old Kingdom names.\nThe Baker Negan and other men shaping dough, from the wall relief in the tomb of Iy-neferet.\nImage: Schürman 1993, fig. 15b\nBaker Ni-meret and Baker Tjenty are named in a large food procession on the east wall relief in the mastaba of Ka-ni-nisut.\nImage: Junker’s Gîza II. Die Mastabas der beginnenden V. Dynastie auf dem Westfriedhof, fig. 20\nParallels & Activity\nIn 1948, James Breasted included NAMA 35-17 in his book, “Egyptian Servant Statues”, describing the figure as “both hands reach forward and seem to be kneading dough” (3). He classified the statue under the category of “Man Forming Cakes or Loaves of Dough”, though similar statues have been interpreted differently.\nThe figure has little known history before the 1930s, but three close parallels coming from large deposits in 5th Dynasty tombs at Giza, lend considerable support for the figure’s origins. Like the parallels, the figure likely came from an Old Kingdom tomb at Giza that contained several other serving statues.\nIn light of the translated inscription on NAMA 35-17, which identifies the individual as a baker, it is doubtful that Parallel #2 (Hassan’s “Fuller”) (4) depicts an individual washing cloth. Similarly, it is unlikely that Munich’s example (Parallel #1, ÄS 4862) is a servant grinding flour, especially since the palette these figures kneel behind is much flatter than those seen in wheat-grinding statues. Their fingers also seem to wrap around the two forms they’re holding, making it unlikely that they are grinding.\nThe best interpretation for NAMA 35-17 seems to be a combination of Breasted’s 1948 classification, and Tooley’s description of OIM 10624: baker kneading dough and/or forming cakes or loaves (5).\nWe\'ve learned that Nebes was a valued baker in the household of the tomb owner, who was an elite in Old Kingdom Giza. The tomb owner likely commissioned this statue, along with several others, to be included in his mortuary cult. Nebes may have been a personal friend, or simply one of several individuals the deceased saw as an asset to his household whom he wished to continue with him into the afterlife.\nMATERIALS & TECHNOLOGY\nThe process of Egyptian stone working began with a cube of stone being roughed out with stone tools, followed by preliminary drawings on all four sides that guided sculptors as they worked.\nEgyptians utilized the geometry of a grid to maintain the figure’s proportions as they methodically worked inward from all sides of the stone. As work progressed, more precise copper/bronze tools were used, especially pointed chisels and drills for details.\nThe statue would have been finished off by polishing with rubbing stones and sand, and finally painted with pigments bound in a plant or animal-based glue (a water-sensitive system) (6-7). The binder rarely survives on painted limestone objects today, but the pigments can remain.\nTool marks evident on NAMA 35-17 include chisel marks on its underside, and abrasion over the surface from rubbing stones.\nPigments remaining on the surface include black, a pinkish white, and brownish reds. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) was utilized at over ten locations on the surface to help characterize the pigments present, and certain trends were observed when spectra were overlaid. Though, as a qualitative method, XRF results will need to be paired with other investigative analyses in the future for proper identification.\nReds were generally red ochre (iron oxides), with realgar (arsenic sulfide) sometimes added to achieve a reddish brown color (6). Analysis at locations with original red pigment showed notably high peaks for both iron and sulfur. All areas of red analyzed contained trace amounts of tin, manganese and zinc, which were absent in readings at the bare stone.\nWhites were often calcium sulfate (gypsum) or calcium carbonate, and pinks could be made by mixing red ochre with gypsum white (6). A spectrum at the pinkish white paint on the figure’s palette had a notable peak for sulfur, which may support the use of calcium sulfate, but overall, the lower iron content of both the pinkish white and black pigments allowed for a greater depth of reading, resulting in compositions and peak heights nearly identical to the bare stone.\nBlacks were almost exclusively made with carbon, which is too light to detect using XRF analysis.\nHover mouse over legend to view annotated map of breaks and approximate extent of previous restoration material.\nOld restoration material, such as plaster, shellac and mismatched paint, was found excessively over the surface of the statue, associated with repairs at 7 break locations, including at the neck, waist, and different points through each arm. These repairs were easily a century or more old and occurred before the statue was acquired by the museum, as determined by the object’s records, old photographs, and the materials and methods employed.\nComputer x-ray radiography revealed metal pins used at many of the joins—a common repair intervention for statues, though unnecessary in this case.\nThese outdated repairs were inadequate, inappropriate, and also posed potential risks:\nThe plaster was a possible source of soluble salts.\nThe shellac was old enough to be at the end of its use-life, at which point the joins could fail or possibly strengthen to a harmful degree.\nLast, if the internal pins were made of iron, they could rust and expand in volume, exerting pressure from within the stone that could cause it to break.\nPresence of Soluble Salts\nThe stone itself was soft—not unusual for limestone, which is calcareous and ranks low on the Mohs scale of hardness (Mohs hardness = 3) (6,8). However, the stone was powdery and excessively soft in many shallow areas of loss, suggesting the presence of harmful salts—common to Egyptian limestone.\nSoluble sea salts, like calcium sulfate (CaSO4) and sodium chloride (NaCl, halite), often became inherent constituents of the limestone as it was formed (9-10). If allowed to cycle in and out of solution in fluctuating relative humidity, the subflorescence of these salts can cause the stone to deteriorate and lose integrity, becoming soft, powdery and fragile. This mechanism likely played a role in the significant loss of paint from the surface.\nWhen the figure was disassembled, the stone and restoration plaster were sampled to be analyzed for ionic species through ion chromatography, in order to assess the presence and potential impact of soluble salts. Analysis was performed and interpreted by Chemist Bruce C. Hamper; results are outlined in Table 1.\nPowdered limestone samples showed an average total salt content around 1% w/w, with CaSO4 and NaCl as the major soluble salts consistently present throughout the stone matrix. The plaster was found to be gypsum plaster (CaSO4·2H2O), such as Plaster of Paris, but additional analysis is necessary to distinguish its influence on the stone’s overall CaSO4 content.\nENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS FOR STORAGE & DISPLAY\nThe potential harm of CaSO4 crystallizing near the surface is contingent on its exposure to a very high percentage of water vapor in the air—around 99% at 70˚F—which is fortunately unlikely to occur in the object’s current, controlled environment. However, the more attainable deliquescence of halite around 75% RH makes the stone’s NaCl content of primary concern (11). The museum currently maintains 50% + 5% RH at 70˚F, which will avoid halite crystallization, and a stable RH was further ensured by using well-sealed enclosures with mitigating quantities of silica gel.\nPrevious restorations were removed and replaced with more appropriate, long-term conservation materials, and repairs were visually integrated to a higher standard. New restoration materials were chosen which both chemically and aesthetically respect the object. Restorations were only added as necessary and were contained to areas of loss, which helped return the piece to a more honest state.\nPreliminary Removal of Old Restoration Materials\nBefore reversing the joins to disassemble the statue, join areas hidden beneath old restoration paint and plaster first needed to be exposed.\nRestoration paint was removed with the aid of an acetone-retaining gel system (10:90 acetone: Poval 5-74). Poval 5-74 is a partially hydrolyzed poly(vinyl alcohol) that was cross-linked with borate ions. This peelable, viscoelastic gel retained the solvent and kept it at the surface of the plaster, introducing it in a more controlled manner. Quantity and spread of the solvent was minimal while it effectively worked to loosen the paint. After removing the gel, pigment easily lifted with minimal solvent (1:1 acetone:mineral spirits) and cotton swabs, which also helped clear the area of any remaining gel residue.\nWhen the bare plaster was fully visible, a scalpel and other tools were used to mechanically break it apart and shave it down. Large areas of preserved, original paint were revealed on the figure, which had been broadly covered by restoration material.\nPulled cotton was packed into narrow spaces between joins, and ethanol was introduced to the point of refusal using a hypodermic needle to dissolve whatever shellac was present. Poultices were regularly changed out, plaster and solubilized shellac removed, and the process repeated. Following this procedure, joins loosened and released after a couple days, leaving the statue in 6 large fragments.\nDisassembly & Cleaning\nSurfaces were cleaned of old restoration materials and the 10:90 acetone: Poval 5-74 gel was used to clean the base, which was dirtied and dark from handling and storage. Fragile areas of pigment were pre-consolidated using 2% w/v Paraloid B-72 in acetone. Overall, restoration materials were successfully removed, if not greatly reduced, though overpainting that was too risky to safely remove remains around join areas.\nManganese dioxide (MnO2) stains observed at break surfaces indicated the statue was in a fragmented state while buried in the ground.\nUnlike the breaks with MnO2 stains, the figure’s proper right arm had been intentionally sawed-off at the top sometime after excavation. The level cut continued through into the pectoral area. It\'s theorized the previous restorer had difficulty aligning the fragments, and resorted to cutting the arm off to more easily manipulate it and compensate for other misalignments.\nAll joins had been misaligned to varying degrees, and the metal pins extracted from 4 of the joins were found to be brass and threaded.\nA judicial amount of 50% w/v Paraloid B-72 in acetone was used to join fragments in their proper positions. A detachable reconstruction was made of the figure’s proper right shoulder, using a piece of high density Ethafoam covered in epoxy putty and shaped using Micro-Mesh®. The epoxy took the impression of the break surfaces as it cured over a barrier of plastic wrap, allowing the piece to tightly fit the topography of the space. The reconstructed shoulder was attached in the same manner as the other fragments, using 50% w/v Paraloid B-72 in acetone.\nAquazol 200 in isopropanol bulked with cellulose power was used for all superficial fills, including applied as a layer over the epoxy shoulder addition. The solubility of this fill material allows it to be removed in the future with minimal to no effect on the joins, since B-72 is only slightly soluble in isopropanol. This material was a pleasing color, easy to use and manipulate, and experienced no shrinkage. Fills were texturized and shaped using a bamboo skewer, micro spatula, files, scalpel, pin-vice, and solvent as needed. In many instances, filing marks were mimicked on the fills to match the surrounding damage in the stone, and “paint losses” were shallowly carved out to imitate the appearance of the adjacent original surface.\nInpainting was performed using QOR watercolors, which are colors bound in Aquazol. This line of watercolors worked very well in matching the stone and the earthy reds of the original pigment. Minimal water was used in their application. Though composed of the same binder as the fills, the inpainting can be easily removed without solubilizing the Aquazol fills, so long as it is not removed with excessive amounts of water or aggressive swabbing.\nOverall, by mimicking paint losses and the disturbed surfaces surrounding losses (overpaint and filing marks from the previous restoration), a balance was achieved that discretely disguises the newly gap-filled areas.\nProper Right Arm\nProper Left Arm\nMaterials & Suppliers\nArt-Sorb—cassettes of pre-conditioned (50% RH) silica gel\n517 Main St., Holyoke, MA 01040\nPoval® 5-74—partially saponified grade of polyvinyl alcohol\nKuraray America Inc.,\n2625 Bay Area Blvd., Suite 300,\nHouston, Texas 77058\nBorate (xPVAc-borate)—lab grade borax sodium tetraborate\n330 W. 63rd Street,\nKansas City, MO 64113\nParaloid B-72—ethyl methacrylate (70%) and methyl acrylate (30%) copolymer\nRohm & Haas Co., Philadelphia, PA\nSupplied by Conservation Support Systems,\nP.O.

C.F. Müller, Karlsruhe.', 'Located atop the highest point of the West Bank’s royal necropolis hill in Luxor, the tomb of Anen belonged to an ancient Egyptian priest that served under the reign of Amenhotep III. Commonly believed to have served in the military prior to joining the priesthood, Anen was known by a number of honorable titles that included ‘Guardian of the Palanquin,’ ‘Second of the Four Prophets of Amun’ and ‘Greatest of Seers.’ Beyond his high spiritual standing, Anen also came from a notable regal line. The brother of Queen Tiye, Anen was not only the brother in-law of Amenhotep III, but a maternal uncle to Akhenaten and a maternal great uncle to Tutankhamun.\nBecause of these familial ties, Anen’s tomb carries substantial historical and scholarly value, and was selected for an intensive restoration project in 2002. Backed by the American Research Center in Egypt, with support from the U.S. Agency for International Development, and directed by archaeologist Lyla Pinch-Brock, the project sought to reverse much of the deterioration that had affected the tomb’s colorful wall paintings and overall structural integrity. Carried out on an intensive schedule in October and November 2002, the project not only restored several impressive wall reliefs – one of which was famously captured as a painting entitled “a jewel in the gebel” in 1929 by Norman de Garis Davies, on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art – but also has made the tomb accessible to scholars and visitors alike.\nComposed of a main hall and an inner burial chamber, the ‘T’-shaped layout of Anen’s tomb is typical of the 18th dynasty. The surviving wall reliefs depict a series of powerful images, including that of rekhyt birds (lapwings) with their anthropomorphized wings raised in adoration – a symbolic image that was unique to the New Kingdom period and represents bound captives, or the captured enemies of Egypt. A second exquisitely detailed image depicts Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye, receiving tribute from foreign visitors. The bowing figures beneath the thrones represent the Nine Bows, or the leaders of the foreign dynasties dominated by Egypt at the time: Minoa, Babylonia, Libya, Beduin, Mittani (the Assyrians), Kush, Irem (Upper Nubia), Iuntiu-seti (Nubian nomads) and Mentu-nu-setet (coastal Levant). The relief has an incredible amount of movement and symbolism in it, including a cat holding a duck by the neck beneath the throne of Queen Tiye, a leaping monkey and foreign enemies on King Amenhotep III’s foot cushion, literally being crushed under the weight of the pharaoh’s feet.\nThe wall reliefs were in a state of advanced deterioration, due in part to the roof collapsing and filling the tomb with rubble. This allowed for exposure to external elements such as flooding from rain and extreme light and heat. The reliefs had also undergone targeted vandalization, particularly in the case of the depiction of Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye, both of whom had their faces chiseled out. Additionally, sections of the reliefs had been cut from the walls and left discarded in fragments among the tomb’s remaining rubble, likely the result of failed attempts to steal them at some point in the 1930s when looting in the area was especially rife. This had predominantly affected the bottom half of the Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye wall relief, where looters had tried to remove the Nine Bows but ended up shattering seven of the figures.\nThe project conservator, Ewa Parandowska, began work first on the rekhyt relief, and owing to the repetitive nature of the imagery, was able to repair the missing sections of the relief relatively quickly. Fragments belonging to the relief that had been found in the tomb were re-adhered to the wall with specially prepared mortar and the relief as a whole was further stabilized to the wall with a thin layer of mortar that was applied along the edges of the painting. The wall surrounding the relief was reinforced and finished with lime mortar, and followed by a mechanical cleaning of the relief with brushes and scalpels.\nThe conservation of the relief of Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye was a more challenging task and also required some ingenuity on the part of Parandowska. Given the extent of the missing and damaged fragments, Parandowska obtained a high-resolution facsimile based on the Davies painting from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and used it as a guideline to restore the missing sections of the relief. These ‘fill-ins’ are differentiated from the rest of the relief by mimicking an ancient painting technique whereby craftsmen would sketch the relief images in red ink before filling them with color. The relief was also stabilized via injections of glue into the wall, the application of mortar around the edges of the image, and the filling in of any gaps or holes in the wall with a light-colored lime mortar.\nAs a final precaution, a protective display box was constructed over the two restored wall reliefs to protect them from human or environmental damage, and a series of low slanted walls were built up along the top edges of the tomb to divert rainwater. From a conservation perspective, these less invasive solutions were preferable over installing an entirely new roof in the tomb, which would have substantially altered the appearance and materials of its original walls and floor.\nSpeaking on the success of the restoration, project director Pinch-Brock explained that the tomb of Anen is a “good example of what can be done to restore a tomb apparently beyond help.” She further added, “ARCE conservation projects such as this one can open up otherwise inaccessible tombs to scholars, and further our knowledge of Egyptian history.”']"	['<urn:uuid:b1692823-a8a7-4224-8f9b-92c2c961e3c1>', '<urn:uuid:a1332813-ddd2-476b-bf3f-91e9399b863a>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	14	66	3891
18	How do you handle protein alternatives like tofu, and what safety standards apply?	Tofu is a valuable protein alternative that can be pan-fried with seasonings, while lentils and beans can be used in dishes like vegetarian chili. When storing these protein alternatives in commercial kitchens, they must be kept in airtight containers below 5°C, properly labeled for allergens and dietary restrictions (vegan, vegetarian), and stored separately from raw meats. The containers should be regularly checked for proper seals to prevent bacterial contamination.	['Unfortunately, producing meals which are edible requires certain skills. No matter what your reason is for deciding to cook, it sure is nice to be in the know. Follow these tips to improve your cooking skills.\nMake sure to keep your spices and herbs sealed in airtight containers, protected in a dark, cool place. Exposure to humidity, light and heat all affect the flavor of your spices. Most ground spices will keep their flavor for at least one year. Whole spices have a longer shelf-life and can hold their flavor for about three years. They can remain fresh longer if stored properly.\nWhen not in use, put your spices in an area that receives the lowest amount of light and heat. Exposing spices to heat, humidity, and light will shorten their lifespan. Always keep your spices in a dark and cool location to extend their longevity. These fresh spices will help add flavor to your meals, making them tastier!\nEven if you have screwed up in this way, there is a fix that will still let you use it right away. Mix 2 tablespoons water and 1 tablespoon cornstarch into a bowl. You can then add the solution to the sauce and it will become thicker. The mixture should be added slowly and constantly stirred so that it doesn’t get too thick.\nHave you found yourself regretting disposing of moldy fruits? Have you ever wondered if you could simply cut away the part with mold and keep the rest? Unfortunately, there isn’t any way to salvage fruit that has begun to rot. The mold and spoilage that you can see is only part of the problem with marginal-looking fruit; even the parts that appear pristine can be unsafe to eat.\nTo maintain nutrients and color in your vegetables, quickly steam them until just crisp-tender. When you cook veggies slowly, they lose many nutrients. These cooking techniques make the vegetables more healthy overall. Cooking vegetables as quickly as possible is key to preserving their nutrients.\nWhen you are grilling burgers, they sometimes lose their shape when they stick to your grill and become hard to remove. To prevent your burgers from sticking, brush the grill with oil prior to cooking.\nYou should use chicken broth when you are cooking your vegetables. Add extra flavor to your vegetables and keep them from sticking by using chicken broth instead of water. Chicken broth is economical and widely available.\nFor a high-protein diet, meat isn’t the only source available. Tofu, lentils and beans are great protein substitutes. You can find these ingredients easily and incorporate them to many different recipes. A delicious alternative to meat is tofu pan fried with your favorite seasonings. Boiling the beans and then including them in a hearty vegetarian chili is also a wonderful dish for a cold winter night.\nYou are now able to practice everything you have learned in this article. These tips can really help you make some very tasty foods! It does not matter why you are going to cook, just that you have a great time doing it, and then putting a meal on the table that was created by you. It is a reality that skills are necessary to be a great cook. On the other hand, a delicious dish makes the effort quite rewarding.', '10 Food Safety Storage Tips\nAdopting a systematic approach to food safety in commercial kitchens and restaurants is essential for maintaining public safety. So here are 10 strategies designed to help chefs and restaurant and kitchen managers store food safely while ensuring it remains fresh and appetising.\n1. First In, First Out. As deliveries or\nprepared foods are stored, they need to be rotated so the dates with the\nclosest use-by are readily seen by staff who then know which to use first.\nand Freezing. Cool rooms, freezers and refrigerators are machines that\nrequire maintenance. As per the manufacturer’s instructions, establish a\nprocess and schedule for checking they are functioning properly and maintaining\ntemperatures. When chilling food, this should be below 5C and when\nfreezing food below -18C. Do\nnot overcrowd your refrigerator or freezer. Air must circulate freely.\n3. Separate Different Foods. Store raw\nmeats away from fresh fruit and vegetables. This will simplify the management\nof your kitchen and reduce the spread of bacteria from one to the other. Store\nprepared foods above raw foods in the fridge.\n4. Store Food in Airtight Containers.\nAirtight containers assist in reducing the spread of harmful bacteria in the\nfridge and at room temperature. Ensure containers are clean and sanitary before\nstoring food in them.\n5. Maintain Seals. An airtight container\nis only as good as its seal. When washing, ensure seals are checked and discard\nany with cracks or excessive signs of wear. Bacteria will grow in the cracks\nand could easily spread to the contents of the container.\n6. Get Organised. Use high quality labels to clearly indicate –\na. Use by dates,\nb. Best before dates,\nd. Preparation dates,\ne. Storage dates,\nf. Who prepared it,\ng. Ingredients contained within,\nh. The contents contain known allergens,\nThe food is suitable for vegans, vegetarians,\npeople with celiac disease and other conditions.\n7. Use the Right Label Adhesive. When choosing\nlabels to indicate the above information, ensure the adhesive on those labels\nis suited to its application and is of a food safety standard. Specific label\nadhesives are manufactured to be either removable, permanent, dissolvable and\ndurable. Ensure the correct one is applied to suit the storage requirements of\nthe selected food.\n8. Be Extra Cautious with High Risk Foods. The temperature danger zone with food is between 5C and 60C. Bacteria readily grows in this range. Dairy products, meat, seafood, prepared casseroles, roasts, stews and soups are high risk foods and must not be stored within this range.\na. Keep cool desserts, sliced meats, dairy products, sandwiches and salads below 5C.\nKeep roasts, stews, casseroles, curries and\nsoups above 60C.\n9. Cover Food. This keeps dust, insects\nand airborne bacteria away from food and is a simple technique for practicing\neffective food safety.\n10. Maintain Safe Temperatures of Displayed Foods. Displayed food is at particular risk of falling within the temperature danger zone. Using a quality food thermometer, periodically conduct temperature checks to see that displayed food is above 60C or below 5C.\nMaintaining food safety standards for stored foods is an essential element for maintaining public health. Following the suggestions above will help chefs and restaurant and kitchen managers to protect their patrons and clients. However, it’s always a good idea to live by the maxim – if in doubt, throw it out!']	['<urn:uuid:aba58b83-1354-4a6a-ba88-a58360de00ad>', '<urn:uuid:bdc9f9ba-b8eb-4e0a-8e20-3fc4e60d115e>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	13	69	1107
19	What are the benefits of industrial waste management, and how can microalgae systems contribute to sustainable solutions?	Industrial waste management through cradle-to-cradle concepts helps conserve natural resources and reduces environmental impact through full utilization of all waste types. Microalgae systems offer an innovative solution by efficiently removing nutrients from wastewater while producing biomass that can be used for multiple purposes including biofuels, fertilizers, and biopolymers. The algae-bacteria symbiosis in these systems also reduces energy demands in treatment plants by providing oxygen for aerobic bacteria through photosynthesis, while bacteria provide carbon dioxide for algae growth.

The development of science and technology has increased human capacity\nto extract resources from nature and it is only recently that industries are being held accountable for the detrimental effects the waste they produce has on the environment. Increased governmental research, regulation and corporate accountability are digging up issues pertaining to pollution control and waste treatment and environmental protection.\nThe traditional approach for clinical waste, agricultural waste, industrial waste, and municipal waste are depleting our natural resources. The main objective of this book is to conserve the natural resources by approaching 100 % full utilization of all types of wastes by cradle – to - cradle concepts, using Industrial Ecology methodology documented with case studies. Sustainable development and environmental protection cannot be achieved without establishing the concept of industrial ecology. The main tools necessary for establishing Industrial Ecology and sustainable development will be covered in the book. The concept of “industrial ecology” will help the industrial system to be managed and operated more or less like a natural ecosystem hence causing as less damage as possible to the surrounding environment.\n*Numerous case studies allow the reader to adapt concepts according to personal\n*Reveals innovative technologies for the conservation of natural resources\n*The only book which provides an integrated approach for sustainable development including tools, methodology, and indicators for sustainable development\nA major environmental and economic problem of the 21st century is the waste generated from industry. The development of science and technology has increased human capacity to extract resources from nature. Extracted resources are then processed, used and exposed of. It is only recently that industries are being held accountable for the detrimental effects the waste they produce has on the environment. Issues of pollution control, waste treatment and environmental protection are being addressed because of increased governmental research, regulation and corporate accountability. Ever since the Earth Summit of Rio de Janeiro in 1992, much has been written about sustainability while guidelines for implementation have been scarce. Industrial ecology is the science of sustainability as it pertains to improving the efficiency of human use of the ecosystem. Issues intrinsic to industrial ecology and sustainability are economic benefits, technological availability, environmental conditions and social perspectives. Concentrated on industrial ecology, this book details the need for the conservation of natural resources, waste utilization, and the use of renewable natural resources in industry. Beginning with guidelines for developing sustainability indicators and providing guidelines for the cradle-to-cradle concept in which industries partner to reuse and reduce waste, it provides an integrated approach to sustainable development for the 21st Century.\nAbout the Author\nDr. Haggar has more than 30 years experience in Energy and Environmental Consulting and University teaching.

However, a paradigm shift in the past few years has led to a new concept of wastewater, not as a problem but as a source of energy and other precious resources, including water itself.\nWastewater is increasingly seen as one of the solutions to many of the big sustainability and climate change issues we are facing. Researchers around the world are developing technologies that make products recovered from wastewater both socially acceptable and economically viable. The mundane world of wastewater treatment has suddenly become the glamorous world of the cyclical, green economy.\nOne of the stars of this new paradigm is microalgal, attracting considerable attention because of its positive characteristics for biotechnology systems, such as wastewater treatment and biofuel production.\nWhy are microalgae-based technologies so attractive?\nWhat really makes the use of algae a thriving technology is that these microorganisms have the potential to efficiently remove nutrients from wastewater, and provide a biomass energy source. Additionally, when combined with the conventional activated sludge systems, the algae-bacteria symbiosis can reduce the electrical energy demands from aeration, which can represent more than 50 percent of the total energy of wastewater treatment plants.\nThe positive interactions are clear when microalgae provide, through photosynthesis, the oxygen necessary for aerobic bacteria to biodegrade organic pollutants, consuming in turn the carbon dioxide released from the bacterial activity.\nBiomass produced in photobioreactors can be used for several purposes, including biogas substrate, biofuels, fertilizers and biopolymers, which can be converted into packaging materials, and have the advantage of being renewable. While the application of by-products derived from algae are technically feasible, their economic feasibility is still under discussion.\nPositive aspects and drawbacks\nThe great advantage of this biotechnology is that most of the algae species proven to be effective are easily available, especially in countries that lack infrastructure for wastewater treatment. As photosynthesis is a key process for microalgae cultivation, these systems are ideal for regions with high temperatures and sunlight exposure.\nThe use of a microalgae-bacteria symbiosis has been proved to provide good quality treated water by removing organic matter, nutrients (including nitrogen and phosphorus, the main causes of eutrophication in water bodies), and some hazardous contaminants and pathogens. The composition of harvested biomass is directly related to the quality of valuable products obtainable from it.\nThe main challenges for the application of microalgae in wastewater treatment are the harvesting of the algae, due to the settling characteristics and operational conditions; the control of biomass composition is complicated by the selection of the desired species; while the definition of an optimal ratio of algae and bacteria biomass, micro-pollutants removal, and the possible need for external CO2 present additional obstacles.\nAlthough there are several studies on this topic, further clarifications are needed to prove the feasibility of microalgae-based systems in full scale. What are the perspectives for the next years? Is microalgae application in wastewater treatment a promising alternative for our current scenario?\nGiven global population growth, increasing consumption and scarce natural resources, we need to develop effective resource recovery technologies in order to promote sustainable progress. Algae-based technologies are great options for treating wastewater and generating useful products with low cost and high efficiency. Further research should be encouraged in order to expand the application of these alternatives worldwide and enhance current systems.\nIn this way, these novel technologies will contribute to a better understanding of the water-energy nexus in a sustainable way, and while inspire the development of innovative solutions in the future.\nThe Workshop on Microalgal Based Wastewater Treatment Facilities at the 13th IWA Leading Edge Technology Conference on Water and Wastewater Technologies was a step in the right direction, as it provided experts from different countries the opportunity to share their findings and set research priorities to resolve remaining challenges around microalgae’s applicability.']"	['<urn:uuid:a591843d-ced0-436a-ae0b-a9dc6329e025>', '<urn:uuid:23886b77-dbb2-4255-86fd-6bad69b25a39>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	17	77	1441
20	How does genetic testing help diagnose diseases and what new methods exist?	Genetic testing identifies changes in chromosomes or genes associated with hereditary disorders, helping confirm diagnoses and differentiate between similar conditions. Currently, CMA (Constitutional Microarray Analysis) is the standard first-tier test for conditions like developmental delays and autism. However, new methods like Low Pass Genome Sequencing (LP-GS) are emerging as promising alternatives, offering 100% clinical sensitivity and specificity while being 50% more cost-effective than microarray testing. LP-GS can detect various genetic changes including deletions, duplications, and other abnormalities that sometimes go undetected by traditional CMA testing.	"['CMA has been the first-tier test for developmental delay/intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorders and multiple congenital anomalies but recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) may one day change that standard. Studies have been performed on NGS as an alternative test but costs are of concern particularly with higher depth sequencing (WES, WGS).\nA recent publication by Alka Chaubey and team evaluated the potential of Low Pass Genome Sequencing (LP-GS) for detection of CNVs as a replacement to constitutional microarray analysis. The team utilized BioDiscovery’s NxClinical software for CNV detection from the LP-GS test. The authors stated that data analysis for CNV from NGS has been a challenge for clinical laboratories for the last decade. The team evaluated a number of different tools and found NxClinical to have superiority in CNV detection and classification.\n""An evaluation of an Edico home brew tool, Variantyx, Golden helix, and BioDiscovery’s NxClinical 5.0 software on the 5X LP-GS data set revealed NxClinical software to have superiority of CNV visualization, analysis, and classification of CNVs for reporting (unpublished data). In addition, challenging samples, such as a mosaic interstitial deletion, mosaic trisomy, and mosaic marker chromosome delineation, were only identified by NxClinical software (Table 1).""\nIn this study, clinical validation of the LP-GS sequencing method with 5x coverage for sequence variants and copy number events was performed using 78 unique samples that included well-characterized Coriell HapMap samples (NA12878, NA12891, and NA12892). Control samples contained a variety of types and sizes of clinically relevant CNVs and AOH such as trisomies, interstitial and terminal deletions and duplications, mosaic deletions and duplications, absence of heterozygosity, and unbalanced translocations.\nThe clinical specificity and clinical sensitivity of relevant CNVs was 100% in 33 samples with previously identified CNVs via CMA. In addition, an intragenic single-exon Duchenne muscular dystrophe (DMD exon 55) deletion was detected via LP-GS and NxClinical but had not been detected by CMA due to a lack of exonic probe coverage on the array platform. The test also picked up pathogenic CNVs that were missed by CMA. Seven samples with AOH/LCSH detected via CMA were concordant with the LP-GS test.\nDiagnostic yield via LP-GS in a lab setting was evaluated on 331 samples processed at PerkinElmer Genomics Laboratory in Branford, CT. The diagnostic yield of the 5x LP-GS test (17.2%) for pathogenic/likely pathogenic events was comparable to published CMA yield of 5-18% depending on array platform used. In one case of dual diagnosis of Kleefstra syndrome and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, the array platform had picked up the EHMT1 intragenic loss but had missed the two exon deletion in DMD. Both these deletions were detected by LP-GS using NxClinical’s MSR algorithm.\nNxClinical screenshot from Chaubey A et al.

J Mol Diagn. 2020 Apr 25. showing EHMT1 loss (A) and deletion of two exons in DMD (B) , both picked up by LP-GS and NxClincial.\nA cost analysis revealed a 50% cost savings of 5x LP-GS over microarray which stated by the authors is more cost-effective than any CMA platform being used for clinical testing worldwide. The authors have demonstrated that LP-GS with variant detection and interpretation using NxClinical can be a good alternative in terms of accuracy, diagnostic yield, and cost in replacing CMA for constitutional cases.', 'What is genetic testing?\nGenetic testing identifies changes in one or more chromosomes or genes associated with a hereditary disorder. The results of a genetic test can confirm or exclude a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person’s chance of developing or passing on a disease to one’s children. There are many genetic changes associated with different types of diseases. The specific test will vary based on a person’s individual circumstances.\nWho should consider genetic testing?\nThe indications for genetic testing are diverse. In almost all areas of medicine doctors encounter clinical disorders caused (at least in part) by genetic changes. Genetic testing is indicated when a patient or a member of his/her family is affected by any of the following:\n- Eye Diseases\n- Vascular and Connective Tissue Disorders\n- Heart Diseases\n- Brain Malformations / Neuronal Migration Disorders\n- Hepatic and Pancreatic Diseases\n- Pulmonary Diseases\n- Nephrology Endocrinology and Electrolyte Disorders\n- Neurogenetic Disorders\n- Neuromuscular Disorders\n- Mental Retardation and Dysmorphology\n- Metabolic Diseases\n- Hereditary Cancer Syndromes\n- Severe Recessive Childhood Diseases\nHow is genetic testing helpful?\n- Confirmation of diagnosis: Many medical conditions share identical or similar traits or symptoms. Genetic diagnosis can help confirm or exclude a specific cause and differentiate a particular disorder from other medical conditions, thereby affecting your clinical diagnosis.\n- Testing at-risk family members: Genetic diagnosis in one family member may enable testing of relatives at risk of inheriting or having inherited a genetic change. This knowledge may have a direct effect on treatment, therapy, and preventative care.\n- Exclusion of risk: Genetic testing can also show that you have not inherited the genetic change responsible for causing a condition in your family, and that you need no further clinical care.\n- Treatment tailored to your needs: Genetic diagnosis enables your doctor to identify and evaluate your personal medical needs, and can help fine-tune your treatment, therapy, and follow-up care.\n- Meaningful and accurate advice: Genetic diagnosis means meaningful and accurate counseling for you and your family and enables your physician to estimate the risk of recurrence in your family.\n- Informed family planning: Genetic diagnosis makes it possible for your doctor to make recommendations regarding family planning and the possibility of prenatal or pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.\nWhat are the limitations of genetic testing?\nGenetic testing can provide only limited information about an inherited disease. Testing cannot always determine:\n- If an individual will develop clinical symptoms of a disease\n- The severity of symptoms should they develop\n- Whether symptoms will worsen or improve with therapy\nThere is also often a lack of treatment strategies for genetic diseases subsequent to diagnosis.\nA clinical professional can explain to you in detail the benefits, risks, and limitations of a particular test. It is important that any person considering genetic testing understand and weigh these factors before making a decision. Genetic counseling is a good way to start.\nHow much does genetic testing cost?\nThe cost of a genetic analysis depends on the type of test. Clinicians and patients are welcome to request pricing for genetic analyses performed at MGZ. Please note that testing can be ordered only by a qualified medical professional.\nFor detailed cost and billing information, please click here.']"	['<urn:uuid:a5a65ac3-c559-477d-a457-5da15c56b037>', '<urn:uuid:07da6d5b-46fa-4841-9ce7-15e85063e16b>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	12	85	1104
21	what difference between feudal system manor system duties relationships involved	Feudalism focused on relationships between nobles and vassals, while manorialism dealt with relationships between lords/vassals and peasants/serfs. In the feudal system, there was a chain of obligations flowing from Pope to Kings to Lords to populace, with duties going both ways. The manor system involved peasants working the lord's lands and maintaining the estate in exchange for protection and certain entitlements.	"['""The Origins of Fuedalism"" by Baron Hrolf Herjolffsen OP.\nThis article was submitted to me by the author for inclusion in this set of files, called Stefan\'s Florilegium.\nThese files are available on the Internet at: http://www.florilegium.org\nCopyright to the contents of this file remains with the author.\nWhile the author will likely give permission for this work to be reprinted in SCA type publications, please check with the author first or check for any permissions granted at the end of this file.\nMark S. Harris...AKA:..Stefan li Rous\nstefan at florilegium.org\nby Baron Hrolf Herjolffsen, OP\nFollowing on from last month’s piece, the secular medieval notion of fealty was a natural development from the philosophical notion of the Great Chain of Being.\nAfter the collapse of the Western Roman state, a void was left in the civic life of Europe. This area still relied on the Eastern Roman Empire as the source of culture and wealth. However, the indifference of the Byzantines to the military plight of much of the abandoned parts of the Empire, in particular those parts not on a Mediterranean coast (Lewis 1951), eventually led to a new independence of attitude. New rulers, such as Charlemagne, while slavishly aping Byzantine garb and manners, became very independent in other matters. When this was combined with the long-term attempts of the Bishops of Rome to gain more power for their office, the result was the birth of a new system (Duchesne 1972).\nThe main stimulus for this new system was military. Due to the usual pressures from central Asia, a whole series of barbarian cultures were again impacting on the West. The former barbarians (Visigoths, Franks and Burgunds for instance) had adopted as much of the paraphernalia of Rome as they could and now found themselves as representatives of ‘civilised’ culture attempting to hold on to land (Veyne 1992). At the same time, the Muslim tide was flowing up the Iberian peninsula and seemed unstoppable. The Vandals of North Africa and the Visigoths of Spain were both fast disappearing.\nThe maintenance of a military force is expensive. Few rulers had any standing forces at this time, and most campaigns in pre-modern times took place in times when people could be spared from harvest (Contamine 1984). However, neither non-horticulturally based barbarians nor religious zealots follow these schedules. This meant a permanent military force had to be raised in order for the European cultures to survive. Given the lack of a cohesive tax base, and indeed the lack of coinage and a money economy, this could not be done by a central government (even where this existed). Such economy as existed was tied to a local exchange circulation of goods on a village level. Thus the creation of a military force was achieved by grouping farmers together into an administrative unit that had a large enough surplus of production that it could afford to support and equip a single fighter. This man was their ‘servant’ of war – a knight (Bloch 1975, Reynolds, 1996 #224). He was paid a ‘fee’ for this service. Naturally, as time went by the new monopoly of violence that the knights enjoyed led them to reverse this status and to seek a justification for their role. This is naturally a very simplified view of this process.\nThe original collection of farmers who had been grouped together to support a knight became tied to the land that was connected to that knight. If any one of them were to leave, then the land may no longer be able to support the knight. Thus the ‘fee’ became what we now call the ‘fief’. The professional military were dependant on the economic well being of ‘their’ peasants, and the wise among them worked hard at ensuring that those in their charge prospered. Unfortunately, there were not many feudal lords who fulfilled this criterion.\nThe new states that were springing up derived a common spiritual authority from the Church, which was rapidly leaving behind its Orthodox beliefs and striking out in new directions. One of these directions involved the notion of the Great Chain of Being (Lovejoy 1970)(see last issue). Whereas Orthodox Christianity (like the Celtic) relied heavily on the Synod (a council of Bishops) in decision making, the attempt by the Bishops of Rome to hold temporal and spiritual power drew heavily on a notion of centralised power. Whilst the doctrine of Papal Infallibility was not yet fully accepted (indeed, it was often decreed as heretical) the Popes had begun to exercise strong control where they could. In particular, they wished to extend this over all of the Christian Ecumen. As a means of giving spiritual blessing to this control, they invoked the Great Chain.\nSeeing that God stood above all, and a direct line extended down to the lowest plants, then Mankind had a distinct place in the Chain. However, as all could see, all Mankind was not equal. For a start Man was above Woman (Leyser 1995) – a position that was well supported by scripture. As well, the spiritual was obviously above the temporal and the lord above the serf. Thus a chain of obligation and loyalty flowed from the Pope to the Kings, from them to their Lords and from them to the populace. This line of ties, bonds, and obligations was thus seen as being blessed by God. A breach of them thus involved a denial of God and, at least, severe censure. In the most extreme case, this meant excommunication (several monarchs received this penalty, John of England being one).\nNote that this was not a one way street. Just as God had duty to man, the King had duty to his vassals. A breach either way was regarded seriously, although very few serfs had the means to pursue remedy.\nOnce the Great Chain began to be questioned by heretical sects, this also called into question ties of fealty. Many of the peasant movements of the Middle Ages were tied up in this double radicalism of spiritual and secular reformism (Lambert 1992, Le Roy Ladurie, 1978 #345). Once the Great Chain collapsed under the impact of secular humanism and Protestantism, support for the ideas of fealty and vassalage likewise evaporated. This was first to be observed in southern Germany (which started its conversion to a wage economy from the 13th century) (Cipolla 1976), but was not to be finally extinguished until the 20th century (in Russia).\nBloch, Marc. 1975.

Serfs who occupied land belonging to the lord were required to work the land, and in return received certain entitlements. The manor system was made up of three types of land: demesne, dependent, and free peasant land.\nWhat was the purpose of the manor system?\nThe Manor System refers to a system of agricultural estates in the Middle Ages, owned by a Lord and run by serfs or peasants. The Lords provided safety and protection from outside threats and the serfs or peasants provided labor to run the manor.\nWhat best describes a manor?\nnoun. (in England) a landed estate or territorial unit, originally of the nature of a feudal lordship, consisting of a lord’s demesne and of lands within which he has the right to exercise certain privileges, exact certain fees, etc. any similar territorial unit in medieval Europe, as a feudal estate.\nWhat is an example of Manorialism?\ncould not without leave quit the manor and could be reclaimed by process of law if he did. The strict contention of law deprived him of all right to hold property, and in many cases he was subject to certain degrading incidents [he] paid for his holding in money, in labour, and in agrarian produce.\nWhat were the four main parts of the manor?\nA manor was usually comprised of tracts of agricultural land, a village whose inhabitants worked that land, and a manor house where the lord who owned or controlled the estate lived. Manors might also have had woods, orchards, gardens, and lakes or ponds where fish could be found.\nWhat was life like on a manor?\nThe people living on the manor were from all “levels” of Feudalism: Peasants, Knights, Lords, and Nobles. There were usually large fields around the Manor used for livestock, crops, and hunting. The only people allowed to hunt in the manor’s forests were nobles.\nWhat is the difference between feudalism and the manor system?\nRelationship: Feudalism deals with the relationship between nobles and vassals. Manorialism deals with the relationship between the vassals, or the lords, and the peasants or serfs.\nWhat is a manor and what are its benefits?\nBenefits that a medieval manor provided were the serfs tended the lord’s lands, cared for his animals, and performed other tasks to maintain the estate.\nWhat is the most important building on a manor?\nA manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor. The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system; within its great hall were held the lord’s manorial courts, communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets.\nWhat is the difference between Villeins and freemen?\nVilleins were tied to the land and could not move away without their lord’s consent. Villeins typically had to pay special taxes and fines that freemen were exempt from, for example, “filstingpound” (an insurance against corporal punishment) and “leyrwite” (fine for bearing a child outside of wedlock).\nWhat did peasants drink?\nThe villagers drank water and milk. The water from a river was unpleasant to drink and the milk did not stay fresh for long. The main drink in a medieval village was ale.\nWhat is the difference between Manor and manner?\nA manor is a mansion or stately home. A manner is a characteristic way of doing something. These words are homophones (words that sound the same but have different meanings), so it’s easy to mix them up.\nWhat is the difference between a manor and a mansion?\nYes, a ” manor ” usually denotes a country house surrounded by acres of land, and its origins date back to the days of feudal lords. A ” mansion ” is nowadays simply another word for a very large house and tends to be used a lot by estate agents in order to inflate the selling price of otherwise relatively ordinary houses.\nWhat does manor mean in Old English?\nManor comes from the Old French manoir, meaning “dwelling place,” but a manor isn’t just any old dwelling place. In the days when people still had titles of nobility, the houses and the grounds of the nobles were known as manors.']"	['<urn:uuid:05a1a6b6-771a-4773-9090-0494e1baabd1>', '<urn:uuid:87939c9d-7ed1-4e00-aadd-5091e5ff964b>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	10	61	2190
22	How do household recycling reduce waste, and what energy challenges affect sustainability?	In household recycling, waste can be reduced to 1.36 pounds per person per day through proper recycling practices and auditing, well below the average of 4.4 pounds. However, sustainability faces significant energy challenges, particularly in sectors like cryptocurrency mining which consumes 128.84 TWh annually, more than Argentina's total energy usage, largely from non-renewable sources.	['As the Assistant Editor of Earth911.com, I look through hundreds upon hundreds of stories about recycling and the green sphere monthly. It goes without saying that I should know the ins and outs of recycling and reducing my consumption. I spend 40 hours (or more) each week talking about it, but how well am I doing it outside of the office?\nI recently volunteered to undergo a trash audit to figure out just how well I have implemented my own knowledge of household recycling. Theoretically, my recycling bin should be impeccable: no contaminants, no haphazard recyclables in the trash.\nSo, for one week, I tossed as normal and surveyed just how much my household produced. Perhaps I’m throwing myself under the bus, but what I found was that even as an expert in the field, I was shocked at what my household still misses on a weekly basis.\n- Audit dates: Feb. 4 – 11 (7 days)\n- Household description: Located in Phoenix, the home is three bedrooms and two-and-a-half bathrooms\n- Occupants: 1 male, 1 female, 1 dog\n- Recycling program: Single-stream curbside recycling, collected every Monday.\n- Recycling material details: Plastics – Accepts plastics #1-7, excluding plastic bags or film of any kind with or without a recycling symbol; no plastic pipes; no pool chemical/household hazardous waste containers; no foam peanuts or bubble wrap. Paper – Accepts office paper, newspapers, magazine, telephone books, cardboard, chipboard, milk/juice cartons, commercial mail and shredded paper. Metal – Accepts aluminum cans, clean pie plates and foil, steel cans, metal hangers, aerosol cans (excluding spray paint, pesticides and over cleaners). Glass – Accepts food and beverage glass and jars only, and lids must be removed. Yard waste or food scraps – Not accepted.\nFor one week, my roommate and I threw away as normal. While my roommate and I have very different diets (I am vegetarian), we are not a cooking household and do not compost, as there is never really enough compostable food scraps available.\nDuring the audit period, we did some light shopping for groceries, household items, clothing and dog toys. One of the top things we throw out is packaging – from paperboard to plastic film. However, our 30-gallon recycling bin quickly fills up. In fact, we empty our recycling two times for every one time we empty the trash. In the case of this audit, we never emptied the trash can, but it was full on the last day of the weeklong test period. The recycling bin was emptied on the fourth day but was already full again at the end of the audit.\nHow to Do a Trash Audit\nThough this isn’t the most pleasant job, a trash audit is a necessary step to really getting a grasp on what you currently throw out, and more importantly, what you can save from the trashcan. The audit itself is simple, just follow these easy steps:\n1. Pick a time period – A week is a good place to start.\n2. Get everyone on board – If they live in your house and they make trash, they are involved, so catch ‘em up to speed.\n3. Throw stuff away – Go about your normal routine, and throw away what you usually do. It is important that you be honest with yourself and not try to be on your “best behavior.” Remember, you are trying to get an accurate measurement of your waste output.\n4. Weigh in – If possible, weigh your trash. Each time you take a trash bag out of the house, plop it on the scale. This way you can have a baseline for comparison (sort of like “before” and “after” photos when you’re starting a new workout program). Though you will visually be able to see your trash dwindle, the satisfaction of cold, hard facts is the icing on the cake.\n5. Put on some gloves – Check daily to see what you threw away that could have been recycled, composted, reused or avoided (this part is the “eeewwww” moment, but don’t be deterred by what you find).\n6. Get graphical – Make a list, chart, pie graph, power point…whatever you want. Just write down your findings, and use those findings to make a plan. What can you recycle that you are currently tossing in the trash? What can be composted? What can be reused and, in turn, what didn’t need to be there in the first place?\nPost-audit Recycling Stats\n- Final weight of recyclables: 12.8 pounds\n- Number of recycled items: 108 items\nI was surprised to find that most of my recycled items were mixed paper, and the bulk (40 out of 57 items) of this paper waste was commercial mail. If I opted out of commercial mail services through the various mail preference programs, I could possibly reduce my recyclable household waste by as much as 37 percent!\nThe good news is that there were no contaminants in my recycling bin. All of the items were also reasonably clean and accepted in our curbside program. The biggest shocker I found was the small number of plastic items recycled. Most of these were plastic juice bottles or milk jugs. I initially thought plastic was the No. 1 type of material we recycled. But as you’ll later read, it’s quite the opposite.\nPost-audit Trash Stats\n- Final weight of trash: 6.3 pounds\n- Number of trashed items: 133*\n*This figure includes individual items such as cheese wrappers and paper towels.\nNow for the bad news. While sifting through the trash can, I found an extremely high amount of materials we threw out that are recyclable but not accepted in our curbside program. I believe that my household is in the mindset of if it’s not accepted, just toss it. The biggest item we’re throwing out? Plastic film and bags. Furthermore, I found several materials with parts that were recyclable, such as paperboard packaging.\nAs I said prior to the audit, my household does not prepare many home-cooked meals, so the food waste was minimal. Out of the 19 food items that were thrown out, only six were compostable (slices of molded bread, two jalapeño peppers and an orange peel). The other food items included spoiled lunch meat and cheese.\nBut the real eye-opener came at the bottom of the trash can, when I found the “other” items: wine corks and (gasp!) an incandescent light bulb. While this bulb doesn’t contain mercury like a CFL, its energy-efficient alternative, it is still a hazardous material that can be recycled through other local programs.\nAccording to the University of Colorado, the average person generates 4.4 pounds per trash daily. Currently, my household is below average at just 1.36 pounds of waste per person, per day, including recyclables. But this is just what we’re tossing at home. I have to factor in the amount of time spend outside of the home, this includes work, gym and social activities.\nThe biggest lesson I learned from my audit is that almost half of the trash I am tossing out is recyclable in other programs. Because I regularly bring along reusable bags while shopping, I tend to overlook the plastic bags and film generated in other places, such as product packaging. But all of these plastic items can be recycled at my local grocery store.\nIt starts with communication with those living in the household. While I may designate a specific area for materials not accepted in our program, we will never truly reduce our footprint if everyone isn’t on board.\nMy overall trash audit grade? B-', 'As the world becomes more conscious of sustainability, the environmental impact of industries and businesses is under the microscope. Cryptocurrency is one of the newer and rapidly evolving industries that has been called out for its high energy consumption and carbon footprint. However, the cryptocurrency sector is also built on innovation, decentralization, and financial democratization. The challenge is to balance these two seemingly opposing goals – sustainability and innovation. In this article, we will explore the environmental concerns of cryptocurrency and ways to mitigate its impact while continuing to promote its benefits.\nRead more: Silvergate Collapse Dragging Down Bitcoin Volume\nCryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses encryption techniques to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds. It is decentralized and operates on a peer-to-peer network that enables secure, fast, and anonymous transactions. Cryptocurrency has gained popularity in recent years, with bitcoin being the most well-known example. However, the process of generating cryptocurrency, known as mining, requires significant computational power, which consumes a massive amount of energy.\nThe amount of energy consumed by cryptocurrency mining has sparked concerns about its environmental impact. According to a 2021 report by the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the annual energy consumption of bitcoin mining alone is estimated to be around 128.84 TWh, which is more than the energy consumption of Argentina. The high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, as the majority of the energy used comes from non-renewable sources like coal and natural gas.\nThe Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency\nCryptocurrency mining is a highly energy-intensive process that requires specialized computer equipment and software. The process involves solving complex mathematical problems to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The first miner to solve the puzzle is rewarded with a certain amount of cryptocurrency.\nTo mine cryptocurrency, miners need to use powerful computers, which consume a considerable amount of energy. The energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is a function of the computing power used and the time it takes to solve the problem. As the difficulty of the problem increases, more computing power is required, which leads to a higher energy consumption.\nThe high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has a significant impact on the environment. Most of the energy used to power cryptocurrency mining comes from non-renewable sources like coal and natural gas. The combustion of fossil fuels leads to the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming and climate change. The increase in greenhouse gas emissions from cryptocurrency mining is a concern as it undermines global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.\nMitigating the Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency\nThe environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining can be mitigated by adopting sustainable practices. Some of the ways to reduce the energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining are:\nUsing renewable energy sources: One of the most effective ways to reduce the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining is to use renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Some cryptocurrency mining companies are already using renewable energy to power their operations. For example, the cryptocurrency mining company, Square, has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030.\nDeveloping energy-efficient mining equipment: Cryptocurrency mining companies can reduce their energy consumption by developing energy-efficient mining equipment. For example, some companies are developing ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that are designed to consume less energy than traditional computer processors.\nImplementing proof-of-stake consensus mechanism: Another way to reduce the energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is to implement the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Proof-of-stake is an alternative to proof-of-work, which is the current consensus mechanism used by most cryptocurrencies. Proof-of-stake does not require miners to solve complex mathematical problems to verify transactions. Instead, it relies on a random selection process to choose a validator who is responsible for verifying transactions. Validators are required to hold a certain amount of cryptocurrency, which acts as a stake. If a validator acts maliciously, their stake is forfeited. The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is less energy-intensive than proof-of-work, making it a more sustainable alternative.\nCarbon offsetting: Cryptocurrency mining companies can offset their carbon emissions by investing in renewable energy projects or purchasing carbon credits. Carbon offsetting is a way to neutralize the carbon emissions associated with cryptocurrency mining by investing in sustainable projects that reduce carbon emissions.\nBalancing Sustainability and Innovation\nCryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry by providing financial democratization and decentralization. However, this cannot come at the expense of the environment. The challenge is to balance sustainability with innovation. The cryptocurrency industry needs to take responsibility for its environmental impact and take steps to mitigate its carbon footprint. It is essential to recognize that sustainability and innovation are not mutually exclusive goals, but rather complementary.\nSustainability is a key factor in the long-term success of cryptocurrency. As the world becomes more conscious of the environment, consumers are looking for sustainable products and services. The cryptocurrency industry needs to recognize this trend and take steps to reduce its carbon footprint. By adopting sustainable practices, the cryptocurrency industry can attract a more environmentally conscious audience.\nCryptocurrency has the potential to transform the financial industry by providing financial democratization and decentralization. However, the high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has sparked concerns about its environmental impact. To balance sustainability and innovation, the cryptocurrency industry needs to take responsibility for its carbon footprint and adopt sustainable practices. By using renewable energy sources, developing energy-efficient mining equipment, implementing proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and carbon offsetting, the cryptocurrency industry can mitigate its environmental impact. Sustainability is not a trade-off for innovation, but rather a complementary goal that is essential for the long-term success of the cryptocurrency industry.']	['<urn:uuid:0ccbaff9-fd6f-4d54-9baa-9035dfec69ac>', '<urn:uuid:16d423b7-32cb-493a-822d-c068233478c4>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	12	54	2212
23	What are the key differences between using bounce wall techniques and the three-light setup for portrait photography, particularly in terms of how they handle shadows and lighting control?	The bounce wall and three-light setup handle shadows and lighting control differently. With bounce wall techniques, light from the flash is reflected off a surface (like a wall or specialized reflector) to create scattered, softer illumination that surrounds the subject, reducing stark shadows. This can be achieved with solutions like the BOUNCE-WALL or DIY alternatives using aluminum foil. In contrast, the three-light setup uses three distinct light sources: a key light (usually hard light) that defines shadows, a fill light (usually soft light) that reduces contrast by filling in shadows, and a separation light that creates a halo effect to separate the subject from the background. The three-light setup offers more precise control through lighting ratios (like 1:1 for even lighting or higher ratios for more contrast), while bounce wall techniques primarily focus on diffusing a single light source.	"[""Flash light projected directly onto the subject of a portrait creates overwhelming illumination on the face, stark shadows and flat, ugly light. So the light has to be made softer and more diffused - something achieved e.g. with indirect flashing. For example: the flash can be directed onto a wall behind the photographer and the light is then projected back off the wall. The illumination area is greater, the light is scattered, and the shadows are softer. It is more like the light is surrounding the subject, instead of bundled light hitting the front of the subject.\nBut there is not always a wall or ceiling available to act as a reflector. Especially not at outdoor shoots, like weddings. That's why there are the most varied solutions available that act as mobile diffusers or reflectors for flashes. There are yogurt cups or small tents made of hazy material that can be attached to a flash. Some people use little cardboard cards to fasten them to the flash.\nHowever, none of these solutions are really satisfying, because they do not really allow the light to be molded to the purpose. A truly revolutionary solution to this problem is the BOUNCE-WALL by Sunbounce. The BOUNCE-WALL is a real reflective surface, just like the big Sunbounce reflectors. It even has the same surface, such as ZEBRA = gold/silver mix. This mini Sunbouncer can be adjusted almost three-dimensionally. It is attached to an arm that can be fastened to the camera. The arm or boom is simply screwed securely onto the camera tripod thread, just like a normal flash bracket. Just stick the flash into the flash shoe and direct it towards the BOUNCE-WALL. No additional cables or remote flash triggers are needed.\nThe BOUNCE-WALL is mounted on a ball head and can be tilted in any direction. And the reflector surface can be replaced, so silver, gold or white surfaces can be used. With the adjustable reflector area and the exchangeable surfaces, any light that you want can be created.\nOf course, this amazing item has a price - which is why I made my own DIY BOUNCE-WALL for 99 cents.\nThis is all I needed:\n- a wire coat hanger\n- a piece of cardboard\n- aluminum foil\n- clothes pins\n- adhesive tape\n- an old tripod or adapter screw\nAnd this is how I built my DIY BOUNCE-WALL:\nI took a piece of sturdy cardboard the size of a standard sheet of paper (DIN A4) and covered it with simple household aluminum foil.\nI completely straightened the wire of the coat hanger and then bent it exactly in the middle. At the two ends of the wire, I bent a short piece, about 3 cm. Then I placed one end over the other and wrapped them with adhesive tape.\nAt the other end of the wire, I wrapped the two sides with adhesive tape, as shown in the photo. I left a little space for the screw. The adapter screw has to fit through here to attach the arm to the bottom of the camera.\nNext I screwed the wire under the camera and, as shown in the photo, bent the wire up at a right angle.\nThen I turned and bent the horizontal piece, wrapped in tape, such that it was at about a 45 degree angle to the shooting axis.\nI used a clothes pin to fasten the reflector surface to the horizontal, taped piece. Then I moved it to the desired angle, e.g. 45 degrees.\nI put the flash on the camera's flash shoe and turned it such that it was pointed directly at the reflector.\nIt was that easy to make my DIY BOUNCE-WALL out of items found in any household."", 'In this article, we’re going to talk about indoor photography lighting tips and tricks.\nFirst, we’ll begin by explaining the two different types of light in photography, then move onto what the three light set up is, next explain lighting ratios and finally share different lighting techniques you can use when shooting indoors.\n|Hard light photo by Robbie W T||Soft light photo by seier+seier|\nTwo Types of Light\nThere are two different types of light in the world of photography: hard light and soft light.\nHard light is considered to be harsh ,while soft light is known as being diffused.\nWith hard light, photographers will get sharp and deep shadows along with well-defined edges, while soft light produces less-defined edges and softer shadows.\nWhen light is closer to your subject, it becomes larger in effective size, making it softer.\nWhen the light source is further away, the effective size becomes smaller, making it harder.\nThe previous two statements may be a little hard for you to understand at first, but if you go out and test this in the field with a light source (flash or standing light) you’ll quickly see the difference in the two types of photography lighting.\nIt’s relatively easy to change a hard light to a soft light by positioning the lighting. When it comes to contrast, it is the difference between the shadow areas and light in your scene. If there is a lot of difference then the scene has more contrast.\nInside lighting generally consists of grips, modifiers and light sources.\nThe grips are the equipment used to hold the camera gear, such as clamps and stands.\nThe modifiers are things that can be held in front of or attached to the light source to control its light pattern. Modifiers consist of items such as reflectors, umbrellas, and soft boxes.\nLight sources are anything that produces light to your scene. This includes natural sunlight, tungsten light, and strobes and flash units etc.\nThree Light Setup\nIf you hear the term three-light setup, it will be referring to key light, fill light, and separation light. This is a very popular lighting technique in photography for portraits.\nThe most significant of these is the key light, which is usually a hard light, and it produces the defining shadow areas and highlight of the scene.\nFill light, which is usually soft light, is secondary and is used with key light as a way to fill light into the shadows produce by the key light on the other side of the subject. The fill light will reduce contrast.\nSeparation light is used when you have a dark subject in front of a dark background. This light will be pointed at the back of the subject producing a halo of light around the person, which helps separate the subject from the background.\nThe ratio refers to the comparison of key light and fill light.\nFor even, soft lighting it’s recommended to use 1:1. This means the amount of key and fill light would be the same.\nA 2:1 ratio would mean twice as much key light as fill light and 3:1 means three times as much, and so on.\nA 1:1 ratio is ideal for flat light while 2:1 would produce a cool effect. The contrast will increase the higher the ratio gets.\nFor example, 8:1 would produce a great amount of contrast. Also, the positioning of the lights will impacts the scene’s contrast. The contrast becomes greater as the angle of the lighting increases.\nPhoto by SchoolofImaging.ca\nSide Lighting Bounce\nIf you’re not in a space that is filled with lighting equipment on hand you can always use this photography lighting trick – place your model close to a wall and face the light source to the wall.\nYou can then bounce the light off of it from the side and this will naturally illuminate and complement the model. You can experiment with different soft box effects with this method by moving the light source closer and further away.\nWhen no bright walls are available you can use just about anything bright as a surface to bounce light off of. This could be white cardboard, a reflector, or a light shirt or table cloth etc. All you need to do is point the light source toward the bounce surface and position your model to the surface’s side.\nUsing Ambient Light\nYou can use ambient light for indoor photography either on its own or in conjunction with flash.\nFor example, you can use if from behind as a rim light to pull the model away from the background and then use flash to light up the person’s face.\nIf you’re in a dark setting you could try a couple of table lamps without the shades and position your model in between them. The light that the model stands closer to will be used as the key light and the other lamp would be fill light.\nUsing Window Light\nWindows are ideal as natural light sources for indoor shots.\nSimply place your model close to a window and take the photos from the front.\nYou can use a flash if you like or just use the natural light. Remember, if you use a flash it will be the key light while the window light will act as a soft box. For more information on using flash check out our other article, Flash Photography Basics 101.\nWithout a flash, the window would be able to provide the key light.\nWe hope you enjoyed these indoor photography tips.

24	What are the origins of barter and its disadvantages today?	According to historical evidence, barter did not naturally emerge as economists traditionally claimed - it actually appeared only in societies that already knew money. As for disadvantages, bartering today involves significant risks since there is no consumer protection or warranties, making it difficult to verify the trustworthiness of trading partners. Items received could be defective or of poor quality. Additionally, people often struggle to accurately assess the relative value of items being exchanged, tending to overvalue desired items while underestimating their own.	"['Adam Smith, in Wealth of Nations, offers the following well-known myth:\nIn a tribe of hunters or shepherds a particular person makes bows and arrows, for example, with more readiness and dexterity than any other. He frequently exchanges them for cattle or for venison with his companions; and he finds at last that he can in this manner get more cattle and venison, than if he himself went to the field to catch them. From a regard to his own interest, therefore, the making of bows and arrows grows to be his chief business, and he becomes a sort of armourer. Another excels in making the frames and covers of their little huts or moveable houses. He is accustomed to be of use in this way to his neighbours, who reward him in the same manner with cattle and with venison, till at last he finds it his interest to dedicate himself entirely to this employment, and to become a sort of house-carpenter. In the same manner a third becomes a smith or a brazier; a fourth, a tanner or dresser of hides or skins, the principal part of the clothing of savages. And thus the certainty of being able to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men’s labour as he may have occasion for, encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation, and to cultivate and bring to perfection whatever talent of genius he may possess for that particular species of business (Wealth of Nations I.2.2).\nFor Smith, this perfectly “natural” process is both the origin of the division of labour and reveals the natural propensity for human beings to “truck, barter and exchange one thing for another” (I.2.1). This distinguishes us from the animals, for who ever saw a dog offer a bone as a fair and deliberate exchange with another dog? Smith goes on:\nWhen the division of labour has been once thoroughly established, it is but a very small part of a man’s wants which the produce of his own labour can supply. He supplies the far greater part of them by exchanging that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men’s labour as he has occasion for. Every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes in some measure a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is properly a commercial society (I.4.2).\nWe’re all capitalists at heart, it seems, for we are natural merchants, constantly exchanging things with one another. Smith can be a little long-winded, so let me summarise the remainder of this myth. Once our primitives have all busied themselves with their natural propensity to produce and “truck”, they soon find that others may have enough of whatever is on offer. I might have made plenty of toe ticklers, but now that the tribe or village is full of toe ticklers, I have nowhere to hawk my wares and get what I want. The solution: stockpile items that I am sure everyone will want – salt, sugar, dried cod, dressed leather, sex toys …. So when I want something, I can simply use these items in exchange. At last, one of us happens upon the idea of using precious metals, weighed, then standardized, minted and so on. Eventually, in our wisdom, we come up with credit, or virtual money.\nIn various forms, this myth has been repeated countless times in economics textbooks, in online forums and in classes on economics. For economists, it is “the most important story ever told” (Graeber, Debt, p. 24). Its narrative from a natural division of labour, through to barter, money and then, in our sophisticated modern era, banking and credit, has become so pervasive that it is regarded as common sense. The problem, as David Graeber shows, is that it is pure fantasy-land (pp. 21-41). Where is this mythical village? Among North American Indians? Asian pastoral nomads? African tribes, Pacific Islanders, Australian aborigines? A small Scottish town of shopkeepers? Often in the same myth it moves from one place to the other. But the simple fact is that it never existed. No such village has ever been found, nor will it be. As Graeber shows in some detail, contrary to the barter-money-credit sequence of the myth, credit may well have preceded money, and barter is a side product, happening only in places that have already come to know money. On that last point, the common “return to barter” account during economically difficult times – in the early Middle Ages or in Russia and eastern Europe in the 1990s or today in Greece and other countries severely affected by the rolling economic crisis that began in 2008 – takes place only within the framework of monetarized economies.\nGraeber expresses some frustration at the sheer pervasiveness of Adam Smith’s myth, working overtime to show that it is not original to Smith and that the evidence is overwhelmingly stacked against it. One source of his frustration is that a crucial founding myth is not empirically falsifiable. No amounts of “facts” will dent the power of the myth, as Sorel showed so well many years ago (Reflections on Violence). Instead, it is more worthwhile to ask what truth the myth expresses, given that a myth is always split between fiction and a deeper and not always pleasant truth (part of its mixed heritage).\nThat truth is that Smith, in resuscitating and refining the myth, had a distinct agenda: he wanted to create a new being, “the economy.” The definite article is crucial, for “the” economy was to be distinct entity, with its own rules, its own dynamic that is distinct from politics, the state, and above all religion. What better way to do so than reconstruct a myth in which “the” economy arose as a natural expression of human nature? But why did he wish to create such a being? A new field of study needed an object to study, the discipline of economics. And in order to ensure that this discipline was not bereft of an object of study, “the economy” was created.\nIt is worth noting that Smith was really completing a process that began with the earlier work of Hobbes and Locke from the seventeenth century. They provide an explicit but incomplete path from the Bible and theology to economics, at times seeking continuities and at others offering a narrative of movement beyond the Bible. Smith’s achievement was to bring the process to a definitive break: economics as both discipline and reality was no longer tied to theology. Or rather, it was sublimated as a moral tension between compassion and self-interest.\nIn other words, the myth of origin is crucial to the very formation of the discipline of what we would now call classical economics. To dump the myth would mean to dismantle the discipline as now understood. I would prefer another formulation: economics would turn out to be inseparable from social relations, politics, and religion.', 'Just as with most things, there are disadvantages and advantages of bartering. A complication of bartering is determining how trustworthy the person you are trading with is. The other person does not have any proof or certification that they are legitimate, and there is no consumer protection or warranties involved. This means that services and goods you are exchanging may be exchanged for poor or defective items. You would not want to exchange a toy that is almost brand new and in perfect working condition for a toy that is worn and does not work at all would you? It may be a good idea to limit exchanges to family and friends in the beginning because good bartering requires skill and experience. At times, it is easy to think the item you desire is worth more than it actually is and underestimate the value of your own item.\n1.Jump up ^ O\'Sullivan, Arthur; Steven M. Sheffrin (2003).

United States Internal Revenue Service\nAlthough, as a general case, a ship unlucky in falling in with whales continues to cruise after them until she has barely sufficient provisions remaining to take her home, turning round then quietly and making the best of her way to her friends, yet there are instances when even this natural obstacle to the further prosecution of the voyage is overcome by headstrong captains, who, bartering the fruits of their hard-earned toils for a new supply of provisions in some of the ports of Chili or Peru, begin the voyage afresh with unabated zeal and perseverance.\nBarter-based economies are one of the earliest, predating monetary systems and even recorded history. People can successfully use barter in many almost any field. Informally, people often participate in barter and other reciprocal systems without really ever thinking about it as such -- for example, providing web design or tech support for a farmer or baker and receiving vegetables or baked goods in return. Strictly Internet-based exchanges are common as well, for example exchanging content creation for research.\nEconomists since the times of Adam Smith (1723-1790), looking at non-specific pre-modern societies as examples, have used the inefficiency of barter to explain the emergence of money, of ""the"" economy, and hence of the discipline of economics itself. However, ethnographic studies have shown that no present or past society has used barter without any other medium of exchange or measurement, nor have anthropologists found evidence that money emerged from barter, instead finding that gift-giving (credit extended on a personal basis with an inter-personal balance maintained over the long term) was the most usual means of exchange of goods and services.']"	['<urn:uuid:27117c1d-1838-4b10-b5aa-ceabe264229f>', '<urn:uuid:c646b824-7116-477e-80ff-f43ad564d66a>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	10	82	2117
25	I'm a worried parent whose child might need surgery - how does the hospital prepare children for surgery procedures, and what kind of emergency care is available if something goes wrong during recovery?	The hospital helps prepare children for surgery by encouraging parents to explain the procedure in simple terms, letting children ask questions and share feelings. Children can bring favorite toys or comfort items to the operating room. The hospital's team will explain everything to make the day less scary. For emergencies, there is 24/7 emergency care provided by board-certified pediatric emergency medicine physicians and skilled pediatric nurses in a dedicated child-friendly space. The emergency department has sophisticated facilities including a specialized resuscitation area for critically ill children and certified Child Life specialists who help children cope through play therapy and emotional support. Parents can access emergency care at any time without an appointment if complications arise after surgery.

To respect physical distancing measures, please leave siblings at home.\nFor detailed information, see Essential Care Partner and Visitor Guidelines.\nView other COVID-19 updates at HSC.\n- Screening tests: Patients may be asked to get some blood work done prior to surgery. The surgeon’s office or the Pre-Admission/Pre-Operative Assessment clinic will provide more information.\n- COVID-19 testing: Asymptomatic patients will need to undergo a rapid COVID-19 testing a day prior to surgery. The surgeon’s office or the Pre-Admission/Pre-Operative Assessment clinic will contact patients with instructions.\n- Respect fasting instructions: Your child’s surgery will be cancelled if their stomach is not empty. Check pre-operative instructions carefully. Your child will be required to stop eating food and drinking at a certain time. This is important as the child’s stomach needs to be empty prior to having surgery. Refer to your fasting information sheet provided by your surgeon’s office or call the Pre-Admission/Pre-Operative Assessment Clinic for more information.\n- Arrive on time: Plan your travel according to the weather and road conditions.\n- Talk to your child about the surgery: Tell your child in simple words what to expect about coming to the hospital, explain why the surgery is needed, when it will happen, and what recovery will look like. Encourage your child to ask questions and share their feelings. It’s normal for children to be nervous and our team will explain everything to try to make the day less scary. For more information on how to talk to your child, call the Pre-Admission/Pre-Operative Assessment Clinic.

Our team will also ensure that consent forms are signed, confirm pre-operative instructions were followed, and if needed, schedule additional tests.\n- Going into the operating room: Parents or caregivers will accompany their child to the operating room waiting area where you will speak to the surgeon and the anesthesiologist prior to surgery. Let your child know you will be there when they wake up after surgery. Be calm, stay positive and offer loving words – this will help your child cope better with the situation.\n- Be prepared to wait: Parents need to be prepared for a long day with periods of waiting. We encourage you to bring entertainment gadgets, such as toys, books, or activities to pass the time. You are expected to stay with your child during these periods of waiting.\n- Recovery: When your child wakes up after surgery, they may be disoriented due to the anesthetics and they may cry. More times than not, a short nap will alleviate these feelings. Calmly comfort your child, hold their hand, or kiss them.\nOnce your child meets the criteria for discharge, our nurses will tell you everything you need to know to ensure healing continues at home. Don’t be afraid to ask questions, we are here to help. Prior to leaving the hospital, you will receive a discharge information sheet indicating the post-operative care that is required when at home.\nAlways talk to your health care provider for specific guidance on when your child can return to normal activities and for information on when to seek medical care if complications arise.\nHere are a few tips to ensure a smooth transition:\n- Ensure you give your child their prescribed medication on time. Pain control medication such as Advil or Tylenol is safe and important to have at home.\n- Encourage your child to drink plenty of fluids after surgery.

Patients may not be seen in the same order of their arrival to the Emergency Department. Those children with the most serious illnesses and injuries will usually be given priority. A child life specialist is available during the early evening to offer activities, answer questions, and help keep you informed. Feel free to ask a nurse or doctor if he/she can give your child something fun to do; we have many toys, books and videos available. While you are in the waiting area, please do not to give your child anything to eat or drink without checking with the triage nurse first. If you notice that your child is getting sicker or is in more pain, tell the triage nurse right away.\nAs soon as possible, you and your child will be brought into an exam room. A team of doctors and nurses will care for your child. Your child may be evaluated by two different doctors. Your child may be initially seen by a resident physician, who is a medical doctor in training to care for children. Your child will also be seen by an attending physician, who is a medical doctor who is trained to care for children with emergencies. The attending physician supervises the care of your child. Depending on your child's condition, your doctor may order a blood test, X-rays, or other tests to help determine what is wrong with your child. Each test will be fully explained to you before it is performed.\nA top priority in our Pediatric Emergency Service is to make sure each child is as comfortable as possible, and to rapidly assess and treat pain. If your child is in any pain, please make sure a doctor or nurse is notified so that the proper medication can be given.\nWhen your child's care is complete, the doctor or nurse will give you instructions on how to care for your child's illness or injury. They will also tell you about follow-up care. If you have any questions after you leave, call the Pediatric Emergency Services at (212) 746-3300 or you may also call your child's primary care provider.\nAdmission to the Hospital\nYour doctors may decide that your child needs to stay in the hospital longer for further observation or tests. Arrangements will be made for your child to be moved to an inpatient bed on either our general pediatrics unit or the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) as soon as possible.\nWhat Sets us Apart\n- Our Pediatric Emergency Department is affiliated with NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, which ranks in more pediatric specialties than any other New York metro area hospital in U.S. News & World Report’s Best Children’s Hospitals.""]"	['<urn:uuid:20f4a51a-45d0-4d49-9c21-7b0f7e797822>', '<urn:uuid:385b5a3d-6291-4d6a-af91-d37d13c6d7d8>']	open-ended	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	33	117	2140
26	fmea sessions problems and cybersecurity threats	FMEA sessions can be problematic as they often get bogged down investigating minor issues while neglecting important ones, while cybersecurity threats include viruses, worms, phishing attacks and unauthorized intrusions that can compromise medical device safety and effectiveness.	"['This second article in our series addresses a common risk analysis problem: prioritization.\nIn large medical device companies, the email invitation to an FMEA session can strike fear (or at least dread) into the hearts of engineers and other members of the risk management team. One reason that they may not be eager to click “Accept” is that these sessions can quickly devolve into detailed investigations of issues of negligible severity or probability of occurrence. The time devoted to these issues soaks up the team’s time and energy – to the point that important issues may not receive the attention they deserve.\nWithout a mature product line or medical device risk management system, small or start-up device companies may have the opposite problem. There, the list of hazards being considered may be limited to those issues that are most obvious to the design team and may not provide a comprehensive assessment of device risks. Instead of an overly detailed analysis, these companies run the risk of not going deep enough.\nThis article presents an approach that device companies have successfully implemented to focus their risk management activities and help to ensure the safety and efficacy of their products.\nWhere to start? – System Boundaries\nThe key to identifying priorities is to first establish a clear scope for the analysis by defining the system boundaries. How you go about defining system boundaries depends on the type of analysis being conducted. Perform a gap assessment on the device information: what do you know and what is not known? A process flow diagram is typically best at assessing a process or the usage, like the human factors impacting the device; however, a list of materials (e.g., a bill-of-material or list of sub-systems) is typically best when assessing risks associated with the product design.\nTypically, it is best to start big and work down into the details. For example, if you have a device that is designed to be used with other devices, you should begin your assessment by looking at the whole system so that you will be able to consider how your device interacts with the other parts of the integrated system and what new risks may arise when your device is integrated into the system.\nBy saying “start big,” we mean that the focus of your analysis will change as you progress through the Design and Development process. As you move from concept to detailed design to design transfer, you will learn more about the function and features of your device and the process that you will use to manufacture the device. The boundaries of your analysis will transition from system-wide assessments of broad hazards to potentially detailed analyses of high-risk subsystems and user interactions.\nThe boundaries of the analysis should be clearly described in the risk management plan (RMP) for the device. Your RMP should be updated prior to beginning a new Design and Development phase to identify the types of analysis and system boundaries that will be assessed in the next stage(s) of the process.\nThe boundaries are set, now what? – Look for Hot Spots\nOnce the boundaries of the system are defined, the next step is to identify the elements of the system that require focused attention. The guidance that supports ISO 14971:2019 (TR 24971) provides some helpful direction for focusing risk assessments that is appropriate for all devices. Annex A, Identification of hazards and characteristics related to safety, contains a list of questions intended to help the risk analysis team characterize potential safety impacts of their device.\nBut your consideration of potential risks shouldn’t be limited to this list. The authors of the standard are careful to state that “these lists are neither exhaustive nor representative of all medical devices, and the manufacturer is advised to add questions that can have applicability to the particular medical device and to skip questions that are not relevant. There will be different risks for wearable medical devices, internet connected medical devices (cybersecurity), software as a medical device, a general medical instrument and an in vitro diagnostic. The manufacturer is also advised to consider each question not only on its own but also in relation to others.” Answering these questions in addition to researching the types of problems that occur with similar devices is good “homework” for the risk team because it can help to identify the types of analyses that need to be performed.\nThe standard also contains examples of hazards that “could ultimately result in harm” (Table C.1). This list can help remind the team to consider categories of hazards that may not be top-of-mind. Other resources (e.g., previous risk analyses and product complaints for similar devices, the FDA’s MAUDE database, other relevant risk standards/ guidance documents, etc.) can also be used to identify potential hazards.\nOnce you’ve established a list of potential hazards, the key step (that not all manufacturers take) is to identify how they relate to the system elements of your device (the elements in the system boundary that you previously defined). By making this explicit link between the system elements and the potential hazards, you will have a much better sense of where your efforts should be focused. To illustrate this process, below is a simplified table showing the relationship between a list of hazards and the major components of an infusion pump.\nFrom this very simplified view, we are illustrating how (even at the earliest stages of the process) priorities can be established to guide subsequent analyses. From this prioritization, the Electronic Controls were found to be the highest priority (three “Highs”). The team can now establish a plan to address each System Element in priority order. In addition, you also have an indication of the types of analysis to conduct. For Electronic Controls, the initial focus can be placed on design analyses to ensure safety from electrical shorts and shocks, and usage analyses to understand how best to minimize the potential for user errors (a usability study may be in your future).\nAt this stage of the analysis, most risk teams will jump directly to their FMEAs. The problem with this approach is that while you’ve done a good job of prioritizing where to focus your attention, you can still get lost in the details of the high priority elements (there are a lot of components and coding in\n“electrical controls”). In the next article, we will address how conducting a Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) at this stage of the process (before you begin your FMEA) can significantly improve your understanding of your device’s risks and greatly simplify and focus your FMEAs.\nMEDIcept … Trusted Solutions, Rapid Response …\nMEDIcept Inc. is an international consulting firm specializing in medical device, IVD, and biotechnology Regulatory, Quality, and Clinical Services.

Cybersecurity is a growing concern for all, whether you work in the legal, financial or consumer industries. It could affect you personally.\nCybersecurity is a recent concern for the medical products industries, a result of their increased reliance on networked electronic software, records and signatures. Initially there were regulations such as 21 CFR Part 11 in the U.S. and Annex 11 in Europe. But more must be done to ensure the integrity of CGMP documents / records. Cybersecurity is an issue that will only increase over time, as records become more electronic, and communications are more networked or accessible.\nAs a result, the US FDA has issued the following Guidances for Industry:\n- “Cybersecurity for Networked Medical Devices Containing Off-the-Shelf (OTS) Software Document”, issued on: January 14, 2005; and\n- “Content of Premarket Submissions for Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices”, issued on: October 2, 2014; and\n- “Postmarket Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices” -- Draft Guidance, issued on: January 22, 2016\nAs the titles above indicate, the focus is on medical devices. But the principles can and should be applied to a company’s computerized systems as well. In this article, we will also focus on devices, but will also draw attention to company computerized systems where appropriate, to flag related potential problems with an e-records based QMS, computer-facilitated production and/or test / lab equipment / systems.\nOf necessity, cybersecurity in the medical products industries is coming under increased regulatory review. Regulatory agencies leave the ""how"" of cybersecurity compliance up to the manufacturer, as long as the principles in the guidances are met in the resulting product and/or system. Related issues are primarily addressed by the CGMPs, specifically design control (21 CFR 820.30) for devices, and post-production by the CAPA system, among others.\nCybersecurity – Why?\nFDA and news media have emphasized the prevalence of cybersecurity issues, such as data / identity theft, and hacking which pose hazards to many activities and businesses / industries. Our, and the FDA’s and EU’s concern, is with medical products’ users.\nFurther adding to the problem is the industrial growth of BYOD – “Bring Your Own Device” (laptop, tablet, smart phone, or similar “smart” device) – in the workplace. This growing trend poses a problem to cybersecurity, including unintentional and intentional malware introduction.\nThe increasing use of cloud (Internet)-based software to accomplish CGMP tasks, store / retrieve data (data warehousing) and similar uses poses another two-fold concern. In many cases, the updates, upgrades, new revisions / releases, service packs, and similar are automatically uploaded to a company’s systems, which can pose:\n- Security risks, with the potential for introduction of compromised code, retrieval of confidential data, data integrity issues (discussed in our previous article), and similar; and\n- Render previous computer systems’ verification and validations worthless (no change control / “line drawn in the sand”).\nSuch issues are troubling because ensuring data integrity / cybersecurity is an important component of industry’s responsibility to ensure the safety, efficacy, and quality of medical products, the records documenting their manufacture and use, and consequently, of FDA’s ability to protect the public health.\nA growing number of medical devices are designed to be connected to computer networks, or facilitate the use of removable storage, such as flash or thumb drives. Such “networked” medical devices incorporate use software (off-the-shelf or custom) that is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, such as viruses and worms, phishing, and similar unauthorized or unknown intrusions.\nSuch vulnerabilities pose a risk to the safe and effective operation of such medical devices. This mandates an ongoing maintenance effort throughout the product life cycle to assure an adequate degree of protection. FDA issued their Cybersecurity Guidance to clarify how existing regulations, including the Quality System (QS) Regulation, 21 CFR 820 (medical device CGMPs), 21 CFR Part 11, Electronic Records / Electronic Signatures, apply to such cybersecurity maintenance activities. It discusses the basic principles the FDA expects of companies producing products containing networked software / firmware. Though geared to medical devices, the principles apply to all regulated industries with networked and/or portable memory accessible software / firmware (e.g., flash / thumb drives, BYOD access) computerized systems – records maintenance, production and test equipment and similar.\nHowever, the Cybersecurity Guidance specifically targets devices that incorporate off-the-shelf (OTS) software. Therefore, it primarily applies to device manufacturers who incorporate OTS software in their medical devices. The QS Regulation, 21 CFR Part 820, applies to software maintenance actions. This is in addition to the other guidance documents the Agency has issued in the past on software. Companies using SOUP (software of unknown pedigree) in their products (or systems) should also be aware of and address similar concerns.\nThe FDA recommends that medical device manufacturers consider the “NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity” framework core functions to guide their cybersecurity activities:\n- Respond; and\nIdentify and Protect\nMedical devices capable of connecting (wirelessly or hard-wired) to another device, to the Internet or other network, or to portable media (e.g. USB or CD) are more vulnerable to cybersecurity threats than devices that are not connected. However, never assume invulnerability, verify to challenge vulnerability, and document such verification.\nThe extent to which security controls are needed will depend on the following:\n- The device’s / systems intended use;\n- The presence and intent of its electronic data interfaces;\n- Its intended environment of use;\n- The type of cybersecurity vulnerabilities present;\n- The likelihood the vulnerability will be exploited (either intentionally or unintentionally); and\n- The probable risk of patient harm due to a cybersecurity breach.\nManufacturers should also carefully consider the balance between cybersecurity safeguards and the usability of the device in its intended environment of use. See also the newly revised standard IEC 62366-1 (2015) and -2 (2016), Usability Engineering, for such a process.\nEnsure Trusted Content\nRestrict software or firmware updates to authenticated code. One authentication method manufacturers may consider is code signature verification. Use systematic procedures for authorized users to download version-identifiable software and firmware from the manufacturer. Ensure capability of secure data transfer to and from the device, and when appropriate, use methods for encryption.\nDetect, Respond, Recover\nImplement features that allow for security compromises to be detected, recognized, logged, timed, and acted upon during normal use. Develop and provide information to the end user concerning appropriate actions to take upon detection of a cybersecurity event. Implement device features that protect critical functionality, even when the device’s cybersecurity has been compromised. Provide methods for retention and recovery of device configuration by an authenticated privileged user.\nVulnerabilities and Risk\nFDA states that a cybersecurity vulnerability exists whenever the software provides the opportunity for unauthorized access to the network or the medical device. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities open the door to unwanted software changes that may have an effect on the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. Failure to properly address these vulnerabilities could result in an adverse effect on public health. A major concern with OTS software is the need for timely software patches to correct newly discovered vulnerabilities in the software.\nThe FDA recommends that the manufacturer conduct a vulnerability analysis, both initially (premarket) and ongoing (post-market). The approach should appropriately address the following elements:\n- Identification of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities;\n- Assessment of the impact of threats and vulnerabilities on device functionality and end users / patients;\n- Assessment of the likelihood of a threat and of a vulnerability being exploited;\n- Determination of risk levels and suitable mitigation strategies; and\n- Assessment of residual risk and risk acceptance criteria.\nAs mentioned above, and especially software / firmware, initial design and subsequent continuous improvement activities must consider hazards / risk, per ISO 14971. Such risk is focused on the end user – patient and/or clinician. The hazard analysis should address both “normal"" as well as “fault” risks, i.e., not just failure mode risk, the most prevalent approach, but also risk posed by the proper function of the product. In such an analysis, the manufacturer must also consider cybersecurity as part of this regular hazard analysis. Exposure to the web, as in the networked devices focused on in this guidance, increases such cybersecurity risks to the patient / clinician. Hazard / risk analysis’ goal is risk mitigation, documented in the Risk Management File and Report (ISO 14971), as well as in the Design History File (21 CFR 820.30). Consider system boundaries and connections to the external environment. In all such analysis, software must be considered with its associated hardware.\nThe above is to be supplemented by on-going monitoring of actual and potential vulnerabilities, consistent with the Quality System Regulation (21 CFR part 820), including complaint handling, internal quality audits, CAPA (corrective and preventive action), software validation and risk analysis, and servicing. Such programs should emphasize addressing vulnerabilities which may permit the unauthorized access, modification, misuse or denial of use, or the unauthorized use of information that is stored, accessed, or transferred from a medical device to an external recipient, and may impact patient safety.\nThe Agency defines critical components of such a program to include:\n- Monitoring cybersecurity information sources for identification and detection of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risk;\n- Understanding, assessing and detecting presence and impact of a vulnerability;\n- Establishing and communicating processes for vulnerability intake and handling;\n- Clearly defining essential clinical performance to develop mitigations that protect, respond and recover from the cybersecurity risk;\n- Adopting a coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy and practice; and\n- Deploying mitigations that address cybersecurity risk early and prior to exploitation.\nPostmarket cybersecurity information may originate from an array of sources including a company’s own CAPA / warranty / complaint system, independent security researchers, in-house testing, suppliers of software or hardware technology, health care facilities, and information sharing and analysis organizations. To manage postmarket cybersecurity risks for medical devices, a company should have a structured and systematic approach to risk management and quality management systems consistent with the CGMPs.\nPer the guidance, it is the device manufacturer who incorporates software in their medical device, that bears the primary responsibility for the continued safe and effective performance of the medical device / system, including the performance of the software that is part of the device / system. This is instead of the user or a contract programmer / software developer. FDA recommends that purchasers and users of medical devices who may be subject to a cybersecurity vulnerability contact the manufacturer with their concerns. Even when there are times when it is appropriate for the user to become involved, the user should not attempt to make changes without seeking the manufacturer’s advice and recommendations.\nSoftware patches that address cybersecurity vulnerabilities are addressed in general in the CGMPs. For example, the need to be vigilant and responsive to cybersecurity vulnerabilities is part of a company’s obligation under CAPA. The preamble to the QS Regulation explains that actions taken should “be appropriate to the magnitude of the problem and commensurate with the risks encountered”, i.e., “risk-based.” Design validation requires that devices conform to defined user needs and functional requirements, including an obligation to perform software validation and hazard / risk analysis, where appropriate.\nSoftware changes to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities are design changes, and thus must be verified / validated before approval and issuance. However, FDA premarket review is not usually required prior to implementation of a software patch to address a purely cybersecurity vulnerability for a previously cleared / approved device.\nIn general, FDA review is necessary when a change or modification could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the medical device (see also FDA Memorandum K 97-1, and their two recent draft guidances on changes to a device having a 510(k), one specifically addressing software). This is to allow an FDA review of any issue that affects a risk to health posed by the device, and should be the key determinant in making such a decision on the need for an new regulatory review.\nThus, it is possible, but unlikely, that a software patch will need a new 510(k) submission. And the more robust the V&V of the patch / change, the less likely the requirement for a new submission would be. As with all changes made to devices, a company must document the basis of its decisions in the Design History File (DHF) and/or related CGMP documentation.\nHowever, for medical devices approved under Premarket Approval Application (PMA) (21 CFR Part 814), a PMA supplement is required for a software patch, if the patch:\n- Results in a change to the approved indications for use; or\n- Is deemed by the manufacturer to have an adverse effect on the safety and effectiveness of the approved medical device.\nNote: The two points above are also “red flags” for changes to devices covered by a 510(k) that would probably also require a new 510(k).\nOtherwise, the company should report its decision to apply a software patch to its PMA device to the FDA in its annual reports.\nIn all cases, validation of software changes made to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities is required. All software design changes must be verified / regression tested / validated, including those computer software changes to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This would be in accordance with an established protocol, before approval and issuance. However, for most software changes intended to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities, analysis, inspection, and testing – documented -- should be adequate and clinical validation should not be necessary.\nThe manufacturer should always maintain formal business relationships with their OTS software vendors to ensure timely receipt of information concerning quality problems and recommended corrective and preventive actions – perhaps by means of the contract or a Quality Agreement. Because of the frequency of cybersecurity patches, the FDA’s Guidance recommends that the company develop a single cybersecurity maintenance plan to address compliance with the QS Regulation and the issues discussed in the guidance document.\nAlthough the guidance recommends that the medical device manufacturer to perform these software maintenance activities, there may be situations in which it is appropriate for the user facility, OTS vendor, or a third party to be involved. The software maintenance plan should provide a mechanism for the manufacturer to exercise overall responsibility while delegating specific tasks to such other parties. The vast majority of healthcare organizations will lack detailed design information and technical resources to assume primary maintenance responsibility for medical device software and will have to rely on the manufacturer to assume the primary maintenance responsibility.\nLifecycle considerations require that the expected growing knowledge of the science of the product and its manufacturing process / equipment translate into manufacturing improvements, and reduction in variation, consistency / homogeneity within lots, and consistency / homogeneity between lots, improved product quality, all reflected in subsequent V&V activities. See FDA’s Guidance on Process Validation.\nThe training of personnel in detecting data integrity issues is also required as part of a routine CGMP training program. Training personnel to detect data integrity issues is viewed as consistent with the personnel requirements discussed in the CGMPs.\nAs stated at the outset, Cybersecurity is a relatively new term for the CGMP community. As hacking of networked electronic systems has become more prevalent, cybersecurity requirements are also being added. Increasingly, manufacturers and users will have to demonstrate their ability to provide for cybersecurity to achieve full CGMP compliance when such vulnerabilities exist in their systems. This is the expectation and demand of all such systems / records stakeholders, not just regulatory agencies.\n# # #\nCAPA Corrective and Preventive Action (see 21 CFR 820.100)\nCDRH U.S. FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health\nCGMPs Current Good Manufacturing Practices (for devices it is 21 CFR Par 820,\nQuality System Regulations)\nCFR The U.S. Code of Federal Regulation\nFDA The United States’ Food and Drug Administration\nISO International Standards Organization\nNIST U.S. National Institute of Science and Technology\nOTS Off-the-shelf [software]\nQA Quality Assurance\nQC Quality Control\nQMS Quality Management System\nQS Quality System\nR&D Research and Development\nSOP Standard Operating Procedure\nV&V Or V[T]&V; Verification [Testing] and Validation.

27	clinical outcomes patient reported measures neocart implant treatment articular cartilage lesions	Patients treated with NeoCart showed significant improvements in multiple clinical outcomes. The International Knee Documentation Committee score improved from 47.9 to 75.5, the Short Form-36 physical component increased from 40.5 to 51.4, and all 5 domains of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score showed significant improvements. Pain scores on the visual analog scale decreased from 34.6 to 14.3, and range of motion improved from 131.5° to 140.7°. These improvements reached maximum benefits at 24 months and were maintained through 60 months of follow-up.	['Background: Autologous cartilage tissue implants, including the NeoCart implant, are intended to repair focal articular cartilage lesions. Short-term results from United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) phase I and phase II clinical trials indicated that the NeoCart implant was safe when surgically applied as a cell-based therapy and efficacious compared with microfracture. Hypothesis: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis would reveal NeoCart tissue maturation through to 60-month follow-up. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients with symptomatic full-thickness cartilage lesions of the distal femoral condyle were treated with NeoCart in FDA clinical trials. Safety and efficacy were evaluated prospectively by MRI and clinical patient-reported outcomes (PROs) through to 60-month follow-up. Qualitative MRI metrics were quantified according to modified MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) criteria, with an independent evaluation of repair tissue signal intensity. Subjective PROs and objective range of motion (ROM) were obtained at baseline and through to 60 months. Results: Twenty-nine patients treated with NeoCart were observed over a mean of 52.0 ± 15.5 months (median, 60 months). MOCART analyses indicated significant improvement (P <.001) in cartilage quality from 3 to 24 months, with stabilization from 24 to 60 months. Signal intensity of the repair tissue evolved from hyperintense at early follow-up to isointense after 6 months and to hypointense after 24 months. The temporal progression toward hypointense T2 signals at later time points observed here indicated a further reorganization of the repair tissue toward a dense tissue that was less similar to the surrounding native tissue. However, 80% of patients showed evidence of subchondral bone changes on MRI at all time points; 4 patients (14%) showed no improvement of MRI criteria. Compared with baseline values, significant improvement (P <.001) was seen in PROs (mean [±SD] baseline to mean [±SD] final follow-up), including the International Knee Documentation Committee score (47.9 ± 17.4 to 75.5 ± 22.1), physical component summary of the Short Form-36 (40.5 ± 7.2 to 51.4 ± 8.1), and all 5 domains of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (Pain: 64.8 ± 12.1 to 86.1 ± 17.3; Activities of Daily Living: 75.5 ± 14.8 to 91.6 ± 13.8; Quality of Life: 28.6 ± 15.5 to 69.4 ± 28.0; Symptoms: 65.8 ± 13.8 to 86.6 ± 13.4; Sports and Recreation: 41.4 ± 24.3 to 72.4 ± 28.8). Significant (P <.0001) decreases from baseline scores for the visual analog scale for pain (34.6 ± 22.5) were seen by 6 months and sustained at final follow-up (14.3 ± 18.4). ROM significantly (P <.0001) improved from baseline (131.5° ± 7.9°) to final follow-up (140.7° ± 6.3°). Conclusion: Longitudinal MRI analysis demonstrated that NeoCart-based repair tissue is durable and evolves over time. For a majority of patients, this progression trended from an initial hyperintense signal to a hypointense signal at later follow-ups. Changes in radiographic measures over time corresponded with improvement in clinical measures, with maximum benefits experienced at 24-month follow-up. Similarly, clinical efficacy for the total cohort, determined by clinical outcome scores, reached a maximum at 24 months without decline to 60 months. Results from safety and exploratory clinical trials indicate that NeoCart is a safe and effective treatment for articular cartilage lesions through to 5-year follow-up.

28	mental training distinguish between good pain bad pain during sports training	There are two types of pain in sports: Bad pain is potentially injurious, often appearing as sharp pain in joint areas like knee, hip, ankle or back, and should be checked by a health professional. Good pain builds strength without physical damage and is the feeling of heart, lungs and muscles working hard and expanding their capacity.	"['Mental Training Techniques\nby Joann Dahlkoetter, Ph.D.\nEven the finest competitive athletes occasionally find themselves struggling with negative attitudes, or becoming too focused on physical pain during training or racing. They strive, like the rest of us, to keep moving forward in spite of the negative beliefs and internal chatter that goes on inside the mind as they attempt to challenge their current limits. Their distinguishing quality, however, is in their highly refined skill at managing and controlling that energy. Top competitors have developed this ability to relax, to remain positive and focused even under tremendous pressure and physical challenge.\nPicture the scene at the Atlanta Olympics during the men\'s 100-meter finals. The world\'s top sprinters were subjected to immense pressure. At that moment, the athletes, who had trained for years, are primed to render their best performances, but they are met with a continual string of mishaps and distractions. They only have 10 seconds to give every ounce of anaerobic energy their bodies can produce, but three false starts begin to drain the strength in their legs, and for some the dream starts to drift away. Linford Christie makes his second false start and protests his disqualification in a lengthy tantrum with the judges and then begins parading around the track, causing 100,000 confused fans to boo and/or cheer. You see the growing frustration of the racers: anxious, angry, pacing back and forth, wondering how much longer this circus will go on. They\'re thinking: ""Which sprint will be the real one that we actually get to finish; the one that determines the gold medal and, perhaps, my future?""\nOne athlete was not pacing; he didn\'t appear at all disturbed by the whole fiasco. The camera flashes on Donavan Bailey, who was sitting calmly, smiling, and appeared to be meditating. He was not wasting time worrying about things he could not control. He was conserving energy and building inner strength while the others were depleting their resources. Sure enough, when the final sprint began, Donavan Bailey was ready, using the whole sequence of events to his advantage. He shot out of the starting blocks like a bullet and ran 9.84, setting a world record.\nHe had turned all of the distractions and external negative energy into the best possible outcome. No matter what your level of training is, or how refined your athletic skills become, you will inevitably encounter some training or racing situations that you perceive as physically painful or mentally challenging. The key is to recognize them early and to develop strong mental skills with which to intervene. First let\'s explore some primary warning signals:\nTypical Signs of Negative Energy or Pain:\n-Feeling anxious or fearful\n-Developing tunnel vision\n-Difficulty concentrating or thinking clearly\n-Diminished emotional control\n-Self-defeating beliefs and critical thoughts dominate the mind\n-Accelerated heart rate, with short, shallow breathing\n-General aching, or body pain\n-Legs or arms feeling weak and rubbery\n-Muscles becoming tense or cramped\n-Events appear in slow motion, or at an accelerated rate\nEveryone has probably experienced a few of these symptoms at some point during their training or competition. With regular practice and awareness, you can develop the ability to manage pain and let go of negative energy more effectively. You can control how deeply you feel things, and how long feelings and moods last. You can learn to re-direct negative emotions to more positive images and change your focus from physical or mental discomfort to the intensity and enjoyment of your sport.\nWhen managing pain, you need to first distinguish two different types: bad pain and good pain.\nBad pain can be potentially injurious. It is often a sharp pain in a joint area, like the knee, hip, ankle or back. If it persists, it should be checked out by a health professional.\nGood pain is the type that builds strength while not doing physical damage. It is the feeling of heart, lungs and muscles working hard and expanding their capacity. This is the type of discomfort you can work through using your mental training techniques.\nTools for Handling ""Good Pain"" and Bad Energy\n1. Relax mentally and physically.\nDeliberately slow down and deepen your breathing. This will help your muscles let go and you can relax through the pain. Say to yourself:\n-""I\'m breathing in inner strength; I\'m breathing out negative thoughts.""\n-""I\'m becoming more relaxed with each step.""\n2. Break the experience down into small, more manageable pieces.\nIf you\'re doing the Ironman, don\'t think of getting to the finish line from the gun. That\'s much too far away. Just say to yourself:\n-""I\'m now focusing on swimming to the turn-around point.""\n-""Just get to the first aid station on the cycling leg.""\n-""I\'ll hold this pace one more mile, then see how I feel.""\n3.Use the pain as feedback.\nYou can register it not as pain but as effort level. Say to yourself:\n-""Now I know exactly how hard I\'m working; I know how this pace feels.""\n-""My body is doing what it should be doing.""\n-""This is how I should be feeling in order to improve and go faster.""\n4. Redefine the pain as just a sensation.\nSay to yourself:\n-""Oh, I have felt this sensation before; this is familiar; I can handle it again.""\n-""This feeling is connected to doing my best and being focused.""\n-""Last time I felt like this I did a personal best.""\n-""I\'m experiencing the same sensations in this race that I have practiced in my training.""\n5. Put your pain in another context.\nDistance yourself from the sensation so the relationship you have to the pain can change. Imagine being an external observer watching yourself doing your sport. View yourself from a camera lens; you can zoom in or zoom out to distance yourself and make the discomfort seem less intense.\n6. Embrace the pain.\nRather than avoid the pain, you can draw it closer. Say to yourself:\n-""If I just hold on to this feeling a little longer, I can perform the best I ever have.""\n-""I am learning to enjoy this feeling of intensity; it helps me focus.""\nBe fully in the here and now, completely aware of your body and the task at hand. Do a body scan every few minutes to assess your form and technique. Ask yourself these questions: ""How are my legs feeling; what is my turnover rate?"" First contract and then relax any problem muscle groups.\nGo somewhere else in your mind. Do this when you are not at a critical point on the course where you need full attention. Imagine that you are swimming with dolphins or soaring like a bird. Visualize yourself doing another sport that you enjoy.\n9. Develop a self-chant or a mantra.\nCreate a simple set of phrases or words that you repeat to yourself to help you stay focused and prevent negative thoughts from entering. You can say:\n-""Smooth, easy, efficient.""\n-""I believe in myself; I am well prepared for this race.""\n-Count your breaths or footsteps.\n10. Create a sense of fun and enjoyment.\nRemind yourself of how much you enjoy doing your activity. If you can come from this perspective, the negative energy will quickly diminish. Say to yourself:\n-""I am doing exactly what I want to be doing.""\n-""My body is getting stronger and faster every moment.""\n-""I am in my element.""\nUse these tools regularly to effectively work through the tough spots in your training and racing, and challenge yourself to truly reach your potential.']"	['<urn:uuid:f66c8388-ea67-4b2d-ae93-8ebb55071f29>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	11	57	1252
29	climate change drought problems and household water conservation methods compare	Climate change is making droughts increasingly severe, with temperatures over 2°F higher than average in western and central U.S., leading to increased evaporation and soil moisture loss. For household water conservation, several effective methods exist: fixing leaks that can waste up to 2,700 gallons annually, using rainwater or gray water for plants instead of drinking water, and installing high-efficiency appliances with WaterSense labels, which can provide significant water savings.	['A large portion of the west U.S. was under the grip of an Drought that is unrelentingSince early 2020. Record-breaking rainfall has coincided with the dryness. WildfiresLong-lasting, intense and lasting Heat waves, Low stream flowsAnd Reservoir water supplies are decliningThe region has millions of people who rely on it.\nThe summer is upon us. OutlookIt is quite grim. The National Weather Service’s The latest seasonal outlookMay 19, 2022: A statement that drought is still a problem in most of the West and parts the Great Plains described it.\nOne of the drivers of the Western drought is persistent La Niña conditionsSince the beginning of the Summer 2020. During La Niña, cooler tropical Pacific waters help nudge the jet stream northward. This tends to bring about a change in the jet stream. There are fewer storms in the southern tier of U.S.Southwest droughts can be severe.\nThe OtherPerhaps the most important part of the story is the A rapidly warming climate makes it hotter and more thirsty..\nAs a climate scientist, I’ve watched how climate change is making drought conditions increasingly worse – particularly in the western and central U.S. The temperatures have been more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 Celsius), higher than average in these regions over the past two years. Large swathes of the Southwest have seen temperatures exceeding 3 F (1.7 C) in recent years. Studies suggest the Southwest’s ongoing 20-year droughtBased on how dry the soils were, this is the worst drought in at least 1,200 Years.\nA hotter atmosphere absorbs more moisture from soil\nA thristier atmosphere tends extract more water from the soil. It causes it to worsen evaporative stressespecially if the region is experiencing lower-than-normal precipitation. High evaporative stress can quickly deplete soil moisture, leading to higher temperatures. Evaporative cooling effectThis causes a decrease in growth. This hydroclimatic stress can cause plants to wither, dry out, and even die.\nThe U.S. Southwest has seen an 8 percent increase in evaporative demand as a result of a warmer climate since the 1980s. This trend is generally understood. This is happening in other parts the country.\nThe This is a more relaxed atmosphereIt is transforming what might otherwise be dry or near-normal conditions into severe or extreme droughts. As the climate heats up, the increasing atmospheric thirst will only increase drought stress. This will have severe consequences for water availability and long-lasting, intense heat stress.\nClimate models predict bleak prospects for the future Arider climates and severe droughts are more commonIn the Southwest and the southern Great Plains in coming decades.\nThese regions will see an increase in droughts and heat. There are fewer stormsAnd More days without precipitation. Climate models consistently project an a Poleward shift in midlatitude storm tracksAs the planet heats up, this century will see fewer storms in southern tiers of the country.\nEven in the wettest areas, flash droughts are possible\nThe changing nature of droughts is a concern Even in areas of the U.S. where there is expected to be a net rise,In the 21st Century, there has been a significant increase in annual precipitation. A hotter future could lead to significant droughts due to the high evaporative demands on the land. These areas can experience prolonged periods of below-normal precipitation for many weeks to months, even though the overall trend is for more precipitation.\nFor example, large parts of the northern Plains have experienced precipitation. Increase of 10% or moreThe last three decades. The region is susceptible to severe drought in hotter climates.\nThe tail end of the what was the wettest decadeThe northern Plains were the only region to record this. A severe flash drought in the summer 2017.This resulted in agricultural losses of more than $2.6 billion. WildfiresSurrounding millions of acres Record evaporative demandThe flash drought was exacerbated by a severe short-term shortage of precipitation. A flash drought can be defined as a drought that lasts for more than one day. In a matter of weeks, the intensity increases rapidlyIt often surprises forecasters. The possibility of flash droughts that can can have severe consequences for agriculture and ecosystems, and can promote large wildfiresExpected to IncreasingWith a warmer and thirstier environment\nIn the Northeast, flash droughts are becoming a growing concern. New England was home to an estimated 12% of the 2020 drought. Extreme hydrologic droughtThe drought was severe, with low stream flows, groundwater levels and widespread crop loss between May and September. The drought developed quickly from the above-normally wet conditions due to very warm and dry atmosphere conditions.\nAs humanity enters a hotter future it will be more concerning to experience prolonged periods of below-normal precipitation for weeks or months.\nHeading into unfamiliar territory\nOther types of droughts are also on the horizon.\nAtmospheric heat is a problem Snow droughtsSnow melts earlier if there is more rain than snow. Warmer temperatures result in shorter snow seasons, and longer growing seasons. Modifying the timing and frequency of ecological responses.\nLand is Greening up earlierThis can lead to an earlier loss of water on the land surface. evapotranspiration – the loss of water from plants and soil. This could lead to soils that are drier in the second half of the growing seasons. This could lead to dry soils in the western and central U.S. Both future greening and drying will be more frequentThey are seasonally distinct across the growing season.\nWe are entering an era of rapid change in the climate. unfamiliar territory. New ways will be needed in the world To better anticipate future droughtsThis could lead to a transformation NaturalAnd Human systems.', 'Accomplishing More With Less\nWater efficiency accomplishes more with less by using the best available technology and using water in smarter and more innovative ways. Water efficiency is different from water conservation which, while also important, is generally more focused on changing behavior and habits like turning off the tap while brushing your teeth.\nWater efficiency isn’t about asking citizens to shower once a week or plant a cactus in the front yard. Water efficiency is about flushing high-efficiency toilets and growing your trees and flowers with rainwater or gray water instead of high quality drinking water. It is about sustaining a high quality of life. It is about using innovative and smart technology to use less water to accomplish the same work.\nWater efficiency is simply the most cost-effective and immediate way to ensure safe, clean and available water for our families, neighbors and businesses.\nSave water, save energy\nIt is important to note that saving water in turn conserves energy. The treating, transporting, and heating of water all take some form of either electricity or gas power, and those costs translate to rising rates on utility bills. According to the Alliance for Water Efficiency, heating the water in your home uses approximately 15 percent of household energy, and a third of the water we use is hot, so re-thinking the way we use (and waste) our water could account for significant savings on more than just water bills.\nCommunities and water efficiency\nIncreasingly, water-efficiency practices are being adopted by communities and businesses as they recognize that improvements in infrastructure can account for big economic savings. Here are four examples of water-efficient cities:\nStarting in the 1980’s, Boston successfully secured its needed water supply by reducing consumption from the 1980 peak of 125.5 billion gallons to 70.9 billion gallons in 2009, a 43% reduction.\nThe city spent $40 million dollars, but avoided $500 million dollars in costs by choosing to reduce their demand instead of increasing supplies. This was done using simple techniques such as repairing leaks, requiring low-flow toilets in new construction, and retrofitting homes with efficient plumbing fixtures.\nThe city of Tucson has dramatically reduced residential water usage during the past 18 years; from a high of 121 gallons per capita per day in 1996, to only 86 in 2014. This is a reduction of 35 GPCD, or 28.9%, over 18 years.\nThe city of Tucson has been proactive in encouraging water conservation by offering a wide range of rebates and incentive programs to residential and commercial customers. Their mascot and spokesduck, Pete the Beak, has been encouraging children and adults to save water for decades.\nDenver’s water use in 2014 was equal to that of 1973, when there were 350,000 fewer people. Denver residents use 82 GPCD for all indoor and outdoor purposes, utility data show, down from 104 GPCD in 2001. This was achieved through measures such as replacing thousands of toilets in Denver Public Schools, the ceaseless “Use Only What You Need” campaign, rebates on water- saving appliances, tiered water rates, and summer watering restrictions. In 2015, Denver Water leaders set a new target for 1.3 million customers: 30 gallons a day for indoor use.\nSanta Barbara, California\nIn the wake of the California drought, the City of Santa Barbara has reduced their water consumption by 35.3% since 2013, far surpassing the conservation standard of 12% set by the State Water Resource Control Board.\nTheir approach has included multiple water rate increases, public outreach and education campaigns, increased leak detection, residential check-ups, and rebates for water-efficient plumbing. Additionally, they recently hosted a Water Conservation Summit, are actively celebrating ‘Water Heroes’ in the community, and even provide a webpage for anonymous water waste reporting.\nWater efficiency in the Southeast: A “Hidden Reservoir”\nThe Southeast United States faces unprecedented challenges to its water supply. Growing populations and the impacts of climate change are putting new strains on communities and their rivers. Our local leaders are facing the pressing question of how to ensure a clean, reliable water supply for current and future generations.\nTraditionally, building more dams and reservoirs was the first and only answer to water supply problems. But these 19th century approaches should not be the primary solutions for our new 21st century challenges. They don’t address the root problem — water is finite and we are not using the water we do have wisely.\nRelying solely on building large new dams is not cost-effective and it won’t solve today’s water needs. Per gallon, dams cost up to 8500 times more than water efficiency investments. Dams are fixed in one place and hold a limited amount of water. Even when we do get sufficient rains to fill reservoirs, these giant pools can lose tremendous amounts of water through evaporation.\nFor these reasons, building new dams should be the absolute last alternative for solving our water supply needs. “Hidden Reservoir,” a report by American Rivers, makes the case that water efficiency is our best source of affordable water and must be the backbone of water supply planning. By implementing the nine water efficiency policies outlined in this report, communities across the Southeast can secure cost-effective and timely water supply. Read the report\nAmerican Rivers advocates at the national, state and local levels for water efficiency and low impact supply solutions that provide cheaper, faster, and more reliable water than costly and harmful new dams and other short-sighted water storage projects. And we work to protect the water flowing in rivers, so that it can continue to nourish our communities for years to come.\nHow you can make a difference at home\nFix leaks inside and outside of your house. A one-drop-per-second leak can add up to as much as 2,700 gallons of water wasted in a year.\nUse rain or gray water to grow the plants in your yard, rather than using high-quality potable water.\nReplace old equipment like toilets, faucets, dishwashers and washing machines with high-efficiency, Energy Star and WaterSense-labeled appliances. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists rebate programs by state available to help defray the cost of new appliances, and you can discover your potential savings here.']	['<urn:uuid:dac81062-03ad-42f8-8195-a9c819c1270a>', '<urn:uuid:5bcf2dc7-56e7-44c4-8ee5-2c38eb674827>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	10	69	1952
30	I'm trying to build a homemade mixer valve for my small engine and only have basic tools - what specific hand tools would I need to complete this project?	You can make a mixer valve using only hand tools including a gas welder, a drill, a hacksaw, and a file. These basic tools are sufficient, and no machine shop equipment is needed.	"[""We all like to see old engines restored to the original condition, just as they were when they were new. Sometimes, however, parts are missing and cannot be located. A choice must be made to forget the engine, or to use non-standard parts, or even homemade parts. This was the case with a Jumbo engine (Nelson Bros.) which I was able to obtain recently. I only obtained the basic castings. There was no valve mechanism, no governor latch, no ignition system, and worst of all no mixer valve, or carburetor as some call it. I was able to make all of these parts, and now have the engine running.\nMost of my 'engine nut' buddies had agreed that the mixer would be the most difficult to make without the use of a machine shop. Actually it turned out to be quite simple using only hand tools, a gas welder, a drill, a hacksaw, and file. The materials required are available at any hardware store.\nThis mixer works fine on my engine, and I believe it will work on any small (1 to 2 HP) hit-and-miss engine. In the hope it may help someone else save an old engine, I have made some pictures and sketches of how the mixer was made.\nSome things to keep in mind while looking at the sketches. The use of 1/8 inch pipe couplings (which are about 1/2 inch actual outside dia.) across the one inch main body tube forms a kind of venturi which will siphon fuel from the tank without the choke closed. This is a necessary part of the construction. On an angle mixer the venturi effect can also be controlled by how close the back corner of the mixer body is cut off. If you want the engine to run well at slow speed, then make the cut about 1/4 inch or less from the cross couplings. If the engine is to run fast, and make a lot of power, then increase the distance. Keep in mind if the distance is larger, then the air flow through the mixer at low speed may not be enough to lift fuel from the tank. Most of us like to see these old engines run slow, and often we don't pull any load at all, so I cut my mixer a bit less than 1/4 inch to produce a strong venturi effect, and give good low-speed performance.\nThe following is a 12-step procedure to make a mixer (see the diagrams in the Image Gallery for a visual step-by-step):\n1. Cut 1-inch ID electrical conduit at 45 degrees.\n2. Notch cut ends with a rat-tail file.\n3. Weld to form an elbow. Run a drill through the hole to smooth it.\n4. Weld two 1/8-inch pipe couplings together for necessary length. Grind or file the weld smooth. Drill a 1/8-inch hole at center one side only.\n5. Saw off the corner of the ell at 45 degrees, about 1/4-inch from the hole.\n6. Weld or braze a nut to the center of a washer of the size to just cover the hole produced by cutting the corner in step No. 5.\n7. Weld or braze the washer and nut to cover the hole in the back corner of the ell. Use care to keep it on center.\n8. Use a 1/4-inch cap screw about 1 inch long. Chuck in a drill and spin it against a file or grinder to form a needle. The point should be about 3/8-inch long.\n9. File or ream the hole until the 1/8-inch pipe couplings will just slip through.\n10. Slip the couplings in place and turn the hole to face the pointed screw. Screw the point into the hole in the coupling snugly. This will hold the coupling in the correct position while the ends are brazed to the elbow.\n11. Weld a flange or whatever is required to fit the engine. Also a choke plate. It is a good idea to cover the lower front air horn about 1/4-inch up to avoid fuel drip.\n12. Screw an angle valve in one side of the coupling and plug the other side. Connect to the fuel tank through a check valve. The tank should be slightly below the mixer. The needle must be adjusted to the engine.""]"	['<urn:uuid:c7f8b283-5f35-4416-9c3d-700f33e877e9>']	factoid	with-premise	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	29	33	718
31	Does my country affect how much I earn from clicks?	Yes, visitor location significantly impacts CPC (cost per click) rates. One click from Asian countries provides a CPC of $0.01 to $1, whereas the same click from a US location offers a CPC of $1 to $5 or more. Focusing on India results in lower CPC, while US traffic generates higher earnings from Google AdSense.	['Cost per click or CPC can be mentioned as the amount the AdSense user earns every time the ad is clicked.\nIt is the advertiser who determines the CPC for any ad.\nThere are certain advertisers who would be willing to pay higher per click when compared to others based on the advertising content.\nWhen your web pages make use of Google AdSense, it means that they are adverts from Google’s AdWords advertising program.\nThe AdWords programs are used by the advertisers and they pay Google for each click on the adverts.\nThe AdSense blocks are placed on certain blogs and web pages, and a percentage of an amount is paid to the user of what they pay Google.\nThe present status is for the advert, it is 68% of the bid price.\nSuppose for any particular advert, or keyword Google is paid $2 then the user would get about $1.36 when any user in your site clicks on the advert.\nThe CPC rates on websites can be enhanced by developing appropriate ads, optimization of texts in ads, and development of compelling ads that grab in the attention of visitors.\nThe main factor which Google AdSense CPC depends upon is on the website niche.\nWhen a competitive niche is considered, the CPC would also be more for Google AdSense ads which are present in the website.\nCTR or Click Through Rates:\nCTR is the click through rate; it is the percentage of people who click Google AdSense ads on websites.\nHere is a simple example, imagine that $0.2 is your average CPC for 12,500 approximate clicks. In the same manner, if $0.3 has been your CPC with similar above-mentioned clicks, then there would be a generation of $.3,750.\nFrom the above example, it can be understood that with just $0.1 increase there is an increase in generation of about $1250.\nFor this reason, it is mandatory to concentrate on enhancing click through rates (CTR).\nAnother aspect is the average click-through rate is 2% on Adwords. Above 2% for anything can be mentioned as above average CTR.\nAverage click through rates opens up details about the frequency of visitors for the ad. With CTR the quality of imaginary keywords and positioning can be determined.\nWhen all the industries are taken into consideration, the average CTR for any ad search would be 1.91% and for a displayed ad it would be 0.35%.\nCalculation of CPC in Adsense:\nCalculating CPC or cost per click is achieved by the following formula as mentioned.\n- CPM * impressions/1000 would be the cost to an advertiser\n- The cost to an advertiser * 1000/impressions is the CPM\n- CPC * number of clicks: cost to an advertiser\n- The cost to an advertiser/number of clicks=CPC\n- (number of clicks/number of impressions) * 100= CTR\nMaximum CPC can be mentioned as the bid which is set to find the highest amount which the user is ready to pay for the ads per click.\nWhen any visitor clicks the ad, it will not cost higher than the maximum cost per click which the user has set.\nObtaining Money from AdSense:\nTo get money from AdSense, the user needs to sign into AdSense account. The next step would be to navigate to the left panel and click on settings.\nThen the user needs to click on payment and on manage payment methods, click on add payment method.\nClick on enter bank information and save the same.\nHere are a few ways which are used to enhance Google AdSense CPC and CTR. To understand cost per click (CPC) the below suggestions can be read.\nWays to Increase AdSense CPC:\n1. Website niche:\nA good niche for your website is a mandatory aspect.\nThe CPC for keywords associated with niches such as web development, health, internet marketing, gaming, and finance are quite perfect and high paying.\nWhen entertainment and education related niches there may not be such good CPC.\nApart from the amount you make from Google AdSense, it is important to choose a website niche which provides you whole some income chances for a prolonged term and is evergreen.\nThe number of dollars you generate from Google AdSense each and every month can be determined from the niche you pick.\nMaking more money online is complete after choosing the right niche. The CPC of an ad depends mainly on the topic that you are writing in the blog. There are few niches which provide you with enhanced returns, they are\n- Tech gadget such as Apple products\n- Internet domain blogs such as Namecheap, Godaddy etc.\n- MS office\n- Google products\n2. Picking money-making keywords:\nClick through rates AdSense can be created by penning down all profitable keywords.\nDuring developing content for your blogs, you can make use of these keywords. In order to enhance AdSense, CPC keyword research is the main aspect.\nFor users who desire to enhance CPC AdSense for their blogs can follow certain suggestions as mentioned.\n- Lookout best outstanding keywords of your competitors. CTR AdSense can be enhanced by making a note of all profitable keywords from top blogs in your arena. To find the top keywords from blogs in your niche tools such as SEMrush can be used.\n- It is always suggested to make use of long tail keywords. This makes ranking easy and also provides good search traffic for blogs.\n- Another suggestion would be to use global search volume keywords which have about 1000 to 2000 searches per month. AdSense CPC can be enhanced by making use of less competitive keywords.\n- It is important to write keyword rich content all the time. Keyword research should be your initial task before developing content for blogs. By this your blog’s search traffic can be boosted and also AdSense CTR and CPC is elevated.\n3. Develop ads that grab visitors vision:\nGood Google AdSense campaigns can be developed for perfect income from Google AdSense ads by concentrating on customer wants and needs.\nIn order to gain relevant phrases for your ads, it is important to make use of Google Adwords keyword suggestion tool.\nThis is done to know the competitiveness in keywords and to investigate the amount they can generate for each keyword.\nIt is true that compelling ads stay out from the competition and such ads generate enhanced CTR.\nAt the time of developing the ads, the developer should step into the visitor’s point of view for more clicks than thinking about the generation of more money.\nIt is mandatory to possess a power-packed headline, search engine friendly description, and irresistible URL.\nIncreasing AdSense CTR, CPC also depends on where your ads are placed in the blog.\n4. Quality content is the prime idea:\nTo gain more CPC and CTR rates from Google AdSense it is necessary to hold quality content.\nContents must be written around a website niche strictly. By this way, it would be a well-themed website for the specific niche.\nThere will be a drop in your click rates when content is unrelated. By this way, present visitors may also be lost.\n5. Creating good landing pages:\nAny visitor to your page for the first time would surely look at all the design aspects used in the page. The design should never be messy as it may develop a spam feeling for the visitor.\nConversation rates can fall down if there is a messy design. Whatever has been promised in the headlines must be delivered and there should not be false promises.\nBy this way, Google AdSense campaigns would offer you with enhanced CPC.\nIn order to enhance CPC and CTR with landing pages, it is necessary to develop less distractive pages.\nFor the development of landing pages, tools such as LeadPages and GetResponse are to be utilized. By using the mentioned tools, magnificent landing pages can be developed.\n6. Location of visitors:\nWhen discussing improvement of CRT, the website visitor location is a major factor.\nOne click from the Asian countries provides you with a CPC of $.01 to $1 whereas the same click from US location offers you with CPC $1 to $5 or more.\nFor enhanced AdSense earning, it would be a great idea to improve US traffic. Lower CPC can be obtained when India is focused.\nMore CPC from Google AdSense can be obtained when more of US traffic is obtained.\n7. Usage of heat maps:\nHeat maps can be mentioned as a demonstration of web pages which represents the visitor’s favored arena to spend time and what is clicked the most.\nBy this way, the users can place their AdSense advert in the most famed arenas in the site and are sure to get the maximum clicks.\n8. Image and video ads:\nAt a time only one image and video advert can be presented.\nLike text ads row of the image ads cannot be displayed hence the visitor’s view is on one advert only.\nService providers, advertisers, and manufacturers sponsor their brand with the help of a logo or any other image in AdSense advertising. This clearly mentions that they prefer to develop videos in order to promote their business.\nThese kinds of adverts pay more than text ads. This works well only if the video content matches the page’s content.\n9. Avoiding smart pricing:\nThe advertisers can bid for a certain amount for a specific ad and Google would pay you less than that. This is said to be true when the click from your site does not prove for a good discussion for advertisers.\nThis is called smart pricing and your website should never be affected by the same.\n10. Permit block ads:\nAllow block ads can be found in Google AdSense.\nBy navigating there, the users can find out the amount each type of ad is paying you. Here varied types of ad categories presented on the website can be seen.\nUsers can move on and block the category which does not pay you much. There may be few categories which may be purely different from your environment, those types can be blocked.\nFor example, your blog may be related to technology, and then the ad categories related to religion, politics, dating may be blocked. By this way AdSense, CPC can be enhanced.\n11. Based on the platform:\nMobiles, laptops, and desktops are the various platforms from which blogs are read. The true fact is that CPC is not affected by the platforms or from where they are read.\nThe main aim should be to focus on more visitors. The real aspect is that more visitors would be from laptop and desktop devices.\nIf hand held devices are targeted, there would be enhanced CPC as these hand held devices have higher quality ads.\n12. Image and text format:\nThe user should follow the appropriate format for their ads. When decided to place about 3 ads per page, then it is good to opt for 336*280 ads and also 468*60 ad.\nText ad formats are recommended as they gain elevated CTR.\nAlso, more CPC can be obtained with image and text format together.

32	How do tourism management and sustainability connect in nature preservation?	Tourism management and sustainability are connected through careful visitor control and environmental protection measures. At Yehliu Geopark, this includes regulated visiting hours, designated viewing areas, and strict rules against touching formations. These align with broader sustainable tourism principles seen in rainforest management, where ecotourism emphasizes small group sizes, minimal environmental impact, local community involvement, and visitor education. Both systems prioritize meeting current tourism needs while ensuring long-term preservation of natural resources for future generations.	"['Exploring Yehliu Geopark | Day Trip Travel Guide from Taipei, Taiwan\nMay 2, 2020\nLocated on Taiwan’s north coast near Keelung City, Yehliu Geopark is one of the most popular tourists day trip activities from Taipei. Located just 30-40 minutes bus ride from Taipei city, its a must for anyone travelling to Taipei to visit this geographic wonder.\nTable of Contents\nThe Geography Behind the Rock Formations\nAs the rock layer of the nearby seashore contains limestone that is subjected to water erosion, weathering and earth movements, Yehliu is full of seawater-eroded holes and numerous rocks in the shape of a mushroom, candle, and ginger. The scenery here is beautiful and you can trek along the ocean to find panoramic views of the East China Sea.\nThe Mushroom rocks have attracted the most attention from guests visiting Yehliu. Originally, these rocks have gone through water erosion, but as time goes by, the hard concretion came out due to the impact of wind, sun, rain and seawater. In present day, the mushroom rocks showcases 3 types of eroding process – from no-neck, broad-neck to narrow-neck ones.\nTake note that the tourists are not allowed to touch or destroy any of these rock formations when visiting Yehliu, this is so that the next generations can enjoy seeing them as well.\nLocation of Yehliu Geopark\nAddress: 207, Taiwan, New Taipei City, Wanli District, 港東路167-1號\nYehliu is a cape in Wanli District, Taiwan that leads up to 1.7 km towards the East China Sea.\nDirections to get from Taipei to Yehliu Geopark?\nOption 1: By Public Transportation (Cheapest Option)\nIt’s easy to get to Yehliu Geopark from Taipei as there are several direct buses that run from the city. The travel time will take you about 1.5h and cost about NT $100-150. Information from Yehliu Geopark Website:\nGetting from Taipei to Yehliu Geopark:\nTake bus No. 1815 (bound for Jinshan Youth Activity Center) of Kuo-Kuang Co. at KUO-KUANG BUS TAIPEI TERMINAL (near Taipei Main Station); alight at Yehliu stop. The bus comes every 20 minutes. (Weekdays: the first bus at 05:40am and the last bus at 11:00pm; Weekends: the first bus at 06:30am and the last bus at 11:00pm.)\nTake the express bus (bound to Jinshan) at Tamshui station (near Tamshui MRT Station); alight at Yehliu stop. The bus comes every 30 minutes (the first bus at 05:50am and the last bus at 10:20pm).\nTake the express bus (bound to Jinshan) at National Taiwan University. The bus comes every 15 minute. (The first bus at 07:30am and the last bust at 10:10pm).\nGetting from Keelung to Yehliu Geopark:\nTake the express bus (bound for Jinshan or Tamsui) at Keelung station (near Keelung Railway Station). The Bus comes every 10 minute. (the first bus at 05:40 am and the last bus at 10:40pm).\nOption 2: Booking a Yehliu Geopark Tour (Most Convenient Option)\nThe most convenient option would be to book a tour shuttle bus online (NT $450). These tours usually come in a package, so you’ll get to visit Jiufen, Shifen and the Golden Waterfall as well. Hence, the price that you’ll be paying is really worth it as it covers multiples attractions in one day and it saves you the hassle of the public transportation system.\nOption 3: Rent a Vehicle\nIf previous options isn’t what you’re looking for, you can always rent a car. This is more cost-efficient if you have a group of 4-5 people. The duration of the journey will take you about 40 minutes.\nYehliu Geopark Ticket Fees & Opening Hours\nOpening hours: Daily, 8am to 5pm Entrance Fees: NT $80for Adult ticket; NT $40 for students and children between 6-12; free for disabled & children under 6. Average Duration of Visit: 3-4 hours\nYou can purchase your tickets at the entrance ticket office when you arrive. Alternatively you can pre-book it online, the price is the same either way.\nThings to do at Yehliu Geopark\n1. Admire the Clear Waters\nThe location shown in this picture below is probably the first thing you’ll see after buying your entrance tickets to go inside the park. The water is clear and the view was absolutely stunning, perfect for a photoshoot.\n2. Tour around the Rock Formations\nThe unique rock formations are the main reason visitors come to the park. Out of the many mushroom-like rocks that you will see, one stands out the most – Queen’s Head. This particular rock formation is said to resemble Queen Elizabeth I of England or Queen Nefertiti of Egypt.\nTypes of Rocks:\nMushroom Rocks: There is about 180 rocks in the shape of mushrooms, formed through the eroding process. Among them the most famous is the Queen’s Head.\nCandle Rocks: Candle-shaped rocks were carved by marine erosion. After the softer surfaces had eroded off, the ball-like erosion had not only created a circular tench at the top but also encroached downward to shape a cone candlestick.\nHoneycombed Rocks: Honeycombed rocks refer to mushroom-shaped crags whose surface is filled with marine-eroded holes of different sizes.\nGinger Rocks: After the softer surface had been washed away as a result of long periods of marine erosion, the hard calcium concretion of rocks were further squeezed by the earth movements to take the shape of gingers.\nPot Holes: Pebbles were brought by wave to wave-cut platform and then bumped deeper and deeper to form many pot-shared holes.\n3. Hike to Scenic Spots\nAfter viewing the rock formations, walk further up along the coast. You’ll find a lot of nice spots to take pictures along the way. There are also hiking trails that you’ll find where you can walk to higher grounds for even better views.\nWhat to Bring to Yehliu Geopark?\nI was here in June previously and it was extremely hot. Bring an umbrella or at least a hat because there is no shade around the park. Water is also an essential. If you need to grab a drink, there’s a local mart situated at the entrance. Other than that, wear comfortable shoes for walking. The hiking routes aren’t difficult at all, so flip-flops are fine too.\nThe Best Time to Visit Yehliu Geopark\nThe best time to get to the park is as early as possible – 8am. This is to avoid the crowds as thousands of tourists visit it everyday. There is also an option to visit it at sunset for the view, but the area gets very dark at night, so you’ll have to make you’re way out of it before that happens.\nIn June when I visited, the sun was strong and the skies were really clear. It made sightseeing and the view more enjoyable despite having to brave the heat. It is advised to check the weather report a day before planning your trip to park as you would not want to be there on a gloomy day.\nWhere to go After Visiting Yehliu Geopark?\nExploring Yehliu Geopark will only take you half a day to complete, subsequently, you can head to Keelung Night Market then to Jiufen Old Street and/or Shifen Area.\nGetting to Keelung Night Market – Head back to the bus stop you alighted when you came from Taipei. At the opposite bus stop, take bus 862 or 790 (towards Keelung Train Station) and alight at Zhongsi Rd Bus Stop. The journey will take about 2 hours and cost about NT $30.\nGetting from Keelung Night Market to Jiufen – From City Government Bus Stop (near Keelung Night Market), take bus 788 (towards Jinguashih) and alight at Jiufen Old Street Bus Stop. The journey will take about 1.5 hours and cost about NT $30.\nGetting from Jiufen to Shifen Old Town: Get back on bus 788 on the opposite side (towards Keelung Train Station). Alight after 12 stops at Rueifang Station. From Rueifang Station, take the Train 4718 to Jingtong and alight at Shifen Station. The journey will take about 1.5 hours and cost about NT $35.', '• Debt reduction – Countries are relieved of some of their debt in return for protecting their rainforests.\n• Ecotourism – Responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the well-being of the local people, and may involve education. It is usually carried out in small groups and has minimal impact on the local ecosystem.\n• Selective logging – The cutting out of trees that are mature or inferior to encourage the growth of the remaining trees in a forest or wood.\n• Sustainability – Actions and forms of progress that meet the needs of the present without reducing the ability of future generations to meet their needs.\nSustainable uses of the rainforest are uses that allow current generations to make a living from the forest without damaging the forest for future generations to use. It is clear that many of the current uses of the forest just destroy it, with massive long term impacts. However, the countries and people of rainforests need to make a living, and sustainable uses of forests offer them a way to do just that.\nSelective logging and replanting,\nSelective logging is selective because loggers choose only wood that is highly valued, such as mahogany. Clear-cutting is not selective. Selective logging is more sustainable than clear-cutting because other trees and plants do survive in the logging process and over time can allow the forest to recover. However, it does have major drawbacks. Although single trees are felled because they are valuable, other trees can be damaged in the process. This is because a felled tree can damage other trees as it falls to the ground once felled. Also, loggers need to access the wood, so have to clear come forest to make way for machinery.\nEcotourism, conservation and education\nConservation is all about the protection, preservation, management, or restoration of tropical forests and the ecological communities that inhabit them. In this case conservation would seek to manage human use of natural resources in tropical rainforests for sustainable social and economic uses. This includes the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program (ARPA), where the WWF work with the Brazilian government to protect parks covering 150million acres of forest.\nAnother sustainable use is the development of ecotourism. Ecotourism is environmentally friendly tourism where;\n• the people involved seek to protect the environment as much as possible\n• there is education of the visitor\n• some of the profits go back into conserving the rainforest environment\n• the tourism is small scale with low visitor densities\n• local people are employed and involved\nBelow is an ecotourism lodge where tours of the Amazon forest take place. The tourist stay in wooden huts, there is limited electricity, waste is dealt with on site and the food is sourced locally. All of the tour guides are local.\nInternational agreements about the use of tropical hardwoods\nThere are also international agreements on the uses of tropical hardwoods and logging. The International Tropical Timber Agreement was set up in 2006 to ""promote the expansion and diversification of international trade in tropical timber from sustainably managed and legally harvested forests and to promote the sustainable management of tropical timber producing forests"".\n71 countries have signed up to the agreement sponsored by the United Nations.\nThe rainforests are often found in poorer countries that want to exploit them. Debt reduction or conservation swaps offer an alternative to poorer countries to the reckless exploitation of their natural wealth.\nThese swaps basically see poorer countries have portions of their debts wiped out or paid for by richer nations or charities of richer nations in exchange for promising to protect or CONSERVE large parts of their natural environment. This has large scale global effects, by protecting the atmosphere and the hydrosphere. In 1984 the World Wildlife Fund came up with the idea of conservation swaps and in 1987 the first was launched in partnership between the Government of Bolivia and Conservation International (CI) for US$ 650000 which protected 3 natural areas. Many countries have since followed, including the Philippines, Sudan, Zambia, Ecuador and Uganda.\nNEXT TOPIC - EITHER -']"	['<urn:uuid:87b671b7-add3-420c-b936-8b77d8898631>', '<urn:uuid:a79f64c9-fc2b-4ef1-b950-552e841a11b8>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	10	74	2011
33	how do they use scents to make bobcats groom themselves	They use star anise and vanilla steeped in water, which is put into squirt guns and sprayed on logs and trees in the bobcat habitats. The star anise was much more popular than vanilla. When the bobcats find the scent, they either roll around or rub against the sprayed area. In enclosures with multiple bobcats, they would often start grooming each other as well.	['Big Cat Enrichment at Big Cat Rescue\nWatch another video of our enrichment HERE.\nEnrichment Adds Quality to Life\nBobcat Enrichment (photos are from pumpkin enrichment)\nAt Big Cat Rescue, the volunteers formed a committee to focus on the development of appropriate enrichment for the animals in our care. When using different enrichment techniques, the animals can be stimulated to investigate and explore their surroundings. This can be accomplished by presenting novel food items (or presenting food in different ways), as well as novel objects and smells. The presentation of new items and scents can help relieve boredom and improve the overall welfare of the animals. The committee decided to focus our enrichment on trying to encourage increased natural behaviors in our captive cats.\nBeing a sanctuary to approximately 100 cats we had to decide exactly where to start. As a committee we determined the easiest\nway to approach our task was one species at a time. We started with our bobcats for a number of reasons. We are home to a significant number of them (over 40) at a wide range of ages. Also, they represented a variety of backgrounds. Some were pets, some came from fur farms, some were hand-raised and some came from the wild.\nFor our study of bobcats and enrichment, we used the SPIDER model, which was\npresented by staff from Disney’s Animal Kingdom at a recent conference attended by some our our volunteers. SPIDER stands for Setting Goals, developing a Plan, Implementation, Documentation, Evaluation, and Readjustment. This presented a simple and organized system for us to follow.\nThe committee then used a list of questions to research bobcat behavior in the wild. These questions related to their hunting techniques and prey, territories and markings, threats, interactions with other animals as well as other observations. We also reviewed the histories of our current bobcat population and examined their enclosures. We investigated what bobcats did in their natural environment and then brainstormed ways to try to encourage and recreate those behaviors in their enclosures here.\nFrom our research, we were able to target a number of behaviors that we wanted to encourage with our bobcats. These included grooming, water play, sunning, climbing and denning. When the committee developed ideas to recreate these behaviors, the ideas were then submitted to our staff and veterinarian for further approval. (It is important to consider individual health issues for each cat when determining the appropriateness of different types of enrichment.) These steps covered the goal setting and planning part of our model. Next came the fun part, the implementation!\nFor grooming, we used scents that we could spray into their enclosures. We used star anise and vanilla steeped in water. We then put the scented water into squirt guns and sprayed logs and trees in the bobcat habitats. (Just a note: the star anise was much more popular than the vanilla.) The bobcats would usually find the scent and either roll around or rub against the area we had sprayed. We found that when multiple bobcats were housed in the same enclosure, they would often start to groom each other as well. This was probably one of our more successful enrichment goals and it was fun to watch the responses of the cats.\nThey loved it!\nDuring our research, we discovered that bobcats will sometimes spend time in the water. We purchased a galvanized tub that was large enough for the bobcats to play in, but small enough to be easily moved from cage to cage. The tub was placed inside an enclosure and was filled with a few inches of water. We found that some of our bobcats really enjoyed splashing around and investigating the water.\nWe also wanted to find ways to encourage our bobcats to sun themselves and climb, which were other natural behaviors that we studied. This involved examining our current enclosures. We had to determine which cages naturally had\nrocks and logs in sunny spots or trees for climbing and if or how we could improve or change the others. We used scented treats in the higher spots of their enclosures to encourage them to climb. The bobcats seemed to enjoy this as well. We did note, however, that on our types of cage wire, the cats that were clawed sometimes had difficulty climbing the cage itself. We restricted any treats on the cage itself to cats that were declawed.\nOur research also revealed that bobcats will often create temporary dens. To encourage this behavior, we placed large boxes in their enclosures. The boxes had holes in them large enough for the cats to enter. The results of this were mixed. Some of our bobcats loved them (although they did not necessarily use them for dens) and some of them were not interested.\nAfter each implementation of enrichment, we evaluated our successes and failures, determined what changes we needed to make and sometimes tried again (the readjustment part of the model). The adjustments we made were noted above.\nAs far as documentation, we decided the easiest way for us to record our enrichment was to make a list of all of our animals. When one of our volunteers gives an animal enrichment, the date and type of enrichment is logged on the list. The lists are updated monthly.\nThe enrichment committee at Big Cat Rescue has found this model to be helpful in organizing, researching and documenting our progress. We have learned so much more about our animals through this process and with that knowledge, feel like we can give them better care while they are with us. We hope you can use some of the information we have shared here.\nFormer Volunteer, Carolyne Clendinen\nReactions ran from leaping, pouncing, rubbing, drooling, spraying, guarding and eating the pumpkins. Like most things, the best things in life are free.\nThese were some of the ploys used by zoo keepers across America to entertain captive cats. Our Volunteers implement them here for our animal’s enjoyment.\n- Laser Mouse: The red pin light pointing device. The cats will chase this thing anywhere, just don’t point it in their eyes. Even during the day, the beam is bright enough to catch their attention.\n- All Spice or just about any other cooking spice will “spice” up an old toy or cause the cat to rub all over a log of specific spot. Ask for outdated stuff at groceries or spice dealers.\n- Cantaloupe, coconut, apples in water bucket\n- Use yogurt containers to make blood- cicles for the cats to lick in the heat. Use bucket forms to make them for the Tigers. You can get plenty of blood at food prep at 7 pm each night.\n- Move their cage furniture around to make things more interesting, just be careful not to make an escape route.\n- Do not use staples, tape, wire or string in making permanent cage toys.\n- Pinecones, dipped in blood with meat chips smushed in are great amusement, but not on Mondays as the cats might be hungry enough to eat the cone.\n- Civet poop is very aromatic. Have a sample tested by the vet to make sure there are no parasites to pass along.\n- Pumpkins full of crickets. The crickets will hang out in the pumpkin for food and the cats will have fun chasing them if they don’t. Use natural vine to hang chicken wings so that the cat can pretend to capture it’s food. Be careful that the cat cannot hang it’s self. Tape recorder playing bird calls sealing in a plastic ball. Geoffroy cats, put their litter boxes as high up as you can as they use trees in the wild.\n- Astroturf, outside Lemur cage, but within reach. Spread with peanut butter and let them pick at it all day. Be sure to wash thoroughly.\n- Toilet paper rolls make great places to hide treats for cats, lemurs, civets, coati etc…\n- Training dummies soaked in hunting scents, like rabbit and grouse, hung from heavy duty plastic chains, at just above nose height, will keep\nThe animals enclosure should supply them with ongoing things to do.\nAbove right, Pisces, the Fishing Cat catches a fish in his stocked pond.\nAll tigers should have access to a pool. Three of our tigers have access to a lake in which they can swim. 11 of our tigers retired here in their golden years and had never had the opportunity to swim, so shallow cooling pools were created for them to insure they didn’t drown. Their pools over look the lake and have pumps that keep the water from the spring fed lake circulating through the pool and then back to the lake via a water fall. This creates a nice atmosphere in which the cats can lounge at the lake’s edge and dream about the swans and ducks they could catch.\nA very inexpensive way to amuse cats for hours is to use paper towel, toilet paper and fabric tubes to hold various meats that aren’t the cats typical fare. The tubes are sometime sprayed with perfumes, or marinated in spices. All of our volunteers collect these card board tubes and save them up for enrichment days. One of our supporters, Kay King has a fabric related company and donates the fabric tubes for the larger cats. Photo by Anissa Camp of Mary Ann Reeds hands.\nThe cats will spend hours carrying the tubes around as if they caught the “prey” themselves. They roll on them, drool on them and eventually shred them to pieces to get to the good stuff inside. This stimulates all of their natural predatory instincts and provides a safe form of amusement. Photo by Anissa Camp of Shadow the Western Cougar sniffing his tube to see what the mystery treat of the day is.\nEnrichment on a Budget\nBeing a non-profit sanctuary poses several obstacles for enrichment activities. Many resources, primarily money and time, are extremely limited. Volunteers are required to wear multiple hats to ensure a safe and healthy life for our animals. To add enrichment activities to the exhausting cleaning, maintenance, and fund raising was a daunting prospect. But despite the struggle, Big Cat Rescue in Tampa, FL has implemented a successful enrichment program.\nMany of the enrichment types we utilize have already been mentioned in several places, so this article will focus more on how we’ve implemented the program, giving some insight into the challenges we faced.\nOne of the first actions taken was to determine what enrichment activities absolutely could not be accomplished. Mimicking foraging and other food-based enrichments are usually major activities at large institutions. We see the benefit of such projects, but are not able to implement any for our carnivores. Due to the fact that all animals are housed outside in Florida weather, mealtime comes just before\ndusk for all meat-eaters. Any other feeding time would run the risk of increasing our bug and parasite populations. Another negative aspect is that the volunteers who prepare meals are not always the ones overseeing enrichment, so there is room for error in diet.\nInstead, bite-sized “treats” are used in food-puzzles or as motivation to inspect a new object. Using frozen fish for enrichment has proven very successful. We feel that because fish is not an item used in our regular diet preparation, it is a novelty itself. Frozen fish purchased by the bag is inexpensive, and the long shelf life helps with our time constraints. A common use of food in our enrichment program is to hide a piece of smelt inside a paper towel roll with the ends curled in. We’ve received positive responses from Cougars (Felis concolor), Servals (Felis serval), Caracals (Felis caracal), as well as Binturongs (Arctictis Binturong) and African Civets (Civettictis civetta).\nAfter determining what enrichment activities were unsuitable for our program, we then brainstormed the ease of implementing the activities left on the table. It may seem that the animals are being short-changed by our realistic approach, eliminating very effective and useful activities. But it is our careful thinking and knowledge of how the sanctuary must be run every day that allows the program to continue and flourish.\nAfter all the planning, we ended up with a selection of easy to implement, use and monitor activities to enrich all of the species (over 25!) at the sanctuary. Many of the materials needed can be saved from the trash (yogurt cups make the perfect size bloodcicle to fit through our cages). We modified projects that required purchasing items to use things that were cheap and easily available. For example, a project that intrigued us was to cut holes in a gourd and stuff it with liverwurst. Gourds are seasonal and can be expensive, so we modified the activity to use potatoes. An apple corer is used lengthwise on the potato, and then the left over center can be used to either plug the potato, adding a level of difficulty to the activity, or the center is rolled in sweet basil and pumpkin spice and given to our Geoffroy’s cats (Felis geoffroyi). The Geoffroy’s have shown much more response to olfactory stimulation than any other toy or food.\nWhat ties our enrichment program together is a database where all activities are recorded. This database tracks the date, species, name, enrichment type, and the animal’s reaction. The species, animal name, and enrichment type are fields that must be chosen from lists. We are alerted when an attempt is made to add an item to these lists. This gives us an opportunity to realize something new has occurred and we should discuss it with the rest of the group.\nBesides reports on all the animals, the database can search on any of the first four fields (date, name, species, enrichment type). This allows for all sorts of questions to be answered. In an instant, we can learn who received enrichment last, what types of enrichment a certain species has responded to and how, as well as take a look at individual cases.\nIn particular, we have many cougars that were privately owned and truly enjoy human company. While this is an added bonus to help care for them, they often prefer the enrichment volunteer to the enrichment activity. It is extremely useful to have at our fingertips an individual history on each cougar of what has been offered them and how they have responded.\nBig Cat Rescue houses approximately 100 animals on 69 acres. With volunteers undertaking the daily workload, starting an enrichment program seemed impossible. But with careful planning before implementation and the open communication of the database, we have logged hundreds enrichment activities and have seen wonderful reactions from all of our animals. Now that the initial hurdles have been conquered, we are taking steps to implement some of the more labor-intense enrichment activities previously discarded.\nBy Jessica Hosford\nWe are avid readers of The Shape of Enrichment.\nThis may just be the perfect enrichment picture. Conan, a retired circus tiger, enjoying life on Easy Street in his 2000+ square foot Cat-A-Tat with earthen floors, real plants, trees, leaves and grass, a waterfall, pool with boomer ball, two white swans swimming by the outside (top center) and a box full of enrichment goodies. What a life!\nThe Ice Hasn’t Melted in Florida Yet\nBelow is enrichment made by Big Cat Rescue volunteers. Mice in ice blocks, swings in the shade and cool rock dens are all ways the cats of Big Cat Rescue can endure the summer heat.\nThis was a great day of enrichment for a few of the cats. Obviously, Moses and Ana really do love their swing. I found them on it in the morning when I arrived and pointed that out to all the guests on the tour when they were still hanging up there together.\nAlthough Apollo and Zeus really could have cared less about their block of ice (ironic since they’re Siberians, huh?), Shadow was another story. He was still working on that block of ice at night when we were there to feed him. As food aggressive as he is, can you believe he didn’t even come to lockout to eat? He was still working on that rat in the ice and it had been hours already. Sugar had only been mildly interested, but was really much happier to be able to eat her dinner in peace while the beast just kept licking his icicle.\nIt gives us such a good feeling to see them enjoying themselves this much.\nCheck out another Enrichment Video here: http://bigcatrescue.org/enrichment-program-big-cat-rescue/']	['<urn:uuid:661e39b2-72a6-41e7-aba6-17d83754c2c8>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	10	64	2768
34	How do environmental protection and social equity intersect in infrastructure planning?	Environmental protection and social equity intersect significantly in infrastructure planning. For nuclear waste storage, protecting the Great Lakes ecosystem is paramount, with Michigan representatives opposing sites near Lake Huron due to drinking water and public health concerns. Meanwhile, indigenous rights and consultation are crucial, as shown by the Saugeen Ojibway Nation's involvement in nuclear waste decisions. In EV charging infrastructure, while promoting clean transportation for environmental benefits, current deployment shows social inequities, with chargers disproportionately located in majority-White, higher-income, and higher-education areas, highlighting the need for more equitable distribution to ensure environmental benefits reach all communities.	"['Saugeen Ojibway Nation vote ends company\'s plans to store nuclear waste near Lake Huron\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly conflated site selection processes being conducted by Ontario Power Generation and the Nuclear Waste Management Organization.\nAn Ontario power company has announced it will no longer consider storing nuclear waste underground near Lake Huron.\nA vote by the Saugeen Ojibway Nation of Ontario Friday to stopped the development of a site sought by Ontario Power Generation. Of 1,232 ballots cast, 1,058 were against the site and 170 in favor.\n""We were not consulted when the nuclear industry was established in our Territory,"" said a news release on the vote. ""Over the past forty years, nuclear power generation in Anishnaabekiing has had many impacts on our Communities, and our Land and Waters, including the production and accumulation of nuclear waste.""\nThe release said that SON leaders will work with Ontario Power Generation ""to find an acceptable solution for the waste.\n""We will continue to work with OPG and others in the nuclear industry on developing new solutions for nuclear waste in our Territory,"" said Chief Greg Nadjiwon of the Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation. ""We know that the waste currently held in above-ground storage at the Bruce site will not go away. SON is committed to developing these solutions with our communities and ensuring Mother Earth is protected for future generations. We will continue to ensure that our People will lead these processes and discussions.""\nOntario Power Generation, which operates the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station in Kincardine, said it would respect the Saugeen Ojibway Nation\'s decision.\n""OPG will explore other options and will engage with key stakeholders to develop an alternate site-selection process,” OPG CEO and President Ken Hartwick said in a statement.\nHartwick touted nuclear power as key in the fight against climate change.\n""To enjoy the benefits of this low-carbon, low-cost and reliable source of energy with peace of mind, we must manage the waste responsibly.

Follow him on Twitter @ErvinJeremy.', 'As electric vehicles (EVs) roll onto the roads in large volumes across the U.S, there has been a corresponding demand for more robust charging infrastructure. Despite the appealing environmental and economic benefits of EVs, the convenience of charging stations heavily influences adoption. And there begins the problem. While electric vehicle use is growing rapidly in well-to-do, predominantly White communities, minority neighborhoods have largely been left behind to date.\nThe U.S. government has emphasized the importance of equity when planning infrastructure investments in bills like the Build Back Better plan, and has incentivized a large portion of EV infrastructure funding in programs like NEVI and policies that seek to ensure EV charging infrastructure is deployed equitably.\nBut how well are these policies performing?\nTaking a granular approach to assess the current state of EV infrastructure\nIn an effort to understand the current state of equity in charger deployment, identify gaps that may exist, and add to the body of knowledge surrounding EV infrastructure deployment – we decided to leverage our vast data core, analytical expertise, and powerful software platform to conduct an analysis of Public EV Level 2 chargers in Columbus, Ohio.\nIn the sections below, we explore where access to EV chargers is most prevalent based on variables like population density, various socio-demographic statistics, and with different definitions of what constitutes a charging gap.\nEV Charging Infrastructure Basics\nFor EVs to achieve broad adoption and utilization, drivers need easy access to charging infrastructure. While many EV owners charge at home, people with longer commutes or irregular driving habits are unlikely to see themselves in EV ownership without excellent access to public charging stations.\nThere are three levels of charging equipment, determined by charging speed.\n- Level 1 (L1) – less than 2% of public EV chargers in the U.S. are L1.\n- Level 2 (L2) – the most common type of public EV chargers, accounting for more than 80% of public EV chargers in the U.S.\n- Level 3 (L3) – more than 15% of public EV chargers in the U.S. are L3.\nDue to the overwhelming preference for and majority of public charging stations being Level 2, we focused our analysis on L2 chargers.\nThe Landscape of EV Charging Infrastructure in Columbus\nAt first glance, you see that Columbus has Level 2 EV chargers spread across the city. A high concentration of chargers are located in the downtown area. So during our study, we took population density into consideration when drawing any conclusions regarding charger placement.\nRacial Factors and public EV Charger Locations\nCloser inspection of the distribution of public chargers in Columbus reveals disparities when comparing majority White areas to majority non-White areas. This is in line with other recent studies on public EV charging distribution. For example, Axios did an analysis of 35 U.S. cities and found that majority-White census tracts are 1.4 times as likely to have a charger.\nGiven UrbanFootprint’s unique ability to aggregate data across all census resolutions, we looked a level of granularity deeper, analyzing census block groups in Columbus using our Analyst application. It revealed that the EV charging locations in our study area are even more heavily skewed towards majority-White areas than what Axios had found in other cities around the country.\nIn Columbus, majority-White block groups are 2 times more likely to have a charger, and 2.3 times more likely to have at least three chargers.\nBut we knew there were likely other factors that may be more strongly correlated with the prevalence of charging stations than race and ethnicity.\nRelationship between EV Charger Presence and Educational Level\nOur study found an even stronger correlation between high education levels and the presence of EV chargers. It was immediately apparent from looking at the map that the median US educational attainment level (36% with at least a bachelor’s degree) was a tipping point for whether a block group would likely contain an L2 charger.\nTo be specific, around 80% of L2 chargers in our study were located in block groups with above the US median for bachelor’s degree attainment – and those block groups were 3.55 times as likely to contain a charger than those below the median.\nThe really shocking piece of this statistic is that these same block groups accounted for only 51% of population and only 40% of area.\nMedian Income and its Impact on EV Charger Distribution\nMedian income also appears to play a significant role in charger presence. Within our study area, block groups with chargers had median incomes 1.1 times higher than those without. Moreover, block groups with average incomes above the US median for household income ($68,703) were 2.24 times as likely to have a charger.\nThis finding supports the argument that historically, charger placement has favored higher income areas, and raises concerns for how access to EV infrastructure will lead to income-based disparities in future EV usage.\nEquitable Access to EV Chargers\nThe end goal of public EV charging infrastructure is to serve the public. That is, having enough chargers in a given block group to satisfy demand. We wanted to get an overall picture of who is being “served” versus “unserved” in Columbus. We chose 4 L2 chargers as a threshold for which to consider a block group “served.”\nWhen we looked at the data through this lens, all three ‘metrics’ (education level, median income, and racial composition) showed equity-related differences.\nConclusions and Recommendations\nOverall, our findings indicate that education level and median income are the most closely related metrics to the distribution of EV chargers in Columbus, Ohio. While racial factors are not quite as strong, there is still a trend for chargers to be more present in predominantly White block groups – in line with studies of other major cities across the country.\nAdditionally, the results were progressively more compelling as we peeled back all of the layers of data. For example, when limiting the analysis to the areas of the city with the highest population density, and increasing the threshold of what counts as a charging gap, the trends are magnified significantly.\nPolicymakers, local governments, utilities, and private companies should consider these findings when incentivizing, funding, planning, and placing future EV infrastructure. By focusing on ensuring equitable access to chargers, they can support the wider adoption of EVs. This includes prioritizing charger installation in diverse neighborhoods and areas with lower educational attainment and income levels.\nBy leveraging the right data at the intersections of climate, community, and the built environment, we can surface the actionable insights that will ensure a more equitable distribution of EV chargers – that will ultimately contribute significantly to higher EV adoption rates, pushing us closer towards a more resilient, sustainable, and inclusive future. Resilience Insights, when paired with our comprehensive Analyst application for data visualization, provide answers to many complex questions related to Infrastructure & Mobility for any location in the United States.

35	carrots fall planting challenges pest protection	Carrots are hardy fall vegetables requiring 60-90 days to mature and need loose, rock-free soil to prevent branching. While they do well in shady areas and become particularly sweet when harvested in fall, gardeners must be vigilant about pest protection. As underground vegetables, carrots are especially vulnerable to wildlife such as rabbits and deer seeking to build fat stores for winter. Additionally, in regions like the Rockies/North Central area, grasshoppers pose a significant threat as they are particularly fond of carrots and can even chew through protective row covers.	['Planting vegetables for fall: Some varieties of fall vegetables require longer in your garden to mature than others\nVegetable gardening is one of the most satisfying types. Not only do you get to watch your seedlings grow up to be strong and healthy plants but you get to harvest the fruits of your labor and enjoy them at the dinner table. If you are planning on a fall harvest you need to start thinking about planting your vegetables in the beginning of the summer. Some vegetables will require longer growing times than others and you don’t want to miss your opportunity to plant them on time.\nFall vegetables pose unique growing difficulties. When you plant your seeds the days will be long and dry. Towards the end of their growth the days will be shorter and the weather cool and wet. In order to pull in a successful harvest of fall vegetables you need to choose varieties that can withstand frost and cooler weather. Some vegetables will actually gain improved flavor from a light frost or two.\nCabbage is one of the hardiest fall vegetables. Cabbage plants enjoy full sun and should be planted at least two feet from each other to give them ample space to grow. Your cabbage will need plenty of water to develop lush heads. Cabbage plants need anywhere from sixty to ninety days to mature depending on the variety you choose. Ideally you should plant your cabbage some time in July depending on the region you live in. You want your cabbage plants to be nearly mature by the time your first frost comes.\nAnother hardy fall vegetable is the carrot. Carrots do well in shady areas and are particularly sweet when harvested in the fall. You will need anywhere from sixty to ninety days for your carrot plants to mature to harvest. Carrots need to be planted in loose soil that is free of rocks or any obstructions that will cause your carrot roots to branch off and produce unattractive vegetables. It can take quite a while for your carrot seeds to sprout so don’t be discouraged if you don’t see any signs of your plants for several weeks. Your carrots are ready for harvesting when the top of the root is between one and two inches.\nOne of the most popular fall vegetables is the pumpkin. Although pumpkins are harvested in the fall they need at least three months to mature and they do not tolerate frost well. If you want to have pumpkins ready to harvest in the fall you will need to plant them as soon as the soil is between 70 and 90 degrees and all danger of frost has passed. If you live in an area that will not give your pumpkins a sufficient length of time to grow in warm weather you will need to start your seedlings indoors. Pumpkins are a versatile vegetable and can be used in pies, breads, and muffins. The pumpkin is also a great vegetable for the grill. If you can’t eat all of your pumpkins you can use them for jack-o-lanterns at Halloween.\nSpinach is a vegetable that does well in the spring and the fall. You can get at least two crops of spinach out of your garden each year or more if you live in a temperate climate. Spinach plants do not like hot weather so wait until the beginning of August to start your seeds. Spinach plants need to be at least one foot apart for optimum growth. Spinach is great for salads and cooking and is high in vitamin A.\nDon’t forget to eat your broccoli! Broccoli tastes better when harvested in the fall especially when it is freshly picked from your garden. Broccoli plants need between fifty and a hundred days to mature to harvest so plant them at least six weeks before the first frost of the fall season. Give your broccoli plants at least two feet apart from each other. Broccoli requires frequent fertilization and it is important to water the base of the plant only or you will cause the plant to flower ahead of schedule. Broccoli does not last for long once it is picked so it is important to blanch and freeze it as soon as possible after it is harvested.\nSeveral varieties of vegetables that grow underground such as radishes, turnips, and rutabagas are also very hardy fall vegetables. If you plant these types of vegetables you will need to be on the lookout for wildlife such as rabbits and deer who are trying to build up stores of fat for the winter ahead.\nThere may be many more varieties of fall vegetables that will do well in your area and your local nursery will be able to point you in the right direction. A harvest of fresh vegetables makes a wonderful end to the growing season. If you freeze or can your homegrown vegetables you can enjoy them all winter long.', 'What could be more disheartening than carefully nurturing a garden to the brink of maturity, and coming out one morning to find some mysterious plant-eating culprit has taken it out?\nIt has happened to me more than once, so I started researching the subject,\nand I wrote this article containing the most pertinent information on what I found.\nWhat is Eating My Plants?\nMany insects eat garden plants, and some can devour a garden in mere days. In the Mid-Atlantic, Pacific Northwest, and New England regions of the US, slugs are the number one garden pest. In the Rockies, it’s the grasshopper; in the Midwest and Southern Interior, the squash bug; in the Southwest, the aphid, and in the Gulf Coast region, the tomato hornworm.\n- 1 What is Eating My Plants?\n- 1.1 Slugs, Cabbageworms, and Japanese Beetles in the Canada/New England Region\n- 1.2 Slugs and Japanese Beetles in the Mid-Atlantic Region\n- 1.3 Squash Bugs and Squash Vine Borers in the Southern Interior and Central/Midwest Regions\n- 1.4 Tomato Hornworms and Squash Vine Borers in the Gulf Coast Region\n- 1.5 Grasshoppers and Aphids in the Rockies/North Central Region\n- 1.6 Aphids and Tomato Hornworms in the Southwest Region\n- 1.7 Slugs and Aphids in the Pacific Northwest Region\n- 2 Frequently Asked Questions About Garden Pest is Eating a Plants\n- 3 Conclusion About What is Eating My Plants\nSlugs, Cabbageworms, and Japanese Beetles in the Canada/New England Region\nIn the Canada/New England Region of the US, slugs are the number one culprit to look for when a garden is suddenly being devoured.\nSlugs leave large holes in a plant’s leaves and in the fruits or vegetables it produces.\nThose growing lettuce, tomatoes, cabbage, and beans should suspect slugs first, as these seem to be at the top of their favorite foods list.\nIt’s easy to tell if slugs are the culprits because they leave behind slime as they wriggle around helping themselves to what the garden has to offer.\nSlugs sort of “hibernate” during the day, and they prefer eating at night.\nThey are attracted to moist soil, so water plants early in the day and allow the ground time to dry before nightfall.\nThe cabbageworm and the Japanese beetle are neck-in-neck for second place garden culprit in the New England region.\nThe cabbageworm (adults are known as small whites or cabbage whites) eats cabbage, of course, but also cauliflower, broccoli, kale, and the like.\nCabbageworms transform into cabbage white butterflies, but pretty isn’t always sweet.\nThe butterflies are likely laying eggs and leaving them underneath the leaves of the vegetables in the garden.\nCabbageworms munch at the base of a vegetable plant and eat its foliage. One day — surprise, there is nothing left but big veins and stems.\nCabbageworms can destroy a garden, and their fecal matter can not only stain but also contaminate the vegetables.\nSlugs and Japanese Beetles in the Mid-Atlantic Region\nSlugs are also the number one garden pest in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US, but in close second place is the Japanese beetle.\nWhile the Japanese beetle prefers fruit and ornamentals, they will certainly eat vegetables.\nThey will damage the leaves of green beans, asparagus, eggplant, peppers, rhubarb, sweet basil, and all types of greens, like collards.\nThey can also cause “silk clipping” in corn. Silk clipping occurs when an insect feeds on the green silk strands, possibly causing fewer kernels per ear.\nSquash Bugs and Squash Vine Borers in the Southern Interior and Central/Midwest Regions\nSquash bugs are the primary garden pest in both the Southern Interior and Central/Midwest regions of the US.\nThey eat vegetables like squash, pumpkin, and melon.\nSquash bugs eat the foliage of plants with mouths that are able to pierce the leaves and suck out the sap from them.\nThis results in plant wilting and sometimes death.\nWhen the population of squash bugs gets high, it can become a real problem for a gardener or a farmer.\nSquash vine borers are actually neck-in-neck with squash bugs in the Central/Midwest region,\nand while not as prevalent as squash bugs, they are not far behind them in the Southern Interior region.\nSquash vine borers lay their eggs at the squash plant’s base. Later, after the eggs hatch,\nthe larvae bore into the stems closest to the ground, weakening or even killing the plant.\nSquash vine borers like squash but prefer Hubbard over butternut squash.\nThey also like zucchini, pumpkins, and different types of gourds but do not care for melons and cucumbers.\nTomato Hornworms and Squash Vine Borers in the Gulf Coast Region\nIn the Gulf Coast region of the US, squash vine borers are common, but the number one garden pest is the tomato hornworm.\nTomato hornworms adore tomatoes but will also dine on peppers, eggplant, potatoes, and even tobacco.\nAs a rule, they feed from the top of the plant, down. Inspect the tops of tomato leaves for black or green droppings.\nFind them, turn over the leaf, and likely, a tomato hornworm will be there.\nLook for missing leaves and stems and wilted leaves that hang down. A hornworm hosting a white cocoon is likely nearby.\nGrasshoppers and Aphids in the Rockies/North Central Region\nGrasshoppers are the primary garden devourer in the Rockies/North Central region. They chew ragged-edged holes in plant leaves.\nIt seems that they don’t care for peas, squash, or tomatoes, but they are very fond of lettuce, carrots, onions, beans, corn, and raspberries.\nGrasshoppers also eat flowers but don’t like ornamentals, such as lilac, crepe myrtle, verbena, forsythia, portulaca, lantana, dianthus, salvia, or artemisia.\nGrasshoppers don’t play around. If they are especially starved, they can chew through row covers.\nSecond on the list of garden pests in the Rockies are aphids, which I’ll discuss in the next section.\nAphids and Tomato Hornworms in the Southwest Region\nAphids eat many plants, but various species of aphids are drawn to certain plants. Various species are named according to what they like to eat.\nThere are cabbage aphids, bean aphids, potato aphids, melon aphids, green peach aphids, and woolly apple aphids, to name a few.\nAphids suck on the juices of the plants they eat, attacking their roots, stems, leaves, buds, fruit, and flowers.\nThey leave behind a sticky substance called honeydew, which is a telltale sign that aphids are the culprit.\nSlugs and Aphids in the Pacific Northwest Region\nSlugs are way ahead as the number one garden pest in the Pacific Northwest region, followed by aphids.\nTo learn more about a particular pest, the signs of their presence, and how to get rid of them,\ngo to the Old Farmer’s Almanac website and search for that particular pest.\nFrequently Asked Questions About Garden Pest is Eating a Plants\nWhat is eating my indoor plant leaves?\nAphids, spider mites, whiteflies, mealybugs, and scales are the most common culprits when a houseplant has been munched on.\nConsult the Farmer’s Almanac for more information on these pesky creatures.\nWhat are some common non-insect garden pests?\nIf it’s a sure thing that insects are not the culprits eating the plants in the garden, consider birds, mammals, or even reptiles.\nSome species in each of these categories will take a meal in the garden, anyone’s garden.\nConclusion About What is Eating My Plants\nCertain garden pests are more prevalent in different regions of the US,\nso depending upon where you live, you should probably look for that region’s most common culprit first.\nFor more information on getting these pests out of your garden, consult the Old Farmer’s Almanac website.']	['<urn:uuid:c3720b33-e3b7-4d38-be24-80d0f424666e>', '<urn:uuid:d970d1bb-71f6-4825-8c1f-09dac436d560>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	6	89	2096
36	What makes wood better for the environment than brick?	Wood siding is more environmentally friendly because brick veneer production requires 22 times more energy to produce, and wood is a renewable and biodegradable resource.	['By Nick Gromicko\nWood siding has been in use for a long time and is extremely popular. While newer, more modern materials have become very fashionable recently because of the benefits they provide in terms of weathering and damage resistance, wood siding is still commonly found on homes all over the world. InterNACHI inspectors will frequently come across this type of exterior cladding during inspections. Inspectors and homeowners alike can benefit from knowing more about the different kinds of wood siding, its advantages and disadvantages, and some signs that problems may be occurring.\nCommon Types of Wood Siding\n- clapboard. Also referred to as weatherboard, and bevel and lap siding, clapboard consists of long boards installed horizontally in such a way that they overlap. It’s typically made with cedar and redwood because of their strength and resistance to decay;\n- rectangular plank. This is similar to clapboard but it is installed vertically, as opposed to horizontally, and has a smooth look. Narrow strips of wood called battens are used to cover the joints and keep out moisture;\n- plywood. Yellow pine, Douglas fir and western red cedar are typically used in plywood siding. It can be installed vertically and horizontally, and it adds to the structural strength of a house;\n- shingles and shakes. Shingles are typically made of cedar, cypress and redwood and are machine-cut to uniform shapes. Shakes are similar to shingles but are hand-cut, so the sizes are not identical or necessarily uniform. Both types are applied from the bottom of a structure to the top, with each new layer overlapping the one below it;\n- solid wood or lumber. This is a very common form of siding made from solid pieces of wood that may be installed vertically, horizontally, diagonally, or in any combination. Solid wood siding is very durable and attractive, when properly maintained; and\n- hardboard. This is also sometimes called composition board. It is manufactured wood siding made of compressed wood fiberboard with synthetic adhesive, often pre-finished and treated with EPA-approved preservatives to help resist insect damage and decay. It is lightweight and less expensive than solid wood siding, and can be easier to work with because it lacks knotholes.\n- Wood is generally considered the most aesthetically desirable form of exterior cladding, and may increase the resale value of a home. A historic building with properly maintained wood siding in good condition is generally considered more valuable than a similar building whose siding is of a modern or synthetic material.\n- A large variety of styles and types of wood is available to suit different tastes.\n- Wood siding can be painted and stained virtually any color. Oil-based stain or paint is typically applied to the rough-sawn side, which will readily absorb the coating.\n- In many instances, wood siding can be repaired more easily than other forms of exterior cladding. A single damaged board of siding can usually be replaced and repainted.\n- Wood siding is generally considered the most environmentally friendly option, as opposed to other materials, such as brick veneer. According to Virginia’s Sustainable Forestry Initiative Program, brick veneer production requires 22 times the amount of energy needed to produce wood siding. Wood is also a renewable and biodegradable resource.\n- Although wood siding may be easier to repair than other materials, it requires more maintenance in general, and repainting or resealing must be done every few years.\n- Unlike siding made from synthetic materials, when not properly maintained, wood is susceptible to rot, which can lead to structural issues if not addressed in a timely manner.\n- While termite problems can occur with other materials, wood siding is more susceptible to direct attack from wood-destroying pests. The use of treatments and preservatives, as well as the choice of wood, can help prevent termite problems.\n- The cost of installing wood siding can be prohibitive, as it is one of the most expensive types of exterior cladding. The average price for a 1,250-square-foot installation may range from $6,500 to $7,500.\nA visual inspection of the siding includes reporting on its general condition. Defects may include damage, cupping, curling, cracking, splitting, and other problems that could affect the performance and lifespan of the siding.\n- Improperly applied paint is a common problem, which can cause blistering, peeling, cracking and fading.\n- Paint problems can also be caused by interior moisture passing through the wall and lifting the paint.\n- Chalking of the paint can occur over time. It can gradually break down to the point that it will lift off as a powdery substance when touched. This indicates that repainting is necessary.\n- Oil-based stain can deteriorate over time due to exposure to UV rays, excess moisture, or physical damage, or it may not have been properly applied in the first place. Stain may need to be touched up or re-applied.\n- Vegetation that holds moisture or water up against the siding, such as vines and ivy, can be detrimental to the condition of the siding over time, and eventually lead to water or moisture damage.\n- Natural wood siding should always be installed over building paper or housewrap in order to provide adequate protection from water intrusion.\n- Depending on the type of siding installed, the nails may be exposed or hidden. Proper use and installation of the correct nails is very important with wood siding. Generally, siding and box nails are used for face nailing. Casing nails are used for blind nailing. Nails should be corrosion-resistant. Nails should also be rust-proof to avoid discoloration. Stainless steel nails are the best choice.\n- Buckling and cracking can be a concern, especially with hardboard siding. The boards or planks should be attached with enough room left for natural expansion and contraction of the wood, which occurs across the grain.\n- If the moisture content of the wood siding is too high and external temperatures are right, rotting will ensue.\n- Water penetrating a wall often comes from poor building practices\naround windows and doors, as well as wall attachments, such as light\nfixtures. Outside corners are often subject to rotting due to\nimperfections at the corner joints. A moisture meter is also a useful\ntool for examining any suspicious conditions observed. Sources of\nmoisture that can lead to rotting include:\n- roof leaks;\n- gutter leaks;\n- openings or gaps in joints;\n- condensation; and\n- wood installed close to or below grade.\nWood siding in its different forms is a common exterior cladding material that inspectors will encounter frequently. InterNACHI inspectors can benefit from knowing more about the different types used, as well as some typical problems associated with it.']	['<urn:uuid:987c22db-e644-49d1-8b57-c9a6b27a3a9c>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	9	25	1111
37	songkran festival buddhist traditions what do people do at monasteries	During Songkran, people may visit Buddhist monasteries (wat) to pray and give food to monks. They also carry sand to monasteries to make stupa-shaped piles decorated with colorful flags, which compensates for the dirt they carried away on their feet during the year.	"['""The Songkran festival (Thai: สงกรานต์, Khmer: សង្រ្កាន្ត; from the Sanskrit wordsaṃkrānti, or literally ""astrological passage"") is celebrated in Thailand as the traditional New Year\'s Day from 13 to 15 April. It coincides with the New Year of many calendars ofSouth and Southeast Asia.\nThe date of the festival was originally set by astrological calculation, but it is now fixed. If these days fall on a weekend, the missed days off are taken on the weekdays immediately following. Songkran falls in the hottest time of the year in Thailand, at the end of the dry season. Until 1888 the Thai New Year was the beginning of the year in Thailand; thereafter 1 April was used until 1940. 1 January is now the beginning of the year. The traditional Thai New Year has been a national holiday since then.\nSongkran has traditionally been celebrated as the New Year for many centuries, and is believed to have been adapted from an Indian festival. It is now observed nationwide, even in the far south. However, the most famous Songkran celebrations are still in the northern city of Chiang Mai, where it continues for six days and even longer. It has also become a party for foreigners and an additional reason for many to visit Thailand for immersion in another culture.""\nThis celebration entails a ceremonial blessing by sprinkling of water. Over the years, it has evolved into almost prankish levels. So if someone hits you with a water balloon or dumps an entire bucket of water on you and runs for cover, you\'ll know why.\n""The most obvious celebration of Songkran is the throwing of water. Thais roam the streets with containers of water or water guns (sometimes mixed with mentholated talc), or post themselves at the side of roads with a garden hose and drench each other and passersby. This, however, was not always the main activity of this festival. Songkran was traditionally a time to visit and pay respects to elders, including family members, friends, neighbors, and monks.\nBesides the throwing of water, people celebrating Songkran as a Buddhist festival may also go to a wat (Buddhist monastery) to pray and give food to monks. They may also cleanse Buddhaimages from household shrines as well as Buddha images at monasteries by gently pouring water mixed with a Thai fragrance (Thai: น้ำอบไทย) over them. It is believed that doing this will bring good luck and prosperity for the New Year. In many cities, such as Chiang Mai, the Buddha images from all of the city\'s important monasteries are paraded through the streets so that people can toss water at them, ritually \'bathing\' the images, as they pass by on ornately decorated floats. In northern Thailand, people may carry handfuls of sand to their neighborhood monastery in order to recompense the dirt that they have carried away on their feet during the rest of the year. The sand is then sculpted into stupa-shaped piles and decorated with colorful flags.\nSome people make New Year resolutions - to refrain from bad behavior, or to do good things. Songkran is a time for cleaning and renewal. Besides washing household Buddha images, many Thais also take this opportunity to give their home a thorough cleaning.""\nSo if you never got to that New Year\'s resolution, go ahead and make it now. :) Better late than never.']"	['<urn:uuid:136d7786-fbd4-47fa-95a6-55787346cf1a>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	10	43	559
38	fret assays bodipy fl donor vs lanthascreen terbium donor which better for avoiding compound interference	LanthaScreen's terbium-based system has an advantage over BODIPY FL in terms of avoiding compound interference. While BODIPY FL operates in the visible spectrum which helps reduce interference from test compound auto-fluorescence and absorption, LanthaScreen's terbium donor has a significantly longer fluorescent lifetime that allows measurement after any interfering background fluorescence or scattered light has completely decayed, making it highly resistant to interference from color quenchers, light scatterants, and fluorescent compounds.	"[""- Inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis represent antibacterial drug targets\n- A FRET-based assay was developed to find MraY inhibitors\n- The simultaneous dual emission detection capability of the PHERAstar®FS enhances high-throughput\nTable of contents\nThe bacterial enzyme N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide translocase (MraY) is a potential target of antibacterial drugs. It attaches UDP-N-acetylmuramoylpentapeptide (UNAM-pp) to lipid undecaprenyl phosphate (C55P), an essential step during bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. A FRET-based approach detects substances that inhibit MraY and can be read on BMG LABTECH's PHERAstar®. The HTS-suitable assay embeds the donor fluorophore (BODIPY FL), the MraY enzyme and C55P in a micelle. Acceptor-labelled (LRPE) UNAM-pp is then transferred by MraY to the micelle-standing C55P and FRET can occur with the micelle-embedded BODIPY FL.\nIn presence of MraY activity, the resulting fluorescence of the acceptor depends on reaction time and acceptor concentration. The assay allowed for determination of the IC50 value of the MraY inhibitor tunicamycin A. The ratiometric analysis eliminates fluctuations between measurements and makes it a robust assay with a high Z' value.\nPeptidoglycan is an important structural component of the bacterial cell wall. The continual synthesis of peptidoglycan and remodelling of the cell wall is essential for most bacteria. Since the enzyme phosho-N-acteylmuramoyl-penta-peptide translocase (MraY) catalyzes one of the last cytoplasmic steps in the peptidoglycan biosynthesis, it represents a target for antibacterial drugs. This integral membrane protein catalyzes the attachment of soluble UDP-N-acetyl-muramoylpentapeptide (UNAM-pp) to the lipid undecaprenyl phosphate (C55P) which is membrane bound.\nIn this application note we want to present a novel homogeneous FRET-based assay to monitor the activity of MraY. A donor fluorophore (BODIPY-FL) is attached to UNAM-pp (B-UNAM-pp) while the acceptor fluorophore-labelled 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethano-lamine-N-(lissaminerhodamine B sulfonyl) (LRPE), is embedded in micelles which also contain MraY and the lipid substrate C55P (Figure 1).\nMraY translocase activity will attach B-UNAM-pp to C55P bringing FRET acceptor and donor close to one another. Excitation at 485 nm will result in energy transfer, reducing donor fluorescence (at 520 nm) and increasing acceptor fluorescence (590 nm).\nMaterials & Methods\n- PHERAstar FS microplate reader (BMG LABTECH)\n- Optic module (Ex:485 nm; Em: 520/590)\n- Chemicals were obtained from commercial sources\n- 384 well, low-volume, black, polystyrene plates (Matrix Tech)\nPreparation of UNAM-pp and cloning, expression of MraY in E.coli as well as subsequent preparation of membranes from E.coli overexpressing MraY is described in the literature.\nA 6 µL mixture containing 0.06% Triton X-100, C55P and E.coli membranes containing MraY was preincubated for 30 min. Addition of 3 mL of B-UNAM-pp +/- UMP initiated the reaction. Reaction buffer consisted of (final concentrations): 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.05% Triton X-100. Final concentration of reactants: 20 mM C55P, 50 mg/mL membrane protein, 2 µM B-UNAM-pp with 0-24 µM LRPE and 0 or 5 mM UMP.\nTriplicate MraY assays were performed at room temperature. Fluorescence was excited and simultaneous dual-emission measured using 20 flashes for each reading at a focal height 10.6 mm. Measurements were made every minute for 1 hour and triplicate time courses averaged.\nTo test the effect of storage at room temperature, MraY assay reagents were stored at room temperature in the dark in the presence or absence of 0.5M trehalose. Reagents were mixed after 0, 2.5 and 5 hours of storage at room temperature and triplicate F590/F520 data were collected at the 1 hour time point. Z’ calculations could then be obtained from samples with (MAX) and without (MIN) membranes.\nTo study tunicamycin inhibition, reactions contained 16 µM LRPE, 0 or 15 µg/mL MraY-containing E. coli membrane protein, 0.1 µM B-UNAM-pp and 10 µM C55P in assay buffer containing 0.5 M trehalose. Tunicamycin was diluted with assay buffer and average progress curves without membranes were subtracted from the average progresscurves with membranes to obtain D(F590/F520) and DF520 measurements. Percentage inhibition and IC50s were calculated.\nResults & Discussion\nWhen the reaction is exposed to fluorescent excitation at 485 nm a time-dependent decrease in 520 and increase in 590 emission is observed (data not shown). Ratiometric measurements were used as they have less noise than individual fluorescence intensity measurements (Figure 2). This is due to the elimination of fluctuations that equally affect both measurements. The ratio change exhibits an increase in a time and LRPE dependent manner.\nWhen reactions are performed in presence of 5 mM UMP the change in fluorescence ratio is negligible (data not shown). In the absence of UMP a large increase in fluorescence ratio is observed with time (Fig. 2). This effect indicates that the signal observed in the assay is due to the MraY reaction.\nThe effect of trehalose, a sugar stabilizer, on storing the reagents at room temperature was also assessed. Figure 3 shows that Z’ values decrease when assays are stored at room temperature for as little as 2.5 hours. However the addition of 0.5 M trehalose blocks this effect.\nThe sensitivity of this assay to inhibition was studied using tunicamycin (Figure 4). The results show that IC50s measured using Δ(F590/F520) are lower and exhibited less of an increase with reaction time than those measured with ΔF520.\nThis assay has several advantages over those previously reported. First: it uses no radioisotopes so no special training, handling and disposal are required. Second: it uses a donor fluorophore with an excitation wavelength in the visible rather than UV part of the spectrum. This reduces interference from test compound auto-fluorescence and absorption. Finally: a FRET assay using the ratio of the emission of acceptor and donor fluorescence intensities upon donor excitation yields greater precision.\nThe use of Δ(F590/F520) over ΔF520 is advantageous due to greater sensitivity to inhibition, resistance to loss of sensitivity to inhibition and a higher signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore a Z’ of greater than 0.7 indicates that this approach will be suitable for high throughput screens."", 'LanthaScreen Technology Overview\nTime Resolved-Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) is a preferred fluorescent assay formats in drug discovery laboratories. TR-FRET assays are less susceptible to compound interference than other assay formats and may be applied to multiple target classes. To support this technology focus, Invitrogen has developed LanthaScreen kinase activity assays. Invitrogen uses two sets of FRET-pairs in developing our LanthaScreen Assays: Terbium/Fluorescein (or GFP) and Europium/AlexaFluor 647.\nThe LanthaScreen kinase activity assay format is based on the use of a long-lifetime terbium or europium chelate as the donor species and fluorescein as the acceptor species. When terbium (or europium) and fluorescein (or AlexaFluor 647) labeled molecules are brought into proximity, energy transfer takes place causing an increase in acceptor fluorescence and a decrease in donor fluorescence. These fluorescent signals can be read in a time-resolved manner to reduce assay interference and increase data quality.\nThe time-resolved spectra above illustrate energy transfer occurring when terbium and fluorescein are brought into proximity via biomolecular interactions. The TR-FRET value is determined as a ratio of the FRET-specific signal measured with a 520 nm filter to that of the signal measured with a 495 nm filter, which is specific to terbium. The inset shows the time-resolved spectra in the absence of energy transfer.\nOvercome compound interference using LanthaScreen Assays\nTR-FRET assays offer advantages over fluorescent polarization (FP) assays when background fluorescence is a problem. In FP assays, background fluorescence due to fluorescent library compounds is often depolarized. Background signal due to scattered light, like that from precipitated compounds, is often polarized. Either phenomenon can lead to a false positive or false negative result, depending on the assay configuration. Because the donor species used in a TR-FRET assay has a fluorescent lifetime that is many orders of magnitude longer than background fluorescence or scattered light, energy transfer can be measured after the interfering signal has completely decayed. Additionally, unlike FP assays, TR-FRET assays can be formatted using limiting receptor and excess tracer concentrations, driving potential cost savings. Our LanthaScreen assays are resistant to interference from color quenchers, light scatterants, and fluorescent compounds.\nLanthaScreen Tb exploits Terbium as the donor chemistry\nMany TR-FRET assays use europium as the ‘long lifetime label’ doner paired with various far-red acceptors (including allophycocyanin (APC)). Due to the large molecular mass of APC (>100 KD) it has typically been used as a streptavidin conjugate, to in-directly couple to the biotinylated substrate in a trimolecular FRET complex. In contrast, LanthaScreen Tb utilizes terbium as the long lifetime label, enabling direct coupling to fluorescein as the acceptor species. This has the immediate advantage of being able to overcome several issues common to use of APC as the acceptor:\n- Simplify assay optimization. Since the donor-acceptor pair in a terbium-based TR-FRET assay does not require a biotin-avidin mediated interaction, three-compound matricies are not required to determine optimal reagent concentrations.\n- Avoid problems due to steric bulk associated with the large streptavidin-APC reagents including long incubation times to reach equilibrium.\n- Reduce assay cost by replacing streptavidin-APC with fluorescein (as well as remove lot-to-lot variations in streptavidin-APC).\nUse of LanthaScreen Tb also enables the use of GFP as the acceptor molecule, which allows for:\n- Development of protein substrates expressed as GFP-fusion proteins.\n- Development of cell lines expressing GFP-fusions for detection of phosphorylation which has occurred in a live-cell context via TR-FRET.\nIf a traditional Europium/Far Red FRET pair is preferred, Invitrogen offers all of our peptide-based substrates and matched antibodies with this alternative dye pair.

39	How do phagocytes fight pathogens and how do antibodies enhance their function?	Phagocytes, like monocytes and macrophages, directly engulf and digest pathogens, with some specializing in specific tissues like lungs or kidneys. Antibodies enhance their function through opsonization - when phagocytes encounter antibodies bound to antigens, they attach to the antibody's Fc portion, triggering the engulfment and destruction of both the antibody and antigen.

Humoral immunity is the first branch of the adaptive immunity that we will go into. Adaptive immunity is split into the primary immune response and the secondary immune response. The primary immune response occurs when an antigen comes in contact with the immune system for the first time. The level of antibodies produced in reaction to this antigen reaches its peak in about 7-10 days. The secondary immune response occurs when you are exposed to the same antigen any time after the first exposure to the same antigen. This secondary response is much faster with the level of antibodies reaching its peak in 3-5 days.\nHow are antibodies against a specific antigen produced? First, an antigen must be exposed to an antigen presenting cell. The APC will phagocytose the antigen, degrade it into peptides, and express a fragment of the antigen on an MHC-II molecule. The APC will then travel to lymphatic tissue where it comes in contact with many T-cells. The APC then presents the antigen to naïve helper T-cells, which are T-cells that have differentiated in the thymus and undergone positive and negative selection but have not yet encountered a matching antigen in the periphery. One of the naïve helper T-cells will have a T-cell receptor that matches the antigen on the MHC-II. The T-cell will then bind to the MHC-II of the APC with its TCR. This bond is strengthened by co-receptors. CD4 is an important co-receptor found on helper T-cells while CD8 is a co-receptor found on cytotoxic T-cells. CD stands for “cluster of differentiation.” CD4 binds the MHC-II of the antigen presenting cell to the helper T-cell. Another cluster of differentiation that makes this binding possible is CD28 from the helper T-cell binding to the co-stimulatory molecule, B7, on the antigen presenting cell. After the binding of these receptors, co-receptors and co-stimulatory signals, the helper T-cell expresses cytokine receptors on its surface. The helper T-cell will then produce cytokines that bind to these receptors and cause an autocrine activation that brings about the proliferation of the helper T-cell. Now we have a helper T-cell that has encountered an antigen, been activated, and is proliferating.\nThe activation of naïve B-cells is as follows. Naïve B-cells in the lymph nodes express IgD antibodies that serve as the B-cell receptor (BCR). In the first signal of activation, the BCR recognizes a particular antigen and uses receptor mediated endocytosis to bring it into the cell. Once inside the cell, the antigen is broken down into fragments and expressed on MHC-II molecules on the surface of the B-cell. The B-cell gets its second signal for activation from one of the proliferated helper T-cells that we discussed previously. The TCR of the helper T-cell will bind to the MHC-II molecule on the B-cell. This bond will be made stronger by CD4 and CD40L of the helper T-cell. After these bindings, the B-cell will express cytokine receptors for cytokines like IL-4, IL-5 and TGF-beta on its surface. The helper T-cells produce these cytokines and complete the activation of the B-cell. The activated B-cell then proliferates to form a clone army of identical activated B-cells. Some of these cells will become activated memory B-cells. If the body is exposed to this same antigen again, they will become plasma cells for antibody production.\nPlasma cells are capable of making five different types of antibodies: IgD, IgM, IgA, IgG and IgE.\nIgD is generally bound to the B-cell plasma membrane, although a small amount can be secreted into the plasma. IgD starts to be expressed as soon as a naïve B-cell leaves the bone marrow. It acts as a BCR to recognize antigens and helps activate the B-cell. There is not a lot known about what IgD does as a unique and important function in the plasma. For this class, we will try to simply recall that IgD acts as a BCR in early (naïve) B-cells. After a B-cell is activated, IgM is also expressed which can bind to the cell membrane or be secreted. IgM is the first antibody to be produced by an activated B-cell. IgM is responsible for transfusion reactions in the ABO blood system.\nPlasma cells will generally undergo an isotypes switch (meaning to switch to a different type of antibody production) depending on the cytokines that are being produced by the antigen presenting cells of any tissue and also the cytokines being secreted by specific types of T-helper cells. Isotype switching causes plasma cells to start producing IgA, IgG, or IgE. IgA is secreted from mucosal epithelia into tears, saliva, and mucous membranes of the lungs to combat microbes in the eyes, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract. It is also found in breast milk and provides passive natural immunity benefits to an infant. IgG has the highest concentration of all the antibodies in the plasma and can cross the placenta to provide immune protection to the fetus and newborn until the antibodies degenerate after birth. IgE combats parasites and binds to mast cells and basophils to stimulate the inflammatory response. IgE is the major antibody in allergies.\nAdaptive Immune System Activation\nImage by Mackenzie Call BYU-I W20\nAntibodies are made of protein chains bound together by disulfide bonds. There are two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains in an antibody. Functionally, the antibody can be split into two parts: the Fab and Fc regions. The Fab region binds to the antigen it is specific for and is variable between antibodies made by different plasma cells. The Fc region is constant (same between antibodies within a class) and binds to the Fc receptors found on immune cells. In other words, the Fc region is the same for all IgA antibodies, all IgG antibodies, and so on, but it is different between these classes. These two different regions allow for antibodies to interact with the antigens and then other components of the immune system. Now that we have an idea about how antibodies are constructed, let’s discuss how they work and why they are so important. There are several direct and indirect immune mechanisms that are activated by antibodies.\nVarious Antibody Actions Image by JS BYU-I F13\nThe image above details how antibodies work within the immune system. It shows how IgE can activate and degranulate mast cells, resulting in histamine release that contributes to the inflammatory response. Antibodies can also simply bind up an antigen and prevent it from being toxic (if it is covered up by antibodies it cannot interact with our cells and harm them). Phagocytic cells have Fc receptors that bind to the Fc portion of antibodies. If a phagocyte comes upon antibodies bound to antigen the phagocyte will attach to the Fc portion of the antibody. This triggers a phagocytic event that causes the cell to engulf, consume, and destroy both the antibody and the antigen it is attached to. In this way, antibodies act to promote opsonization. Other non-phagocytic leukocytes can also have Fc receptors. When they bind the Fc portion of an antibody, they are triggered to release cytotoxins that can destroy any cell that antibodies might be bound to. This mechanism is called antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC. This mechanism is effective for removing cells that don’t belong, including damaged or cancerous cells. These cells express strange proteins capable of triggering a humoral immune response that creates antibodies against incorrect cellular membrane proteins.\nFinally, as you have already learned, antibodies can trigger the complement system which will enhance inflammation, chemotaxis, opsonization, and the membrane attack complex.']"	['<urn:uuid:c7ef7f6e-0215-415e-bdba-f7af34f94d1d>', '<urn:uuid:a6c0ff0d-ebfb-40b6-bbbe-f4b8929feb57>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	12	52	1967
40	eco friendly house heat cost efficiency	Passive solar houses can reduce energy usage by up to 90% while providing maximum comfort. They use solar energy through south-facing windows and thermal mass materials (like masonry floors and walls) to store heat. The buildings are made 10-15 times more airtight than typical constructions and use continuous exterior insulation, similar to wearing a heavy winter coat. While they may cost about 10% more than average quality buildings initially, this increase is offset by the 90% savings in utility bills.	['Passive Solar Energy\nPassive Solar Energy\nPassive solar energy designs use the energy from the sun to heat, cool, and illuminate our buildings. Solar energy is a renewable energy resource made from sunlight and nearly all of the renewable energy sources we use today comes directly or indirectly from the sun. Solar energy is environmentally friendly, and unlike traditional fossil fuels, passive solar energy is available just about everywhere on Earth. The heat and light that comes from the sun can be used in many ways to make electricity, to provide heating and cooling for buildings, or to heat water.\nPotentially the sun is our most abundant source of free energy and even if a small portion of this energy were harnessed, it could solve many of our current energy problems. One way of harnessing this immense power to reduce the heating and cooling demands of a building is through the use of Passive Solar Energy.\nPassive Solar Design by Mohler + Ghillino Architects\nPassive Solar Energy is the use of solar energy by passive means to reduce the heating demand of a building. A “passive” solar house provides solar cooling and heating to keep the home comfortable without the use of any mechanical equipment such as pumps or fans.\nPassive solar energy relies purely on the design, positioning and style of construction of the home (or other building) allowing it to respond to the environment with nature doing most of the work.\nThen passive solar energy systems are primarily concerned with the design of buildings. Passive solar design focuses on the placement of the home or building and on windows, ventilation, and insulation to cut down on the need for electricity by using the sun.\nAnyone who has sat by a sunny, south-facing window on a winters day has felt the effects of passive solar energy and the home or building is designed to maximize the potential of this solar energy for heating and cooling so a good solar house design is tailored to the local climate and environment.\nThere are several types of passive solar energy designs for buildings and these include: direct gain, thermal storage, solar greenhouse, and convective loops. The simplest form is the direct gain design in which a large south facing (in the northern hemisphere) window, usually double glazed, is used to allow sunlight into the building. The energy in the sunlight entering directly through the windows is absorbed, converted to heat, and stored in the thermal mass of the walls and floor.\nBut as well as using solar energy to heat our homes and buildings, we can also use it to cool them as well. Where as passive solar heating designs collect and store thermal energy from direct sunlight, passive solar cooling can help minimise the effects of the solar radiation through the shading of windows or creating air flows using convection ventilation.\nPassive Solar Heating\nPassive Solar Heating is most cost-effective way of warming buildings and the goal of any passive solar heating systems is to capture and store the sun’s heat within the buildings materials and then release the heat during periods when the sun is not shining.\nWhile at the same time the buildings elements are absorbing the suns heat for later use, there should also be enough solar heat available for keeping the living space comfortable and warm for normal daily use.\nWe have all seen that when an object absorbs sunlight it gets hot and we can put this to good use by allowing sunlight to pass through a window and be absorbed by the building striking directly and indirectly the thermal mass materials in the house, such as masonry floors and walls before being converting into heat.\nHouses heated by passive solar energy have energy efficient windows that face south, so they absorb as much heat as possible from the sun. Once the heat has entered the building, various techniques come into play to keep and distribute it.\nWhile direct sunlight through south facing windows can heat up a building quickly, it is much more difficult to control without the aid of a thermal mass storage wall. The thermal mass of buildings is a common concept in passive solar design. All materials can store heat to some degree so making use of heavy mass materials in the walls, floors, and ceilings gives them a higher thermal mass or heat capacity.\nFor example, concrete and masonry are good heat absorbers so the floors and walls can be constructed from these materials. In the hot summer time, any excess heat will be absorbed by these thermal masses to help cool down the building. Also painting the floor and walls in darker colours will help absorb the heat better.\nOnce the heat is in, a well insulated and air tight building design helps prevent heat loss and allows the solar heat to provide more of the heating needed. Then the crucial component of the passively heated building is in the window positioning and design and passive solar energy makes good use of this. While normal glazed windows let heat escape, high performance windows with insulated frames and spacers, low emission ratings and multiple glazing filled with inert gas or vacuum fills, can help reduce heat loss back through the windows by over 50 per cent in most cases.\nPassive Solar Heating of a Building\nConservatories are also an effective means of bringing thermal energy into houses by means of conduction through a shared mass wall in the rear of a sunroom or by using vents that allow the air between the sunroom and living space to be exchanged by natural convection. A brick chimney between a sunroom and the living room can also act as additional thermal mass. A south-facing home having an attached conservatory can in the hot summer months, use of blinds, curtains or awnings to block the sunlight and prevent the building from overheating.\nBut as well as large south facing windows and high efficiency windows, modern passive solar thermal designs use buildings with high (R-20) levels of wall insulation and air-tight construction to keep the heat in, when it is cold outside and keep the interior cool when it is hot outside. With the heat contained, often a simple ceiling fan is all that is required for the heat to be distributed around the building.\nPassive Solar Cooling\nPassive Solar Cooling is another use of passive solar energy and the opposite to passive solar heating. Passive solar cooling is more about reducing heat build-up rather than about taking it away. Cold is nothing more than the absence of heat and most of us associate cooling and air-conditioning with self-contained electromechanical HVAC devices connected to an electric power source, but the need for air conditioning in the building during the hot summer months can be greatly reduced or even eliminated by using passive solar cooling.\nPassive cooling systems have the same basic components as passive heating systems, but work in a different manner. Producing cooled air by making use of solar energy may seem a bit odd at first sight because we tend to view the sun as a source of heat. However, with passive solar building designs and the use of the right materials it is possible to remove heat thereby cooling our homes and buildings as well as heating them using the power of the sun.\nThe obvious way of shading a building is with the use of shutters, awnings, curtains and landscaping with trees, while still admitting a significant amount of indirect light. From a passive solar viewpoint, the most effective method of shading is on the outside of the building using overhangs which block the sun during the summer months but allow sunlight to enter the building during winter.\nWhen designing with passive solar cooling in mind, heat from solar radiation and heated air should be kept from reaching the building. Natural ventilation relies on the natural airflow and breezes through windows on opposite sides of the building to reduce the need for mechanical cooling when the building is occupied. Also cross ventilation will help distribute the heat more evenly around the building keeping it cooler.\nPassive solar cooling techniques include carefully designed overhangs and using reflective coatings on windows, exterior walls, and roofs. Another way to achieve passive solar cooling is to combine shading with natural ventilation. We can design or modify buildings to use this moving air to cool the building so that the heat of the sun creates convection currents which draw cool air into the building from outside as heat rises, and cool air sinks helping to reduce the inside temperature.\nSolar energy may be excluded from the interior of a structure by building walls that have good thermal insulation or cladding. Thermal insulation in walls can keep heat out of a structure during the summer and keep heat in during the winter. Expanding foam can also be used which is pumped into the wall cavity, which then fills the gap and insulates the home.\nPassive Solar Energy Conclusion\nThe sun is free, it only makes sense to use it so by using passive solar energy design to heat and cool your home you can be both environmentally friendly and cost effective. The term “passive” indicates that no additional mechanical equipment is used so any solar gains are brought in through windows with the minimum use of electrical pumps or fans to distribute the heat or produce an effect cooling. This results in a building that responds to the environment.\nHeating and cooling with passive solar energy is not as easy as you might think. Capturing the sunlight and putting it to work is difficult because the solar energy that reaches the Earth is spread out over a large area. The sun does not deliver that much energy to any one place at any one time. The amount of solar energy an area receives depends on the time of day, the season of the year, the cloudiness of the sky and how close you are to the Earth’s equator.\nBut a well designed passive solar house will have comfortable, even temperatures all year round and make good use of natural light. It will therefore require less energy to heat, cool and illuminate than a conventional house. Hence it will also create less greenhouse gas emissions helping you save money and the environment.\nPassive solar energy requires buildings to be located and designed so that they interact with the environment and climate in a positive manner so a passive solar home requires careful design and siting, which will vary by local climate conditions. If you are considering passive solar design for a new home or a major remodel, consult an architect familiar with passive solar energy techniques.\nTo gain a better understanding of how “Passive Solar Energy” works, or to obtain more detailed information about passive solar design and architecture, then Click Here today to get your copy from Amazon of one of the top books about passive solar energy concepts and practical ideas and ways you can use to heat and cool your home just by using passive solar designs.', 'Frequently asked Questions about Passive House\nWhat is Passive House?\nPassive house is a set of guiding principles (initiated in the 70’s and perfected in the 90’s by Dr. Wolfgang Feist) for design and construction of buildings to maximize interior building comfort thermally and with freshest indoor air quality. All of this is achieved “passively” by using minimal fossil fuel energy to the point that it can REDUCE up to 90% of energy use in a building, and therefore contributing significantly toward carbon footprint reduction, while providing the most comfortable indoor environment.\nWhy do a Passive House?\nWould we like to live in place that provides us with the most comfortable indoor living environment possible with the freshest air, at the same time, use energy most efficiently, thus use much less to do a lot more? If so, then going passive house is the right step towards achieving this goal.\nHow is Passive House achieved?\nThere are 5 main principles that work toward achieving the most comfortable and energy efficient home/building;\n1. Creating a more airtight building enclosure (often 10-15 times more air tight than in a typical building), thereby preventing unwanted cold/or hot air leakages into buildings that would require much more active heating or cooling.\n2. Providing a much more robust exterior continuous insulation to the building envelope, similar to putting on your heaviest, most insulated coat in the coldest winter days, verses, wearing a thin light jacket.\n3. Taking advantage of building’s Solar orientation and Internal heat gains to “passively” heat and cool.\n4. Using high performance windows, that are thermally broken and typically are triple glazed. With this, one would not need to put radiators in front of windows and there will be no draft.\n5. Last, using an active Heat Recovery Ventilation system to provide filtered fresh air 24/7 while reusing the internally heated or cooled air to temper the new outside air, thereby reducing drastically the need for heavy mechanical heating and cooling. Also, minimizing thermal bridging in building construction junctures where materials can conduct heat out of or into the building leading to heat loss in winter and heat gain in summer.\nWhat is the difference between a Passive House and a more conventionally built building?\nAt first glance, they may seem very similar, and certainly from the outside they can even look the same. A Passive House Building uses much greater exterior continuous insulation than that of a typical building. It has much greater air tightness, which leads to also providing freshest air via the ventilation system, and with this system, it takes further advantage of heat recovery of internal heat gains to temper the outside air, thus reducing the need for more active mechanical heat and cooling systems. It uses higher performance windows (thermally broken & triple glazed ), so that there is no need for radiators in front of them, since there is no draft. It takes full advantage of the natural elements of solar orientation and trees for shading to help heat and cool the building “passively”. Last, the details of constructions are designed to minimize thermal bridging that could otherwise potentially lead to condensation and mold. This is the part that is greatly invisible to the naked eye since all the detailing is inside the walls. All these aspects are worked out in the design of the building on paper and in energy modeling softwares prior to construction so that the result is always predictably successful.\nDoes it cost more to build Passive House?\nIn general, it does not cost more than any conventional high quality construction, it can even cost less in these cases. In many parts of Europe, it has become the building standard, and with the prevailing culture of construction it is becoming the norm, thus same with the expense. In other cases, it may cost about 10% more than the average, modest quality constructed buildings. This increase in cost will easily and immediately be offset in 90% savings in utility bill, and in the life span of the building will actually become a huge financial benefit.\nBecause the building has to be air tight, would I be able to open windows or do they have to remain closed all the time?\nYou can open the windows whenever you like. The only difference between a passive house bldg. and a conventional building is that opening windows is a choice and not a necessity for more air. Because the building’s heat recovery ventilation systems provides 24/7 freshest filtered indoor air quality, one does not NEED to open windows for this purpose, and certainly not on days when the weather is extremely cold or hot outside. On any given day, one can open the windows, especially on a beautifully sunny day, where the outside air temperature is wonderful, nothing like it!\nIs Passive House for just a single family or can it be used in larger buildings types?\nPassive house is slightly a misnomer, it should be called a Passive Building, or Energy Efficient Building, since it not only can do single family houses, but the larger the building the more energy efficient it is! This is mainly due to the building volume to building envelope surface ratio – the greater the volume and the less of building envelope surface the more energy efficient the building is. Passive house principle can also be applied to all kinds of building programs that would welcome a comfortable indoor environment, with minimum energy usage and utility bills – residential, commercial, institutional, educational, cultural, hospitality and more!\nHere are examples by other creative architects worldwide.\nCan a passive house be a retrofit or is it just for new constructions?\nPassive House can be achieved in both retrofits and in new construction. New construction may be a bit more straight forward, but retrofit passive houses are done all the time, and it is important that this happens, since we have so much wonderful existing building stock to work with. There are many easy ways to improve existing buildings from applying these principles, whether partially or fully, depending on each buildings unique situation.\nIs Passive House standards similar to LEED or ENERGY Star rated houses?\nThey all work towards helping our environment to be more sustainable, and they can support each other. They differ in that, LEED, currently, focuses on the use of materials and systems that are used that would impact the environment as a whole, whereas Passive house focuses on maximizing interior comfort while drastically reducing the energy usage, and thus the carbon footprint. Building to the passive house standard would certainly benefit one’s ability to participate in the Energy Star incentives and rebates.\nWhat do Passive Houses look like, are they just simple shaped, box like buildings, and do they all look the same?\nBuildings built to the passive house standards can look like ANYTHING one wishes. Since Passive House is a set of guiding principles, it provides a luxurious freedom to have it manifest in any design one can think of. Passive house buildings come in all sizes, shapes, and styles from the range of traditional to ultra modern.\nHere are some examples of Passive House projects that are designed by other talented architects globally.\nWhat is Net Zero or Net positive – can a Passive House project be either of these ?\nA net zero is a building with zero net fossil fuel energy consumption, where the total amount of energy used by the building is approximately equal to the amount of renewable energy created on the site, or elsewhere for this purpose, thereby drastically reducing its contribution to the effects of greenhouse gases. A net positive is a building that would produce more renewable energy than it needs, thus creating a surplus of energy to be used for others.\nWhat are the pro’s and con’s to a Passive House?\nThe pro’s of a passive house is being in a building that is built with high quality workmanship, having it be very resilient and being very comfortable inside, while saving so much on utility bill, as well as being part of the solution to reducing our carbon foot print. The con to a passive house is that once you go passive house, you will never be satisfied with any other building type, and you might never want to leave the comforts of your indoor environment!\nHow can I get started on my own Passive House project ?\nFirst, congratulations on your interest to go passive house. The easiest way to start is to work with a certified passive house designer/consultant to start the dialogue. This can be a certified passive house architect, or consultants who can then help you find the right set up for your particular needs.\nPassipedia - The Passive House Resource\nPassive House Institute – Germany\nPassive House Institute – US\nBuilding Energy Exchange - NYC\nPassive House Building Supply']	['<urn:uuid:265eaa8a-b8f2-469e-a8c1-1ae0c52fcf3a>', '<urn:uuid:09698a21-501c-4490-ab8a-fb636e5a7597>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	6	80	3346
41	How does the relationship between religion and mental health vary depending on a person's religious orientation according to research findings?	The relationship between religion and mental health is most likely to be positive for people who find religion intrinsically important, rather than serving selfish interests. However, a rigid and dogmatic religious orientation may help reinforce irrational and compulsive behaviors that reflect less than optimal mental functioning.	"['The relationship between mental health and religion has generated contradictory theoretical arguments and inconsistent empirical findings (Bergin 1983, Gartner et al. 1991, Larson et al. 1992, Batson et al. 1993). One basic question is whether religion contributes positively to individuals\' mental health or undermines it. Another question concerns the support role of churches and the counseling role of clergy in the mental health system (McCann 1962).\nThe opposing theoretical perspectives regarding the relation between religion and mental health probably reflect biases in evaluations of religion. The view that religion enhances mental health emphasizes that religious beliefs help fulfill the basic human need for meaning, purpose, and confidence in the face of life\'s disappointments, frustrations, and exigencies. In addition, church attendance and involvement in religious groups provide reinforcement for these beliefs and also a social support network. The argument that religion undermines mental health emphasizes the notion that religion perpetuates immature dependency needs and unrealistic illusions, and prevents mature adjustment to the exigencies of life. These positive and negative theoretical orientations are reflected in the classical works of Jung and Freud, with Jung recognizing religion\'s importance in human experience and Freud emphasizing religion as a source of immature illusions. William James\'s (1958 ) classic distinction between the religion of ""healthy-mindedness"" versus the ""sick soul,"" plus his description of the positive effects of a conversion experience for the latter type, have clear implications for mental health.\nIn the voluminous research literature (Schumaker 1992, Pargament et al. 1993, Brown 1994), the weight of the evidence seems generally to support the notion that religion contributes positively to mental health, but this depends in part on how religion and mental health are defined and measured. Beyond a minimum definition based on absence of dysfunctional symptoms, mental health may include a sense of well-being and satisfaction with life, appropriate coping skills, a sense of ego integrity, and, optimally, continual growth and development of one\'s potential. Religiosity measures most often include beliefs, practices, and religious experience as different dimensions. Religious experience is less frequently measured in survey research, except for investigations of a conversion (or ""born-again"") experience, but may be a major element of case studies. The relationship between religion and mental health is most likely to be positive for persons for whom religion is intrinsically important (as opposed to serving selfish interests); however, a rigid and dogmatic religious orientation may help reinforce irrational and compulsive behaviors reflecting less than optimal mental functioning. It is also plausible that one\'s religiosity is itself a reflection of one\'s level of mental health.\nDoyle Paul Johnson\nC. D.

42	What were the physical forms Egyptian funerary texts could take, and how were they preserved alongside the deceased?	Egyptian funerary texts appeared in multiple physical forms: they were inscribed on burial chamber walls in pyramids, written on the inside of stone coffins, and recorded on papyrus scrolls that were placed in tombs. These texts were accompanied by various protective elements including sarcophagi, painted mummy cases (cartonnages) made of linen or papyrus strips hardened with plaster and resin, and decorated with portraits and scenes from the afterlife. The texts and protective elements were essential parts of the burial process, working together with the mummified body to ensure the deceased's soul could successfully navigate the afterlife.	"[""Egyptian antiquities from the Louvre:\njourney to the Afterlife\n21 July – 28 October 2007\nIn July 2007, the West Australian public had the opportunity to see an extraordinary collection of art and artefacts from one of history’s most enduring civilisations. Over two hundred works, comprised of more than 500 precious objects, went on show in 'Egyptian antiquities from the Louvre: journey to the Afterlife'. This momentous event was the first exhibition the Louvre had sent to Australia in nearly two decades. Many of the works were drawn from the permanent exhibition of Egyptian antiquities at the Louvre, while others had never been on public display.\nThe ancient Egyptians saw life as a continuous process, in which mortal existence was only preparatory to the transformation brought by death; a mere shadow of the delightful world to come. A life lived morally and in accordance with the Egyptian commandments would allow a soul to pass through the final gate from the Underworld to the paradise of the Field of Reeds after judgment by the god Osiris.\nThe journey between death and the Hall of Judgement was, however, lengthy and fraught with danger. The deceased had to set out equipped with amulets, magical spells and blessings from the gods. 'Egyptian antiquities from the Louvre; journey to the Afterlife' extracted its narrative from the Book of the Dead - a compilation of spells and incantations to secure protection against the perils of the journey. The manuscripts were often illustrated with scenes of the stages of the journey, or the rewards which awaited those who completed it successfully and gained entry to the Field of Reeds. Known to the Egyptians as the Book of Coming Forth by Day, visitors had the pleasure of seeing a number of these painted papyrus manuscripts in the exhibition.\n'Egyptian antiquities from the Louvre: journey to the Afterlife' included a broad range of subjects and themes in a variety of media, which showcased the incredible skill and virtuosity of ancient Egyptian artists and craftspeople. The exhibition contained major sculptural works in stone and bronze, illustrated manuscripts, painted chests and mummy cases, low reliefs, jewellery, ceramics, and fine wood carving.\nThe smallest objects in the exhibition were the amulets and jewels used to adorn and protect mummies, made from ceramic, carnelian, and other semi-precious stones. An army of over two hundred faience ushabti figures stood to attention, ready to act as deputies for the deceased in the afterlife; prepared to perform any required duties on his or her behalf. Hieroglyphic inscriptions on illustrated stelae invoked the gods to grant favours and safe passage to donors on their travels through the afterlife to the Hall of Judgement. Painted scenes on canopic chests and mummy cases showed vignettes from the journey of the dead, as they travelled beyond the mortal realm towards eternal life with the gods. Lifelike sculptures and mummy portraits ensured the survival of the physical form - the eyes of the deceased gazing at us across the millennia. Throughout, the sublime, impassive faces of the gods watch over the progress of souls through the rigours of life and the Underworld’s dangers.\nAlthough ancient Egyptian art is often perceived to be about death and the tomb, 'Egyptian antiquities from the Louvre; journey to the Afterlife' showed that the elaborate funerary preparations and mummification rituals were actually only the first step on the path to eternal life. The Field of Reeds was a paradise imagined by a simple, agricultural society: tilling fertile fields, tending fat livestock, hunting in a countryside teeming with birdlife and game, dancing and listening to heavenly music, and fishing in swollen streams.\nIt was a life similar to that along the Nile, but brighter, more beautiful, and more restful, where magical servants carried out the more tiresome tasks, and everyone was comfortable and happy. This was not only a paradise for the upper classes, but one to which every Egyptian aspired. Some of the works in the exhibition depicted the world to come; others served as reminders of it, such as a blue glazed bowl decorated with the water lilies that symbolised rebirth and the fecund splendour of the afterlife.\nAmong the most spectacular objects in the exhibition were the sarcophagi, coffins and cartonnages – mummy cases made of linen or papyrus strips held together and hardened with plaster and resin then covered in painted decorations. To enter the Field of Reeds, it was not just necessary for the soul to pass the final judgement before the god Osiris. The body must remain intact for the soul to be reunited with it and these coffins protected the mummified remains from physical damage. Together with the accompanying wall paintings, low reliefs and portrait sculptures inscribed with the names of the deceased, they also allowed the soul to find and recognise its body more easily and substituted for it in the case of loss or damage.\nOne of the most exquisite examples of painting seen in the exhibition, was the Cartonnage of Djedkhonsouioufankh. It combined a portrait of the deceased with a scene in the Hall of Judgment, a variety of talismanic motifs, and symbols of the afterlife and the journey of the soul.\nPharaonic culture lasted in ancient Egypt for well over three thousand years, gradually evolving over this time as the kingdom was conquered, divided, reunited, and transformed. The exhibition imparted an understanding of how these changes affected religious belief and art production over the millennia, from the Old Kingdom when the pyramids were built to Cleopatra, last of the pharaohs, and the Roman conquest two thousand years ago.\n'Egyptian antiquities from the Louvre: journey to the Afterlife' is unlike any exhibition of Egyptian art and culture before seen in Australia. Visitors gained an appreciation of Egyptian artistic traditions and the enormous skill of the ancient hands that fashioned the works on display, together with an understanding of their functional context. Egypt holds a perennial fascination for anyone who owns a memory of a school project on the pyramids, or a first encounter with a mummy on a museum visit. The exquisite workmanship of the objects in the exhibition not only granted the ancient Egyptians their longed-for immortality, but it has bridged the intervening millennia and allowed visitors to accompany them on their journey through the Underworld.\n'Egyptian antiquities from the Louvre: journey to the Afterlife' is organised by the Musée du Louvre, Paris and Art Exhibitions Australia, in collaboration with the Art Gallery of Western Australia, National Gallery of Australia and Art Gallery of South Australia."", 'OUR ULTIMATE COVID BOOKING GUARANTEE. FIND OUT MORE\nEgypt has a rich literary history. The Ancient Egyptian ‘guides for the recently deceased’, or books of the dead as they’re widely known, offer fascinating insights into the nation’s spiritual heritage. Jamie Moore unpacks the history and contents of the most famous Book of the Dead, unveiling its dark mysteries, supernatural qualities and practical tips for a fruitful afterlife.\nDeath has hung over the history of human civilization like a demonic bat, wheezing inexorable extinction into the lives of every mortal, sentient being. The fact of death has terrified humans for millennia and has been tackled in a multitude of ways throughout history, many which have been enshrined in a variety of religious doctrines. With extensive beliefs concerning the underworld and afterlife, Ancient Egyptian civilization was no exception. A common misconception of the Egyptian Book of the Dead is that it is a definitive volume of Ancient Egyptian religious doctrine and dogma, a text analogous to the Bible or the Quran. However, although spiritual and moral guidance is implicit in much of what is written, a more accurate way of conceiving of the work is as a comprehensive practical guide for the recently deceased, delineating how they might navigate their way through all manner of terrifying and seemingly insurmountable obstacles in the underworld to reach to a kind of heaven. Even this latter definition is reductive, and in many ways misleading, owing to the variety of different manifestations the book existed in over the course of Ancient Egyptian history. Nevertheless, as will be explored, similarities can be drawn between much of what is written in the book and later religious texts such as the Bible and the Quran; it is for this reason that the text is considered to augment understandings of subsequent religion and culture.\nSir Ernest Alfred Thompson Wallis Budge was an English Egyptologist, Orientalist and philologist employed at the British Museum. Amongst the myriad antiquities Budge procured throughout his career was his acquisition of the Papyrus of Ani, a manifestation of the Book of the Dead. This version of the text, found in Thebe, contained a number of the chapters that are found in the full version of the text. This was by no means the oldest version of the book we have knowledge of, with other excerpts found inscribed in tombs instated more than 3000 years before Christ. The first funerary manuscripts we know of are the Pyramid Texts, the first of which were sequestered away in the heart of the Pyramid of King Unas of the 5th dynasty dated approximately 2400 BC – a period known as the Old Kingdom. The text was inscribed on the walls of the burial chambers as opposed to being an actual book at this stage. Only royalty would have been entitled to a Pyramid text thus enabling only them to ethereally perambulate through the afterlife and ascend to the heavens in the sky to become deities themselves, snuggling in amongst the gods, and being united with their divine primogenitor, the god Ra. This rigid exclusivity eventually crumbled towards the end of the period of the Old Kingdom when other wealthy Egyptians of high status, like government officials, were able to purchase a path to the afterlife. In her book, entitled, Utterances Going Forth, Sue D’Auria aptly describes this change as the ‘democratization of the afterlife’. These have been dubbed the Coffin Texts owing to the fact that they were most commonly written on the inside of the stone coffins of the deceased.\nThe text in its most famously recognized form developed after these first two versions, incorporating much of the content as well as more recent additions. The 19th dynasty saw the widespread introduction of papyrus scrolls – a paper-like material derived from the pith of the papyrus plant – on which the text was inscribed; this would be placed in the tomb of the deceased. The Papyrus of Ani was a version of the text recorded in this format. Each individual script had to be penned and illustrated by a team of scribes and artists, and often aspects of the story were forgotten or overlooked. Because, by this stage, the scrolls were produced with a view to their sale, quite often spaces would be left in the text where the name of the purchaser could be inserted to personalize the text to them. These spaces can be seen in some of the texts that have been recovered.\nAs these texts were made for sale, a number of copies exist, all different depending on the period they were made in, and the scribes that produced it. Often the text would be produced by a team of scribes and artists because of the gargantuan undertaking the penning of said book consists of. In 2011, researchers at the Brooklyn Museum translated into English a particularly atypical version of the text that was inscribed on both sides. Carbon dating places the age of the text to somewhere between 1620BC and 1430 BC. This unusual copy of the Book of the Dead can be viewed in the mummy chamber of the museum. The Papyrus of Ani mentioned earlier can still be viewed in the British Museum.\nThe purpose of the Book of the Dead is better understood via the Doctrine of Eternal Life. An important caveat regarding the study and analysis of Ancient Egyptian religion is that it is difficult to expound their ideas and beliefs definitively, as they evolved over the course of the civilization’s maturation and there are discrepancies between individual interpretations, even those temporally contiguous. Nevertheless, a general overview of some of the central tenets the Book of the Text might help with its elucidation. One belief that transcended all of the metamorphoses of Egyptian religion is that at some point following death the soul or some other article of an individual would return to life. It was for this very reason that Egyptians were so fastidious when it came to the preservation and burial of the dead. Depending on the period, this would have involved a combination of embalming the corpse and placing the body in a tomb in which articles such as a Book of the Dead would be inscribed or placed, so as to aid the deceased in their battle to attain the ‘heavenly life of the blessed’. In addition, priests and members of the deceased’s family would declaim prayers and short litanies at the burial. All of these rituals were symbolic of the transcendent state the person was about to enter in, their transition from the physical state, referred to as khat, to component parts of this whole, which were variously described as making their own voyage through the underworld. In the introduction to The Papyrus of Ani, Wallis Budge details these parts, the first of being the heart or ka, for the sustenance of which an abundance of food was left in the tomb. Next is the soul or ba, which paradoxically is corporeal as it is an intrinsic part of the physical body of the man. Other aspects are the shadow or khaibit, the intelligence or khu, the form or physical mummification of the body called the sekhem, and finally the ren or name of the man.\nAccording to some ancient texts the heaven that the dead strove to ascend to was in the sky and had to be reached by clambering up a ladder, while others claimed it was through a gap in the mountains of Abydos; yet the ultimate destination was a region of the Tuat or the underworld (Budge 1895). Here the individual was deified and enjoyed an immortality of abundant food and drink, a veritable paradise for the wearied but successful pilgrim of the afterlife. Written in the Book of the Dead is an account of some of the beneficent delights one can expect in this heavenly realm.\n‘O ye judges, ye have taken Unas unto yourselves, let him eat that which ye eat, let him drink that which ye drink, let him live upon that which ye live upon, let your seat be his seat, let his power be your power, let the boat wherein he shall sail be your boat, let him net birds in Aaru, let him possess running streams in Sekhet-Hetep, and may he obtain his meat and his drink from you, O ye gods. May the water of Unas be of the wine which is of Ra, may he revolve in the sky like Ra, and may he pass over the sky like Thoth.’ (Recueil de Travaux, t. iv., p. 69 (ll. 572-75).)\nThe Book of the Dead contains a multitude of magical spells that its owner could use to aid them in their quest to the afterlife. This journey was fraught with all manners of danger posed by an assortment of grotesque creatures and other supernatural obstructions, and this book was considered as an essential item for triumphing over these and thus achieving success. Far from being considered as anti-religious or witchcraft, the use of magic was as legitimate as praying in Ancient Egypt as ‘the concept of magic (heka) was also intimately linked with the spoken and written word’ (Budge 1895). Similarly, knowing the name of some unknown entity was believed to empower the knower, giving them dominion over the named; for this reason the Egyptian Book of the Dead contained many names of the evils one was likely to encounter after death. As mentioned, only the later versions of the texts contained a coherent structure, split into chapters. For example in the Saite version the structure can be divided into four parts: the first 16 chapters deal with entering of the tomb, the descent into the underworld, and the body reacquiring the ability to move and speak. The second section, chapters 17 to 63, delineates the myths concerning the gods and places the dead pass through. The individual is then bequeathed life again so they might be born again with the morning sun. The next section, chapters 64 to 129, describes the journey across the sky in the sun ark, and then in the twilight hours, the deceased descends into the underworld to be judged by the god Osiris. So long as the individual passes this judgement, they move on to section four – chapters 130 to 189 – where they assume their position as a god amongst gods.\nThere are obvious comparisons between the contents of the Book of the Dead and religious texts such as the Bible; for example, belief in a life after death. Some of the most striking comparisons can be made in famed ‘weighing of the heart’ episode depicted in Spell 125. The deceased is confronted by the god Anubis and asked to swear that they have not committed any of the ’42 sins’ by reciting scripture called ‘Negative Confessions’. The resemblance between many of these sins and the Ten Commandments is striking. For example, ‘Thou shalt not kill’ from the Bible is analogous to sin four, ‘I have not slain men and women’ and sin fourteen, ‘I have not attacked any man’. Comparisons can be made for almost every single one of the 42 sins. The heart of the deceased is then weighed against the god Maat, represented by the feather of an ostrich, and should there be an imbalance the heart of the dead will be devoured by Ammit, part crocodile, part lion, and part hippopotamus, and they will not find a place with Osiris in the afterlife. In fact, the entire journey the deceased make with its risk of failure and eternal damnation, or second death – the failure to reach the afterlife – can be likened to judgement in purgatory in the Christian faith. Many more likenesses can be made between the Book of the Dead and later religious texts; one of the reasons it is considered so important.\nThe Egyptian Book of the Dead holds significance as the first known major religious text concerning beliefs about the afterlife. Whilst the doctrine and beliefs have long since been supplanted, one can inform and frame contemporary understandings of death and the afterlife by enveloping oneself, mummy-like, in the entrancing papyrus pages of the Egyptian Book of the Dead.']"	['<urn:uuid:abd674ec-1c31-42e8-8deb-c4ca89442525>', '<urn:uuid:3a7ba8c4-8925-4215-ac35-27ae152ed93d>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	18	96	3132
43	I'm a farmer - what types of crop insurance can I get?	There are three common types of crop insurance: Multiple Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI) which covers natural disasters, Crop-hail insurance which specifically protects against hail damage, and Crop Revenue Insurance which protects against low yields or falling prices.	['Whether you depend on your crops for your entire livelihood, a large portion of your income, or even just to feed your own family, losing a year’s worth of crops could lead to serious financial hardship. Crop insurance helps to replace the income you lose when you lose your crop yield.\nWhat is Crop Insurance?\nCrop insurance is a special type of insurance that’s specifically for the crops that you grow. Unlike a farm insurance policy or other policy, crop insurance protects the plants in your field rather than your buildings, tools, or other hard assets. Crop insurance covers a wide range of perils depending on the options that you choose.\nWhat Types of Crop Insurance Are There?\nThere are three common types of crop insurance.\nMultiple Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI)\nMultiple peril crop insurance is a federally-backed insurance policy that you purchase through authorized private insurers. The federal backing guarantees coverage even during widespread disasters and the private insurers handle issuing policies, reviewing claims, and other administrative tasks.\nMPCI policies generally protect crop destruction or loss of yield due to natural disasters. This may include drought, freezing, and diseases. Some policies allow farmers to add coverage for low yields not caused by disaster or for market price changes.\nAny farmer is eligible to participate as long as you purchase coverage before planting your crops. You can buy insurance coverage from one of the authorized insurers through your insurance agent.\nCrop-hail insurance is a private insurance option. The primary purpose of crop-hail insurance is to protect against hail damage.\nHail can completely destroy one section of crops but leave other sections untouched. This could lead to a large financial loss that still falls below MPCI deductibles. Since crop-hail insurance generally has no deductible, it can also be an inexpensive way of covering your MPCI deductible even if paying that deductible wouldn’t be a major hardship.\nMany crop-hail insurance policies also include coverage for other perils such as lightning, fire, wind, and vandalism. You can generally choose your coverage options, limits, and deductibles to match your financial needs, risk tolerance, and overlapping MPCI insurance.\nCrop Revenue Insurance\nCrop revenue insurance is another private insurance option. It protects you when your revenues fall due to either low yields or prices falling. The main difference between this and an MPCI or crop-hail policy is that crop revenue insurance protects against non-disaster perils. Keep in mind that your MPCI or crop-hail policy may offer this as a built-in or optional add-on, so you may not need crop revenue insurance as a separate policy.\nHow Are Crop Insurance Rates Determined?\nThe United States Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency sets rates for MPCI policies based on the type of crop and region. Private insurers set their own rates for crop-hail policies using factors such as location, crop type, and other risks. You will also need to report your acreage since larger crops will need more insurance.\nHow Much Will Crop Insurance Pay You?\nLike other insurance policies, the first step is checking whether the reason for your loss is covered under your insurance policy. Next, the loss will have to be higher than your insurance deductible for you to be able to file a claim.\nThe value of your crops is calculated based on the difference between your historical yield in normal years and the lowered (or zero) yield in the year the disaster happens. Most policies require the loss to be above a certain percentage of your typical yield and pay a certain percentage of the market price for the lost yield. You can select both of these percentages when you buy your policy with higher percentages leading to a higher premium.\nWhat Happens if You Don’t Buy Crop Insurance?\nWhether to buy crop insurance is a simple math problem. Think about your recurring expenses, the cost to plant this year’s crop, and the cost to clean up the destroyed crops. Would you be able to meet these expenses with no revenue? What if it happened two years in a row?\nIn addition, you should consider any contracts you’ve signed to sell your crops. Would you be liable for damages if you weren’t able to deliver as promised?\nDoesn’t the IRS Give a Tax Break if You Lose Your Crops?\nThe tax code generally does allow you to write off your losses and use them to offset your taxes in either the current or future years. Like other deductions, you generally end up saving a percentage of your loss equal to your income tax rate rather than getting a tax break for the entire loss.\nWhat if Crop Insurance Isn’t Available?\nThe USDA doesn’t offer MPCI policies for all crops in all locations. This may be because the location is less than ideal for a specific crop or because there aren’t enough farms in the area to support an actuarially sound insurance offering.\nEven when you can’t get MPCI coverage, you can almost always find a private insurance policy. If you can’t find a private insurance policy at a reasonable cost, you may wish to reconsider if you’re taking on too much risk by planting that crop at that location.']	['<urn:uuid:4a850213-3680-449d-97a0-170184ca8280>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	12	37	866
44	What is the historical evolution of music festival venues and how does the Dobršská brána festival showcase diverse performance spaces compared to traditional festival settings?	Traditionally, music festivals are commonly held outdoors with tents or roofed temporary stages for performers. The Dobršská brána festival expands on this concept by utilizing multiple unique venues throughout a village setting, including a main outdoor stage, a Baroque church, a shady lawn beside a Gothic tower, and even a pub as a backup performance space. This diverse use of venues contrasts with typical music festivals that primarily focus on outdoor settings with temporary structures, while still maintaining the traditional elements of including various attractions and performances.	"['The Dobršská brána International Music Festival keeps to its tradition and ambition with another year of first-rate musicians from across Europe including the Czech Republic. Each year’s festival has a focus on an instrument; as last year’s was the Accordion, 2021 will spotlight the power of the Drums.\nIn the jazz pantheon, the list of legendary drummers is formidable including Art Blakey, Buddy Rich, Max Roach, Elvin Jones, Philly Joe Jones, Tony Williams, Billy Cobham, and on and on. However, there have not been many women on the list until recent years with the inclusion of Cindy Blackman Santana followed by Terri Lynn Carrington. Following hard on bass-drum pedals is Anika Nilles (born 1983), a fiery drummer from Germany leading her group Nevell (a jazz-funk-rock-pop fusion trio), and Anne Paceo (born 1984 in France), who is a drummer, composer and leader of the Circles project.\nAnika Nilles Nevell performs on the opening night of the festival, which runs for two days/evenings in various venues throughout the quaint hillside village of Dobrs, in South Bohemia’s Sumava foothills.\nAnother highlight of the first day is Pavel Fajt (born 1957 in Brno), a veteran avant-garde drummer percussionist initially noted for his collaborations with the experimental vocalist and violinist Iva Bittová. Fajt is an esteemed figure in the Czech experimental music scene from the 1970s into the current times. In 2001, Fajt released Drum Trek, displaying this master as a soloist with electronics.\nThe roll call of most noted drummers & percussionists on the main day includes Bodek Janke, Cyril Atef, Klaus Kugel and the final headliner Anne Paceo.\nBodek Janke performs his project SONG2, an experimental blend of pop songs from across decades under his jazz-improvisational arrangements and sung by the smooth and fragile-voiced Namibian vocalist Shishani Vranckx. Their repertoire includes jazz ballads “I Fall in Love Too Easily” (Chet Baker), along with 80s and 90s pop radio hits “What is Love” (Haddaway), “Rhythm is a Dancer” (Snap!), “Take on Me (A-ha), and “Eye of the Tiger (Survivor), to list only a few retro-pop nuggets.\nJanke (born 1979, Warsaw) is a Polish-Russian mostly raised and currently based in Germany. He has been schooled in classical conservatories (Karlsruhe) and jazz academies or specialty programs–the Academy of Music Cologne, and City College New York City (MA in Arts & Music Performance). SONG2 also features Estonian pianist Kristjan Randau, and British bassist Phillip Donkin.\nCyril Atef is a French-Persian percussionist and composer and he will bring his project Bumcello with Vincent Segal, who is handy on a wide variety of instruments. Their performances are multimedia and the high-tech visuals are essential to enhance their psychedelic-hypnotic groove with its exotic and experimental twists and turns. Their downtempo electronica is both modern-day primal and futuristic.\nAtef was born in Berlin (1968) then moved to Los Angeles, California, at the age of ten. In the mid-1980s he studied at the Percussion Institute of Technology and at the end of the 80s at Berklee College of Music in Boston. He has been based in Paris since 1990. The other half of Bumcello, Vincent Segal, was born 1967 in Reims, France, and he commands the stage on electric cello and as the lead vocalist.\nConcluding the festival is Anne Paceo, who has been awarded the Victories de la Musique (Jazz Artist of the Year in 2016) and Jazz Discovery of the Year in 2011. Her project Circles is a modern fusion jazz quartet with an uplifting female vocalist-rapper (Camille Durand) and sound-wise, they are a roaring thunder of drums & percussion thanks to Paceo along with saxophone (Christophe Panzani) and keyboards (Tony Paeleman). The roar of drums should be heard loudest of all and far and across the nearby valleys and mountains of South Bohemia for the concluding evening of this year’s festival.\nThe remaining artists/groups on the program include Klaus Kugel, a German master drummer from Munich, who has been a leading figure on the modern jazz scene in Central Europe. Then from the Czech Republic, JeN Hovorka (voice) and Marek Urbanek (drummer) combine urban beat rapping with funky drumming, and the MaBaSo Trio, featuring Czechs Daniel Soltis (drummer) and Michael Baranski (bassist) with Polish vibraphonist Bernard Maseli play a funky 70s jazz art-rock-fusion.\nThe only group in the festival sans drummer is Romanovská Tichý Hrubý & Blažíková. Yet, this group is a nod to the original orientation of the festival combining improvisational and classical musicians for the most curious of outcomes. In this case, the improv trio of classical violinist and koto player Anna Romanovská, classical and jazz double-bassist Peter Tichý, and the free jazz improviser saxophonist-clarinetist-flutist Michal Hrubý will be joined by the soprano and harpist Hana Blažíková, who is a most highly-regarded soprano on the Czech/European classical scene. Hrubý was also an initial organizer of this festival, in its first edition, so this group marks a return to the festival’s roots.\nDespite its size, in the village of Dobrš, this festival offers in this part of Europe the most eclectic first-rate international musicians performing experimental contemporary jazz, classical and pop music. Besides the main outdoor stage, smaller concerts are held in a Baroque church, a shady lawn beside a Gothic tower, and if necessary due to the weather, a barren pub makes for a cozy performance space.\nThe Fifth Annual Dobršská brána International Music Festival 2021 will be on August 13th & 14th. More Information can be found on their website here.\nLast modified: August 18, 2021', 'From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia\nThis article possibly contains original research.

Often music festivals host other attractions such as food and merchandise vending, dance, crafts, performance art, and social or cultural activities. At music festivals associated with charitable causes, there may be information about social or political issues. Many festivals are annual, or repeat at some other interval. Some, including many rock festivals, are held only once.\nSome festivals are organized as for-profit concerts and others are benefits for a specific charitable cause. Another type of music festival is the educative type, organized annually in local communities, regionally, or nationally, for the benefit of amateur musicians of all ages and grades of achievement.\nAncient and medieval\nMusic festivals have developed as an emerging industry which contributes to many national economies. For example, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival earned $114.6 million in 2017. Music festivals nowadays also can serve as a way of building a brand for a destination, creating a unique image for it and attracting visitors.\nAs in Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival there different festivals that attract many tourists. For example, Lollapalooza, Electric Daisy Carnival Las Vegas, Ultra Music Festival, Electric Forest and many more.\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (May 2019)\nThere are also other types of festivals, such as jazz. An example of a jazz festival is the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.\nThis section does not cite any sources. (March 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nAnother type of music festival is the music education, often organized annually in local communities, regionally, or nationally, for the benefit of amateur musicians of all ages and grades of achievement. Entrants perform prepared pieces or songs in front of an audience which includes competitors, family and friends, and members of the community, along with one or more adjudicators or judges. These adjudicators, who may be music teachers, professors, or professional performers, provide verbal and written feedback to each performer or group. The adjudicator may be someone whom they might never meet in any other way, as is the case when an adjudicator from another city is brought in to judge. They also usually receive a certificate, classified according to merit or ranking, and some may win trophies or even scholarships. The most important aspect is that participants can learn from one another rather than compete. Such festivals aim to provide a friendly and supportive platform for musicians to share in the excitement of making music. For many, they provide a bridge from lessons and examinations to performing confidently in public; for a few of the top performers, they provide a pathway to further professional study of music in a college, university or conservatory.\nFestivals around the world\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\'s 11-day event, Summerfest, promotes itself as ""The World\'s Largest Music Festival.” Operating annually since 1968, the festival attracts between 800,000 and 1,000,000 people each year, and hosts over 800 musical acts. The Woodstock Festival in 1969 drew nearly 500,000 attendees, and the Polish spin-off Przystanek Woodstock in 2014 drew 750,000 thus becoming the largest open air annual festival in Europe and the second largest in the world. In comparison, the Roskilde Festival in Denmark, attracts about 135,000 spectators each year. Glastonbury Festival has a capacity of about 275,000 spectators, but has ""fallow years"" roughly every five years, so it is the biggest non-annual greenfield festival in the world. The oldest annual dedicated pop music festival in the world is Pinkpop Festival in the Netherlands, though in other genres, there are much older ones: the Three Choirs Festival in the UK has run annually since 1719. The Queensland Music Festival, established in 1999 and headquartered in Brisbane Australia, is the largest music festival by land mass, as a state-wide music biennial music festival, over a three-week period during July.\nLists of music festivals\nLists of music festivals in:\n- Central America\n- The Netherlands\n- New Zealand\n- South Korea\n- United Arab Emirates\n- Saudi Arabia\n- United Kingdom\n- United States\nLists of music festivals by genre\n- List of jazz festivals\n- List of metal festivals\n- List of electronic music festivals\n- List of reggae festivals\n- List of punk rock festivals\n- List of gothic festivals\n- List of rock festivals\n- List of music festivals\n- ""Non-Profit Organizations | Gathering of the Vibes Music Festival"". gatheringofthevibes.com.

However, there are security risks since VPNs can have performance and speed issues, and if servers are not properly secured with strong usernames/passwords, they can be compromised. Additionally, ISPs can detect VPN usage even though they cannot decipher the traffic contents.	['When building out network labs, often multiple people will need access to the lab. The main way right now is to use something like EVE-NG or GNS3 to provide access.\nThere are 2 downsides to this method. The first is that your server is exposed to the internet and if your usernames/passwords aren’t strong enough, your server can become compromised. The second is that sometimes you may not want everyone to be able to add or edit to the lab topology.\nThe solution to this is using Containerlab and ZeroTier. This setup is great for things like testing new hires, training classes, or for providing lab access to others on a limited basis.\nWhat is Containerlab?\nContainerlab is a container orchestrating tool for managing container-based networking labs. It doesn’t just support Container based Network Operating Systems though. Through vrnetlab, there is support for a wide variety of commonly used NOSes: Mikrotik RouterOS, Nokia SROS, Juniper vMX and vQFX, and many more.\nConfigs are text based making it easy to add/update links between nodes. The lab does need to be destroyed and redeployed when adding/removing links. With some tools to generate configs, it’s easy to spin up a 500+ node lab in under 30 minutes.\nWhat is ZeroTier?\nZeroTier is a mesh VPN that allows for Layer 2 connectivity. It is typically used in a remote worker scenario to provide access to internal company resources. In our case, we use it to provide remote lab access.\nSetting it up\nThis assumes that Containerlab and ZeroTier are already setup on the lab server. One thing that will be needed on the lab server is to enable ip forwarding. Otherwise, the lab server won’t be able to forward packets.\nSample labs showing the changes needed between labs are available in a repo. The main differences between the labs are the lab names and management networks. In the sample labs, we hardcode the management IP addresses to make access easier. This isn’t necessary but makes it easier when not using DNS.\nOnce the labs are deployed, you should be able to SSH into all of the nodes from the server.\nThen you need to setup a ZeroTier network. The first step is to add a route to the managed route pointing from the lab network to the server IP address (we set the server IP address to 172.22.0.1).\nIf you’re not worried about preventing cross pod access, you are all set. But if you want to secure access to each pod to prevent end users from accessing each others lab pod, some rules need to be added to the ZeroTier network. Those can be found in the GitHub repo file named zerotier.rules.\nThen you can set your server to prevent user to user traffic.\nTo provide user access to their pod, select the correct capabilities for the pod\nUsing the lab\nWith the lab setup with the security features, you should be able to access the nodes via SSH or Winbox.\nWith the ZeroTier rules in place, you are not able to reach the other running pods.\nDo you have a 3 tier, switched, or vendor proprietary data center design?\nDoes it rely on spanning tree or proprietary solutions to eliminate spanning tree?\nNot sure how to migrate to a new architecture without serious downtime?\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions then this post is for you. We’ll be looking at deploying an EVPN/VxLAN Data Center fabric and migrating from a cisco fabricpath environment to the new design.\nAlthough we will be focusing on a fabricpath migration many, if not all, of the principles apply to migrating a 3 tier architecture.\n1. Building the new Data Center Fabric 2. Connecting the current fabricpath and new fabric 3. Migrating switched virtual interfaces 4. Migrating various types of physical devices\nBuilding the new Data Center Fabric\nThe easiest part of designing and building the new fabric is the physical topology. This should be a symmetric topology to easily take advantage of equal cost multipath and add additional switches with ease. This is also known as a spine/leaf or clos topology. The basic idea is leafs connect to spines and spines connect to super spines. A leaf/spine should not connect to another switch of the same type expect for multichassis lag or virtual port-channel at the access layer if you’re utilizing this.\nISIS as an underlay routing protocol\nNext you must decide on routing protocols. We will not examine layer 2 as this will be a completely routed fabric eliminating the need for any STP in your datacenter. Remember if you’re not Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, or Google (FANG) or some other webscaler you probably don’t have FANG problems i.e. there is no need to run a BGP underlay and learn to turn all the associated knobs to make that work; nor to engage in troubleshooting complex problems like path hunting.\nFor this reason we will look at utilizing Intermediate System to Intermediate System (ISIS) as an underlay with Internal Border Gateway Protocol (iBGP) as an overlay.\nWe prefer ISIS as an underlay network for data centers because:\nit is easier to scale than OSPF\nis extensible from the beginning (Type Length Values for additional capabilities)\nbetter stability at scale\nThe secondary loopback is to enable the advertisement of a virtual IP address for traffic destined to the vPC pair. Single attached or routed links will advertise the physical IP address of the leaf so traffic returns the that specific leaf and not the pair.\niBGP as the overlay\nThe overlay is pretty straight forward. We will run iBGP with loopback peerings to exchange EVPN routes. EVPN scales significantly better than other VxLAN control plane protocols so we will not explore flood and learn or static assignment.\nWe will be utilizing vPC on the access layer for the remainder of the post. There are other methods for dual attached devices such as EVPN-multihoming but as this is cisco specific for fabricpath migrations they will not be discussed.\nSee an example configuration below of how the VIP/PIP mentioned earlier operate\nLeaf BGP and NVE\nhost-reachability protocol bgp\nadvertise virtual-rmac ## for advertising the VIP\nrouter bgp 8675309\naddress-family l2vpn evpn\nadvertise-pip ## for advertising PIP if single attached\naddress-family l2vpn evpn\nConnecting the current fabricpath DC and new fabric\nThe first thing to do is decide on the physical point of interconnection. You’ll want to ensure you chose a place you have enough ports to do a dual sided vPC with enough bandwidth to cover lateral traffic between new/old until the migrations are complete.\nNext we have to think about the layer 2 protocols in play. Since spanning tree isn’t in play on either side we need to take special consideration to make sure we do not introduce a layer 2 loop.\nThe EVPN/VxLAN side will not do anything with STP BPDUs but there is a requirement on the fabricpath side that it remains the root bridge. This is due to the entire fabricpath domain looking like one physical bridge. If a port in the fabricpath domain receives a superior BPDU a root-guard of sorts is enacted and the content edge port begins blocking.\nWhy do we care if STP doesn’t pass over the EVPN fabric? If the fabricpath environment is interconnected at two points then there will be a loop back to the fabricpath domain. This is a situation we want to avoid.\nIt can be avoided by:\nonly having one interconnect\nmanually pruning vlans at the two+ points of interconnect to ensure vlans remain on exactly ONE path\nMigrating Switched Virtual Interfaces\nOur preferred method of migrating SVIs from the old fabricpath environment to the new fabric is to:\nbuild all of the new Distributed Anycast Gateways (DAG) on the new fabric\nkeep them shutdown\nestablish a L3 adjacency via BGP for routing traffic back to exit points until the migrations are complete\nadd the VLANs being migrated to the dual side vPC\nshutdown the SVIs on the fabricpath side and no shut the DAGs on the new fabric\nmanually clear ARP on any hosts that did not update with the new DAG MAC\nMigrating physical devices\nMost of the physical devices are “easy” since there is no option but to physically move cables and you know this will result in a slight outage while the new uplinks come online.\nHowever, with HA pairs of devices it is possible to migrate by moving the standby unit, waiting for the HA to reestablish, forcing a failover, move the active unit, and then “fail” back to the primary unit. This will test your HA setup as well as provide a seamless migration.\nIf you have new compute and storage you can migrate your workloads directly to the new environment and age out the legacy compute/storage.\nFinally, ensure there are no more devices in use on your old environment and decommission the devices.\nIf you have questions or need assistance do not hesitate to reach out to us at iparchitechs.', 'What is a VPN? How is it used? Why is it needed now more than ever before? Read on.\nDo you want to protect your online identity, stay safe on public wifi or bypass censorship on the internet? Then this article is for you.\nFirst a little background on how the internet world works: Your public IP address is discoverable by browsers, websites, service providers, and other devices. This opens the door for your privacy to be compromised. It can also mean that sensitive information falls into malicious hands. When using a VPN, instead of your public IP address being displayed, it uses the address of the VPN server that all of your internet activity is routed through. This VPN server could be located anywhere in the world, which makes it impossible for those interested to find out your true location, let alone any personal information.\nMoreover, VPNs have lists of countries, after you select one, you appear to be using the internet not from your actual location, but from the location of the virtual server. VPNs secure and protect your online identity. Most of the trusted VPN service providers use the latest encryption keys to hide your data from anyone trying to spy on your digital lifestyle. If servers are not obfuscated, however, your ISP can see if you are using a VPN, but it cannot decipher the contents of your internet traffic. It means your ISP cannot see anything you do while you are connected.\nThe Virtual Private Network (VPN) Market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.39% to reach US$50.153 billion by 2024, from US$34.591 billion in 2018.\nThe demand for VPNs will grow on account of the increasing cybercrime issues, as VPNs provide a secure and private network for individuals to access. In addition to this, many online services are acquiring VPN service providers to provide their own VPN services to users. However, since VPNs carry data to a different server before taking the user to the desired webpage, they witness some performance and speed issues, which restrains the demand for these services during the forecasted period.\nHere is a look at three VPN use cases you should know about.\n- By Pass Geo Restriction\nGeo-restriction or geo-blocking is a method to restrict or limit access of specified content based on the user’s geographic location. Average internet users usually encounter geo-restrictions on a daily basis while trying to access streaming platforms as they allow different content for different countries. Additionally, governments implement geo-restriction technologies to block sites or specific online services.\nHow does geo-blocking work? All of your devices on the internet have their unique series of numbers called an Internet Protocol address (known as ‘IP address’). Your laptop, phone, and each device connected to the internet have IPs, which are provided by your internet service provider (ISP). Therefore, your ISP knows your IP address. When you visit a website, the IP address of your network is sent to the server so it knows where it has to send the content.\nAlthough your IP address is not significant on its own, using specialized software, it is possible to track your online behavior effortlessly, monitor which websites you visit and when. Also, to some extent, it is possible to know the geographical location of your device. This is how a site ‘knows’ from which country you are accessing. Then, website administrators apply geo-blocking based on this information. Moreover, geo-blocking applies when traveling. Meaning, if you are an American visiting France, you will only access the content available in France.\nIs bypassing geo-blocking legal? The legality of getting around geo-restrictions is unclear and varies by country. In the European Union, some forms of geo-blocking are illegal. Companies are not allowed to discriminate against consumers based on their location for online sales of specific services.\nHowever, streaming platforms, such as Netflix, claim that bypassing geo-blocking can be considered as a violation of copyright and licensing regulations, they also justify the use of methods to detected and block various anonymizer services, like VPNs.\nThere are tools to get around geo-restrictions, VPNs are the most common and, usually, easy to use for a less tech-savvy audience. While using a VPN service, you can quickly change your location and have unrestricted and fast access to any website. You can choose your desired location, or let us offer an optimal choice for you.\nLocal VPN servers represent a private, controlled network. It creates a virtual tunnel, where your data is encrypted so that no one can track or monitor your online activities.\nVPN masks your actual IP address and allocates you with one from your chosen country. For instance, if you are in the USA, you can quickly select a remote VPN server in Japan, the website will think you are accessing it from Japan.\nVPNs also help to bypass government-induced censorship. In this case, VPNs not only help to achieve internet freedom but also – to fully secure your data from the prying eyes of snoopers.\n2. Avoid Government Censorship\nInternet censorship is a process of blocking, limiting, filtering or manipulating internet content in any way. It is a method of suppression used by the governments which control what can be accessed, published or viewed online. Although censorship might seem like something done by oppressive governments, the scope of it has been increasing alarmingly in many democratic countries. More than 60 countries engage in some form of state-sponsored censorship.\nRestrictions and manipulations vary from limiting access to digital content (such as movies, series or music), blocking certain websites or services (Skype, Telegram, WhatsApp, Youtube, Netflix, etc.) or filtering information perceived as unwanted (for instance, opposing the government in any way)\nWho is usually affected by internet censorship? Various attempts to tighten internet control and crack down online freedom have a harmful impact on journalists, human rights activists, marginalized communities, as well as ordinary internet users, who want to access information or services online. Why do governments engage in various forms of internet censorship? The intents vary. In can be done to spread the government’s views, particular agendas, and to stop government critics and various opposing views. There are a few methods to surf the internet without borders. A VPN (a virtual private network) is a robust tool to access free information online. Also, it is safe, because it hides your online activities from the censors.\n3. Stay Safe on Public Wi-fi\nPublic WiFi can be a goldmine for dangerous lurkers posing security threats. It’s convenient, yet, dangerous to use while traveling or dining out in the city.\nAll the traffic within a public WiFi network is usually unsecured, meaning it does not use proper encryption to protect your internet data. Your sensitive information sent via an unsecured WiFi network (such as credit card numbers, passwords, chat messages) becomes an easy target for hackers.\nWhen it comes to stealing your data, hackers get quite creative. One of the ways they attack is called man-in-the-middle (MITM). Cybercriminals will create their fake public network. In most cases, the name will be similar to the name of the place with access to a public network (like a restaurant or hotel) nearby. Then, hackers will snoop on your private information and target data on your devices.\nOn top of that, hackers can install packet sniffing software. It is particularly dangerous because it records massive amounts of data which later can be processed on their demand.\nBe aware that there are many other ways to undermine your privacy while you’re connected to a public WiFi. The internet is full of video tutorials and step-by-step guides on how to hack someone’s computer over a WiFi network.\nAll of the WiFi networks are vulnerable to hacking. If you are not alone using the network, chances are someone is spying on your online activities. At best it is your ISP, at worst – scammers lurking for your passwords, bank account details or other sensitive information.\nIn 2017 Belgian researchers discovered that WPA2 protocol used by the vast majority of WiFi networks is unsafe.\nAccording to the report, the WPA2 protocol can be broken using novel attacks potentially exposing personal data.\nThe vulnerability can affect a broad range of operating systems and devices – including Android, Apple, Windows, Linux, OpenBSD, MediaTek, etc. Basically, if you have a device that connects to WiFi, it can be affected. The situation is a little different in the European Union since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect. ISPs processing Europeans’ data must be compliant to the GDPR. They have to make sure they store personal data only with the consent and when it’s not linkable to an individual.\nWhat can you do to protect your online identity? It is the best option to shield your private information from cybercriminals. If you are connected to a VPN, your connection is secure even if you’re on a public WiFi hotspot.']	['<urn:uuid:4a7e8797-372f-460d-b98e-66646d2fce79>', '<urn:uuid:12c8ab66-0868-4caa-a24a-6f28dd74cf97>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	6	64	2989
46	traditional vs blockchain accounting advantages disadvantages	Traditional accounting involves standard bookkeeping with financial statements but has limitations like slow processes and high error potential. In contrast, blockchain accounting offers enhanced security and transparency, with studies showing it can reduce transaction costs by 35% and reporting errors by 67%, while also enabling faster processing and automated smart contracts.	"['What is Financial Accounting?\nFinancial Accounting refers to the Bookkeeping of the Financial transactions by classifying, analyzing, summarizing, and recording financial transactions like Purchase, Sales, Receivables and Payables and finally preparing the Financial Statements which includes Income Statement, Balance Sheet & Cash Flows.\nThe main objective of financial accounting is to showcase an accurate and fair picture of financial affairs of the company. To understand the fundamentals of financial accounting well, first, we should start with double entry system and debit & credit, and then gradually should understand journal and ledger, trial balance, and four financial statements.\n- Double Entry System\n- Trial Balance\n- Financial Statements\nLet’s start with the double-entry system.\nThis is the essence of financial accounting.\nIn financial accounting, every financial transaction has two equal aspects. That means if cash is withdrawn from the bank, in the company’s book under the double entry system, both cash and bank would be affected.\nUnder the double entry system, we call these two aspects debit and credit.\nDebit and credit\nUnderstanding debit and credit is easy. You need to remember two rules –\n- Debit the increase of assets and expenses and the decrease of liabilities and incomes.\n- Credit the increase of liabilities and incomes and the decrease of assets and expenses.\nHere’s an example to illustrate debit and credit –\nLet’s say that around $20,000 worth of capital is being invested into the company in the form of cash.\nUnder double entry system, there are two accounts here – cash and capital.\nHere cash is an asset and capital is a liability.\nAccording to the rule of debit and credit, when an asset increases, we will debit the account and when a liability will increase, we will credit the account.\nIn this example, both the asset and the liability are increasing.\nSo, we will debit the cash since it is an asset and we will credit the capital since it is a liability.\nJournal entry is based on the debit and the credit of the accounts. Taking the previous example into account, here’s how a journal entry will look like –\n|Cash A/c ………………….Debit||$20,000||–|\n|To Capital A/c…………………………….Credit||–||$20,000|\nOnce you know the essence of double entry system, journal, and ledger, we need to look at ledger entry.\nA ledger entry is an extension of the journal entry. Taking the journal entry from above, we can create a T-format for ledger entry.\nDebit Cash Account Credit\n|To Capital Account||$20,000|\n|By balance c/f||$20,000|\nDebit Capital Account Credit\n|By Cash Account||$20,000|\n|To balance c/f||$20,000|\nFrom ledger, we can create a trial balance. Here’s a snapshot and the format of a trial balance of the example we took above.\nTrial Balance of MNC Co. for the year-end\n|Particulars||Debit (Amount in $)||Credit (Amount in $)|\nThere are four financial statements that every company prepares and every investor should look at –\n- Income Statement\n- Balance Sheet\n- Shareholders’ Equity Statement\n- Cash Flow Statement\nLet’s understand each of them briefly.\nThe purpose of the income statement is to find out the net income of the company for the year. We take into account all the financial transactions (including non-cash ones) and do a “revenue – expense” analysis to find out the profit for the year. Here’s the format of income statement –\n|Cost of Goods Sold||(*****)|\n|General & Administrative Expenses||(**)|\n|Operating Income (EBIT)||***|\n|Profit Before Tax||***|\n|Tax Rate (% of Profit before tax)||(**)|\nBalance Sheet is based on the equation – “Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders’ Equity”. Here’s a simple snapshot of balance sheet so that you can understand how it is formatted.\nBalance Sheet of ABC Company\n|2016 (In US $)|\n|Plant & Machinery||45,000|\n|Total Stockholders’ Equity||230,000|\n|Total liabilities & Stockholders’ Equity||320,000|\nShareholders’ equity statement:\nShareholders’ equity statement is a statement which includes shareholders’ equity, retained earnings, reserves, and many such items. Here’s a format of shareholders’ equity statement –\n|Additional Paid-up Capital:|\n|(-) Treasury Shares||(**)|\n|(-) Translation Reserve||(**)|\nCash flow statement:\nThe objective of cash flow statement is to find out the net cash inflow/outflow of the company. The cash flow statement is a combination of three statements – cash flow from operating activities (which can be computed using a direct and indirect method of cash flow), cash flow from financing activities, and cash flow from investing activities. All non-cash expenses (or losses) are added back and all non-cash incomes (or profits) are deducted to get exactly the net cash inflow (total cash inflow – total cash outflow) for the year.\nAs financial accounting is solely prepared for the right disclosure of financial information of a company, the statements, and reports a company produce should be valid and credible. That’s why companies need to follow certain rules as per the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or accounting standards.\nGAAP covers basic principles of accounting that must be followed by companies. These principles include going concern concept, full disclosure concept, matching principle, cost principle and many others to produce the most accurate and reliable reports for the audience of the company.\nHowever, GAAP doesn’t remain same always. GAAP is updated based on the complexities that arise in the world of accounting.\nFinancial Accounting Video\nThis is a guide to what is Financial Accounting, definition and fundamentals of financial accounting.

That would be quite the challenge! Blockchain technology in finance is just like this.\nBlockchain technology has been making waves in the accounting world, with enhanced security, transparency, and clarity of financial transactions. In this article, we\'ll discuss the role of blockchain in accounting, its benefits, how it works, its impact on the accounting industry, and real-world use cases.\nWhat is blockchain accounting?\nTraditional accounting practices exist for regular banking and hard cash systems, but there are also accounting practices for blockchain, which deals in cryptocurrencies. Pursuing ACCA courses or an industry-oriented accounting and financial management degree with roots in FinTech can help you learn more about this subject.\nWhat is blockchain technology?\nBlockchain is a revolutionary decentralised and distributed ledger technology (DLT) that records data in chronological order. In simple terms, a blockchain requires authentication and keys to open cash flow every step of the way in the financial pathway, thus making the system decentralised.\nTo understand its application in accounting, let\'s start with the basics of blockchain technology.\nAbout traditional accounting systems\nTraditional accounting systems have served us well for years, but they have limitations. They often involve intermediaries, slow processes, and a high potential for errors. Blockchain aims to mitigate these issues, altering the way financial transactions are recorded and managed for good.\nBenefits of blockchain in accounting:\nEnhanced transparency: Blockchain ensures all parties have access to the same ledger (accounting records/data), reducing fraud risks. According to a report by Deloitte, 53% of surveyed professionals believe that increased transparency is the primary benefit of blockchain in accounting.\nIncreased security: Blockchain is impossible to alter, duplicate, or forge making it extremely difficult for unauthorised alterations. A study by IBM found that blockchain can reduce data breaches by up to 80%.\nEfficiency gains: Transactions are processed faster and with fewer errors, saving time and resources. The World Economic Forum estimates that blockchain could save businesses USD 365 billion annually by 2030.\nReduced costs: Eliminating intermediaries helps companies cut down their fees and expenses. A PwC report suggests that blockchain technology can reduce transaction costs by 35% in financial services.\nAccurate auditing: Auditors can easily trace transactions using blockchain technology, leading to more accurate audits. According to a survey by EY, 95% of respondents believe that blockchain will simplify the auditing process.\nHow does blockchain in accounting work?\nBlockchain in accounting relies on a network of computers (nodes) that validate and record transactions. These transactions are grouped into blocks and linked together in a chain. Different types of blockchain can be used for various accounting purposes.\nTypes of blockchain in accounting:\n- Public blockchain: Open to anyone and highly transparent.\n- Private blockchain: Restricted access, often used within organisations.\n- Consortium blockchain: Shared among a group of trusted organisations.\nBenefits of blockchain in accounting:\n- Improved financial reporting: Real-time data access enhances reporting accuracy. A study by Accenture found that blockchain can reduce reporting errors by 67%.\n- Fraud prevention: Blockchain\'s security features deter fraudulent activities. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, organisations lose 5% of their annual revenues to fraud.\n- Smart contracts: Self-executing contracts automate processes, reducing the need for intermediaries (middle management). Research by MarketsandMarkets predicts that the smart contract market will reach USD 300 million by 2023.\n- Simplified reconciliation: Reduced discrepancies in financial records lead to smoother reconciliation processes. A report by McKinsey & Company suggests that blockchain can reduce reconciliation time by 80%.\nReal-world use cases of blockchain technology\nBlockchain technology is already making strides in accounting. It\'s being used for supply chain management, digital identity verification, and more.\n- Supply chain management: IBM\'s Food Trust platform uses blockchain to trace the origin of food products, reducing foodborne illnesses by 60%.\n- Digital identity verification: Estonia\'s e-Residency programme employs blockchain for secure digital identity verification, serving over 80,000 people globally.\n- Cross-border payments: Ripple, a blockchain-based payment platform, has partnered with over 300 financial institutions to enable faster and cheaper cross-border transactions. This technology can reduce cross-border payment costs by up to 60%, according to a report by McKinsey & Company.\n- Intellectual property protection: The WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization) uses blockchain to record intellectual property rights, providing creators with immutable proof of ownership.\n- Healthcare data security: MedicalChain utilises blockchain to secure and streamline medical records, ensuring patient data remains confidential and accessible to authorised personnel.\nHow will blockchain technology affect the accounting industry?\nBlockchain is set to transform the accounting industry in several ways as mentioned below:\n- Streamlined processes: Blockchain enables faster and more accurate transactions. A study by Juniper Research predicts that blockchain could save financial institutions up to USD 27 billion annually by 2030.\n- Career opportunities: Demand for blockchain-savvy accountants is on the rise. A report by LinkedIn shows that blockchain-related job postings have increased by 550% in recent years.\n- Regulatory changes: Regulations will evolve to accommodate blockchain technology. Governments worldwide are exploring how to regulate blockchain to ensure its safe and responsible use.\nFuture of accounting with blockchain\nThe future of accounting is undeniably intertwined with blockchain. Embracing this technology will be crucial for staying competitive and relevant in the accounting field. Deloitte predicts that blockchain will become a ""critical asset"" for financial institutions.\nAs finance professionals, it\'s essential to stay ahead in the ever-evolving world of accounting and financial management. In this comprehensive guide, we\'ve explored the fascinating world of blockchain in accounting. We\'ve uncovered how blockchain technology enhances transparency, security, and efficiency in financial transactions.\nBlockchain offers exciting opportunities to enhance transparency, security, and efficiency in accounting practices. Given all the advantages and merits of blockchain technology, the finance sector is rapidly evolving to be able to implement this on a global scale. It is safe to say that blockchain is the future of financial transactions.\nAs the accounting industry continues to evolve, consider embracing blockchain technology as a valuable skill set. By understanding its basics and potential, you\'ll be well-prepared for the future of accounting and financial management.\nOther news from Online Learning\nExplore ACCA applied skills exams: subjects, expert tips, and the importance of this module.

47	When does horseweed grow tallest during its lifecycle?	Marestail (horseweed) undergoes stem elongation (bolting) after late April and grows to an eventual height of 3 to 6 feet. Plants that emerged in the previous fall will begin stem elongation earlier than those that emerge in spring.	['Marestail (aka horseweed) has two primary periods of emergence - from late summer into fall, and from late March through June. Spring-emerging marestail has been the most problematic to manage in the southern half of Ohio and Indiana, especially the plants that emerge in May and June.\nMarestail plants remain in the low-growing rosette stage through late April, followed by stem elongation (bolting) and growth to an eventual height of 3 to 6 feet. Plants that emerge the previous fall will start stem elongation earlier than spring-emerging plants.\nMarestail competes with the soybeans throughout the growing season, and reduces crop yield. Marestail matures in late summer or early fall, late enough to interfere with soybean harvest.\nHerbicide activity and resistance in marestail\nHerbicide programs must consist of a spring burndown to ensure that the field is free of marestail at the time of soybean planting, and residual (PRE) herbicides to control marestail for another 6 to 8 weeks. Failure to follow these guidelines can result in poor control and reduced soybean yield. We observed the following soybean yields in a 2010 OSU marestail study:\n51 bu/A average where the burndown treatment failed to control emerged plants\n57 bu/A average where the burndown treatment was effective, but there was no residual herbicide\n65 bu/A average where the burndown was effective and residual herbicides were used\nMarestail is most easily controlled when in the seedling or rosette stage, and spring burndown herbicides should be applied when plants are less than 4 inches tall if possible.\nMarestail populations with resistance to glyphosate or ALS inhibitors (e.g. Classic, FirstRate) are widespread throughout Ohio and Indiana, and many populations have multiple resistance to both of these sites of action. Growers should therefore not expect to obtain effective POST control with combinations of glyphosate plus Classic, Synchrony, or FirstRate, except in fields with no history of herbicide resistance or POST control problems.\nLibertyLink soybeans are the most effective control strategy\nLibertyLink soybeans are the most effective tool for management of herbicide-resistant marestail, especially in fields with high marestail populations.\nUse burndown and residual herbicides as outlined on the next page. Apply Liberty POST (29 oz/A) before marestail plants exceed 6 inches in height. Liberty can be applied POST at rates up to 36 oz/A for taller plants or plants that have survived previous herbicide treatments.\nSteps for effective management of marestail\n1. Use fall herbicide treatments in fields with a history of problems or where marestail seedlings are observed in the fall. The primary goal of a fall treatment is control of emerged plants, and it is not a substitute for a spring preplant herbicide treatment. An application of burndown and residual herbicides is still required in the spring in fields that were treated in the fall. Products containing chlorimuron can provide residual control into the spring if the marestail population is not ALS-resistant, but do not expect a fall herbicide treatment to adequately control marestail that emerges in May or June. Authority, Valor, and metribuzin products and mixtures should be applied in the spring, not in the fall. Where a fall application is necessary, we suggest minimizing costs by applying one of the following:\nglyphosate + 2,4-D; or dicamba + 2,4-D; or 2,4-D + a low rate of Canopy/Cloak EX or DF\n2. Apply effective burndown herbicides in spring. Do not plant into existing stands of marestail. Start weedfree at the time of planting by using one of the following preplant herbicide treatments, applied when marestail plants are less than 4 inches tall. Note - tillage also effectively removes marestail.\n- 2,4-D ester plus glyphosate (1.5 lb ae/A)\n- 2,4-D ester plus Gramoxone (3 to 4 pts/A) plus a metribuzin-containing herbicide\n- Liberty (29 to 36 oz/A) or Liberty plus a metribuzin-containing herbicide\n- Saflufenacil product (Sharpen, Optill, or Verdict) plus MSO (1% v/v) plus either glyphosate or Ignite\nThe mixture of glyphosate and 2,4-D ester has become more variable for control of marestail over time in some fields. Plants should be in the rosette stage at the time of application for best results. In fields where this mixture has previously failed to provide effective control, use one of the other burndown treatments listed above (2,4-D ester can be added to any of these).\nUse the highest rate of a 2,4-D ester product that is allowed, based on the interval between application and soybean planting. For all 2,4-D ester products, rates up to 0.5 lb active ingredient/A must be applied at least 7 days before planting. Rates between 0.5 and 1.0 lb/A should be applied at least 30 days before planting, with the the exception of several products (E-99, Salvo, and Weedone 650) that allow 1 lb/A to be applied 15 days before planting.\nIn ALS-sensitive populations, the activity of any of the above can be improved with the addition of a herbicide that contains chlorimuron (Canopy/Cloak/Fallout, Valor XLT, Envive, Authority XL) or cloransulam (Gangster, Sonic, Authority First).\n3. Include residual herbicides with the burndown treatment. Add one of the following herbicides or herbicide combinations to the burndown herbicides, for residual control of marestail until the soybean leaf canopy develops. Where a saflufenacil product is used for burndown, do not use a residual herbicide containing flumioxazin (Valor, Valor XLT, Envive, Enlite, Gangster) or sulfentrazone (Authority products).\n- Valor, Valor XLT, Envive, Enlite, or Gangster\n- Authority First, Sonic, Authority XL, Authority Broadleaf, or Spartan\n- Canopy/Cloak DF + metribuzin (total metribuzin rate must be at least 0.38 lb ai/A)\n- metribuzin (Metri DF, Tricor, etc) or Boundary (metribuzin rate must be at least 0.38 lb ai/A)\n4. Herbicides for POST control. Liberty is the only consistently effective herbicide for POST control (for use only in LibertyLink soybeans). If marestail plants escape the measures outlined above and require POST control in Roundup Ready soybeans, try a combination of glyphosate plus Classic or FirstRate at the highest allowable rates. These combinations are likely to be variable in their effectiveness but may work in some fields.']	['<urn:uuid:44e801d6-5f02-4e47-bc8c-3a44f306e38a>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	8	38	998
48	carbon footprint measurement methods individual level and large scale carbon removal cost per tonne	At the individual level, carbon footprint is measured through parameters like water usage, energy consumption, waste generation, and transport, as implemented in apps like Carbon Watch. For large-scale carbon removal, direct air capture technology can remove CO2 at costs ranging from $94 to $232 per tonne using current technologies, with companies like Climeworks aiming to reduce costs to $100 per tonne by 2030.	['- GS-3: Environmental Conservation\n- GS-2: Government policies and interventions for development in various sectors and issues arising out of their design and implementation\nCarbon Watch App: To assess Carbon Footprint\nContext: Chandigarh became the first state or Union Territory in India to launch Carbon Watch, a mobile application to assess the carbon footprint of an individual.\nWhat is Carbon Footprint?\n- Carbon footprint is the amount of greenhouse gases-especially carbon dioxide-released into the atmosphere by a particular human activity.\n- It is expressed as a weight of CO2 emissions produced in tonnes.\n- It can be a broad measure or be applied to the actions of an individual, a family, an event, an organization, or even an entire nation.\n- Carbon footprint includes direct emissions, such as from driving a car, as well as whatever emissions are required to consume any goods and services (indirect)\n- Carbon footprint is different from ecological footprint. While the carbon footprint measures the emission of gases that contribute to global warming, the ecological footprint focuses on measuring the use of bio-productive space.\nAbout the app\n- The application that can be downloaded on mobile focuses on individual’s actions and calculates the carbon footprint based on four parameters: Water, Energy, Waste Generation and Transport (Vehicular movement)\n- The application will also provide information such as the national and world average of the emission, and the individual’s level of emission generation.\n- The motive behind this application is making people Climate-Smart Citizens while enabling them capable of accessing their carbon footprint, along with providing them with steps to reduce it\n- The mobile application will suggest methods to reduce the carbon footprints as per the information furnished by the individuals.\n- It also sensitizes people about their lifestyle emissions, their impact and possible countermeasures to mitigate the same.\nEffects of Higher Carbon Footprint\n- Increase in Carbon dioxide concentration in atmosphere causes Global Warming i.e Greenhouse gas effect\n- Climate Change\n- Melting of Polar Caps\n- Depletion of resources: Due to changed Carbon concentration in biosphere\n- Increasing Incidents of Severe Weather\n- Changes in food supply\nMethods of Reducing Carbon Footprint\n- Water: Adopting better agronomic practices (like drip irrigation), shifting dietary basket from water guzzling cereal crops to water conserving millets (also Health benefits), recycling of water in industries, smart water metering at households\n- Energy: Using renewable energy (shift from carbon intensive coal), smart metering, Energy sector Reforms particularly in DISCOMs, Using energy efficient appliances\n- Waste: Adopting the 4 R’s- Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.\n- Transportation: Using Public Transport, bicycles, car pooling\n- Market mechanism like Carbon Trading: Individuals and companies can also offset some of their carbon dioxide emissions by purchasing carbon credits, the money from which can go into projects such as planting trees or investing in renewable energy.\n- International Collaboration: Implementation of the Climate change conventions like the Paris Agreement and Indian initiatives for the same must be fast forwarded.\nConnecting the dots:\n- The benefits of Carbon Tax', 'Germany aims to cut its greenhouse gas emissions some 40 percent by 2020. This target rises to 55 percent by 2030 and 95 percent by 2050 when compared with 1990 levels. Many other countries across the world have issued similar pledges.\nThe bad news, though, is this won’t be good enough: efforts to decarbonise the global economy have been delayed to such an extent that reducing emissions now comes too little, too late.\nClimate prediction models indicate that, in order to meet the targets established by the Paris Agreement, carbon dioxide (CO2) will have to be removed from the atmosphere on a substantial scale.\nIn fact, scientists now estimate limiting the global temperature rise to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels will require 10 billion tonnes of CO2 to be removed from the atmosphere every year from 2050 onwards.\nReforestation is the most natural way of sucking carbon out of the air, but this is time consuming and would need to take place on a gigantic scale. As global populations increase, convincing governments to plant trees on spare land, rather than build homes, is a difficult sell.\nA combination of renewable energy investment and carbon-removal solutions may be the only way to avoid an environmental disaster in the coming years\nOther businesses are looking at carbon capture and sequestration techniques that trap CO2 before it reaches the atmosphere, but this approach is often only carbon-neutral at best.\nIn order to solve the planet’s carbon conundrum, a number of businesses have started thinking outside the box, employing cutting-edge technology to remove existing CO2 from the planet’s atmosphere. In many cases, their ideas have proved to be effective; whether they are financially feasible is another matter entirely.\nWith the likelihood that humanity will be able to curb its CO2 emissions in time to avert catastrophe looking increasingly slim, a number of businesses have begun to search for alternative options. Their approaches to CO2 removal vary widely, with each methodology bringing its own advantages and disadvantages.\nOne of the more unusual ideas involves supplying natural gas to a high-temperature fuel cell. Half of the energy created is converted into electricity, and the other half is used to decompose limestone into lime and CO2.\nAs this activity produces CO2, it may not initially be clear how it helps with the planet’s greenhouse gas problem. However, the entire process is actually carbon-negative. As all of the CO2 being produced – both from the fuel cell and the lime kiln – is pure, it can be used or stored underground at a low cost. The lime can also be used to trap CO2.\nThe company pioneering this method of carbon air capture, Origen Power, estimates it can remove 600g of CO2 from the air for every kWh of electricity generated. In contrast, electricity produced by burning natural gas typically emits around 400g of CO2 for the same energy output.\nOrganisations like Canada’s Carbon Engineering and the Zurich-based Climeworks have opted for a different approach, utilising direct air capture technology. The latter develops, builds and operates plants that capture CO2 from ambient air through a cyclic adsorption-desorption process.\n“At the heart of the process is a filter material, which selectively captures CO2,” Louise Charles, Communications Manager at Climeworks, told The New Economy. “The first step involves air being drawn into a collector using a fan.\n“CO2 is then captured on the surface of a filter material – also known as the adsorption stage. The second step begins when saturation has occurred. Then, the collector is closed and the temperature increased to 100 degrees Celsius, releasing the CO2 (desorption) at a purity of over 99 percent. The CO2 is then cooled to 45 degrees Celsius, collected and delivered where necessary.”\nCost of carbon removal (per tonne)\nIt should be remembered there is no silver bullet to the problem of climate change. The disparate ideas that businesses like Origen Power and Climeworks are exploring may all need to be deployed together if a decarbonised future is to be achieved.\nUltimately, a combination of renewable energy investment and carbon removal solutions may be the only way to avoid an environmental disaster in the coming years.\nCosting the Earth\nThe suitability of carbon-removal projects is not in doubt – their affordability is. In 2011, a study led by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that, when focusing on ambient air, the cost of carbon removal was likely to be more than $907 per tonne of CO2 removed.\nAlthough they are not truly carbon-negative, powerplant scrubbers can boast a figure of between $50 and $100 for every tonne of CO2 prevented from reaching the atmosphere.\nRecently, however, scientists have become increasingly optimistic that carbon removal is not as expensive as first feared. An updated analysis, published in June, suggested carbon capture could be achieved at a price between $94 and $232 per tonne if existing technologies were scaled up. Many of the businesses working in this field are working on the assumption that their current costs can be significantly reduced.\n“We are already commercially viable and, as we continue to develop our technology, we will become increasingly cost competitive across the world,” Charles explained. “We have a detailed cost-reduction roadmap in place and are confident we’ll reach a price level of $200 per tonne of CO2 in three to four years’ time. Our long-term goal of $100 per tonne of CO2 is achievable within the next five to 10 years – or by 2030 at the very latest.”\nScaling up will be key to optimising outgoings, and progress on this front has been steady, if not spectacular. When Climeworks was founded in 2009, it was only capable of removing a few milligrams of CO2 in a 24-hour period; now, several tonnes are being captured every day.\nThe company is aiming to scale up by a factor of one million in the next five to 10 years in order to make a broader impact. To achieve this, more customers and additional funding will be required.\nThe next step\nCarbon capture, in one form or another, has been implemented since the 1970s, but the technology’s progress has been slow. Globally, there are 17 large-scale plants dedicated to carbon capture, most of which are in the US. Altogether, they remove around 40 million tonnes of CO2 per annum – equivalent to just one percent of yearly global emissions.\nGuaranteeing these facilities receive the right government support will be vital to their development. Subsidies for carbon removal need to be implemented to ensure the right economic incentives are in place for firms. Renewable energies have benefitted hugely from this approach and there is no reason why CO2 removal wouldn’t similarly profit.\nBusinesses also need to think carefully about what they do with the CO2 once they remove it from the air. Making it into synthetic fuels is one option; burying it underground is another.\nCharles said her company “sells high-purity, high-concentration, air-captured CO2 to the food, beverage and agriculture market, [as well as] for the synthesis of renewable fuels and materials”. By forging external partnerships, carbon-removal firms gain access to additional revenue streams and ensure companies can purchase sustainable supplies of CO2.\nIt is regrettable that mankind has reached a stage where reducing carbon emissions will not be sufficient to stop temperatures exceeding globally agreed targets. But all hope is not lost: while CO2 removal can’t turn back the clock on decades of polluting human activity, it could provide a way to avoid the potentially devastating consequences of climate change.']	['<urn:uuid:cf875daf-1b1e-4a38-b3f9-1908c3ad19bd>', '<urn:uuid:aa0edff0-4d25-4ea5-9b0d-02b5098abec5>']	factoid	with-premise	long-search-query	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	14	63	1759
49	what type of equalizer curve switches available for playback stereo and mono records	There are three types of equalizer curve switches available: RIAA for stereo playback, Mono 1 (specifically for use with DECCA label recordings), and Mono 2 (specifically for use with Columbia label recordings). The Mono1 and Mono2 settings are designed for monaural use only, enabling higher fidelity playback for both DECCA and Columbia labels.	['A tube type LCR non-feedback phono amplifier of independent Lch & Rch and completely monaural composed of 6 units\nDivided into six units on the left and right and supported by a powerful power supply, the played sound with its high S/N ratio and high resolution delivers the highest degree of realism of the performer with an overwhelming sense of liveliness and good visibility of the performer on stage.\nAn MC step-up transformer composed of 2 monaural blocks\nTransformers are made pursuing high sound quality by reviewing the wire/core material and the winding structure. The monaural unit is composed of a chassis base made of solid steel plates with copper plating and a case cover with an induction ham shield. In addition, magnetic shields were added making a double-layered structure which made the T-2000 successful to completely eliminate sound quality interference between the left and right. Setting this as the base, we have tuned it specifically for the EA-2000.\nNon-feedback LCR equalizer due to tube type unit amplifiers composed with two monaural blocks\n1) The non-feedback SRPP-type amplifying circuit of ECC-803S which has an excellent transient response and an outstanding reputation for sound quality plus the ultra-low impedance output cathode follower due to 6922 (6DJ8 high reliability tube) are together adopted as a unit amplifier. You can enjoy the large dynamic range and its glossy and lively sound quality that is possible only in vacuum tubes.\n2) The LCR type is adopted for the equalizing circuit. Power loss and inductive noise in the signal line can be minimized and sound quality deterioration can be suppressed by adopting the LCR type which can reduce the impedance of the signal system. The information obtained from the step-up transformer is outputted from the output transformer of the last stage without any losses by adopting our own winding coil and high quality film capacitors and so forth.\n3) Three types of equalizer curve switches are installed. The RIAA for stereo, Mono 1 (for use with DECCA label and so forth) and Mono 2 (for use with Columbia label and so forth) can be selected. Mono1 and Mono2 are for monaural use only. This enables a higher fidelity playback for both the DECCA and Columbia labels.\nPower supply with direct heat rectifier tubes 5U4G composed of 2 monaural blocks using a high-capacity R-core transformer.\nFor the rectification circuit, an R-core power transformer with excessive capacity is used and a rich rectification circuit is used for each independent left and right power supplies by using two choke coils in parallel and rectifier tubes (5U4G) which in principle do not generate switching noise. Furthermore, the power supply transformer and choke coils are magnetically shielded to provide a cleaner and stronger power to the amplifier. In addition, a 3-terminal regulator DC ignition system is used for the heater power supply of the amplifier achieving a high S/N ratio.\nA tough chassis structure consisting of machined aluminum control knobs, a 20mm-thick aluminum slant front panel, a 2mm-thick copper-plated steel plate chassis base, and a 2mm-thick aluminum cover with a magnetic shield are used to ensure rigidity and reduce magnetic distortion.\nThe bottom of the chassis is made of walnut board, which effectively suppresses unwanted resonance in the metal chassis. The foot is equipped with a TAOC high carbon insulator to isolate external vibrations. The RCA terminals are made by WBT, renowned for their high quality and high sound quality, and the XLR terminals are rhodium-plated by Furutech to aim for total balance in the sound quality.

50	Im a mountaineer. What ruins raincoat performance over time?	Dirt and oil work against the DWR (Durable Water Repellent) finish, allowing water to soak into the outer shell and blocking the tiny holes that allow evaporated sweat out, causing the garment to lose both its wicking and water repellent properties.	['HOW TO REPROOF A WATERPROOF JACKET\nThere’s nothing quite like a modern waterproof jacket. Today’s shells and insulated waterproof jackets are built to withstand heavy downpours, while allowing sweat and moisture from your skin to evaporate, keeping you dry in the wettest of weather – unlike the old rubber rain slickers, which created an internal sauna. Also unlike rubber, modern waterproof jackets can lose their waterproof properties over time (as well as their wicking properties), so it’s important to properly maintain a waterproof jacket to get the maximum benefit and life out of it. Here’s how.\nHOW TO WASH A WATERPROOF JACKET\nWashing your waterproof jacket and maintaining its repellent are key to its performance. Most modern waterproof jackets are treated with a Durable Water Repellent (DWR) coating, which covers the threads of the shell with a membrane that repels water droplets, while leaving holes small enough that only evaporated sweat can escape. Problems with this membrane (and the jacket’s overall water repellency and wicking ability) start when a jacket becomes dirty. Dirt and oil work against the DWR finish and allow water droplets to soak into the outer shell, while blocking the tiny holes that allow evaporated sweat out, causing the garment to lose both its wicking and water repellent properties.\nSo how do you prevent your waterproof jacket from losing its water repellency? The answer is simple, but may seem counterintuitive for a garment treated with a DWR coating – wash it. Washing DWR treated jackets removes the oil and dirt that can cause your jacket to lose its functional properties. Simply follow the directions on your waterproof jacket’s label and allow the garment to dry properly. Most DWR garments suggest washing in cold water with a gentle detergent and then drying on medium heat, but this can vary so make sure to check the directions.\nOnce your waterproof jacket has been washed and dried, you should see a renewed water repellency close, if not equal to brand new. Maintaining a waterproof jacket will help give it a long life, but eventually the DWR finish will wear away and you’ll need to reapply a similar finish.\nREPROOFING A WATERPROOF JACKET\nThe first step in reproofing a waterproof jacket is washing it as described above. This will remove any dirt and oil, allowing for the new DWR finish to bond directly to the jacket fibers.\nNext, choose the proofing agent that is best for your garment. Some are built for hard shells, others for soft shells, and still others are specifically for insulated garments; for each of those you may have the choice between a spray-on or wash-on agent. A spray-on treatment tends to work best for insulated waterproof jackets, as it does not coat the jacket liner with waterproofing. For hard shell jackets, wash-on waterproofing will generally provide the best application of waterproofing to the fabric inside and out.\nOnce you’ve decided on a waterproofing agent, simply follow the directions and allow your jacket to dry; you’ll find its water repellency to be like new again and you can continue to maintain it through multiple wash cycles as described above in “How to Wash a Waterproof Jacket.”\nA waterproof jacket is a necessary tool in everyone’s closet, whether you’re fishing in the wet weather of coastal Washington, or hailing a taxi in New York City. Properly maintaining a waterproof jacket and reapplying waterproofing when necessary can maximize the life of your garment with very little effort. Follow these simple steps and your favorite waterproof jacket will be with you for the long haul.']	['<urn:uuid:47281a3e-da32-4127-a497-445d7be1afa2>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	9	41	595
51	what is ecu reflash advantages disadvantages	A reflashed ECU provides modified fuel, ignition, and boost maps by overwriting the stock ECU parameters. The advantages are: it offers noticeable performance increase, requires minimal technical knowledge, appears stock, and is the safest form of engine management. The main disadvantages are: you must use a base map from the company doing the reflash with no fine-tuning options, dealers may revert it to stock during warranty work, and additional car modifications require new reflashes. It is the cheapest form of aftermarket engine management, starting around $500.	['Engine Management 101 (as taught by Cosmo)\nEngine Management 101\nas taught by Cosmo\nAfter seeing many debates about this subject (and being involved in many myself) I figured it was time to set out on an effort to give you, the loyal WRXTuners member, a comprehensive guide to Engine Management and the WRX.\n1. WHAT IS ENGINE MANAGEMENT?\nYour WRX uses an Engine Control Unit (ECU) to control how your car runs. It uses inputs from the Mass Air Flow sensor (MAF), Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), and many other sensors to determine how much fuel, how much ignition advance, and how much boost your car should run.\nThe stock ECU is the form of engine management many WRX owners use, and they are perfectly happy with it. For some, however, the better choice is aftermarket engine management. Aftermarket engine management lets you change how your car runs, and get the most out of other modifications to the engine. Engine management in itself will often provide a very noticeable increase in power.\n2. WHY USE ENGINE MANAGEMENT?\nYour WRX comes from the factory in pretty good shape, even if it does run a little rich. If you don’t plan on doing any modifications to your car’s engine, you don’t need any engine management. Even small modifications like a cat-back don’t require engine management, but the performance gains will be minimal.\nIf, however, you want to make your WRX more powerful, engine management is a must. The best way to get power out of a turbocharged engine (like the one in your WRX) is to make the turbo create more boost (the amount of compressed air the turbocharger puts into the engine). Engines must maintain a certain Air-Fuel Ratio (AFR) to run correctly. In a perfect world, engines run best at a 14.7:1 ratio of air to fuel (14.7 parts air to 1 part fuel). Turbocharged cars usually run better - and much safer - at a richer AFR.\nYour stock ECU determines the AFR for your car after factoring in many different parameters. For a stock car this works great. However, if your car is making more boost than a stock car, it will need more fuel to maintain the optimal AFR as well as possibly retarding timing to prevent detonation or knock. This is where aftermarket engine management comes in.\n3. HOW DOES AFTERMARKET ENGINE MANAGEMENT WORK?\nThere are 3 main types of aftermarket engine management available:\nA. Reflashed ECU – Your ECU has a series of parameters that tell your car how much fuel, timing, and boost to run at certain RPM levels and throttle positions. This is often referred to as a “map”. When your ECU is reflashed, the programmer changes some or all of the numbers in your map to make your car run differently. Your car will then run according to the map that was “flashed” into your ECU.\nSome of the companies that offer this service are Cobb Tuning and Vishnu Tuning.\nB. Piggyback Unit – This unit mounts on top or near your ECU (hence the name) and modifies or overrides the signal that your ECU sends to the fuel system, ignition system, and boost control system. These usually have their own map or maps that tell your car how to run.\nTurboXS, Greddy, Apexi, and other companies offer this kind of engine management.\nC. Stand Alone System – This system completely replaces your ECU, and your car will run solely on the stand alone system’s maps and other parameters.\nSome of the companies that offer this are AEM, Electromotive, and Microtek.\n4. WHICH KIND OF ENGINE MANAGEMENT IS BEST?\nThis is where much of the debate lies. Unfortunately, there is no definite answer. Different cars require different kinds of engine management. Let’s look at some of the pros and cons of the different kinds of engine management:\nA. Stock ECU – Perfectly fine for a stock car, or a car with very little modification. Requires no user knowledge or skill, but does not offer an increase in performance.\nB. Reflashed ECU – Provides modified fuel, ignition, and boost maps. When your ECU is reflashed, your parameters and maps are overwritten, so your car will only run according to the reflash. This requires virtually no automotive or tuning knowledge (aside from knowing how to remove a few screws and unplug a few plugs). It offers a noticeable increase in performance, and your ECU will still appear stock. It is the safest and most fool-proof form of engine management.\nThe drawbacks, however, are that you must use a base map provided by the company that does the reflash. You have no way to fine tune your car to get the most performance you can safely get. For many people this is not a big deal, as they are simply looking to use a reflash to get the most out of the other modifications they do to their car. Also, many dealers reflash an ECU back to its stock form as a precautionary measure when your car goes in for warranty work. If that happens, you lose the reflash you paid for. In addition, when you make additional modifications to your car, you will need to have the ECU reflashed again to take advantage of them.\nThere are now some companies that offer a user-based reflasher (Cobb Tuning’s AccessPort). This allows you to change the map on your reflashed ECU to one of a limited number of maps provided by Cobb. This can be done while your ECU is still in your car. A reflashed ECU is the cheapest form of aftermarket engine management. They usually start around $500.\nC. Piggy-Back System – This system overrides or modifies your ECU’s stock maps for fuel, ignition, and boost, along with other parameters. It is a very powerful system, but also leaves room for user error. Those errors can cause serious damage to your engine. With a piggy-back system, you can change your fuel system, ignition system, and boost control system with a few keystrokes on your computer. This is both a blessing and a curse. In the right hands, this provides a very powerful tuning device, and can help your car run its absolute best. However, in inexperienced hands it can also destroy your engine.\nThis is not to say, however, that only an experienced tuner should consider a piggy-back system. Many of the companies that produce piggy-back systems provide base maps that you can load with very little computer skill. In fact, if you successfully made it to this web site to read this post, you have enough skill to load the base maps into your car. As you get more experienced, you can start to fine tune your car to run its best while still maintaining safe parameters. Anyone with minimal computer skills and the ability to read can tune an engine. However, if you don’t know what the effects of those tuning procedures are, I recommend having a professional do it for you.\nAs the name implies, a piggy-back system is an external system that often mounts on top of your ECU. It is immediately noticeable, and in some instances can void your warranty. It can be removed, however, and your car will revert back to stock engine management. Most piggy-back systems also provide a way to bypass the system to allow your car to run on the stock ECU while the piggy-back system is still installed.\nThe most popular piggy-back systems are the TurboXS UTEC and Vishnu Xede. Cobb Tuning is also preparing to release their AccessTuner which will function as a piggy-back system.\nMany piggy back systems also offer data logging features, which can be an invaluable tuning aid. Piggy back systems generally cost around $1000-1200.\nD. Stand Alone System – This system is the most complex and expensive, but most powerful system you can use. There are several options in stand alone systems, and all have about the same advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage of a stand alone system is that they offer the most control over your engine, and the most ability to find tune your engine. The disadvantages (although some don’t consider it a disadvantage) is that you have to program every aspect of your engine. Idle, cold start, and other mundane features of your engine are all dependent on you. While I strongly believe that a stand alone system is the best choice for a race car, I just as strongly believe that they are not well suited for a street car.\n5. SO, WHICH KIND OF ENGINE MANAGEMENT SHOULD I USE?\nWell, to answer this question you need to take a look at your car, your needs, your ability, and your budget.\nIf you are going to be doing minimal modifications to your car (uppipe, downpipe, turbo back), or feel completely uncomfortable with the idea of tuning your car yourself, you should consider a reflashed ECU. Also, if you are on a budget, this is probably the best choice.\nIf you want to tweak your car to get the best performance possible, make heavy modifications (turbo, fuel system), and want to be able to tune your car to take advantage of current modifications and any future modifications, you should consider a piggy back system. They are the best choice for cars with upgraded fuel systems and/or turbos.\nI won’t recommend a stand alone system because if anyone needs one of those, they know it already, and don’t need my recommendation.\nAnyone with any comments/criticisms, please let me know. This is YOUR web site, not mine, so I want this guide to be something that benefits everyone!']	['<urn:uuid:f54f8ceb-cfed-4aba-9089-1e696d5474bb>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	6	86	1611

53	As someone studying food science, I notice many packaged foods contain hidden sugars and salt. How much has American consumption of these ingredients changed over time, and what are the current health implications?	According to USDA statistics, Americans now consume 43 percent more caloric sweeteners than they did in the 1950s. For salt, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 75 percent of Americans' sodium intake comes from processed foods rather than from salt shakers. Even packaged toddler foods are affected, with 75 percent being high in sodium. Research conclusively links high sugar and salt consumption to several serious health conditions, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer.	['What is in this article?:\nSmartphones, Skype, drive-through everything—today’s technologies and conveniences help us connect with the world, conquer to-do lists, and feed our kids on the fly. But the upsides of modern advances come loaded with downsides: We’re more sedentary, stressed, and exposed to toxins than ever before, and the list of health ramifications is long. Learn all-natural solutions—from experts trained in nutrition, acupuncture, pharmacology, and more—for top health menaces you’re facing now\nModern challenge: Broken food systems\nBacklash: sugar and salt saturation\nMany people don’t realize that even healthy-sounding bread, fruit juice, yogurt, condiments, cereal, and other packaged foods contain scads of sugar and salt—which abundant research irrefutably links to obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. USDA stats show that Americans today consume 43 percent more caloric sweeteners than we did in the 1950s. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 75 percent of Americans’ sodium intake now comes from processed foods—not the salt shaker—and a recent study found that 75 percent of packaged toddler foods are high in sodium.\nWhat to do now\n- Do the math. “We have been conditioned by processed foods to like that high-sodium flavor,” says Clayton. “But in 2010, the American Heart Association recommended keeping sodium intake to 1,500 mg or less daily. Likewise, with sugar, you need to budget it—stick to 100–200 sugar calories per day. It’s not that you can’t have them, but you need to monitor how much you consume.”\n- Read labels. Become familiar with other names for sugar, like corn syrup, honey, fruit juice concentrate, and any ingredient that ends in –ose, such as fructose, sucrose, and glucose. Then compare labels, urges Clayton. “Look at a canned soup and see how high the sodium is, or a regular broth versus a low-sodium broth. When you start studying labels, you’ll see that, gee, this serving of soup has 570 mg sodium or this food has 50 grams of sugar in it, or wow, the top four ingredients on this label are sugars.”\n- Be patient. When cutting back on sugar and salt, it takes taste buds six to eight weeks to adjust to a new style of eating, says McColl. Can’t bear to eliminate bread, a common salt offender? “Just choose one meal a day to enjoy bread, and the other meals have other grains or starches, such as brown rice, oatmeal, or sweet potatoes,” she advises. The same goes for sugar. “It will be tough the first week or two, but once you get that sugar out of your system by eating plain whole foods, you will not have sugar cravings anymore.”\nBacklash: nutrient depletion\nUnfortunately, even when you choose apples, carrots, and cucumbers over crackers, you may not be getting as many nutrients from those foods as your grandparents did. A landmark 2004 study found that 43 vegetables and fruits had markedly less calcium, protein, phosphorus, iron, and vitamins B2 and C than in 1950. Why? According to the researchers, during the past 60 years, farmers shifted their focus to getting the greatest yield. Often, that means growing only one or two crops; and, because crop rotation reintroduces nutrients into the soil, monocropping robs dirt of its riches.\nWhat to do now\n- Connect the dots. First and foremost, learn more about where your food comes from and how it’s grown. “The average person goes to the store and says, ‘I’m going to eat my fruits and vegetables; those are healthy for me,’” says Hoffman. “That’s good, but I think in our minds we envision an old-time orchard with apples handpicked at the peak of ripeness, and that’s not how it is when they’re grown conventionally.” Ask questions about where your store gets its food, including meat and dairy. What sourcing standards are used?\n- Cover your bases. “Everyone should take a multivitamin-mineral complex as an insurance policy, because of depleted soil but also incomplete nutrition,” says Clayton. A recently published long-term study in The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that taking a daily multi could lower cancer risk by about 8 percent; and a 2013 meta-analysis found that people who take vitamin and mineral supplements appear to be in a better mood—perceiving 65 percent to 77 percent less stress, anxiety, fatigue, and confusion—than nonusers.\n- Keep your cool. “Living food” devotees—those who eat foods not heated above 115 degrees—swear by raw foods’ health benefits, which stem from the preservation of foods’ natural enzymes that promote healthy digestion and nutrient absorption. Not ready to go cold turkey—er, broccoli? Some is better than none. Find out which raw foods satisfy you and incorporate them into your daily regimen—raw nut butter on apple slices, for example, or a glass of raw coconut water.\n- Counter free radicals. When food-nutrient intake is low, you need even more antioxidants—nutrients that fight free radicals, which exacerbate aging, says Sowers. He suggests 500–2,000 mg vitamin C and 400 IU vitamin E daily. “And make sure your daily multi contains 70–200 mcg selenium,” another free radical fighter, he says.\nBacklash: food and water contamination\nIn addition to what’s missing from foods, another modern concern is what’s present in them—namely, toxins and contaminants. As the world’s population has skyrocketed, so have agricultural “innovations” aimed at streamlining and economizing food production, such as synthetic pesticides and fertilizers you can’t apply without hazmat gear and antibiotics injected into factory-farm-raised cattle, pigs, and poultry. “Today, 70 percent of all medically important antibiotics in the U.S. are used in food animal production,” says Sasha Lyutse, food and agriculture policy advocate for the National Resources Defense Council. “Fed to animals day after day, these antibiotics kill the weakest bacteria, but the stronger ones thrive. You really couldn’t design a better system to promote antibiotic-resistant ‘superbugs.’”\nAnd it isn’t just meat eaters who are affected. “Resistant bugs can travel away from feedlots via water, soil, and air that comes into contact with contaminated animal waste,” Lyutse says. “They can end up on a doorknob, on a piece of unwashed fruit, or at a hospital, where they can cause really severe illnesses.” And those pesticides and fertilizers? They wind up not only in food, but in the groundwater that eventually comes out of someone’s tap.\nWhat to do now\n- Purify. “I think everyone in Southern California knows that there are water issues,” says Sowers, whose Riverside, California, store serves a county with 2 million people. To see how your city’s water measures up, check the Environmental Working Group National Drinking Water Database (ewg.org/tap-water). In most cases, a simple, carbon-based filter will take out a lot of what’s problematic, such as heavy metals and pathogens, Sowers says; a distillation feature can eliminate even more contaminants. Don’t rely on bottled water, which isn’t necessarily pure; the EWG found 38 contaminants in ten popular brands. And consider a shower-head filter to reduce chlorine; it’s commonly added to disinfect tap water but can exacerbate dry skin, asthma, and allergies.\n- Eat organic. You hear a lot of debate about whether organic foods are more nutritious than conventional foods, but what’s indubitable is that USDA Certified Organic foods must be grown and processed without pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics, growth hormones, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Check the EWG’s updated “Dirty Dozen Plus” list (ewg.org/foodnews) for the most important foods to buy organic. Organic crops and livestock also mean fewer toxins leaching into groundwater.\n- Wash.

Essential golf etiquette rules include arriving early to warm up before the game, marking your golf balls for identification, replacing any divots you create, avoiding walking between another player's ball and the hole, maintaining silence when others are putting, and not spending too much time at one hole. Additionally, never pick up another player's golf ball or tee.	['01 May A Guide to Golfing for the First Time\nIf you’re among the nearly 25 million people estimated to hit the golf course this year, you might be a little unsure what to expect. If this is your first time golfing, there are some important golf tips for beginners, as well as tricks and rules of etiquette you are expected to follow.\nHow Do I Learn to Play Golf for the First Time?\nIf you’re here because you are interested in learning golf basics, that’s an excellent first step. Taking the time to understand the game means you have the type of dedication required to become a skilled player. Some of the best golf tips for a beginner are to establish a routine, familiarize yourself with golf terminology and secure the appropriate gear:\nEstablish a Routine\nThe best way to learn any new skill is to dive right in and start practicing. The following tips can help you create and stick to a routine:\n- Be consistent: One of the best golf lessons for beginner adults is to be consistent with your practice. Practice may not make you the perfect golfer, but it is crucial if you want to learn the basics of the game and grow into a better player over time. Set aside time each week to practice on the range or the course, and set milestones for yourself to track your progress. The more time you put into the game, the more comfortable you will feel on the green. One way to hold yourself accountable is to book tee times in advance.\n- Learn with a friend: Consider learning golf alongside another beginner to help keep you accountable and have someone to practice with. You could also have an experienced golfer mentor you in the game and work with you one-on-one.\n- Put in the time: If you want to become a better golfer, you need to be willing to put in the time. Golf is fun and challenging, but also requires great concentration and skill to master.\nLearn the Terminology\nIf you have spent any time on a golf course or practicing at the range, you’ve likely heard quite a few terms used. There are dozens of golf-specific words you will learn as you gain experience, but these are a good place to start:\n- Golf tee: The golf tee is a small peg, 2–3 inches long, that you push into the golf turf to prop up the ball. Tees are usually made of either wood or plastic.\n- Tee box: The tee box is a generalized term that refers to the area where you begin playing each hole. It’s also known as the teeing area.\n- Par: Par is the number of strokes it will likely take for a golfer to complete either a single hole or every hole on the course, depending on the context. Par is usually calculated at an expert level, so don’t worry if you don’t golf up to par right away.\n- The green: The green is the manicured, lush part of a golf course that surrounds the hole.\n- Ace: An ace is also known as a hole-in-one.\n- Fore: If you hear someone yell, “Fore!” while you’re on the course, you might want to take cover — it means a ball was hit too hard or in the wrong direction and could hit someone. If you have a bad hit, make sure you yell out the warning in time for other players to shield their faces.\n- Drive: Even if you don’t use a driver, the drive is the first hit you take from the tee box.\n- Duff: Simply put, a duff is a hit that doesn’t go as planned. Duffs happen to the best of us — even professional golfers hit a duff or two.\n- Mulligan: You won’t find the term mulligan used in a professional golf game. However, in a casual game or at the putting range, a mulligan refers to a do-over if you want to try your hit again.\n- Fairway: The fairway is the part of the golf course that leads to the green.\n- Pre-shot routine: A pre-shot routine is a ritual a golfer does just before they hit the ball. Every golfer’s pre-shot routine is different, and there is no “right way.”\n- Divot: The divot is a piece of turf or cut-out hole on the course that shifts out of place when struck by the ball.\nThe exact type of equipment you require depends on several factors, including temperature, weather conditions, your budget, where you are playing and what you hope to get out of the game. There are a few things that every golfer should have, regardless of these factors:\n- Clubs: Every golfer should have a set of comfortable, quality golf clubs. Later, we’ll talk more in-depth about which basic clubs for golf beginners are essential.\n- Golf balls: As a beginner, you might want to avoid investing too much money in golf balls right away. You will likely lose several of them as you learn how to play. Instead, look for an affordable multi-pack of golf balls that you can easily replace if a few go missing along the way.\n- Golf bag: When choosing a golf bag, know whether you need a cart bag or a carry bag. Cart bags are designed to load easily into a golf cart, while carry bags are comfortable enough to carry around the course on foot.\n- Golf tees: You should always have several golf tees on hand. The size of the golf tees depends on the type and length of the golf club you are using, so be sure to consider that before purchasing.\n- Sunscreen: No matter the time of year or visible cloud cover, sunscreen is essential if you are playing outdoors. If you’re worried about adding too much weight to your golf bag, look for a travel size bottle.\n- Towels: Towels are not required, but make golfing during warm weather much more enjoyable. You can use a towel to dab sweat from your hands and promote a steadier grip, or you can use a damp towel to cool down in between holes.\nYou can find golf gear at most sport equipment stores. Some ranges and private clubs have golf gear for rent or sale on the premises. If you’re just starting out, you could also buy secondhand golf equipment or borrow gear from a friend until you get a better feel for your preferences.\nWhat to Wear Golfing for the First Time\nIf you’re heading to practice at a public golf range, the dress code may be less strict than it is at a private club. Check with the range and ask if there are any guidelines for attire you need to know about. If you’re golfing at a club, however, the guidelines are pretty standard across the industry:\n- Tops: Specific golf shirts are slightly longer than the average polo, but if this is your first trip to the green, anything similar will work. Just be sure your top is comfortable and has a collar, as well as short sleeves. Depending on the season and weather forecast, you may also want to bring along a long-sleeved windbreaker or fleece jacket to stay comfortable while you’re outside. Make sure your jacket isn’t too hot and that the sleeves are an appropriate length, otherwise it could impact your performance.\n- Bottoms: Jeans and leggings are typically against golf course etiquette. Instead, opt for a pair of khakis or capri pants. If the weather is warm, go for a pair of mid-length shorts or a golf skirt.\n- Shoes and socks: You can buy shoes explicitly created for golf. Golf shoes have soft spikes on the bottom that lend an extra level of stability while walking, aiming and driving. If you don’t have golf shoes, regular sneakers or athletic shoes will be okay as long as they are comfortable and don’t have a heel that could dig into the turf.\n- Hat: Golf hats are essential for keeping the sun out of your eyes during crucial moments, like hitting and spotting the ball. Any baseball-style cap or sun visor will work, as long as it fits securely to your head and doesn’t impede your vision.\n- Gloves: Not every golfer wants or needs a set of golf gloves, but you might consider investing in a pair with good gripping if you are prone to sweaty hands.\nHow to Play Golf for Beginners: The Basics\nOnce you have brushed up on the lingo and purchased all the necessary apparel, it’s time to start practicing. Here are some golf pointers for beginners:\n- Setting up the round: After you show up for your scheduled tee time, you and your group — up to four players total — need to decide how many holes you want to play and whether you will be walking or using a golf cart. This is also when you will hire a caddy, if interested.\n- Gripping the club: When gripping the club, use your palm and fingers. Try to grip the handle about an inch below the end of the club. Avoid tightly gripping or holding too much tension in your hands, or you won’t be able to turn with enough fluidity to make the shot.\n- Hitting the ball: As you prepare to hit the ball, trace an invisible path back and forth with your club to build up force for your hit. Aim for a steady hit with the center of the club’s face, rather than the tip or the edge.\n- Keeping score: Specific scoring instructions depend on if you are playing stroke or match. Either way, make sure you keep track of how many times you tried to hit the ball, not just the successful hits. If you’re a new golfer, keeping score isn’t necessary, but it’s a fun way to track your progress over time.\nAs you practice and eventually work your way up to golfing on a professional course, there are a few rules of golf etiquette you should be aware of:\n- Show up to the course with plenty of time to warm up before you begin your game.\n- Write your name or other identifying information on your golf balls in case they get lost — and never pick up another player’s golf ball or tee.\n- Always replace your divots.\n- Don’t step in or walk through the area between another player and the hole they are golfing.\n- When someone is preparing to putt, do not make any noise or be otherwise distracting.\n- Do not linger at one hole for too long.\nWhat Golf Clubs Are Needed for a Beginner?\nThere are several different types of golf clubs, each one serving a unique purpose. It’s important that you research what each golf club does, as well as the best time to use that club. Eventually, you will want to own one or more of the following:\n- Fairway woods\nIt’s okay to start out with just a few clubs. The primary golf clubs for beginners are fairway woods, irons and putters. As you gain more experience, you can experiment with more. If you’re working with a golf instructor, they can help you decide which clubs to get first based on your specific goals. Most golfers have about a standard 12 clubs in their golf bag:\n- Three fairway woods\n- Eight irons\n- One putter\n- Room for two additional clubs based on your hitting preferences\nAs you shop for clubs, it is crucial that you hold each one in your hand before making a purchase. Your club should feel comfortable and sit well in your palm.\nHow Many Golf Lessons Should a Beginner Take?\nSome golf instructors recommend at least 15 different lessons that cover everything from golf basics to specific club hits and swing analysis. While this is ideal for many beginners, how many golf lessons you should take depends on several factors, including:\n- How long each lesson is\n- How quickly you master each new skill\n- Whether you are working with a teacher\n- How often you practice\n- Your budget\n- What your end goal is\nAs you consider the type and frequency of lessons that are best for you, one of the most important things to focus on is finding the right teacher. Some private clubs and private or public ranges staff golf instructors. You can also ask your golf friends for recommendations or research options local to your area. When considering a golf teacher, make sure you ask about their rate per lesson, their teaching philosophies and their golf credentials. You may be able to get a discount per class by purchasing a lesson package.\nChoose a golf instructor who shares similar interests as you or has had a golf career that aligns with your current goals. Many golf teachers have trial lessons or clinics available, so you can be sure you’re a good match before committing.\nLevel up Your Game With Hallmark Golf\nMany enthusiasts consider Hilton Head Island in South Carolina to be one of the top golfing destinations in the United States — and we couldn’t agree more.

"[""PARENTING; When Children Know Best\nBy MICHAEL WINERIP\nPublished: June 3, 2007\nWHEN my mother reached her mid-80s, it began to dawn on me that I'd have to start intervening in her life. This was not pleasant. Mom had always been fiercely independent, happily living on her own in suburban Boston for the 20 years after my dad died.\nThere was no single event, just a hundred little ones that nibbled away at that solid image of Mom that was stored in my brain. I'd go back to Quincy for a visit and there would be piles of mail all over the house. Overdue bills were mixed in with supermarket stuffers that should have been tossed out weeks earlier. And I'd try to remember: Was this new?\nOn one visit, we cooked dinner together, and I couldn't be sure, but it appeared that more of her pots were burned on the bottom. Another time, Mom misplaced her purse, and after hours of hunting, we found it at the bottom of her closet. Her closet?\nThe house didn't seem as clean, so as a Mother's Day gift, I hired a student from a local college for a free month of cleaning. But when the gift expired, Mom didn't keep the cleaner: She didn't clean right. Besides, Mom loved scrubbing floors.\nMom wouldn't consider assisted living. We'd go on tours and she'd nod enthusiastically at all the amenities, then tell the rental agent, ''You know, I love my house.''\nSo I found a social worker in Quincy named Kate who specialized in helping the elderly stay in their homes. Mom insisted she didn't need help, and she certainly didn't want this Kate person knowing her private business. But I persisted, and after the three of us went to lunch, Mom admitted that this Kate person seemed all right. At that point, I lied to my mother. I told her that the social worker was provided by the city free of charge, and that as a senior citizen Mom was entitled to unlimited free visits. This worked. Mom loved a bargain.\nBlessed Kate won Mom's heart and progressed from seeing her once a month to visiting weekly for 90 minutes. She became my eyes on Mom, my spy. Eventually, Mom trusted her so completely, she let Kate pay the bills that we couldn't do online. At the end of those visits, Mom would send Kate off with cookies or some small gift to take home to her children.\nOne of my regular topics with Kate was Mom's driving -- nothing conclusive, just more worrisome nibbles. There was the time at the mall when a shopper found Mom slumped over the steering wheel, the car idling. Mom went to the hospital emergency room and then to her doctor. Nothing serious, they concluded; she'd just had a cold and was weak that day.\nI got a call from an insurance investigator. He said someone had reported Mom hitting a car in a Stop & Shop parking lot. Mom adamantly denied this. She drove a 15-year-old Dodge Dart that had accumulated lots of nicks, and when I made a special visit to Boston to see the car for myself, there didn't seem to be any more scrapes than when I'd last looked.\nThe insurance agent was very sympathetic. He said he had a grandmother Mom's age and confessed that he couldn't tell whether Mom had actually hit the other car or someone was scamming her because of her age.\nThen a woman told Kate that Mom had gone through a red light and done a few other things that had made her nervous when she rode with her. How much to make of this? Was Mom being overly scrutinized because of her age? If the standard for taking away a license were running red lights, much of America would be walking.\nI went for a drive with Mom around town, and she did fine. I contacted Mom's doctor and asked him to do an assessment, but he told me that under privacy laws, he'd need her permission. She would not give it.\nThe social worker helped me find a reasonably priced car service that specialized in driving the elderly, but Mom would not hear of it. In her defense, Mom recited the suburban credo: ''My car is my freedom.'' She said she'd know when it was time to stop.\nI couldn't tell if I was noticing more problems because I was looking, or if more was going wrong. The forgetfulness seemed worse. She'd be out on an errand when she was supposed to be home for her appointment with Kate. Her hearing deteriorated further, and she refused to wear her hearing aid. She said that when she wore it, she heard the wrong things. I noticed more odd comments during our nightly phone calls. ''There's a paper here on my couch,'' she said one time, ''and I can't remember how it got there.''\nThe law in Massachusetts, as in most states, has a procedure for filing a complaint about someone you think should no longer drive. In Massachusetts, the driver is entitled to know who filed that complaint. Mom would know it was her son Michael. I felt this was a terrible message to send at a time when I badly needed Mom's trust so we could work together to figure out how to enable her to best live out her life.\nReporting Mom to the government would not build trust. I decided it was better to look her in the eye and tell the truth. I was motivated by fear as much as anything. As a newspaperman, I could see the headline: ''Confused Elderly Woman Crashes Into''\n''Mom,'' I said, ''I don't think you should be driving any more. I'm taking away your keys.''\nI was bigger, stronger, younger, and I didn't think she'd have the wherewithal to go up against me or behind my back. And I was right.\nBut this was no victory, only lots more responsibility. It reminded me of the warning President Bush was given on Iraq: ''You break it, you own it.'' Now I owned Mom. That was 2004. She was 90.\nShortly after I took the keys, she went to stay with my brother in Phoenix for the winter. In the spring, I brought her to New York and set her up -- ''strictly on a trial basis, Mom'' -- in an assisted-living residence near my home. For her remaining 18 months, Mom did not live in her Quincy home, nor did she drive again.\nDuring this time, if we were together with her bridge friends at the residence, Mom would invariably say: ''Do you know that my son Michael took my car keys away from me? Can you believe that?''\nMom was not a complainer, and when she said this, she smiled. But I was being reminded: There are many degrading things about living to be 92.\nHer friends would shake their heads as if to say, ''What a monster son, we know the type.'' But then they would do me a kindness. What I read in their ever-so-slightly raised eyebrows was, ''You did right.''\nDrawing (Drawing by Jason Schneider)"", 'Whats in this section?\nWhats in this section?\nServices developed in partnership with the voluntary sector\nAdult Social Care works with voluntary and community organisations and charities to deliver preventative care services and fund these activities.

57	modern ship construction materials prevent corrosion damage methods effective	Modern ship construction employs multiple methods to prevent corrosion damage. The traditional approach includes painting, sacrificial anodes, and inhibitors in bilges. More advanced solutions incorporate alumina nanofiber-enhanced polymer composites, which increase impact toughness, crack resistance, and corrosion resistance. These nanofibers, at just 10nm diameter, can significantly improve coating performance at low concentrations. Additionally, ships can utilize corrosion-resistant alloys like stainless steels or copper-based alloys, though this requires careful control of system potential to avoid hydrogen uptake in certain materials like super duplex steel and titanium.	"['A unique nanofiber form of pure aluminium oxide (alumina) was discovered and further developed as an industrial scale technology. Nano-alumina features high strength, high aspect ratio, large surface area and a faceted surface, which all together allow the nanofiber to increase the mechanical properties of polymer (e.g. epoxy) based systems. The increased performance will have great benefits for advanced material manufacturers and the end-users of those materials (i.e. composites, adhesives, sealants, coatings). Affected industries include Marine, Oil & Gas, Aerospace, Automotive, Electronics, Construction, Performance Sports Equipment and more.\nThis alumina nanofiber technology has been taken a step further by developing dispersion methods which enables homogeneous dispersion within the polymer matrix. This eliminates the current problems faced by nano-additive users, where additional processing steps or high increases in cost are required just to incorporate those nano-additives. This technology requires very low concentrations of the alumina nanofiber and no additional processing steps, where existing nano-additives require significantly higher loadings that can impact other aspects of the formulations (e.g. viscosity) negatively, thus demanding more complex chemistry in order to balance the system.\nIn the current market environment, where most industry participants are looking for higher strength and lighter weight for their materials, this new alumina nanofiber technology has shown very promising increases in the performance of real-world products.\nTechnology Features, Specifications and Advantages\nThe aluminum oxide (alumina) nanofiber has the following unique features:\n- 10nm diameter\n- Solid structure (no micropores) with large surface area (155 m2/g)\n- High Temperature stability (up to 1200°C)\n- High aspect ratio (30:1 up to 90:1 in dispersed form)\n- High strength (12 GPa tensile strength; 400 GPa tensile modulus)\n- Dielectric (non-electrically conductive)\n- Thermally conductive (30 W/mK)\n- Naturally predispersed as-produced (no agglomeration)\n- Transparent when wetted (no negative effect on colored or clear systems)\n- Faceted surface (allows for mechanical interlocking within the matrix)\nSeveral immediate industry applications where the technology can have a very positive impact has been identified, and these include the following polymer-based product categories:\n- Abrasion resistant coatings or pipe liners for automotive, marine, wind energy, oil & gas\n- Crack resistant and corrosion resistant coatings for marine vessel and offshore oil & gas construction\n- Toughened composite components for automotive, aerospace, wind energy, high performance sports equipment, etc.\n- Strengthened and flexible composite components for automotive, aerospace, wind energy, high performance sports equipment, etc.\n- Fire resistant coatings for marine, oil & gas and construction industries\n- High Performance adhesives with better adhesive and cohesive strength for automotive, aerospace, wind energy and electronics\n- Dielectric films, adhesives and sealants for the electronics industry to reduce the impact of electro-magnetic impulse on sensitive components\n- Higher performance, lighter weight ballistic armour and structural composites for automotive, aerospace, personal protection, wind energy, etc.\nAdditional target applications currently being investigated are as follows:\n- Accelerators for Ultra High Performance Cement (UHPC), reducing curing times while increasing compression strength\n- Additive for more stable, high-capacity lithium batteries\n- Catalyst carriers for various gas phase change catalysis\n- Reinforcing additive for ceramics to prevent creep, shrinkage and micro crack propagation in high temperature ceramics.\n- Reinforcing and strengthening additive for thermoplastics\nAdvantages of the alumina nanofiber in polymers include increases in the following properties:\n- Impact toughness\n- Flexural strength\n- Fracture toughness (crack resistance)\n- Compression Strength\n- Interlaminar shear strength\n- Elongation (elasticity)\n- Tensile strength\n- Tensile modulus\n- Abrasion resistance\n- Dielectric shielding (insulating from electric impulses)\n- Fire resistance (including burn-through rate and char resistance)\n- Thermal conductivity', ""Year upon year the cost of marine corrosion has increased until it is estimated today at 4 % of the Gross National Product. An enlightened approach to materials selection, protection and corrosion control is needed to reduce this burden of wasted materials, wasted energy and wasted money. These notes have been compiled by Members of the Marine Corrosion Forum to help marine designers, engineers, and equipment users, understand the causes of marine corrosion and the way in which protective systems and more resistant materials can be used to reduce or entirely eliminate sea water corrosion problems.\nMany different types of destructive attack can occur to structures, ships and other equipment used in sea water service. The term 'aqueous corrosion' describes the majority of the most troublesome problems encountered in contact with sea water, but atmospheric corrosion of metals exposed on or near coastlines, and hot salt corrosion in engines operating at sea or taking in salt-laden air are equally problematical and like aqueous corrosion require a systematic approach to eliminate or manage them.\nCorrosion by sea water, aqueous corrosion, is an electrochemical process, and all metals and alloys when in contact with sea water have a specific electrical potential (or corrosion potential) at a specific level of sea water acidity or alkalinity - the pH.\nThis typical diagram shows the regions where the metal will freely corrode; the region of passivation where stable oxide or other films form and the corrosion process is stifled; the region of pitting corrosion where the corrosion potential of the metal exceeds that of its oxide; and the region of immunity where the metal is normally fully safe to use. More resistant alloys mean less corrosion, metals like gold platinum and tantalum can resist virtually all corrosion, but for marine service the final choice will always be a compromise with cost.\nMost corrosion resistant metals rely on an oxide film to provide protection against corrosion. If the oxide is tightly adherent, stable and self healing, as on many stainless steels and titanium, then the metal will be highly resistant or immune to corrosion. If the film is loose, powdery, easily damaged and non self repairing, such as rust on steel, then corrosion will continue unchecked. Even so, the most stable oxides may be attacked when aggressive concentrations of hydrochloric acid are formed in chloride environments.\nSea water, by virtue of its chloride content, is a most efficient electrolyte. The omni-presence of oxygen in marine atmospheres, sea spray and splash zones at the water-line, and sometimes surprisingly at much greater depths, increases the aggressiveness of salt attack. The differential concentration of oxygen dissolved at the waterline or in a droplet of salt spray creates a cell in which attack is concentrated where the oxygen concentration is lowest. Crevices which allow ingress of water and chlorides but from which oxygen is excluded rapidly become anodic and acidic and are hidden start points of corrosion.\nThere are five main methods for controlling the tendency of metals to corrode in sea water:\nUse of non metallic materials including composites may offer a solution for some applications.\nSea water, if not destructive enough on its own, has several powerful allies assisting the breakdown of metals and non metals alike. Living allies in sea water also enhance its destructive power. Microbiological organisms, clusterings of weed, limpets as well as deposits of sand, silt or slime not only exclude oxygen but often create locally corrosive conditions under these deposits which aggravate attack. Coatings and composite structures can experience rapid degradation. Sulphate reducing bacteria, left undisturbed in marine silt or mud deposits, will produce concentrations of hydrogen sulphide which are particularly aggressive to steel and copper based alloys.\nPitting attack in stagnant sea water may be as much a problem as impingement, erosion or cavitation attack at higher velocities. The highest water velocities, at the tips of propellers or in pumps can result in bubbles of entrained air imploding with sufficient energy to remove metal or break up composites. Called cavitation, this noisy and aggressive mechanical destruction must be corrected by design, or if it cannot be eliminated, countered by the selection of suitably resistant alloys.\nHigh levels of stress in service, or residual stress from manufacturing may result in selective corrosion of more highly stressed regions of an otherwise corrosion resistant structure. In the aggressive marine environment even the more resistant alloys may be affected by hydrogen-induced cracking, or by chloride or sulphide stress corrosion cracking. Choosing the right material for corrosion resistance also requires careful attention to component design, selection of manufacturing processes, installation and operation.\nLet's now look at a simple example. A ship made from bare mild steel will quickly rust.\nProtection by painting\nPainting the ship isolates the steel from the corrosive media. The paint must also be resistant to the marine environment and the application strictly controlled to ensure full and effective coverage of the steel. Regular inspection and repair of the coating may be necessary to achieve reliable and lasting protection.\nSacrificial anodes enable the potential of the system to be changed and will provide temporary protection to steel exposed by wear or damage of the protective coating. Systematic location of the anodes is critical to their overall effectiveness. They must likewise be regularly serviced and replaced when spent.\nInside the ship inhibitors which modify the corrosion process may effectively prevent attack in bilges and other areas where sea water will collect and stagnate. Reliable systems to monitor and maintain the correct concentration of the inhibitor are an essential aspect of this prevention strategy.\nIn practice ships are rarely made just from a single metal or alloy. Modern engineering systems use a wide range composites and of metals and alloys, some more, some less resistant to marine corrosion than steel. The more resistant alloys may aggravate the attack on adjacent unprotected less resistant alloys. This galvanic effect is not always confined to separate metals, some alloys improperly processed in manufacture or fabrication carry the seeds of their own destruction in their microstructures which contain phases so widely separated in corrosion potential that without further overall protection by coating, anodes or inhibitors, selective attack of the less resistant phase is inevitable.\nUsing corrosion resistant alloys\nCould ships and other marine structures be made from more corrosion resistant materials? Depending on design factors including the severity of the application and the levels of strength, damage tolerance, reliability, safety and life required, components and systems can be manufactured from composites, or from stainless steels of increasing resistance, or from copper based alloys such as cupro-nickel or nickel aluminium bronze, nickel alloys or titanium, using these materials exclusively or in conjunction with each other or less resistant alloys. Protection for the least resistant alloys by anodes, or impressed potential, requires careful control of the system potential to avoid the possibility of hydrogen uptake by the more highly corrosion resistant alloys such as super duplex steel and titanium.\nKey factors in prevention of marine corrosion are design, selection of materials, construction, use and maintenance. Failings in any one of these may lead to a total failure to prevent attack, which once started may cost far more to correct or eliminate than any notional savings on materials achieved at the outset. In a recent survey corrosion was found to be responsible for 30% of failures on ships and other marine equipment. These are expensive errors arising from the selection and use of unsuitable materials and are compounded by ever increasing penalties on vessels, civil and military for breakdown and unnecessarily short intervals between outages for major repairs. On offshore platforms the cost penalty for replacement of failed equipment is several times that required for a similar onshore facility, and this does not take into account any losses of oil or gas production.\nWhere to get help\nThe many types of marine corrosion, their possible interaction, and the need to review the whole system when considering changes, means that getting help and advice from marine corrosion specialists and materials and coatings experts is particularly important. Members of the Marine Corrosion Forum include such specialists as well as product and systems suppliers and end users. Regular meetings review and update the wide range of options available to designers and users to overcome new or long term marine corrosion problems. You are welcome to attend a meeting as a guest, or to become a member of the Marine Corrosion Forum yourself.""]"	['<urn:uuid:e50a17a7-8bb0-40e6-9ff0-b87fe6d41133>', '<urn:uuid:9540ede7-3fd3-4bd6-b15a-073d9bb00532>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	three-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	9	85	1995

59	brain structure differences entrepreneurs dyslexics business success	Entrepreneurs and dyslexics show different brain structures that influence their business success. Entrepreneurs' brains exhibit unique activation patterns during decision-making, with faster initial problem recognition and more intensive later-stage processing. Dyslexics have differences in their left parietal region and temporal processing, which leads them to develop alternative skills and coping strategies. These distinct neurological characteristics contribute to both groups finding success in entrepreneurship, with dyslexics being particularly effective in startup environments and creative business roles.	"['To learn more about the way founders think, we conducted a laboratory experiment that measured brain activity during a simple decision-making task. A group of 30 founder entrepreneurs, as well as 30 non-entrepreneurs, participated in a classic experiment called the Stroop Test. In this experiment, people are shown a series of images on which the names of colors are spelled in discordant colors. For example, the word red may be written in a blue color. Participants must then distinguish between the word itself and the color used to print it.\nWe measured brain activity over multiple cycles of the task, each cycle lasting one second. The brain activity of founder entrepreneurs was significantly different, compared to the non-entrepreneurs. In the initial stage of brain activation, when people first recognize the problem, founders were quicker to respond and were less inhibited. They quickly absorbed and embraced the problem, despite its ambiguity, In contrast, the non-entrepreneurs were slower during this initial phase. They tried to resolve more of the ambiguity before continuing.\nIn the later stages of problem processing, also within a split second, the founder entrepreneurs were different again. They dedicated more brain resources—in terms of information processing and speed—to resolve residual ambiguities. In other words, the entrepreneurs thought more intensely about the problem after they had already embraced it. In contrast, the non-entrepreneurs used less brain resources during this latter phase, presumably because they had resolved more ambiguity during the initial stage of the process.\nThese results are surprising and novel from the perspective of neuroscience. But does split-second decision-making in a lab say anything about how entrepreneurs really think? Evidence suggests it does. Quick responses matter. Imagine a potential founder who is scanning for opportunities — maybe there are early signs of new customer needs in the mobile e-commerce market. If she or he is not ready to embrace and explore this ambiguous problem, the opportunity will go undetected.\nOr consider a founder who is confronted with an urgent problem that must be tackled immediately. There is no time to resolve ambiguity and uncertainty. In fact, it may not be possible to do so. Instead, the founder must embrace the problem and move forward. In practice, we observe this kind of behavior often.\nEntrepreneurs frequently dive into a challenge without fully analyzing it. Deeper understanding evolves over time as they experiment and discover more about the market and customer, as in the Lean Startup approach to venture creation: embrace the problem, discover the customer, experiment and prototype, be ready to pivot and if necessary fail fast. We believe we are seeing this process sped up. And for the first time, we show that the brain is fundamentally involved.\nAnother study confirmed our thinking. This time we interviewed founder entrepreneurs about their decision-making processes. Founders were clearly more inclined to quickly grasp an opportunity, using a set of simple tests: did the opportunity fit their core strategy; did they already know the market; could they trust the other parties involved; did they have a good gut feeling; and finally, was the worst case scenario not too bad. A negative answer to any question could be a reason to stop. In this fashion, the entrepreneurs used simple criteria to rapidly embrace or reject opportunities.\nAs one entrepreneur explained: “I think often I’ll make a tentative decision on gut, and I could do that almost immediately. I might within two minutes have the information that I’ll think, yes, this is worthwhile. Then I’ll go and hunt around for information that will help me to decide if that’s the right decision.” Just as in the first experiment, this entrepreneur responded quickly to the problem and was happy to delay the resolution of ambiguity and uncertainty until later stages of decision-making.\nWhen combined, our studies add new evidence to support the view that founders think differently in decision-making, especially about problems and opportunities. Similar to the Lean Startup approach, founders embrace ambiguous problems more quickly, using simple rules to move forward, then dedicate more effort to resolve ambiguity and uncertainty during later stages of decision-making. In these respects, it appears that founders´ brains are wired differently.\nWe expect this difference will be explained by a combination of factors: a genetic component, early development and learning, and adult experience in problem resolution and decision-making. The brain is not hard wired, it is richly complex. For us, this is good news. Change and variety are part of being human, and so we shouldn’t be surprised that entrepreneurs’ brains are a little bit different.""\nSource: Peter T.

Despite an apparent disability, some are famous, like Tom Cruise or Richard Branson. Obviously, they do not suffer from a lack of intelligence and are, in fact, quite successful in the business world. So what is going on in their brains? Are they developing some compensatory mechanisms that help them to do things better?\nEpidemiological research studies indicate that dyslexics develop coping strategies to compensate for their weaknesses, which helps them in later life. The resilience that they acquire while in school often helps them to be more successful in developing a business, in being an entrepreneur.\nStatistics show that there are twice more dyslexics among entrepreneurs when compared to the general population. However, dyslexics are uncommon in higher management. They also tend to have a different business management style. Thus, they do better in startups and are better at handling particular types of businesses.\nDyslexia is usually first identified when a child goes to school and struggles with scrambled text. Dyslexic children have difficulty in reading texts, interpreting them, and explaining the meaning of the text to others, even though they can be very intelligent otherwise. Dyslexia often results in poor academic performance, undue pressure, and psychological trauma. Each dyslexic child needs to learn to cope with these challenges.\nAlthough dyslexic children are as intelligent as their peers at school, they are often labeled as less capable. Children with dyslexia are often targets of bullying in school. Poor self-image at school often leads to worsening of self-esteem in many of these kids. As helping dyslexic children is not easy, they are often left to themselves.\nWhat’s going on in the dyslexic brain? Neurological basis of dyslexia\nAs a common disorder, dyslexia is the subject of multiple studies. Researchers agree that those living with dyslexia may have differences in the brain relative to non-dyslexic children, and these differences are the subject of intense clinical research. The recent explosion in brain imaging technology is helping us gain a deeper understanding of the matter.\nThe neurological theory of dyslexia is one of the earliest. The theory was proposed about a century ago when British physicians Morgan and Hinshelwood described dyslexia as a “visual word blindness.”\nThe study of adults living with brain trauma in the left parietal region demonstrated that many of these people develop reading difficulties. They find it challenging to process the optical image of letters. Thus, the early theory was that those with dyslexia have developmental defects in the parietal region of the brain.\nLeft parietal involvement was also somewhat confirmed during pathological examination of the brains of those who died at an earlier age and were known to be dyslexic.\nAnother important theory focuses on delayed brain lateralization in dyslexia. It is thought that some people have weak or insufficient brain lateralization that hinders the understanding of languages. This theory was the subject of multiple studies in the second half of last century.\nThe latest research into the neurophysiology of those living with dyslexia seems to indicate that dyslexia is phonological in nature: dyslexics have difficulty in manipulating the phoneme parts of speech. It is possible that there are developmental issues in the visual tract or other visual mechanisms in the brain may be contributing to the difficulty.\nApart from defects in a specific subsystem of the vision pathway, researchers think that there are other brain developmental issues involved as well. It is entirely possible that people with dyslexia have temporal processing impairment, and therefore they are not able to process information fast enough. Thus, dyslexia is considered the result of multi-system deficits\nDyslexia is probably the result of deficits in the brain at multiple levels. There is an impaired phoneme discrimination resulting in difficulty in understanding spelling. Visual perceptual impairment leads to further worsening of word recognition, and phonological awareness impairment causes speech disturbances. In the center of all this is delayed temporal processing. The end result is delayed speech development, difficulties in reading and comprehending texts, and poor academic performance.\nWhat makes a dyslexic a successful person?\nFrom Leonardo da Vinci to Einstein, children with learning disabilities prove that there is a limited link between disability and intelligence. Children with dyslexia are at least equally intelligent to non-dyslexic children.\nThe higher success of individuals with dyslexia in certain professions is probably the result of resilience or compensatory mechanisms that they cultivate during the school days to overcome their difficulties.\nSome of these kids may develop better skills for interacting with others. They may focus more on specific arts or sciences. Many of them may not concentrate on studies and instead start doing business at an early age. This means that they can be found in any profession, and in the long run they are equally successful.\nThe compensatory mechanisms developed at a young age may provide an edge over others in specific areas when the children grow up. Even though dyslexics may score poorly in school, they may outscore other children in practical life since they spend more time perfecting their verbal skills.\nAs an entrepreneur, dyslexics are known to be good at delegating tasks, they are excellent mentors, and they are often creative. All of these qualities usually make them more successful entrepreneurs, though they may not be that good in roles where there is less space for creativity.\nAchieving success with dyslexia is perhaps about learning different skills, mastering different approaches to solving the tasks, and developing strategies to compensate for certain limitations.\nHabib, M.

From Document 1, the RFA is expanding to 2200 positions by decade's end with opportunities for promotion to command positions in late 30s. From Document 2, confined space work requires specific safety measures including ventilation prerequisites, keeping gas cylinders outside, blocking heavy equipment, providing emergency removal means, and maintaining ventilation at 2,000 cubic feet per minute per worker.	"[""- Education and training\n- General secretary message\n- Health and safety\n- Members at work\n- Nautilus news\n- Nautilus partnerships\n- Open days\n- Ukraine conflict\n- United Kingdom\nNautilus International spoke with Commodore David Eagles on why qualified seafarers should consider a career with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), a major employer of Nautilus members\nIt is clear when you meet Commodore David Eagles, head of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), that he has both eyes set firmly on expansion of the service and that people and skills are resolutely at the heart of this strategy.\nAny Nautilus member who has lost their job, been furloughed, had their pay and conditions curtailed during the pandemic, or who just fancies a change, should consider the RFA. It is actively expanding its fleet with three solid support ships due for delivery by 2032 and the recent Defence Command Paper offers opportunities that could see exciting new capabilities and ships coming into the fleet. Viewed through the prism of its existing 11 vessels, six of which are currently on active duty with two more poised to go on operations, the need for highly trained crew becomes clear.\nWith workforce recovery on track to deliver crews for 13 ships by the middle of the decade and the potential growth through new capabilities identified in the Defence Command Paper of March this year, the RFA is looking to grow UK seafarer numbers from the current total of 1850 across all ranks to around 2200 by the end of the decade. An ambitious aspiration with the RFA at the heart of the UK seafarer community.\n'For the first time in probably two working generations we have the opportunity to grow both the size of the RFA, and the number of UK registered seafarers as we develop the Integrated Programme (IP) of the next 30 years,' Cdre Eagles said when he visited Nautilus head office in June.\nThe RFA pays for the full costs of all study leave, professional certification and mandatory training for all its personnel and any individuals with Deck, ME or ETO certificates of competency who wish to transition from the Merchant Navy will be fully trained and encouraged to achieve senior certification with all training costs met by the RFA.\nIt provides specialist military training for all newcomers and maintains a fully funded study scheme with paid study leave for career development – which is vanishingly rare in commercial shipping these days.\n'That combination,' Cdre Eagles said 'will deliver a very highly qualified workforce to meet the demand'.\nWith pay negotiations on hold at many commercial shipping operations during the pandemic, an historical gap between RFA and private sector salaries has decreased. As an example, deck officer and engineer officer jobs are currently advertised with initial earnings starting at £35,000, while a motorman grade 1 will start at over £27,000.\nAnother reason to consider the RFA is its generous pension and bonus scheme for officers, negotiated with union support. Pair that with a guaranteed salary for 365 days of the year and job security, and a transition to its ranks could prove welcome for the right candidates.\nCdre Eagles acknowledged that some seafarers may be slightly daunted by the military aspects of the job. But he remains confident that the opportunities on offer at all levels from ratings to officer – are comparable with and in some cases better than the commercial maritime sector.\nThe Royal Fleet Auxiliary’s reputation as a quality employer has been exemplified during the pandemic as it worked with officers and ratings to mitigate the many challenges faced by merchant navy seafarers.\nLike many vessel operators with large fleet and crew moving from multiple locations, there have been cases of COVID-19in RFA ranks during the pandemic. But unlike some commercial operators that cut sick and travel pay, including for mandatory self-isolation or quarantine, the RFA fully supported its seafarers.\n'I am incredibly grateful for the loyal support and the hard work of our workforce throughout the pandemic,' Cdre Eagles said.\n'We have managed to achieve all of our defence outputs throughout the duration of the pandemic and this has been due to the loyalty and incredibly hard work of our workforce, supported by their families and loved ones.'\nCdre Eagles is keen to express his gratitude for RFA officers and ratings for their flexibility in undertaking COVID-19 testing and isolation requirements. 'It has been first class and it's enabled us as a team to deliver all we've needed to during 2020 and 2021.'\nReimagining the future\nLinked to the expected fleet growth, long term career prospects at RFA will improve over the coming decade where previously stagnant fleet levels have created a ceiling to promotion.\n'We're seeing the changing demographic of our senior officers, where the right people with the right skills and drive can be in command or chief engineer in their late 30s,' Cdre Eagles said.\nThere are more female officers reaching the top ranks too. Nautilus member Susan Cloggie-Holden was named the first female RFA Captain in 2020 and the RFA is about to announce its first female chief engineer.\nThe RFA is actively looking at how it can improve the prospects for seafaring mothers to combine both their duties at home with a worthwhile, fulfilling seafaring career. It was a founding signatory to the Maritime UK Women in Maritime Charter in 2019.\nThe RFA is actively looking to be more inclusive across its fleet.\nThis year the RFA will refresh its Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) and its LGBTQ+ champions programmes and is also producing a transgender policy to ensure it is a fully diverse and inclusive employer. The organisation will also extend training to cover mental health awareness and safeguarding, and revitalise ethical behaviours training to ensure seafarers are aware of the impact of their actions on other people.\nDe loco smoko\nIn a major step change and after six months of consultation with unions, the RFA in line with Ministry of Defence policy, introduced a smoking cessation programme on June 1. Starting with education, small working groups and with the support of a business partner, a medical team and the safety team at RFA HQ, it is seeking to encourage behavioural change across its ranks.\n'This is a significant change to people's working habits and there will be difficult short-term changes required,' Cdre Eagles said. 'But the medical advice is clear: smoking has long term health implications.\n'This is a positive step forward as we as we strive for a healthier working environment.'\nNautilus members seeking help to quit smoking can contact liaison officer Marc Williams.\nMembers seeking independent advice on any matter pertaining to the RFA can contact their industrial official: email@example.com\nFor the first time in probably two working generations we have the opportunity to grow the size of the RFA, and in tandem with our well-established workforce recovery programme, increase the number of UK registered seafarers as we develop the Integrated Programme (IP) of the next 30 years"", 'Welding, Cutting and Brazing Safety Program\nThis welding, cutting and brazing program is designed to protect life and property from fire, atmospheric contaminants, and other associated hazards that may occur during these operations.

61	Can early diagnosis help maintain both work and physical abilities?	Yes. Early diagnosis of dementia allows individuals to continue working for a long time with proper workplace accommodations and HR support. Additionally, early physical therapy intervention can help diagnose potential issues before they become serious injuries, maintain mobility, and treat neurologic conditions, contributing to overall functional independence and quality of life.	['By Emily Ong, Dementia Advocate\nLiving with neurodegenerative disorders like dementia does not mean individuals suddenly lose their functional capacity and work skills upon diagnosis. Unless it is rapidly progressive dementia, many of us continue to live well for a very long time if we do our part to stay physically fit, mentally active, socially engaged, and eat well.\nHowever, there is one aspect of positive living that we need support and understanding from society. To us with young-onset dementia (YOD), receiving a “forced” retirement is the hardest blow.\nMany diagnosed with YOD have to quit their jobs because of their cognitive decline, particularly in their executive function skills. There will be certain aspects of the functional capacities, which are no longer able to function at an optimal level. Skills like planning, time management, being organised, and multitasking are commonly affected by cognitive decline. While it does impact an individual’s productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness as a worker, the skills and experiences that they’ve acquired over the years can compensate for functional deterioration.\nThe term “workability” refers to the relationship between an individual’s resources and job scope. According to the work ability model by the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, there are four interrelated tiers: with a base layer consisting of personal health and functional capacities; the next layer which is competence and skills; followed by the third layer which includes personal values, attitudes, and motivation; and the topmost layer is work, referring to work scope, work environment, organisation, and leadership.\nHence, it would be useful for any workplace to consider and decide the kind of work intervention needed to keep their employees living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or YOD. Beyond economic benefits, retaining the occupational role is vital to provide a sense of purpose in life and maintaining self-worth.\nFor this to work, the collaboration between the affected employee and the Human Resource Department is crucial. The employee has to feel safe enough to disclose the level of functional capacity without being discriminated against and judged.\nThe negative attitudes, which are often based on stereotypes and myths, include people with dementia who are unteachable and burdensome. Such perception can influence management decisions and implicates the employee’s situation.\nWith an inclusive work culture and willingness to support affected employees to maintain their workability, this is a feasible practice. It is also important for the government to formulate public health policies conducive to supporting those diagnosed with dementia at the workplace. This is especially necessary with the increasing number of cases of YOD over the years.\nThis commentary is in response to “Forum: Firms need to understand dementia better as the workforce ages” (The Straits Times, 19 January 2021) by Paul Heng, Management Committee Member at ADA.\nAbout Emily Ong:\nEmily was first diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders at the age of 49, and provisionally diagnosed with Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) when she was 51. Emily has been a participant and co-facilitator of the Voices for Hope programme under Alzheimer’s Disease Association, and passionately advocates for a dementia enabling environment.

Physical therapy is the field of medicine that is devoted to restoring and improving human movement. Physical therapists achieve correct posture and spinal alignment by reducing pain and using physical methods such as strength training, massage and using the body’s natural healing processes. Physical therapists are experts in movement, kinesiology (study of human movement) and functional independence. Physical therapists help people of all ages and skills to improve strength, restore mobility and reduce pain. Restoring mobility and pain-free movement is crucial to an individuals ability to participate and perform in recreational and work duties, as well as improving their quality of life and overall health. This leads to reduced risk of falls and reduced risk of stroke and heart attack1.\nIn many cases, physical therapy has been shown to be just as effective as surgery when treating a wide variety of conditions from low back pain, shoulder issues and knee arthritis2,3. How wonderful to be able to participate in several weeks of non-invasive therapy to get the same outcomes as an invasive, costly and risky surgery!\nUnfortunately, there are misconceptions about physical therapy that may discourage people from seeking the skilled guidance of a licensed therapist. Some misconceptions include: insurance coverage, physician involvement, preconceptions about pain, not understanding what physical therapists are capable of treating, clinical indications and therapists’ education.\nIn all 50 states of the U.S., a physical therapist can perform a physical therapy evaluation without a physician referral. By participating in a physical therapist evaluation, you will learn what physical limitations you have and how they relate to your pain or limited independence and how to correct them.\nPhysical therapy is typically a covered service by most insurance policies. For people that have Medicare, services are covered at 80% and the other 20% is covered by a supplemental policy if you have one. Other insurance policies may even cover physical therapy costs at 100% making it a very affordable alternative to costly surgeries3. Insurance companies recognize the significant value physical therapy holds in the medical field.\nPhysical therapy is not only for injuries or accidents. The skilled physical therapist is able to evaluate and diagnose potential issues before they lead to more serious injuries or falls. A physical therapist can improve the joint function in one joint to impact the functional performance of another. For example, if you are having pain in your back related to vertebral dysfunction, the therapist can improve the joint mechanics and muscle action of your low back, and further improve the joint mechanics of your hips and knees, reducing potential complications down the road. All treatments are specific to the individual needs and vary person to person with the ultimate goal of eliminating pain and restoring natural movement.\nPhysical therapist are capable of and license to treat numerous physical disabilities Including orthopedic conditions such as: pre- and post- joint surgery, chronic pain, knee injury including ACL and meniscus tear, joint sprain, arthritis, back pain related to disc herniation, vertebral fractures, spinal stenosis, osteoporosis, frozen shoulder, rotator cuff tear, hand injuries, bursitis, muscle strain, plantar fasciitis/foot pain and Neurologic conditions such as: stroke recovery, peripheral neuropathy, balance impairment, progressive neurologic conditions including Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, headaches, vertigo all utilizing our bodies own natural healing abilities. By incorporating state of the art treatment techniques including laser therapy and trigger point dry needling, manual hands on skills, instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization and private education/training so clients understand exactly what is occurring and how they can alleviate symptoms by themselves.\nA licensed physical therapist or physical therapist assistant can only deliver and provide physical therapy services. Physical therapists are highly educated Doctors of Physical Therapy that possess a thorough understanding of the human body’s anatomy, physiology, biomechanics and health conditions. All therapists participate in yearly continuing education to maintain their state license to practice. Many therapists hold board certifications for specific areas of medicine including: neurology, orthopedics, geriatrics, pediatrics, cardiovascular-pulmonary, sports enhancement, research and women’s health.\nPhysical therapy is not something that can be done on your own or by any other health/medical practitioner. You need the critical and trained eye of a licensed doctor of physical therapy in order to assess and determine appropriate diagnosis, limitations and treatments . So, if you have never sought the guidance and direction from a therapist, what is keeping you away?

62	duties guardian minor release signing Mississippi	A guardian's duties include assuming parental responsibilities for support, care, and education of a minor, but their legal authority has important limitations regarding release signing. In Mississippi, a guardian cannot sign away another adult's right to sue - as demonstrated in a court case where a guardian's signature on a release did not prevent the mother from filing a wrongful death lawsuit. This is because while guardians have legal control and responsibility of the minor, they do not acquire all legal interests that a parent has.

Those requirements are to research all the possible risks the student may face and to include those risks in the release.\nState: Mississippi: Court of Appeals of Mississippi\nPlaintiff: Deliah Colyer, as Natural Mother and Next Friend of Marshuan Braxton, Deceased, and on Behalf of all Wrongful Death Beneficiaries of Marshuan Braxton, Deceased\nDefendant: First United Methodist Church of New Albany and John Does 1-15\nPlaintiff Claims: negligence\nDefendant Defenses: no negligence and release\nHolding: for the plaintiff\nThis case concerns a young man who died during a mission trip to Costa Rica. A mission trip is where US citizens, generally go to a third world (or in their mind’s third-world country and perform public service. In this case, the mission was to fly to Costa Rica and construct a sanctuary in Villa Briceno.\nThe trip was led by the associate pastor of the defendant church. The trip had nine adults and six minors, including the deceased. There were also another four adults and one minor from another church on the trip.\nThe participants or their parents had to sign a “New Albany First United Methodist Church Youth Medical / Parent Consent form and a Parental Consent form. Braxton also signed a document entitled “Int. Missionary Profile and Release of Claim.”\nOn the way to the site after landing, the group stopped to pick up lunch. The group then proceeded to a beach to have lunch. The group split up into several smaller groups and went different directions along the beach. The deceased and another boy and two adults when to a rock formation and climbed it. A large wave crashed over them and swept the deceased off the rock into the ocean. Two people were able to swim back to the rock and eventually get out of the ocean.\nA lawsuit was filed by the deceased mother, who was not the guardian of the deceased. The trial court, in Mississippi called the circuit court, dismissed the case and the plaintiff’s filed this appeal.\nAnalysis: making sense of the law based on these facts.\nThe court reviewed what was required in Mississippi to prove a negligence claim. “The elements of a prima facie case of negligence are duty, breach, causation, and damages.”\nThe first issue was the duty owed by the church to the deceased. The defendants admitted that they owed a duty to the deceased; however, the defendant argued that duty was diminished due to the age of the deceased, 17. However, the court found under Mississippi law the age of the victim was not at issue. The duty was the same under the law to anyone who was not an adult. The issue was one for the jury to decide what constituted proper and adequate supervision over the deceased.\nThe court also gave credence to the idea that the church failed to supervise the deceased by not researching the ocean and rocks first.\nAdditionally, Colyer alleges other acts of negligence: (1) failure to research the dangers of the Pacific coast and (2) allowing the children, including Braxton, to go onto a dangerous rock structure on the coast of the Pacific Ocean without any knowledge of oceanic activities in Costa Rica.\nThe next issue was whether the documents signed by the deceased family were valid. The court determined the legal issue in a very scary way.\nThe deceased’s grandmother was his guardian and signed the documents. However, a guardian does acquire all the legal interests in a minor that a parent has. The guardian has legal control and responsibility of the minor but may not have any other valid interest. In this case, the mother still maintained a recognizable interest in the deceased, a consortium type of claim loss of love, future earnings in some states, etc. She is the plaintiff in the case, and thus the release was not written broadly enough, in fact, probably could not be written broadly enough, for the release to stop the mother’s lawsuit, when it was signed by the guardian. The guardian can sign for the minor but not the parents. One adult cannot sign away another adult’s right to sue.\nIt is undisputed that the parties in this appeal are not the same parties that executed the waivers. It appears that one of the waivers was signed by Howell, who was Braxton’s grandmother. She signed a “parental consent form,” but she is not a party to this action. Braxton, a seventeen-year-old minor at the time, appeared to have signed the release waiver.\nThe court then looked into this issue. First because the deceased was a minor, he could not, by law sign the contract (release).\nThe defendant argued that because the mother was a third party beneficiary of the contract to send the deceased on the trip, she was bound by the contract. However, the court referred to basic contract law that said there was no meeting of the minds. Because the mother did not sign the contract or was not mentioned in the contract she did not have the requirements necessary to be a party to the contract. Therefore, she was not bound by the contract.\nThe appellate court overruled the trial court find the release did not meet the necessary requirements to stop a lawsuit under Mississippi law.\nThere was a concurring opinion this decision. That means one of the judges agreed with the decision but wanted to emphasize some point of the law or agreed with the decision overall but for a different legal reasoning. The concurring decision put more emphasize the duties owed to the deceased.\nIn this case, a duty clearly arose from the relationship between Braxton, a seventeen-year-old minor, and Amanda, the associate pastor and leader of FUNA’s youth mission trip. At the very least, FUNA, by and through its employee, Amanda, bore a duty to use ordinary care to plan and supervise this international mission trip composed of church members to Costa Rica and its shores on the Pacific Ocean. As the facts of this case reflect, a duty also arose and existed to supervise Braxton on the rock formations of the Costa Rica Pacific coastline.\nConsequently, the concurring decision believed there was a real issue as to whether the church through its employee, failed to warn against the risk of the beaches and Pacific Ocean. Then the judge seemed to have piled on for failing to check US State Department for travel advisories.\n…but she admitted to failing to check with the United States State Department online travel advisory warnings, or any other travel advisories, as to any unsafe beach, tide, or surf conditions in Costa Rica.\n(Since when as the state department issued warnings about beaches, the ocean or surf?)\nIn planning and supervising this trip, a duty existed to warn of the hidden dangers and perils not in plain view that FUNA and its mission trip leader, Amanda, knew, or should have known, existed. Additionally, once the tide rose and the large waves knocked the adults down, Amanda bore a duty to supervise and warn Braxton of the dangerous conditions.\nThe concurring opinion then addressed the releases in the case. The courts’ reasoning on why the releases where void is because they contained no language warning of the risks of the trip, specifically the risk of the ocean.\nThe waivers contained no language regarding the liability or risks of recreational activities such as hiking, swimming, or rock climbing on Costa Rica’s beaches on the Pacific Ocean or the risks of the dangerous riptides and dangerous ocean surf.\nThis requirement is occurring more frequently lately. The courts want to see a list of the risks that can cause injury to the plaintiff in the release. That means there must be more than the legalese necessary for the release to be valid under state law, there must be a list of the risks to the plaintiff. More importantly the risks must include the risk that caused injury to the plaintiff.\nThe concurring opinion also found that the requirements for a release under Mississippi law had not been met.\nPublic policy prohibits the use of preinjury waivers of liability for personal injury due to future acts of a defendant’s own negligence. (waiver unenforceable where it did not express intent of student to accept any heightened exposure to injury caused by malfeasance of instructor’s failure to follow safety guidelines); For a waiver to be valid and enforceable, it must not be ambiguous, and it must be specific in wording as to the liability. Waivers will be strictly construed against the defendant. When a waiver contains ambiguous language, it cannot be construed as a waiver of liability for injuries that result from the negligence of the defendant.\nHere the lack of information in the release about the risks of the trip and the ocean would have made the release unenforceable according to the concurring judge.\nSo Now What?\nThe first issue of concern is the court gave the plaintiff’s a lot of room to bring in far-flung claims of negligence to the trial. Basically, if this stands, you will have to have gone to a site and researched the risks of the site and getting to and from a site before ever taking kids from Mississippi there.\nAlthough this is considered normal when in the outdoors, it has not been the standard of care for travel in communities, cities or normal life. Even though the defendant worked with a local missionary before the trip, the court thought that might not have been enough. The employee of the defendant in charge of the trip had not been to the site and examined it where the deceased died.\nThe release issue is next and creates a nightmare for recreation providers. If a minor is under the court-ordered control of a guardian, both the guardian and the minor’s parent, at least in Mississippi, must sign the release as both have an interest that can be used to sue for the minor’s injuries or as in this case, death.\nOverall, the appellant decision is scary in the burdens it places upon people organizing trips for minors, which leave the country or possibly even go next door. The entire trip must be researched in advance, the risks researched and examined, and those risks must be provided to the minors and their parents traveling on the trip, or included in the release.\nThe overview of the case sums the issue up. A hazardous condition was sitting on a rock near the ocean.\nIt was an error to grant appellee church summary judgment in a wrongful-death suit filed by the appellant, a deceased minor’s mother, because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the church adequately supervised the minor, whether the child should have been warned of a known hazardous condition, and whether the minor was negligently allowed to engage in dangerous activity….\nWhat is not brought up in this decision is whether or not the release, if valid, would have stopped the suit.\nIf you like this let your friends know or post it on FB, Twitter or LinkedIn\nCopyright 2016 Recreation Law (720) Edit Law\nFacebook Page: Outdoor Recreation & Adventure Travel Law\nMobile Site: http://m.recreation-law.com\nBy Recreation Law Recemail@example.comJames H.

63	As someone who designs secure authentication systems, I'm wondering how the interaction between MAC calculations and encryption affects system security when dealing with block ciphers, and what protective measures would you recommend implementing at different system levels?	In SSL 3.0, the MAC-then-Encrypt approach is used where the MAC (message authentication code) is calculated first, added to the data, and then the whole thing is encrypted with padding. With block ciphers, data must be padded to match the block size, and the last byte must contain the padding length. This creates a vulnerability since SSL doesn't fully verify padding bytes. To protect against such vulnerabilities, systems hardening should be implemented across multiple layers. This includes keeping security patches updated, monitoring security bulletins, installing firewalls, closing unnecessary ports like server ports, and disabling file sharing. The goal is to reduce the system's attack surface by eliminating potential attack vectors through a comprehensive security approach at the host, application, operating system, and user levels.	"['The POODLE attack (Padding Oracle on Downgraded Legacy Encryption) exploits a vulnerability in the SSL 3.0 protocol (CVE-2014-3566). This vulnerability lets an attacker eavesdrop on communication encrypted using SSLv3. The vulnerability is no longer present in the Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS), which is the successor to SSL (Secure Socket Layer).\nThe recent Acunetix 2020 Web Application Vulnerability Report shows that as many as 3.9% of web servers are still vulnerable to POODLE, which means they still support the SSL 3.0 protocol, despite the fact that the TLS protocol was introduced in 1999. Even more (over 30%) servers are vulnerable to the BEAST attack because they support TLS 1.0.\nWhy do web servers support old protocols? Perhaps the administrators of those servers wanted to make sure that users can access them using very old browsers. However, we suspect that it’s more likely that such servers use very old server software with very old configurations.\nWhat Can an Attacker Do with POODLE?\nThe POODLE vulnerability lets the attacker eavesdrop on encrypted communication. This means that the attacker can steal confidential data that is transmitted, for example, passwords or session cookies, and then impersonate the user. This can have very serious consequences, including losing control over the web application (for example, if the attacker impersonates an admin).\nThe attack is not very easy because it needs to be successful in three stages:\n- In the first stage, the attacker must perform a successful man-in-the-middle attack (MITM). The attacker can now listen to all communication between the client and the server as well as add to this communication (impersonate the client or the server). However, if this is a secure connection, communication is encrypted using SSL/TLS, so the attacker cannot understand what is being sent.\n- In the second stage, the attacker must convince the server to use the old SSL 3.0 protocol. The attacker can do this by dropping connections – after a number of such drop-outs, the server will try an older protocol, thinking that the client cannot use a newer protocol such as TLS 1.2. This is called a protocol downgrade attack or downgrade dance.\n- In the third stage, when the client and the server are communicating using SSL 3.0, the attacker can use the POODLE attack to decrypt selected parts of the communication and steal confidential information.\nHow Does POODLE Work?\nThe POODLE attack is possible due to several features of the SSL/TLS protocol. You can read more about how these protocols work in our article series on SSL/TLS. For now, all you need to know is that SSL/TLS lets the server and the browser use sets of different algorithms to encrypt communication – these are called cipher suites.\nThe POODLE vulnerability affects cipher suites that include symmetric encryption together with block ciphers, for example, AES or DES algorithms. In such cases, the client and the server first agree on a secret key using asymmetric encryption (a private key and a public key). Then, all communication is encrypted symmetrically using this key. In the case of block ciphers, data is encrypted in blocks of fixed length, for example, 8 bytes or 16 bytes.\nCipher suites that are vulnerable to POODLE also use cipher-block chaining (CBC mode). This means that the value of each block depends on the value of the previous block – it is calculated by using the logical operation XOR. Also, a random data block is added at the start – this is called an initialization vector. This is necessary so that every time data is encrypted, it looks different (and therefore the attacker cannot figure out the data based on similarities).\nWhat Is MAC-Then-Encrypt?\nTo understand POODLE, you must first understand MAC and MAC-then-Encrypt.\nThe SSL/TLS protocol not only guarantees that the data is confidential. It also guarantees that the data has not been tampered with. For example, you do not want someone to be able to inject their own account number when you try to transfer money between accounts in an online bank.\nTo guarantee that the data is not corrupt, every encrypted fragment of data has a checksum – a MAC (message authentication code). The MAC can only be calculated if you have the encryption key. If the MAC is wrong, it means that someone has tampered with the message.\nThe SSL 3.0 protocol uses the MAC-then-Encrypt approach. This means that first, the algorithm calculates the MAC value, then it adds that MAC value at the end of the data, and then it encrypts the whole thing, including padding.\nWhat Is Padding?\nA block cipher needs all data to be a multiple of the block size. For example, if the block size is 8, data must have 64, 80, or 336 bytes (a multiple of 8). If it is not a multiple of 8, it needs to be padded with unimportant data just to reach the right length.\nMost web server implementations use the following padding technique:\n- The last byte of the last block must always contain the padding length. That value represents the number of previous bytes that are padded. For example, if 4 bytes are padded, the value of the block is:\nyyrepresents padding). This is an SSL requirement.\n- In most implementations, the values of all padding bytes are the same as the length value. For example, if 4 out of 8 bytes are padded, the value of the block is:\n- If the length of the data is a multiple of the block size, for example, 336, there must be an extra block added with only padding:\n07-07-07-07-07-07-07-07. This is necessary because if the last byte did not represent padding, the algorithm cannot recognize padding from real data.\nNote that SSL does not check padding bytes (except the padding length), so as long as the last byte is between\n07, the block will be accepted. For example, an\nxx-xx-xx-12-34-56-78-04 block will be accepted.\nWhat Is a Padding Oracle?\nThe padding oracle is a situation when the attacker knows or can guess why the data that they sent to the server is rejected: whether it is because the padding was incorrect or whether the MAC was wrong.\nImagine the following situation:\n- The attacker receives data from the browser and knows that this data contains a password. The attacker knows that this is an HTTP POST request and knows exactly where the password is located in this request.\n- The attacker modifies the encrypted data and sends it to the server.\n- The server responds to the attacker saying that the data is wrong. However, it can respond with two types of errors: it may tell the attacker that the padding was wrong or that the MAC was wrong. This makes the POODLE attack possible.\nPadding oracles are used for other attacks, too. Some protocols don’t respond directly but may, for example, first check the padding and only later check the MAC. In those cases, if the attacker gets a quick response, it’s a padding error, but if the response takes a bit longer, it’s a MAC error.\nThe Anatomy of the POODLE Attack\nTo perform a typical POODLE attack and steal a web session cookie, the attacker does the following:\n- The attacker knows which blocks of data contain the session cookie. For example, the data may have 10 blocks and the attacker knows that the third and fourth blocks contain the session cookie value.\n- The attacker copies the entire third block to the last block and sends it to the server many times, changing something in the connection URL every time so that the MAC is different.\n- After at most 256 times, the message will be accepted. This means that the last byte of the third block, after decryption, will be the number\n07, which signifies correct padding.\n- Now the attacker knows the decrypted last byte and they can combine it with previous blocks using XOR operations to obtain the real last byte of the third block.\n- The attacker can then make the connection URL one byte longer and repeat the steps above to get the next piece of the cookie. And then repeat again for the fourth block of data.\n- If the cookie length is 16, the attacker will know the cookie after no more than 4096 requests, which takes at most a few minutes.\nHow to Know if Your Web Server Is Vulnerable to POODLE\nTo know if your web server is vulnerable to POODLE, you only need to know if it supports SSL 3.0. You can find out if your web server supports SSL 3.0 using Acunetix. You can also do it manually, but with Acunetix you can also find web vulnerabilities and much more.\nThere were also old implementations of the TLS protocol that were vulnerable to POODLE. However, all modern TLS implementations are safe.\nNote that while POODLE is a network vulnerability, it also affects web servers and web browsers.\nHow to Fix the POODLE Vulnerability\nTo protect your server against POODLE and BEAST, configure it to support only TLS 1.2 and no older protocols. All older SSL and TLS versions are now officially deprecated and all modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer support TLS 1.2.\nApache Web Server\nEdit the SSLProtocol directive in the ssl.conf file, which is usually located in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf. For example, if you have:\nchange it to:\nThen, restart httpd.\nEdit the ssl_protocols directive in the nginx.conf file. For example, if you have:\nssl_protocols SSLv3 TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;\nchange it to:\nThen, restart nginx.\nTo disable TLS 1.0 in Microsoft IIS, you must edit the registry settings in Microsoft Windows.\n- Open the registry editor\n- Find the key HKLM SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.0\\Server\n- Change the DWORD value of the Enabled entry to 0.\n- Create a DisabledByDefault entry and change the DWORD value to 1.\nRepeat the above steps for all versions of SSL and for TLS 1.1.\nGet the latest content on web security\nin your inbox each week.', ""Top best answers to the question «What is hardening in network security»\nSystems hardening is a collection of tools, techniques, and best practices to reduce vulnerability in technology applications, systems, infrastructure, firmware, and other areas.

64	What different types of basic data can you work with in Six Sigma, and what main tools are available to analyze this information?	In Six Sigma, you can work with discrete data (which includes nominal data like names or colors, ordinal data that can be ranked, and binary data like yes/no) and continuous data (like measurements of time, weight, or temperature). To analyze this information, Six Sigma provides various tools including Five Whys for determining problem causes, 5S for workplace improvement, Control Charts for monitoring stability, Measurement System Analysis (MSA) for measuring precision, and RACI charts for assigning roles and responsibilities.	['The Six Sigma approach is a data-driven approach to problem-solving. It stands to reason that the people who study in a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt course will be confronted with different data types in Six Sigma measure phase. Even some reputable free Six Sigma Green Belt Certification training will cover different types of data when discussing the Six Sigma Measure phase of the DMAIC process. Understanding the different data types of Six Sigma measure phase is critical to the successful execution of the Six Sigma Measure phase as it affects how data will be measured, collected, analyzed and interpreted.\nUnderstanding different data types of Six Sigma Measure Phase\nBefore we move towards the concept of types of data of Six Sigma measure phase, let’s first look at what “data” means. Data refers to organized or unorganized information. It can be numbers, words, measurements, observations or even just descriptions of things.\nTypes of data affects the execution of Six Sigma Measure phase\nIn the Six Sigma measure phase of the DMAIC process, before doing actual data collection, the project team should consider some statistical techniques including types of data and sampling. This is because these statistical techniques and the types of data that will be collected will affect how the team goes about collecting the data. The “X” or “Y” data in Six Sigma methodology can be either continuous data or discrete data. In other words, continuous and discrete are two different data types often used in Six Sigma measure phase.\nUnderstanding the difference between continuous and discrete data is important because the difference influences how Six Sigma project teams define their measures, how they collect their data, and what they can learn from it. The difference also affects the sampling of data and how they will analyze it too. So we may say that it affects the whole Six Sigma measure phase.\nThe 1st Data Type of Six Sigma Measure Phase: Discrete Data\nDiscrete numeric data of Six Sigma Measure Phase\nLet’s take a closer look at what discrete data means for Six Sigma measure phase. Discrete data is also known as attribute data. Discrete numeric data is countable in the sense that you can count how many of something there are. You can count items with a specific characteristic, or you can count the number of occurrences of an event or incident (Count Data). Discrete numeric data is measured by the presence or absence of a particular characteristic of each device that is being tested during Six Sigma measure phase.\nExamples of discrete numeric data for Six Sigma measure phase would be:\n- Number of people who pass a test\n- Count of errors or number of errors on a bill\n- Software errors in a software program\n- Number of defects in a sample\n- Number of days in a week\n- Number of dimples on a golf ball\n- Number of people in a stadium or arena\n- Number of parts damaged in shipment\n- Number of hours in a day\nDiscrete attribute data of Six Sigma Measure Phase\nLet us now study what discrete attribute data means for Six Sigma measure phase. Discrete attribute data is qualitative in nature. Think of attributes as a way of categorizing or bucketing things. Let take a simple example. Animals could be a Cat, Dog, Rabbit or a Gerbil. A product ordered could be a CD, MP3 file or DVD. Not only can you count how many items have a certain attribute but you can also count how many items do not have a certain attribute. This can also be converted into a percentage. Now, let us study the 3 types of Discrete Attribute Data of Six Sigma measure phase.\nDiscrete ordinal data\nThe first type is discrete ordinal data. A set of data is said to be ordinal if the values/observations belonging to it can be ranked or put in order or have a rating scale attached. Note that ordinal data can be counted and set in order but it cannot be measured. For example, “The third tallest person in the class” (We don’t know how tall, only that there are two others taller than this person).\nLet’s have a look at another example. Suppose a group of people was asked to taste varieties of biscuits and classify each biscuit on a rating scale of 1 to 5. The rating scale of 1 represents “Strongly Dislike,” the scale of 2 represents “Dislike,” The scale of 3 represents “Neutral,” the scale of 4 represents “Like, ” and the rating of 5 represents “Strongly Like.” In this case, a rating of 5 indicates more liking or enjoyment than the rating of 4. Such data are ordinal.\nDiscrete nominal data\nThe second type is discrete nominal Data. This type of data is descriptive, and not numeric, with more than two categories, for example; names, phone numbers, colors, type of car, capital cities and states. In a more general form, the data, assigned with labels or names, are considered as the data in nominal scale. Since each label or name indicates a separate category of the data, this data is also called ‘Categorical Data.’\nNominal data can also be equated to discrete values, for example, to distinguish among people such as sales representatives, marketing representatives, etc. However, to maintain some anonymity, they could be coded and referred to a discrete number whereby Sally = 1, John = 2, Michael = 3, and Ricky = 4. Moreover, the data, related to gender, race, religious affiliation, political affiliation, etc., are also nominal data.\nDiscrete binary data\nThe third type is discrete binary data. It is a qualitative or categorical type of data made up of two classifications. For example, Yes/No, Pass/Fail, On/Off, Male/Female, Good/Bad, Agree/Disagree, etc.\nThe 2nd Data Type of Six Sigma Measure Phase: Continuous Data\nContinuous data of Six Sigma measure phase is also known as variable data. Common continuous measures are time, money and any physical measurement such as weight, height, length or temperature. Continuous Data can take on any value on a continuous scale such as temperature, distance, cycle time, profit. This is a type of data that is usually associated with some sort of physical measurement. Continuous data or measures are only those things that can be measured on an infinitely divisible continuum or scale.\nThe examples for continıus data of Six Sigma measure phase are as follows:\n- Time (Hours, Minutes and Seconds)\n- Height (Feet, Inches, Fractions of an inch and so on)\n- Sound Level (Decibels)\n- Temperature (Degrees Celcius and Fahrenheit)\n- Electrical resistance (Ohms)\n- Money (Dollars, Yens, Euros, and fractions thereof)\nHow to Distinguish The Different Data Types of Six Sigma Measure Phase?\nHave a look at the figure below. This chart on data types of Six Sigma measure phase is a kind of summarized chart on discrete and continuous types of data. Please remember a fundamental rule about types of data here. Discrete data is all about counting while continuous data is all about measurements.\nLet’s see how we are supposed to read this table. Look at the first column titled ‘Measurement.’ In the first row, the objective is to measure the time of the day. The units of measurement are hours, minutes and seconds. It is a piece of continuous data. Moving on in the same row, ordinal data for measuring the time of the day has been noted as 1, 2, and 3 without indicating any order among them. We can count 1, 2, 3 as 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, etc. It is a piece of discrete ordinal data. Nominal data is not applicable to be measured against the time of the day. In the case of binary data, the time of the day can be measured as am/pm only. The time during the day can be expressed either as am or pm. It’s simply a close-ended answer.\nA quick and easy way to distinguish data types of Six Sigma Measure Phase\nNow, to understand the crux of data types of Six Sigma measure phase here is a quick test for distinguishing between discrete and continuous measures. Please have a look at the next table in the figure above. Think about the “Unit of Measure,” or the thing being measured and then ask yourself if “half of that thing” makes sense. If the answer is yes, then the measure is “Continuous.” If the answer is No, then we have a “Discrete” measure.\nKnowledge of different data types of Six Simga measure phase is essential for the Six Sigma practitioner. The data types that he or she will be confronted with during the Six Sigma measure phase of a project will affect how the data is collected, analyzed and interpreted. Before you can collect data, you must first understand types of data and how it applied to your project during Six Sigma measure phase. Now that you know how to distinguish between the different types of data, you are ready to collect data for your project in Six Sigma measure phase.', 'Six Sigma is a method of project management and is sometimes considered an alternative to project management.\nIt is a set of organisational tools that help improve the business processes. Six sigma aims to reduce the variations in process and therefore increase overall performance.\nIt is given credit for reducing defective products and services, improving profits and employee morale and therefore positively impacting the customer experience.\nIf a process is said to have six sigma qualities, then this means that the process is well controlled, and the errors are well within tolerance.\nThere are many definitions of six sigma, but there is a common thread of organisation within statistical tolerance. It requires projects to have clear outcomes that are closely aligned to a business strategy, all of which are measurable.\nThe difference in opinion comes from whether Six Sigma is a philosophy, a set of tools and methodology or a set of metrics. The question is whether it matters and whether it is something of all these things.\nSix Sigma is a philosophy because it determines that processes can be measured and that if you work on input, then you can control outputs. It is a set of qualitative and quantitative techniques which include statistical process control, control charts, failure mode and effect analysis and process mapping.\nIt can be considered a methodology because there are steps to follow: define, measure, analyse, improve and control. Finally, it is a set of performance metrics that allow you to account for shifts in process quality.\nAs well as Six Sigma there is Lean Six Sigma.\nThis is a method that requires the team to collaborate in efforts to improve performance by removing waste and reducing variation in quality. It is still a statistical process that gives quantitative analysis to improvements, rather than applying guesswork.\nSix Sigma Process\nThe process is DMAIC. This is a step by step approach to completing a project. These steps include:\nDefine the nature of the problem. This means writing such documents as a problem statement, a goal statement, developing a process map, define the requirements and more. The whole point is to create a project charter – which is a high-level map of the process.\nThis is the step where you determine how the process performs currently. You are asking the question: what is the size of the problem we face? Measurement is crucial for creating a baseline and using the data to inform the project charter with measurable outcomes.\nThis is where you try to establish the cause of a problem and using the conclusions from this to discern potential solutions. Part of this will be collecting data that will help you verify the origins of the problem and part of it will be brainstorming and applying five whys to get to the bottom of an issue before implementing a solution.\nThis is where the team attempt to mitigate the cause of the problem and improve the outcomes of the project. This might involve brainstorming potential solutions to the problem, selecting a practical solution, developing an enhanced map of the process – or maps, selecting the best solution and the means of measuring the improvement.\nThe point here is to assess how to sustain the improvement. This means once the fixes and improvements are in place how can the gains be managed and maintained. The focus is on creating a monitoring plan to continue measuring the improvements to the process. The control chart can also iterate – in other words; it can become part of a further analysis process to show how it can be further improved and adapted.\nSix Sigma Tools\nThere are a series of tools that are part of the Six Sigma methodology. These charts and processes are designed to standardise the workings of a team and therefore facilitate management of a project.\nThe tools that form part of the Six Sigma approach include:\nThis is a simple tool used during the analyse phase of the development process for a project. The point of five whys is to determine the cause of a problem – using the strategy employed by all toddlers. You ask why then you ask why again and then again and again and again. By repeatedly asking why you peel away the layers of the problem until you can reasonably believe you are at the determining features of an issue. This is one of the simplest six sigma tools – and doesn’t involve statistical analysis.\nThe 5 S that the title of this tool refers to is Japanese – it relates to seiri (sort), seiton (systemize), seiso (sweep), seiketsu (standardise), shitsuke (self-discipline).\nIt is a philosophy of how a workplace can engage in continuous improvement. It is also sometimes referred to as the plan, do, check, act approach. As you can imagine, this tool is a lot simpler to envision that it is to apply. It can require a complete reorganisation of the way a company works.\nThe first reason to create a control chart is the obvious one – to monitor stability and control of a project. The better idea for generating a control chart is to produce a document that helps you analyse the project and the way the project should move forward. The control chart is simple – you record measurements of production or service and applies tolerances for variability.\nThere are four states: ideal, threshold, brink and chaos. The perfect state is 100% control and zero nonconformity. It obvious goes downhill from there. It is obviously a lot more statistical than this… with maths applied to discern the level of control and variation – however, the principle is this simple.\nThe point is that you can catch processes before they hit chaos. However, it is also a great way of getting an overview of your team and the working context – which with suitable reflection can help you improve the ways that you work.\nThis is a statistical tool used to measure precision. It is an experimental method to work out how much variation there can be within measurements. It gives a sense of the overall variability. The five parameters used to investigate MSA include bias, linearity, stability, repeatability and reproducibility.\nThis is a way of assigning roles and responsibilities. RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted and Informed. Those who are deemed to be responsible are those actively participating in the process. People who are considered to be accountable are those who are ultimately accountable for the results.\nPeople who are consulted are those who have an expertise or can be asked to contribute to a specific decision. The people who are informed are those who receive details of the project but are not expected to offer any efforts.\nThe roles and responsibilities can be designated to different group members at different parts of the process – however, generally, the RACI is published at the start of the project.\nAnd many more\nThe reason that Six Sigma is a tool for project management rather than a methodology, in some people’s minds, is that it is made up of a series of tools that can be used to make a project more efficient.\nThe tools mentioned here are a mere tip of the iceberg – there is a serious amount to learn and apply – and some would suggest a best-fit approach to your company or project.\nSix Sigma In a Nutshell\nSix Sigma has been proven to improve sales and improve customer value – for instance, GE claimed that an $8 billion saving was thanks to a three-year implementation of the methodology.\nIf appropriately implemented then it is said to improve employee satisfaction, as there is an improvement in communication and teamwork. With enhanced job satisfaction comes higher productivity and therefore increased profit.\nOn the downside, Six Sigma is complicated in its pure form.\nIt requires a significant commitment to the gathering and analysis of data – which can be confusing and time-consuming.\nFor smaller companies, Six Sigma in its pure form may be too expensive to apply – as it would require employing specialist data collectors and analysis – and a business intelligence team is for a larger company.\nAlso, Six Sigma requires complete participation and buy-in – the point is consistency and tightly defined measurements of success. Without the buy-in of the whole company – and in some ways a commitment to a new philosophy of working – then this is not going to work.\nSome of the principles and tools of Six Sigma can be cherry-picked to improve project management. You do not need to fully immerse yourself in the data analysis and statistical variances of pure Six Sigma.\nThere is the option to take the tools and processes and use these to improve project management approaches in general.\nSix Sigma in project management itself is no different to other project management steps – therefore the tools at each stage could be used in other models.\nRead more about The Top Project Management Methodologies.']	['<urn:uuid:1d32ba5c-c409-4700-8124-8f355113a8e2>', '<urn:uuid:387dc0bf-64e7-47c0-a16e-5c630e770ff6>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	23	78	3013
65	What role do pressure and stress play in cattle handling?	In handling, pressure should be applied like a dimmer switch rather than all-or-nothing, using the lowest necessary pressure to move cattle. When pressure is released entirely, control is lost. Stress from adverse handling can elevate cortisol levels during the 'fight or flight' response, which interferes with normal immune system function. This is particularly important during vaccination periods, as physiological stress can impact the effectiveness of vaccines and the animal's immune response. Good working facilities that allow quiet and efficient processing help reduce such stress.	['by Sally Colby\nThere are some significant differences in the ways dairy and beef animals are handled; one is how they’re handled for the first few months of their lives. Depending on the time of year, beef calves are born on pasture or in a dedicated calving area. Other than receiving an ear tag and a brief health check at birth, most beef calves aren’t handled regularly until they’re weaned.\nIn contrast, dairy calves are handled as individuals from the time they’re born and quickly learn that humans bring food. On many dairy farms, dairy heifers’ first experience living in and being handled as a group occurs after weaning. As heifers grow, approach breeding age and eventually join the herd, they may be difficult to work with because they’re still accustomed to moving toward the handler.\nDr. Adam Kauf said cows have thinking and communication skills, but unless humans pay attention, it’s a one-way street. Kauf, who is a member of the Livestock Trust Institute and a certified FARM Program Evaluator, recently worked with dairy farmers in an on-farm animal handling training session.\nThe FARM (Farmers Assuring Responsible Management) program for dairy farms requires appropriate care for animals of all ages, clean housing, recordkeeping on individual animals, biosecurity and hands-on training in animal care and handling for employees. Dairy cattle are handled frequently throughout their lives, so good animal handling practices that begin with calves will benefit the animal (and those handling her) for her entire life.\nAs Kauf and a group of dairy farmers observed a group of recently weaned heifer calves, he noted that he could see what the animals were doing in response to his actions and the actions of others in the group. “We can improve their quality of life and our quality of life working with them by what we observe and how we handle that,” he said.\nKauf pointed out the fact that a cow can be looking in front of her and behind her at the same time. “Our eyes are in front, they focus together to look at something,” he said, explaining how a cow can look in front of her while paying attention to something behind her. “It’s something we can’t do, but they can. Her right ear is back, so while she’s looking ahead, she’s also looking back. We can take advantage of that to move her.”\nRather than moving toward a group of cattle and yelling to make them move, Kauf said a far more effective way to move a group is to simply walk up slowly behind them. Moving slowly and calmly from side to side in a zig-zag pattern will encourage cattle to move forward.\nPressure and release also plays a role in moving dairy cattle, but Kauf encouraged farmers to think of pressure as a dimmer switch that can be turned up and down rather than “all or nothing” action. “Once you’ve released, you’ve lost all control,” he said. “Stay on the lowest end necessary to do what you need to do.”\nKauf noted a safety issue that can arise when working with cattle, especially if the cattle aren’t accustomed to being handled quietly. If the person moving animals has their hands in pockets, not only can tripping become a more serious hazard, it takes longer for the handler to remove his hands from his pockets if he needs his hands to calmly discourage forward movement.\nLike humans, animals learn from every interaction, whether it’s positive or negative. “We want them to learn to be comfortable facing away from us because that’s what they have to do the rest of their lives,” said Kauf. “Milking, breeding, whatever we do – we want them to stand away and stand quietly.”\nKauf said every handler has an impact. “Anyone who steps into the barn, for good or for bad, is a trainer,” he said. “If it’s a bad experience, you’re training animals to do something wrong. Consistency is key – everyone on the farm has to be handling animals the same way.”\nTraining heifers to move away pays off for every other aspect of the animals’ lives. Kauf said during the first 60 days of a calf’s life, humans are teaching calves to come toward them, but for the rest of the heifer’s life, they need to move away from humans and be comfortable doing it.\nThe goal in teaching animals how to move away is using a zig-zag pattern, moving slowly in and out of the animals’ blind spots. Kauf explained that in moving cattle, successful handlers use negative reinforcement. “We step into them and get them to do what we want them to do,” he said, “then as soon as they do, we back off and walk away. Removing the pressure is the negative reinforcement. They learn that if a person steps in toward them and [the animals] move away, the person will step away and release the pressure.”\nRegarding weaned heifers Kauf said they can also learn that it’s okay to be separated from the group and held calmly in a corner, away from herd mates. He encourages dairy farmers to spend 15 minutes working with young animals in a group – moving them to one end of the pen, holding them there, then moving appropriately among the animals to move them to the other end. “Move them in group pens once or twice,” he said, adding that holding the group is important. “And once they turn away, you back off to reduce pressure.” Young heifers will retain such a lesson, and months later, when it’s time for breeding, a brief refresher of just a few minutes of moving a group quietly will prove they remembered.\n“Heifers learn from everything you do with them – keep that in mind,” said Kauf. “Over time, you’ll find moving animals around the farm is going to be a lot easier.”', 'Pre-Weaning Vaccination of\nG.

The calf’s passive immunity gained from\nthe maternal antibodies begins to wane around the age of five\nto six months. In a healthy closed herd on the range, the\ncalf’s exposure to the BRD organisms will be minimal and\nthere will be little opportunity for the calf’s immune\nsystem to develop an active or acquired long lasting immunity.\nThe result is an increased disease susceptibility (morbidity)\nand mortality in the feedlot.\nparticular concern is the wide spread exposure to the BVDV.\nProtection of the developing fetus is not consistently\nobtained by regular vaccination of the mother cow.

The duration of active immunity stimulated by\nvaccination at branding may also be short-lived due to the\ninterference by the maternal antibodies.

66	how prevent student suspension instead	There are several proactive approaches to prevent student suspension, including: educating social-emotional skills to prevent violent or aggressive behavior, hiring school psychologists to provide counseling to students and families, implementing schoolwide positive behavioral intervention and support programs (PBIS), and working directly with families to support healthy parent-child relationships. Additionally, reactive approaches include restorative justice practices, peer mediators, in-school-suspension, and partnerships with alternative schools.	['STRATEGY: Ensure school-level expulsion and suspension practices limit negative effects of lost instructional time.\nStudent expulsion and suspension rarely achieve their stated ends, beyond removing students who might otherwise have been disruptive to classes. These disciplinary policies result in significantly lost instructional time and often exacerbate racial inequity by targeting students of color. What students often “learn” from out of school suspension is that they are unwanted, incapable of learning or behaving, and that poor behavior is a way to escape their problems at school.\nStudents who are suspended or expelled are more likely to repeat grades, struggle with social interactions, and ultimately drop out. Moreover, schools with high suspension rates tend to score lower on measures of school culture. In other words, schools that routinely use suspension and expulsion as disciplinary measures fail to serve both the students who are disciplined and the students who remain.\nAlternatives to expulsion and suspension focus improving or correcting student behavior without limiting access to learning opportunities. They include both proactive approaches geared toward preventing incidents that might result in a suspension or expulsion, and reactive approaches that deal with incidents through less exclusionary means.\nCommon proactive approaches\n- Educate social-emotional skills to students to prevent or manage violent or aggressive behavior\n- Hire a school psychologist to provide direct counseling to students and families\n- Implement a schoolwide positive behavioral intervention and support program (PBIS)\n- Work directly with families to support healthy parent-child relationships\nCommon reactive approaches\n- Implement restorative justice, (i.e., a set of practices that address incidents through discussion with the student and natural consequences that repair harm)\n- Train and utilize peer mediators (i.e., students who can help diffuse conflicts when they arise)\n- Use in-school-suspension to remove disruptive students from classes, provide them with schoolwork, and keep them in an educational setting\n- Partner with alternative schools so that if a student must be expelled, they are transferred to a school that has specialized supports to meet the student’s needs\nFirst Steps to Consider\n- Examine suspension and expulsion data carefully, looking for patterns that may suggest solutions. For example, are the same students being suspended regularly? Are students frequently suspended for the same infractions? Do infractions occur at specific times or in certain places or classrooms?\n- Look for bias in suspension and expulsion data. Research shows that black and Hispanic students commit infractions at similar rates as white students, but they are suspended at much higher rates. Eliminating this bias can significantly lower suspension rates.\n- Commit resources to at least one proactive and one reactive approach to lowering suspension and expulsion rates. These strategies require funding, whether it be to provide professional development for school staff, hire new staff, or designate staff time for specific duties such as monitoring in-school suspension.\n- Learn about alternative policies and practices. There are a variety of different options, not all of which are suited to specific school situations. Choosing the right one(s) to implement is critical. Seeing these practices in action in other schools is highly recommended.\nComplexities & Pitfalls\nStudents are generally suspended or expelled both as a punishment to the student and to remove dangers or disruptions to other students. School leaders need to balance the needs of the individual student who has committed an infraction with the rights of other students and their teachers to a safe and productive learning environment. This is a tricky balance but one that is generally best served by implementing alternative approaches to suspension and expulsion.\nAs described above, suspension and expulsion have become sources of racial inequity in many schools and can have consequences that extend well beyond the education system. Students who are suspended or expelled are more likely to end up in the juvenile justice system, a situation known as the “school-to-prison pipeline.” Suspensions and expulsions also involve significant legal ramifications, especially for students with individual education plans or 504 plans.\nAlternatives to suspension and expulsion are designed to address common pitfalls in student discipline policies, including\n- confusing students’ emotional issues and challenges with self-control issues;\n- using one-size-fits all discipline policies (i.e., zero-tolerance) that treat all infractions the same, regardless of circumstances;\n- using exclusively (or primarily) reactive approaches to discipline; and\n- not addressing the root causes of student misbehavior.\nThe recommended approaches described above can come with pitfalls of their own as well. For example:\n- PBIS programs rely upon systems of rewards and punishments. These extrinsic motivators may not work for all students, and often they do not address the root causes of student misbehavior.\n- Restorative justice strategies must include more than the discussion component of the technique. If students are not required to make adequate repairs to the school or classroom community, they are unlikely to change their behavior.\n- What are root causes of students’ behavioral issues and how can they be uncovered?\n- What types of training do staff members, including teachers, administrators, counselors, etc., need to support student behavior better?\n- What proactive approaches to student behavior does the school use?\n- How will students who do not present behavior challenges be affected if disruptive students are kept in the building?']	['<urn:uuid:c1de7ed9-c63a-42ea-a367-6c7ffc1a20b0>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	5	63	865
67	california aquifer solutions earthquake connection	California's approach to aquifer management and its connection to earthquakes reveals an complex relationship. While water districts are implementing positive solutions like water budgets, trading programs, and groundwater banking to achieve sustainability, these groundwater management practices are inadvertently affecting seismic activity. The removal of groundwater causes the earth's crust to rise slightly when the weight of water is removed, creating stress changes in underground rocks that can trigger fault activity. This is particularly concerning along the San Andreas Fault, where the ongoing depletion of groundwater (approximately 40 cubic miles over 150 years) could potentially trigger larger earthquakes.	"['A Bottom-Up Approach to Groundwater Sustainability\nCalifornia’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) requires communities with ongoing groundwater deficits to bring their aquifers into balance in the coming years. This will be a difficult and complex process, but it’s also an opportunity to devise workable solutions at the community level. We talked to Eric Averett of the Rosedale–Rio Bravo Water Storage District about groundwater management innovations being tried in his Kern County district and lessons learned that might have wider application.\nPPIC: What are the priority areas for addressing groundwater sustainability in your district?\nEric Averett: The most challenging area is managing and mitigating impacts associated with demand reduction. Rather than mandating that individual landowners reduce demand, our district has pursued a path that we think gives individuals greater flexibility. The idea is that every acre will be assigned a water budget based on what the district can provide or considers sustainable. If a landowner uses more than that amount, it triggers a water charge. The district will use those funds to develop water supply programs or purchase land from willing sellers to retire it from production. Either way, this system doesn’t take anything away from landowners’ ability to manage their own water, it just gives them more options.\nAnother important area we’re looking at is water trading within our district’s boundaries. We’ve implemented a pilot study that empowers landowners to act as buyers or sellers in managing their water resources. We think water trading will be an essential tool to getting aquifers into balance and maximizing the value of the resource. For example, during a drought, a small grower with row crops may find greater value in fallowing a field and selling the water. At the same time, a grower who may be short of water and facing the loss of a permanent crop may enter the market as a buyer. If we don’t find a way to create these buy/sell opportunities, we strand the asset.\nA third area we’re working on is creating individual groundwater bank accounts for landowners. We have a number of landowners who’ve committed to make their land available for recharge in exchange for a portion of the recharged water being credited to their account. Alternatively, some landowners have acquired a source of water and asked the district to use it for recharge on their behalf. Both types of programs were tested successfully in 2017, and we look forward to expanding the concept. Ultimately, we’re looking at ways the district can assist landowners in becoming sustainable and mitigating SGMA impacts.\nPPIC: How are you handling the issue of dry wells?\nEA: During the most recent drought, we experienced a number of wells that went dry. Kern County’s groundwater levels can be very dynamic, in part because of the groundwater banking projects within the region. These projects pump out large volumes of water during droughts, causing the water table to drop a lot and fairly quickly. We’ve developed a unique mitigation program in partnership with the banking projects. We utilize a groundwater model to evaluate the well in question. If it’s determined that the well’s failure was due to water level impacts from the banking projects, we mitigate the impacts. Within 24 hours of the well going dry they’re connected into a temporary water supply. To date, we’ve spent more than $1 million replacing and repairing wells, or connecting people with dry wells to local service providers. The proof of success is that not one landowner has pursued legal remedies, and all have been satisfied with the results. We think it’s a good template for others to try and may be a model going into the groundwater sustainability planning process.\nPPIC: What’s the big lesson from your district’s efforts?\nEA In all of these areas, our goal is to have the district be a resource for sustainability, not a regulator. Each landowner is unique: some have thousands of acres, and the impacts on them may not be as great as for someone with a small parcel. A lot of smaller landowners may be unable to manage the fixed costs that will arise from implementing SGMA. We wanted to address the diversity in our district and not disadvantage any one user.\nWe’re emphasizing approaches that let growers decide what’s best for them—whether it’s helping them put unused water into a market or compensating them for using their land for recharge. Everyone in the district will have to live with the water budget we come up with, but we want to provide as many tools and options to get to sustainability as we can.\nRead “The State of Groundwater Recharge in the San Joaquin Valley” (PPIC Blog)\nRead “Groundwater in California” (PPIC fact sheet)\nRead the report Water Stress and a Changing San Joaquin Valley', '""Depletion Of California’s Groundwater Is Triggering Earthquakes, Study Finds""\nCREDIT: AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez\nCalifornia’s record-breaking drought is helping spark wildfires and drying up farmland, but it appears to be having another unforeseen consequence: increasing the state’s chance of earthquakes.\nA study published in the journal Nature on Wednesday found that the depletion of groundwater in California’s San Joaquin Valley is putting pressure on the San Andreas Fault, which could be increasing the risk of earthquakes in the region. Colin Amos, Assistant Professor at Western Washington University and lead author of the study, said he was “absolutely” surprised by the results of the study — the researchers hadn’t started out looking into whether groundwater removal affected earthquake activity, but when they looked at the GPS data for the region, they noticed tectonic activity was clustered around the region where groundwater was being lost.\n“The upward portion of the earth behaves elastically — if you push on it and remove that force, it snaps back,” Amos said. He said that the the rocks underneath California are loaded by the weight of groundwater, and if that groundwater is removed, the rocks rise slightly. Because there are faults in those rocks, the faults experience a stress change while the rocks shift upwards. Amos and his team hypothesize that this change in stress could be responsible for changes in earthquake activity in the region.\nAmos said linking earthquakes to groundwater removal isn’t unprecedented — one study found a 2011 magnitude 5.1 earthquake in Lorca, Spain may have been triggered by groundwater extraction in the region. Other human activities have been tied to quakes — Amos said filling up or draining large reservoirs can also trigger fault activity, and scientists have linked wastewater injection from fracking operations to clusters of small earthquakes in regions that previously had had little tectonic activity.\nSo far, the uplift and seismic activity that can be partially attributed to groundwater approval is minor. However, the study states, the activity puts more stress on the San Andreas fault, which could bring the fault closer to failure, in turn triggering a much larger earthquake.\nThe study also points to another problem in California: the sheer quantity of groundwater that’s being removed from the San Joaquin Valley, a quantity Amos called “staggering.” Over the last 150 years, about 160 cubic kilometers — about 40 cubic miles — of groundwater in the Central Valley has has been pumped out, used for irrigation or has evaporated. The study highlights this practice of removing groundwater as something that could become even more resource-consuming if California’s drought continues.\n“Future scenarios for groundwater in California suggest increasing demand for agricultural, urban and environmental use,” the study reads. “Climate change will probably exacerbate the stress on this resource through altered precipitation patterns, more frequent droughts, earlier snowmelt, larger floods, and increasing temperatures and evapotranspiration.”\nCalifornia’s drought has been thrown into sharp relief over the last few days. In Southern California, nine fires forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents this week, and on Wednesday, a fire in San Diego County forced the evacuation of a nuclear plant. The state has also struggled with soaring temperatures — San Francisco, Mountain View, and Monterey have all set or tied heat records already this spring.']"	['<urn:uuid:6ce67565-ff54-4f3e-b601-0bd4808a51b7>', '<urn:uuid:812d741c-07b7-4090-9351-f8832fc4bdbd>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	5	97	1341
68	What are the different methods for planting bare root seedlings?	There are two methods for planting bare root seedlings: the hole method and the slit method. The hole method involves digging a small hole in the soil large enough to spread the roots naturally, then adding and packing soil around the roots to remove air pockets. The slit method involves making a vertical slit in the soil with a shovel at 45 degrees, placing the seedling at the correct depth with the root flare at ground level, and closing the hole by pulling the shovel toward yourself. With the slit method, extra care is needed to avoid J-rooting, where roots become deformed by not making the hole deep enough.	"[""Tree planting is more than just putting a tree into the ground. There are a number of options and items to consider prior to any tree planting. Before you have a shovel in your hands, you need to consider the purpose of this tree plant. Trees may be planted for:\n- Aesthetics - for the shape of the tree, foliage colour in autumn, or showy blossoms and fruit.\n- Shelterbelts or visual screens - along fields, on property lines\n- Shade - to provide much need shade to yard sites\n- Energy Conservation - evergreen windbreaks to shield homes against wind and snow, deciduous trees to provide shade in the summer and allow sunshine in the winter months\n- Wildlife enhancement - to attract wildlife to your property by providing food source and shelter\nOnce you've determined what the purpose of the tree plant is, then you need to determine a suitable location for the tree(s). Things to keep in mind when selecting the location of the tree planting site(s):\n- How much room does the tree need to grow? Is it too close to other trees or a building that will cause damage to the siding or roof?\n- Is there anything that will limit the height the tree can grow, such as power lines?\n- Is the tree too close to an intersection where it may block visibility?\n- What is the light levels at this location - full sunlight or shaded?\nIn the planning stages, call your local utilities. They can come out and mark any services lines or pipes present. To avoid any problems in the future, do not plant directly over these lines and pipes or directly under power lines. It is recommended not to plant trees within five meters of overhead power lines, however, if it is unavoidable, plant shrubs or low growing trees in this area.\nNow that you've got an idea of where you want to plant the tree(s), you need to determine the soil type and drainage conditions of the planting site. This information will help you with tree selection.\nTree selection is very important. The best planting techniques will not ensure the tree health or survival if the tree is poorly suited for that site. Proper tree selection is probably the single most important factor influencing the success of the tree. When selecting trees from a nursery, inquire about the plant’s cold hardiness, as this will help determine whether the tree will withstand our cold winters. Please refer to the cold hardiness map for Manitoba , produced by National Land and Water Information Service, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 2005.\nClick here to see a list of Native Trees of Manitoba and a list of Non-Native trees which have a cold hardiness of 2.\nOnce you determined the type of tree and the location of planting and obtained your tree(s), you are ready for planting. The size of tree(s) and how the tree(s) are packaged will determine the method of planting.\nIt is best to plant or transplant trees in their dormant state, in the fall after leaf drop or in the spring prior to bud break.\nThere are generally 3 types of seedling types: bare root, container grown and cuttings.\nBare Root Seedlings\nBare rooted seedlings must be planted during the dormant season for the best survival. Weather and soil conditions conductive to planting occur in both late spring and early fall. The spring is generally the best time to plant bare-root seedlings, especially if planting in heavy loam or clay soils. Trees planted in heavy soils in the fall are more susceptible to frost heaving and winterkill from dry winter winds. Winter damage from rodents and other wildlife is also greater in fall planted seedlings. Keep the tree roots moist and protected from the sun and wind while handling. It is not recommended to soak the tree roots in water before planting because this will wash away protective soil particles from the roots, making the roots more susceptible to drying. Keep seedlings in containers with moss, wet shredded newspaper, wet burlap or similar material, as this prevents the tree roots from drying out while planting.\nContainer Grown Seedlings\nContainer grown seedlings experience less shock then bare-root stock at planting time because the seedling roots are not distributed when planted. Carefully separate the seedlings from their bundles, minimizing the number of stripped or broken roots.\nPlanting Bare Root and Container Grown Seedlings\nThere are two methods for hand planting bare root or container grown seedlings: the hole method and the slit method.\n- The hole method consists of digging a small hole in the soil to hold the roots of the tree. The hole is made large enough for the planter to spread the roots out in a natural un-crowded or twisted position. Soil is then added around the roots and packed to remove any air pockets.\n- The slit method consists of placing the shovel in the ground and making a vertical slit in the soil. Insert the shovel at a 45 degree angle and push forward to the upright position. Remove the shovel and place the seedling at the correct depth. Remember you want the root flare to be at ground level. Hold the seedling at the correct depth and insert the shovel approximately 3 inches behind the seedling and pull the shovel towards yourself to close the hole at the bottom of the roots. With this method, bare rooted seedlings require some extra care to ensure the roots fall down the hole to avoid the deformity called J –rooting. Seedlings with J- roots are more susceptible to drought, disease, and insect attacks because the root system does not develop properly. Root systems with a characteristic J shape are typically caused by not making the planting hole deep enough or twisting the tree into the hole.\nCuttings are another alternative for regenerating certain tree species. Cuttings are usually 8 to 12 inch lengths of tree stems about ¼ to ¾ inch in diameter. They are cut during the dormant season from the previous year’s growth of vigorous seedlings or stump sprouts. Cuttings generally have no visible roots, but when buried vertically with only one inch of the stick above ground, they will form roots.\nCuttings produce exact genetic replica of the parent tree. Cuttings are generally used to regenerate poplars, but can also be used to regenerate willow and green ash.\nPlanting cuttings requires that the planting area is worked so the soil is loose, making it easier to push the cuttings vertically to their full depth. Cuttings seem to take root quicker if they are soaked in water for one day prior to planting in the soil. Do not leave cuttings in the water for more than one day or small roots will form but will be ripped off when the cutting is pushed into the soil.\nWhen soaking the cuttings, be sure they are fully immersed in the water and not floating on the top. The best way to do this is wrap a bundle of cuttings with an elastic band and putting a weight on the top of the bundle.\nWhen planting, be sure to push the cutting in straight down and not at an angle. Ensure that most of the cutting is below ground so that the top bud is flush with the soil level. Be sure to plant the cuttings with the buds facing upward. Once the cuttings have been pushed into the soil, pack the soil firmly around the cuttings and water them immediately. The cutting require watering whenever the soil gets dry, but do not over water them.\nTrees are generally available from nurseries in one of three forms: bare-root, balled and burlapped (B & B), or containerized. Each form has advantages and disadvantages\nBare Root Trees\nBare-root trees are usually small and easy to transplant. Because there is no soil on the root system, these trees are lightweight. This stock type is commonly sold with peat moss covering the roots. It is vital that the roots be kept moist. For best results bare-root trees are typically planted during the dormant season before roots and buds begin to grow. If not planted immediately, bare-root trees should be stored cold, with moist packing around roots. Usually only deciduous trees and small conifer seedlings are sold as bare-root stock.\nDig a planting hole wider than the root width and slightly deeper then the length of the roots.\nBuild a small mound of soil in the center of the hole. Roots should be spread and distributed over the mound. Backfill about three-quarters of the hole and lightly pack the soil to remove any air pockets. Water the tree to promote good contact between roots and soil. Finish filling the hole and pack the soil slightly. Water thoroughly. Soil that is highly compacted decreases the roots ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.\nContainerized or Potted Trees\nContainerized or potted trees are sold in plastic or peat pots. This container-grown stock offers better protection against transplant shock and drying of roots during transport and storage. This stock type can be planted at any time during the growing season; however the spring and fall are best for the trees. Always handle the tree by the container or root ball, never by the stem.\nAll pots must be removed prior to planting. To aid in the removal tap the container on the sides and bottom. Never force the tree out of the container - it may be necessary to cut the sides of the pot to remove the tree. Sometimes roots will have grown in circles within the container. To ensure root growth, score the root ball by making several vertical cuts down the root ball with a knife. Another acceptable method is to use a shovel blade and make a cut through the soil ball at the bottom two-thirds, this is known as butterflying.\nDig a hole at least twice the width of the root ball and to the same depth as the root ball. Plant these trees so the root flare is just below the soil surface to allow the root flare to settle. Backfill approximately two-thirds of the planting hole with the same soil removed when the hole was dug. Lightly pack the soil and water. Finish filling the remainder of the hole, and with the soil create a saucer–shaped cup and embankment around the tree. Lightly pack and water.\nThe most important factor in successfully planting container grown trees is maintaining adequate soil moisture to encourage the roots to grow into the surrounding soil.\nBalled and Burlapped (B & B) Trees\nBalled and burlapped trees are sold with burlap surrounding the root ball. As much as 95% of the absorbing roots can be lost in digging, but some of these roots are preserved in the root ball. The burlap is used to wrap the root ball for support and helps keep roots from drying out from exposure to air. All burlap, twine, wire, tags and labels should be removed prior to planting to avoid girdling of the tree. Be sure to handle this stock by lifting the root ball carefully. Never move a B & B tree by lifting the stem.\nSome larger balled and burlapped trees come in wire baskets to maintain the integrity of the ball during handling. Baskets can sometimes last decades in the soil, and they can partially girdle roots, restricting vascular transport. Although it may be impractical to remove the entire basket, it is preferable to cut away as much as possible once the tree is in the planting pit and the ball is stabilized. Basket removal eliminates interference with roots and allows them to grow and spread freely.\nOnce the tree has been selected, the planting hole can be dug. The planting hole for a tree should be two to three times the width of the of the root ball at the soil surface, sloping down about the width of the root ball at the base. The hole should never be deeper than the root ball. One of the most common planting problems is planting too deeply. Deep planting can even be a problem when professionals plant trees because containerized and balled and burlap trees often arrive with soil too high up the trunk due to production techniques.\nIt is imperative that the natural root flare be located before planting. The top of the root ball should be even with or slightly higher than soil grade at planting. Soft fill should not be added to the bottom of the hole because the root ball will settle and result in it being planted too deeply. Do not put gravel in the bottom of the planting hole; it does not aid drainage. Water will accumulate in the finer textured soil above the course gravel level until the soil is completely saturated.\nBackfill the hole with the soil removed when the hole was dug. Work the soil around the root ball so that no air pockets remain. Firm the soil around the bottom of the root ball so that the tree is vertical and adequately supported. Water thoroughly and slowly. The remaining soil is sometimes mounded into a dike or berm beyond the outer edge of the root ball to collect water over the root zone, especially on sloped sites.\nApply mulch around newly planted trees. Mulch is important for several reasons:\n- keeps the soil moist by decreasing evaporation\n- decreases competition from weeds\n- creates a buffer between the tree and weed trimmers or mowers\n- increases the effectiveness and longevity of fertilizer applications\n- moderates soil temperature\nInorganic mulches include various types of stone, lava rock, pulverized rubber, geotextile fabrics, and other materials. While organic mulches include wood chips, pine needles, hardwood and softwood bark, cocoa hulls, leaves, compost mixes, and a variety of other products usually derived from plants. Because the decomposition of organic mulch improves soil quality and fertility, many consider these characteristic a positive one and the preferred choice, despite the added maintenance.\nDo not cover the area immediately surrounding the stem, rather measure 5 cm out and begin there. Spread the mulch around the tree to a distance of approximately 50 cm from the stem. The mulch layer should be approximately 7 cm deep. Do not make mulch layer much deeper than the recommended 7 cm, otherwise small rodents may overwinter in the mulch.""]"	['<urn:uuid:35631e81-9168-4d34-98a3-87fc16c58cd7>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	10	109	2411
69	What were the different impacts of artillery on WWI forts, both in terms of structural damage and the toll on human life?	Artillery had devastating effects on WWI forts both structurally and in terms of human casualties. At Fort Loncin, a 420mm German artillery round penetrated the fort and hit the magazine, setting off 24,000 pounds of explosives, killing 250 men of the 550-man garrison and destroying much of the central massif. At Fort Vaux during the Battle of Verdun, constant artillery bombardment from both German and French shells would shake the earth despite the fort's two-meter thick concrete walls, leaving the surrounding fields pockmarked from the fury of war.	"['19 FEB 2017\nSo many lives lost… one million at the Battle of Verdun. I stand in the dark tunnel where German soldiers had infiltrated Fort Vaux. The French managed to hold them off for two weeks. Two weeks they spent killing each other in this tunnel, until finally Major Raynal surrendered the fort so that the survivors could have some water. What dignity or heroism can be had in this cold, damp, dark place, hungry and thirsty, among fallen comrades and excrement.\nThe long hall of the underground fortress splits off into barracks, escape tunnels, and the communications room. Small windows for cannons and machine guns let the sunlight peek in. The walls, two meters of concrete, protect the soldiers from German shells, and later French shells after the fort is taken. They explode and shake the earth. The flat fields and smooth hills are pockmarked from the fury of war. So much destruction, everywhere.\nLooking out from the top of Fort Vaux where the French flag flies, Verdun is not far off. The countryside is beautiful, the sun is bright, and trees now blanket once barren fields. A mossy ground cover manages to make the shell blasts look peaceful. One hundred years ago, an explosion tore through the thick metal of a turret dome. A remnant of the concave casing now lies prostrate, home to a bird bath and new moss growth. Nature nurtures the artifacts of this war.\nThe French and German unidentified dead of the Battle of Verdun rest as bones in the Douaumont Ossuary to the west of Fort Vaux. This white sword hilt of a building appears to have its massive blade buried into the earth, signifying the end of fighting. One hundred thirty thousand soldiers’ bones can be seen through small windows. I think they had hoped this monument to the fallen, who now share a final resting place, would be enough to remind the two nations of the horror that was World War I and keep them from committing to the same mistake again. It was only twenty-one years later, from 1918 to 1939, that WWII broke out.\nA little south of the ossuary lies the town of Fleury-avant-Douaumont. Our guide recounts the tale of how the residents were told to flee their homes because fighting in the area was imminent. The townspeople left behind the homes of their parents and theirs before them. They left behind their farmlands and their shops. When the fighting was finally over, the townspeople were led back to Fleury, but when they were told this was their home, they could not believe it. The houses, the shops, the flat farmland was no more. It had all been shelled and destroyed. The landscape had become infested with the miniature hills of shell-blasts. Stones and blocks of their homes littered the walkways. The wood had burned. The terrain was unrecognizable. The earth was contaminated by poison gas, explosives, and the bodies of soldiers.\nI stand where once there was a house. I am surrounded by blast holes and concrete blocks. The poison gas has dissipated, the explosives discovered and disarmed, the bodies removed and reburied with proper rights. Now, the moss ground cover lives here, too. A forest has taken root. A memorial chapel was constructed to commemorate the collective loss.\nSo many memorials. So many graves. And not so very long ago.', ""Fort de Loncin\nAugust 4-25, 1914\nWith the start of the Great War in the summer of\n1914, Germany faced enemies on two fronts - the Russians and\nThe Russians would be slower to mobilize, so Germany decided to\nstrike the French, knocking them out of the war, then turning on\nRussia. This plan, the Schieffen Plan, sought to avoid French\nthe French-German border by violating Belgian neutrality, swinging\nthrough the small country and into France. Doing this had a\nserious drawback as the Germans would face\nBelgian fortifications, especially the twelve forts around Liege\nbut also around Namur and Antwerp.\nDesigned by Henri Brialmont, the fortifications were\nrevolutionary for their time and well respected. Designed to be\nused along with troops positioned between the forts, the\nguns within the forts were to support these infantrymen and suppress\nenemy artillery. Unfortunately, there were gaps between the forts\nnot covered by the forts' artillery. In addition, when forward\nobservation posts were captured, targeting the forts' artillery became\ndifficult. Although the Brialmont forts\nwould prove to be inadequate and deeply flawed, the Germans would\nlosses attacking them and lose valuable time in reducing them.\ncrossed the Belgian border on August 4th and began probing the Liege\nforts the next day. With the loss of some of the forts, the\ncomander of Liege, General Leman moved to Fort Loncin. The\nGermans still needed to capture them all to secure their advance, so\nthey now began using their heavy artillery, up to 420mm in caliber with\naround 1,600 pounds. On August 25th, the magazine of Fort de\nLoncin was hit,\nsetting off 24,000 pounds of explosives and destroying much of the fort\nwhile killing 250 men of the survivors of the original garrison of\n550. The explosion rendered the fort indefensible, and surrender\nFort Loncin is an\nexcellent example of the Brialmont forts, and it is now a museum that is well worth a visit.\nThis model gives a good idea of the fort's design, a\ntriangle with a\n300 meter base and 235 meter sides. We are looking at the fort\nfrom its front. Like older forts, there is a ditch and a cleared\nfield of fire - the glacis. Barbed wire on the glacis was a\nbarrier to attacking enemy infantry. At each corner of the fort\ncasemates with weapons positioned to fire along the ditch. On top\nof the fort there are fighting positions for the infantry, but the\ninfantry had no overhead protection. Unlike older forts, the\nartillery was larger in size and fewer in number. The guns\nwere concentrated in the fort's central massif, and they were protected\nby concrete. Brialmont hoped that enemy artillery projectiles\nwould bounce off the concrete. In reality, however, because the\nbeen poured in layers, the concrete in Brialmont forts tended to flake\noff. The concrete was not covered with earth, something which\ncould have provided additional protection. Concrete with metal\nreinforcing, much stronger than the concrete used here, had not yet\nbeen invented when the fort was built.\nAlthough tests had been done that showed the forts' concrete was\nvulnerable to artillery even of 150mm size, no improvements were made.\n1880s technology would have to do.\nThis is the fort's rear entrance. The entrance is covered by a\nfiring position on its flank, and it also featured a rolling bridge which could be\nwithdrawn, leaving a pit. The fort is designed with few defenses\nto its rear so that it would be easier to recapture if the enemy captured the\nfort. Next, we will enter the fort.\nWe entered the fort through the entrance at left. Any attacker\nwho managed to enter the fort here would face the gorge front - the\nwall to their front with the central massif behind - and be faced with enfilade fire from both\nsides. The men lived\nunderground inside the gorge front. Since the Germans\npenetrated between the forts and into Liege, they bombarded\nsome Brialmont forts from the rear, damaging the gorge front\nenough to drive the garrison deep into the fort. Fort de Loncin\nwould suffer another fate entirely.\nThe entrance to the central massif, the modern steps in the center of\nthe panorama, was offset from the fort's entrance in order to protect it from direct fire through the entrance. The\ncentral massif looks much different now compared to when the fort was\nnew. Knowing that the Brialmont forts were designed against 200mm\nrounds, the Germans brought 420mm howitzers into Belgium. A lucky\nround penetrated the fort, setting off the magazine and wrecking\nthe central massif.\nA little later we will climb the modern bright white steps and take the\npath through the ruins of the fort. There we will see\na panorama from the white steps visible above and to the\nright of the statue in the middle of the panorama. This is the location of the searchlight. First, though,\nlet's go inside the gorge front section of the central massif.\nThis is an example of a casemate within the central massif. Note\nthe crack at right, likely a result of the magazine explosion.\nThis is a 180 degree view of a corridor within the central massif.\nThe stairs at right lead up to fort's left 57mm turret.\nLater on we will see the outside of the right 57mm turret, but\nfirst let's cross the gorge ditch and go inside to see the bathroom.\nSo you weren't expecting to see the toilette? Some of the\nBrialmont forts had a serious flaw regarding the bathroom. In\nthese forts the bathroom facilities were\nlocated separate from the men in the central massif, forcing them to go\noutside under enemy fire to reach the sanitary facilities.\nInstead many of the men relieved themselves where they\nwere, which created serious sanitation and health problems. The\nsmell of their\nown waste, combined with smoke from firing artillery, contributed\nto the surrender of some Brialmont\n|In this 360 degree view, you can see where we entered the\nthe right side. On the left side of the panorama you can see the\nruins of a stairway passage through the concrete leading to the powered\nsearchlight turret. This armored turret was able to move 360\ndegrees and housed a light like the one pictured in the photo at\nelectric one that could illuminate enemy infantry at distances of 2-3\nkm. A steam engine turned a dynamo that furnished the power to\nAlthough the addition of a searchlight was a great advance in its\ntime, use of a single light per fort meant that a fort's night fighting\nability was gone if the light was destroyed.\nTo the right of the searchlight in the panorama are the ruins of a\nturret. Between our location and 5.7cm turret on the right side\nof the fort is the massive crater from the explosion of the\nmagazine.

Next we continue up\nthe stairs at right.\nAtop the Central Massif\n|From atop the central massif you can see not only some of the\nmassive damage to the fort, you can also get an idea of what an intact\nfort looks like. The 5.7cm turrets are on either flank of the\nfort. At right is the chasm that the 15cm turret in the center of\nthe fort is now leaning into. The 12cm turret looks reasonably\nintact, but the 21cm turret near the front of the fort was blown\nskyward by the explosion and landed upside down. See photo at\nBelow is a panorama of the other 21cm turret on the fort's right\nside. Next we continue to the stairs that lead down to the ditch in\nfort's front salient.\nof the three salients had fighting positions designed so that\ncould fire along the ditch.

In the event that the enemy was able to\ncross the ditch, barbed wire or thorn bushes faced any enemy climbing\nthe earthen scarp on their way to the top of the fort. This area is now wooded.\nThe panorama at left is the inside of the front salient.\n5.7cm rapid fire guns like the one in the photo at right were\nmounted in the two story casemate and dominated the ditch.\nNext, we climb the steps and walk toward the right 57mm turret.\nWe are now at the infantry fighting position on top\nof the fort. At center and right of the panorama you can see\nthe damage to the central massif.

See model at right.\nThe turrets in the Brialmont forts featured steel armor\nthat extended into the concrete. This prevented the\nturret from being moved\nsignificantly off center if the concrete was destroyed.\n|Around 300 of the 550 man garrison died during the\nbattle.

70	ancient monuments built britain 3000 2000 bc significance	During the period between 3000-2000 BC, significant monuments were constructed in Britain. This includes Stonehenge, which began construction around 3000 BC, and the Exmoor henge, which dates to the Late Neolithic period (2800-2000 BC). These henges were ritual or ceremonial centers, and are considered nationally important due to their rarity, with only about 80 known examples throughout England.

In contrast to the others, Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor, there has been no history of antiquarian research and little excavation of its monuments. However, detailed survey work by the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England has confirmed a comparable richness of archaeological remains, with evidence of human exploitation and occupation from the Mesolithic period to the present day. Many of the field monuments surviving on Exmoor date from the later prehistoric period. Examples include burial mounds (`barrows\'), standing stones, stone alignments and stone settings. Henges are ritual or ceremonial centres which date to the Late Neolithic period (2800-2000 BC). They were constructed as roughly circular or oval- shaped enclosures comprising a flat area over 20m in diameter enclosed by a ditch and external bank. One, two or four entrances provided access to the interior of the monument, which may have contained a variety of features including timber or stone circles, post or stone alignments, pits, burials or central mounds. Finds from the ditches and interiors of henges provide important evidence for the chronological development of the sites, the types of activity that occurred within them and the nature of the environment in which they were constructed. Henges occur throughout England with the exception of south-eastern counties and the Welsh Marches. They are generally situated on low ground, often close to springs and water-courses. Henges are rare nationally with about 80 known examples. As one of the few types of identified Neolithic structures and in view of their comparative rarity, all henges are considered to be of national importance. Despite being bisected by a field boundary and the heights of the earthworks having been reduced by cultivation the henge 760m south west of Woolhanger Farm survives comparatively well for such a rare, fragile and ancient type of monument. It will contain important archaeological and environmental evidence relating to its construction, function, use, ritual and social significance, and its overall landscape context as well as providing the links between the migrations of people, trade and ideas from centres such as Wessex where such classes of monument were more widespread.\nThis record was the subject of a minor enhancement on 10 November 2015. This record has been generated from an ""old county number"" (OCN) scheduling record. These are monuments that were not reviewed under the Monuments Protection Programme and are some of our oldest designation records.\nThis monument includes a henge situated on the lower northern slopes of Parracombe Common on a small ESE facing crest forming the head of the valley of a tributary to the Barbrook River. The henge survives as a level circular interior measuring up to 25.8m in diameter, surrounded by an approximately 3.9m wide and 0.3m deep partially buried ditch, enclosed by an outer bank of up to 3.4m wide and 0.5m high. The total diameter of the henge is approximately 40.4m. The northern part of the henge survives more clearly as an earthwork than the area to the south. The henge is bisected by a field boundary and any original entrance or entrances are no longer visible.

71	What are some common materials used for home temperature control?	Several materials are commonly used for insulation including fiberglass (made of light glass fibers), polyester (made from recycled plastic fibers), polystyrene, Rockwool (made from dissolved basalt and slag), cellulose (made from 75-85% recycled paper), and wool (made from sheep wool threads). These materials all contain tiny air pockets that help trap heat and sound, as air is an excellent insulator.	['Insulation is a process in which your home is protected from external heat and sounds. The house is internally coated using various heat and sound-resistant materials.\nAir is an excellent insulator; therefore, most coating materials have many tiny air pockets inside them to trap heat and sound. Insulation is used for resisting cold as well.\nInsulation Of Roof Without Attic\nRoof and ceiling are the most vital elements of your house when it comes to the transmission of unwanted temperatures and sounds.\nLet’s take a brief look at a few of the different insulation techniques that are most commonly used to insulate the roofs and ceilings without attic.\nBulk insulation is a comprehensive insulation process in which your entire house is coated with a selected material to protect from unwanted temperatures and sounds. The coating acts like a cover or a sheath.\nThis type of insulation heavily depends on the underlying material and the concentration selected by the builders. The materials that are commonly used in bulk insulation include:\n- Fiberglass. It consists of very light glass fibers. It is a covering material that is located in many houses without an attic. It is usually applied in two distinct insulation types: batts and rolls and loose-fill.\n- Polyester roof insulation is a plastic product that is made up of petrochemicals. These products are mostly recycled plastic fibers. Others may be mixed with goods like wool.\n- Extruded polystyrene insulation or XPS Insulation is produced through an extrusion method. Expanded polystyrene padding or EPS insulation is made while utilizing a mold to hold tiny foam beads.\n- Rockwool produces their stone wool insulation by dissolving basalt and slag commonly and whirling it to produce fibers. This material is then made into insulation plates or insulation tubes that are used to cover residential, commercial, and modern buildings. Perfect for insulating the roof without attic.\n- Cellulose consists of 75-85% recycled paper texture, which is mostly waste newsprint. The rest of 15% is a fire retardant such as boric acid or ammonium sulfate. Cellulose has the most eminent recycled content of any insulation obtainable.\n- Wool insulation is produced from sheep wool threads that are either mechanically attached or bonded using within 5% and 20% recycled polyester adhesive to develop insulation batts, tubes, and strings. Original wool insulation is highly efficient for both thermal and acoustic padding.\nReflective insulation is another name for foil insulation. It has also been known as other names, including the reflective barrier of radiant barrier. All these names are used interchangeably. Make sure when you hear these, you don’t confuse this type of insulation with another.\nThis insulation process requires the coating of the roof or ceiling, both internally or externally, to resist and reflect solar radiations. It works best for fighting heatwaves; therefore, it is more effective and efficient in warmer areas.\nSpray insulation is probably the most DIY kind of insulation for your roof without attic. You can simply spray the foam into your wall cavities and cracks. This method can also be used to spray ceilings as well collectively with batts and reflective foam insulation. Once sprayed, the foam solidifies and becomes a hard insulating material, and it can protect the concerned areas from heat and moisture.\nSee also: Running Ductwork In Attic – Challenges\nStep By Step Guide To Insulating Your Roof Without Attic\nRoof insulation is a tricky and complex process that requires tremendous skills and experience to achieve effectiveness and efficiency through accuracy.\nWe recommend you to get the services of professionals rather than doing yourself. However, if your looking to insulate your roof yourself as a DIY process, we have prepared this step-by-step guide to give you a headstart.\n- First off, you have to set the scene. This includes that you have the right tools to access and insulate your roof and the required materials. These tools will typically include a measuring tape, a tough pair of scissors, a saw, a drill, and a nail gun. You also have to take care of any electrical wiring that is already present inside the roof rafters. If you are insulating the roof from the inside, make sure that you have large stands under you to support you while you are standing or moving. Similarly, if you are insulating from the outside, and standing on the rafters, make sure you don’t put too much weight on the roof. Lastly, take care of the light as well. You should not be insulating your roof in the dark. Rather you should have ambient light present all the time during the roof insulation process.\n- You also have to wear protective suits, gloves, and goggles, if the material of your choice is dangerous for your health. For example, the shards inside the fiberglass can be hazardous. Similarly, if you are using wool for roof insulation, you should be careful as it can also be disturbing.\n- Before you start the roof, there are few more things that you must take care of. You should clean the rafters and look for any cracks or holes. If you find any, you can fill these with spray foams or any other material you find suitable.\n- Start by measuring a particular rafter area as well as the width. Note down these measurements along with the required thickness of insulation. Noting these measurements are important as the insulation thickness must not increase than the rafter width.\n- In the case of wool insulation, you have to cut the wool rolls with the help of scissors before you place them inside the rafter and staple them to the rafters. Make sure these rolls are 50mm below the roof. You can add two layers of wool if the width of your rafters allows their insertion. You have to cover the entire rafter space in a similar fashion. Lastly, you can add a plastic sheet as well to cover up the wool insulation. While this insulation, you have to make sure that you don’t leave any spaces for the passage of air or light.\n- In the case of rigid boards, you’ll have a much more precise board parliament than well. You can measure and adjust the board lengths before their insertion among the rafters. Likewise, the width of these boards will depend on the width of the rafters.\nWhich One Is The Best Insulation For Your Roof Without Attic?\nAll the above-mentioned types of insulation are designed for different climate conditions as well as the built quality and materials of the buildings. If you are looking to insulate the roof or ceiling of your house, we suggest you deeply understand both of these facts.\nNot one type is superior to the other. What matters is what type is more suitable for your particular house. Let’s briefly take a look at few examples below as to why different insulation techniques are used for different kinds of ceiling.\nInsulation Of A Metal Roof Without Attic\nMetal roof insulation approaches two significant purposes; preserving the interior temperature and blocking the substance from accumulating under the roofing. Providing a sheet of insulation under a metal roof is necessary as the metal is generally a better heat transmitter than wood.\nQuality insulation assists in retaining heat in the wintertime and keeps warm when the temperature drops. The best options to insulate your metal roof include:\nFiberglass batts are the most simplistic and most affordable methods to protect a metal roof. Fiberglass consists of fine thread-like slices combined with other synthetic materials that are tightly twisted together to develop thick insulating padding.\nFiberglass is a very adaptable material that suggests that it can be cut into any diameter or breadth to embrace a surface. The shards of glass can be dangerous to work with for a novice; therefore, a professional is suggested.\nRigid board insulation is employed anywhere within a home, including the foundation. The rigid boards are composed of panels of polyurethane and polystyrene. The thicker the substance is, the more eminent the R-value will be. These boards are fixed under a metal roof panel and have to be adjusted collectively. The joints should be sealed or caulked to accommodate most thermal protection.\nSpray foam is one of the most attractive insulation methods for metal roofs because it’s highly efficient. It’s useful at stopping compression and rodent infestation. This is a kind of polyurethane insulation whose R-value is defined by the inches.\nSpray foam is very easy to work with, considering it can protect a new or old new metal roof without any disturbances. This insulation technique is more expensive than fiberglass.\nInsulation Of A Cathedral Ceiling\nCellulose allows much greater insulating strength per inch and, related to fiberglass, provides more insulating capacity because ventilation space is not wanted.\nIn a restricted area such as a cathedral ceiling, cellulose contributes a much higher stated R-value.']	['<urn:uuid:e643c152-b43b-4371-b496-2d214fbcf313>']	open-ended	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	10	60	1478
72	compare ancient obsidian mirror polish modern granite countertop polish techniques	Ancient obsidian mirror polishing and modern granite countertop polishing share some basic principles but differ in techniques. Ancient craftsmen used natural materials like granite, sand, sandstone, and fine-grained stone for grinding, followed by materials like clay and wood ash for final polishing. The process was done entirely by hand. Modern stone polishing typically involves mechanical methods using rotary machines with diamond abrasives, specialized stone-safe polishes, and sealants. Both processes require starting with cleaning the surface and progressing from coarser to finer materials, but modern techniques are more standardized and efficient, using professionally formulated products and power tools rather than manual labor with natural materials.	"['A publication of the Archaeological Institute of America\nMaking a mirror the old-fashioned way\nCypriot ship painted on a modern pot shows clearly on polished obsidian surface. (James Vedder)\nAmong the intriguing finds at the Neolithic site of Çatalhöyük in central Anatolia are a few polished obsidian artifacts believed to have been used as mirrors. In a letter in response to an article, ""The World\'s First City"" (March/April 1998), which mentions the obsidian mirrors, P.H.M. Hawley wrote, ""to make such a mirror requires considerable technology in a sense. To grind a flat surface and then achieve a true polish is not easy"" (May/June 1998, p. 11). In an accompanying comment, Orrin Shane (an author of the original article and a curator at the Minnesota Museum of Science) said of the Çatalhöyük mirrors, ""Their exceptional planar surfaces are highly polished and reflect a sharp image."" I was curious just how difficult it would be and how long it would take to make an obsidian mirror.\nIn December 1999, I started to fashion a small one by hand, using various readily available materials (some artificial) to grind and polish a broken obsidian nodule. A fragment of concrete sidewalk provided the rough surface for the initial grinding. Once there was a flat surface, I continued, using in order, the side of a discarded abrasive wheel, a fine whetstone, and a fine clay slip on a piece of plate glass. The result was a nearly flat polished area that produced an excellent reflection. After this first success, I used three more obsidian nodules and an obsidian lump with conchoidal surfaces that had lost their luster during long exposure, grinding and polishing them with materials such as granite, quartzite, sandstone, slate, marble, sand, fine-grained stone, clay, and wood ash. The most used for grinding were granite, sand, sandstone, and the fine-grained stone. The fine grained stone gave a fairly good polish, while the others were used briefly to verify that a wide range of materials are effective in the process. I observed the sun\'s reflection and examined the obsidian surface with a 10x hand lens to evaluate the progress of the grinding and polishing and took great care to keep the surface clear of extraneous material to reduce the possibility of generating scratches. I have yet to explore fully various possible final burnishing, buffing, and polishing procedures. The wood ash was briefly tried as a final polishing agent, but it was probably too fine-grained to improve the existing state of the polished surface with out the expense of an inordinate amount of time. Materials for grinding and polishing comparable to those listed above can be found in Turkey.\nThe largest mirror surface I produced is about 4 by 6 centimeters (1.6 by 2.4 inches). With experience, one could probably select an optimum set of materials to expedite the creation of a mirror surface. Since achieving the final polish may take the longest time, I can not estimate now the time required to make a mirror.\nAll of the mirrors produced good images, and all were slightly convex as expected from manual grinding in which linear and rotary motions result in greater pressure being applied around the perimeter of the surface. The only technical reference that I have seen on an obsidian mirror from Çatalhöyük states that it is slightly convex. With special preparation of a core and great care during the grinding process, one could probably make a nearly flat mirror with no obvious distortions in the image.\n""STOP"" image is reflected in experimental obsidian mirror. (James Vedder)\nDuring my stay at Çatalhöyük in August 2000, I collected information from unpublished notes and speaking with those at the site who had any familiarity with obsidian and grinding stones. I was able to see eight of the Çatalhöyük mirrors. Three each were in the Archaeological Museum of Konya and the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara. Dim lighting and glass cases made it difficult to discern details of fabrication. Two in storage at the Konya museum could be inspected close-up. Their faces were slightly convex, as I had suspected; but they were badly scratched, probably from post-manufacturing usage and disposal.\nPictures of at least six obsidian artifacts from Çatalhöyük were published and claimed to be mirrors by the site\'s first excavator, James Mellaart, who dug there in the 1960s. Naomi Hamilton (a participant in the current efforts at the site) in her unpublished inventory of artifacts from Çatalhöyük held in the Konya and Ankara museums lists 11 items as mirrors or possible mirrors. Those shown by Mellaart are in this list. I have verified that eight of the 11 objects are mirrors and rejected two. One of these two, described by Hamilton as possibly a broken mirror with grinding marks, has linear sets of abrasions at several angles that have obliterated the luster on 60 percent of the surface but have not flattened it. The other, described as a questionable mirror fragment or flake, is a long, thin curved piece lacking luster. The eleventh item, in storage at the Konya museum, is possibly the beginnings of a mirror in the early stage of grinding a core to produce a flat surface.\nWhat purpose did they serve? The conventional answer given by Mellaart is for a woman to view her application of make-up, but few obsidian mirrors have been found and these only in the middle occupation levels at Çatalhöyük. Various alternative uses have been suggested, some practical (illuminating rooms or shafts, starting fires, reflecting sunlight for a compact seasonal calendar, or signalling) and some spiritual (viewing one\'s soul or performing special rites). No mirrors have been found in the recent excavations, under the general direction of the University of Cambridge\'s Ian Hodder; but only the group from the University of California, Berkeley, is working at the levels IV to VI in which Mellaart discovered the objects.\nIn conclusion, there is abundant archaeological evidence for grinding and polishing stone to make tools and ornaments. No technological innovation was required before obsidian mirrors could be produced. While the only raw materials available locally to the ancient inhabitants of Çatalhöyük were clay, lake-bed marl, grasses, and animal hide, at some distance, the Tarus Mountains to the south and several volcanoes in other directions, could have been the sources ofmaterials suitable for grinding and polishing obsidian.', 'There are almost as many uses for stone in and around the home as there are stone varieties. Smooth granite makes durable countertops, sandstone fireplaces look rustic and cozy, and a slate floor can last for generations. Most stone isn’t naturally glossy without special grinding and polishing techniques. However, you can add shine to a stone surface with minimal fuss, and keep it looking fresh with regular maintenance. If the stone is used for food preparation, only use materials that the manufacturer states are food safe.\nAfter natural-stone blocks are extracted from quarries, they go through a masonry process that involves cutting, forming, and finishing prior to installation. Depending on the methodology and style of work followed by the stonemasons, the tiles and slabs produced can be finished in many ways. Flamed and brushed finishing is ideal for the outdoors and rustic interior décor, while the tumbled and aged styles of surface finishing are better for antique styles. The most popular natural-stone finish is the polished look because it appears classic and modern at the same time.\nIf you prefer a refined, shiny natural stone floor to a raw and rustic one, polished tiles are an excellent choice.\nTo get your floor shining, you’ll need a good natural stone polish, such as Lithofin’s Polish Cream. Then, you can follow the steps below to give your tiles the shine they deserve.\nNatural stones like marble, granite, limestone, slate, and travertine are known for their hard surfaces, long life, and easy to clean surfaces. They are perfectly suited for warm and hot climates as they tend to keep cool and do not harbour any allergens in the house.\nAs hard and heavy as they can be, they are also not completely invulnerable to damage. They can get dull over time because of the usual wear and tear. Contact StoneShine today and get a free estimate as to the extent of damage and what can be done to restore the stone surfaces. Depending on where you have used stone, be it walls, floors, or even countertops, you need different types of treatment. The best way to go about redoing your polish is to get the professionals to do it for you.\nIf you’re looking for a place to purchase quality supplies, check out Stonemason supplies.\nBefore You Begin\nWhen applying any treatment to natural stone tiles, it’s essential that you clean them first.\nBefore using natural stone polish, sweep away any dirt and debris with a soft-bristled broom. Then, use a dust mop to sweep away anything you might have missed. Removing debris from your floor at the very beginning prevents scratches.\nOnce you’re satisfied you’ve removed the grime from your tiles, you can clean them thoroughly with a natural stone cleaner. Some cleaners can be applied directly while others are from concentrate and must be diluted in warm water. Read the packaging on your stone cleaner and follow the instructions.\nAfter mopping, allow your tiles to air dry for a day or, if you’re feeling impatient, dry them by hand using a soft microfiber cloth.\nPreparing Your Floor\nIf your natural stone tiles are already honed, or smooth, you can skip this step. Otherwise, continue.\nTypically, natural stone tiles have a rough surface that’s not suitable for polishing. However, if you fancy a change of scenery, you can transform your tiles and create a smooth finish.\nTo prepare textured stone tiles for polishing, you must grind them down, which flattens the floor. Grinding is also an excellent way to remove deep scratches and stains.\nOnce you have ground down your tiles, you can hone them using a diamond pad; this will give you an entirely smooth surface.\nPolishing is a great way to add a brilliant shine to marble, granite, and other types of natural stone. Polishing even prevents fingerprints, water spots, and soap scum. These easy tips can help you get the best effect when using a natural-stone granite polish.\nAlways Clean the Stone Before Polishing\nDon’t try to polish natural stone before it’s been thoroughly cleaned. Start by cleaning the surface with a stone-safe granite cleaner like Granite Gold Daily Cleaner® and a lint-free cloth to remove buildup, crumbs, and soap film on the surface. Next, dry your countertops completely with a clean, soft cloth.\nBe sure to have these stonemason polishing tools for your next work.\nSeal the Stone After Cleaning\nYou don’t necessarily need to seal your natural stone before polishing, but it’s a good idea to make sure the stone has a strong seal against liquids and stains before you polish the surface. If you do decide to seal the stone, make sure the sealer has at least 24 hours to cure before you follow up with a polish fully. Sealing stone isn’t difficult to do yourself. After cleaning the surface, spray Granite Gold Sealer® directly onto the surface. Working in three-foot sections, immediately wipe the sealer into the stone without allowing it to dry on the surface, then buff the stone with a lint-free cloth.\nPolish Shower Walls to Resist Soap Scum\nNatural-stone showers are beautiful and elegant, but they can develop a film of soap scum just like ceramic tile. Polish doesn’t just bring out the natural lustre and beauty in stone. It’s also effective at preventing soap scum and water spots. Polishing stone shower walls, especially when combined with a sealer, creates a slicker surface that makes it harder for soap scum to grip the textured surface of the stone.\nNever Polish Stone Floors\nTo keep your natural-stone floors looking their best, sweep and dry mop regularly. You can use a stone-safe cleaner on stone tile floors followed with a sealer to help your floors resist stains, but make sure your stone floor maintenance stops there. Polish should not be used on floors, including shower floors, because it can make the floors very slippery and increase the risk of slips and falls. Polish is best for countertops, backsplashes, shower walls, and tub surrounds.\nPolish Natural Stone Weekly\nTo maintain the lustre and shine of your natural stone, use a stone-safe polish about once a week. To polish the stone, spray the polish directly onto the surface, then buff the surface until it’s dry with a lint-free cloth or dry paper towel. Granite Gold Polish® is safe to use on food preparation surfaces, so you don’t need to worry about using your countertops after you’ve polished them.\nOver time, the polished finish can lose some of its sheens, but homeowners who don’t know how to polish granite and other types of natural stone can restore the gloss by taking the following steps.\nChoose the Right Product\nWith natural-stone polish formulated for household use such as Granite Gold Polish®, homeowners can easily maintain the lustre of their countertops themselves. The best granite polish is the kind that can be sprayed on, wiped down, and buffed by hand with a paper towel or lint-free cloth.\nCheck out our range of stone cutting tools for all of your working needs.\nClean Before Polishing\nA stone surface that hasn’t been cleaned for a while may develop a patina that can hide its lustre. Before polishing, apply a granite daily cleaner and wipe it dry to make sure the patina dissipates. Applying polish on soiled stone may end up creating an unsightly patina that needs to be scrubbed away.\nSeal Before Polishing\nProper stone care starts with cleaning and should be followed by sealing, then polishing. Applying polish on unsealed stone could make the surface shine unevenly. Allow the sealant to settle and cure for 24 hours before applying polish.\nDivide Polishing Work in Sections\nCountertops and panels can be divided into three or four sections when polishing. The idea is to polish the surface evenly using a lint-free cloth.\nUse the Right Buffing Technique\nOnce the polish has been spread evenly over the surface, the final step involves buffing, which should be done with a dry, lint-free cloth, preferably made with microfiber material. The timeless circular buffing technique works better when it starts in wide circles and continues with smaller circles as the polish dries out completely and the surface starts to shine. For the brightest sheen, pressure should be applied to the cloth.\nReduce the Risk of Slipping\nMarble and granite countertops can be buffed to a high gloss, but this isn’t recommended for the floors in living spaces such as kitchens, bathrooms, lanais, and foyers. Natural stone can become very slippery when polished, so it should be avoided unless done by a professional stone restoration specialist.\nNatural Stone Cleaning Process\nAll Natural Stone cleaning and restoration as well as sealing jobs, must be preceded by a thorough pre-inspection. Here we determine a customized care plan to meet your specific needs for your specific stone.\nBecause your home is important to you, it is important to us; we will take the necessary precautions to protect all areas surrounding your stones with plastic sheets and blue tape.\nCleaning Processes vary from floor to floor, and many variables include make-up, maintenance, soiling conditions, traffic, use, etc.… When cleaning any stones, we use the most scientifically advanced cleaning products, and the stone is then machine or hand scrubbed and brushed. Finally, we will rinse the stone with a rinsing tool, connected to a truck-mounted hot water extraction system is used, achieving maximum soil removal and best overall cleaning results.\nThe stone that is etched, scuffed, and scratched can be restored only by the use of mechanical abrasives underneath a rotary machine. Diamond abrasives resurface/remove a slight amount of stone (just enough to get below the etch marks and scratches). All diamond grinding is performed with the use of water to contain dust. The surfacing procedures that follow will determine the desired surface sheen.\nStone is mechanically resurfaced using diamond abrasives and water to achieve a uniformly honed surface sheen. In some cases, polished marble, granite, travertine or limestone can be mechanically honed to remove pre-existing surface polish.\nStone is mechanically finished to produce a high gloss shine. Very light etches, scuffs and scratches may be removed with the polishing process, but diamond grinding is needed if the stone surface has a medium deep etches scuffs and scratches.\nThis will be the last step in the stone cleaning process. Depending on the sealer chosen, we will use a heavy-duty professional grade sealer to protect your stones.\nWe will do a walk-through inspection of the areas before we leave home and give you some tips on how to maintain your stones.\nWhy shouldn’t you DIY for a natural stone polishing job?\nIf you go online and check for DIY methods to polish stone, you will get a ton of advice. The problem with all of them is that they don’t work as well. You can never get the same finish from using just your hands and a few pads as you would get from a full-fledged rotary polishing machine operated by a professional. Getting the right grit and working your way up, using the right polish and sealant, and sanding the surface the right amount; can all be very difficult to do correctly.\nAccording to the MIA (Marble Institute of America), there are a few terms used in the industry that will help when deciding to polish your natural stone floors, countertops, or walls.\nThere are several types of finishes you can have on any stone surface. They are measured by their sheen(how much they shine). The more sheen a stone has, the more reflective it is.\n- Flamed/Matte Finish– Close to 0% sheen.\n- A rough, stone-like look. (can still be “polished” and sealed)\n- Honed Finish– Around 33% sheen.\n- Smoothed out, almost matte finish look that is perfect for floors and areas with heavy traffic like stairs and walkways.\n- Satin Finish– Around 66% sheen.\n- Is often referred to as a semi-polished finish, and looks marvellous on any floor, counter, or shower stall.\n- Polished Finish– Close to 100% sheen. With a high gloss, mirror-like appearance, polished finishes show off the stones markings and natural designs.\nRefinishing is the process by which natural stone surfaces are brought back to their original sheen and look. It can mean a honing or polishing done to the surface to make it look and feel better. It can also include repairs to cracks, scratches, and other minor damages.\nIt is a large scale option that works on entire homes, offices, or historical buildings. Restoration work is normally done when the surfaces have been neglected for many years, and a simple refinishing might not work anymore.\nPolishing your stone surfaces is a detail-oriented project. Before the work begins, all other surfaces adjacent to it will be thoroughly sealed off and taped over. The process might take more than a day or two depending on the size and extent to which the work has to be carried out. Shining powders and a lot of water will be used to buff out the minor scratches and other blemishes, so it is advised you stay away from the work area unless you are adequately protected.\nWhy Polish Your Stone Floors?\nPolishing stone floors is the only way to repair and restore damage to the stone’s crystals, which reflect light and give the natural stone its shiny surface. Over time, these crystals become dulled, crushed and even broken as a result of the wear caused by foot traffic as it grinds dirt and debris into the surface. By polishing dulled and damaged stone floors, homeowners not only restore the beauty of their room and enhance the light in the space, but they also add value to their home when this luxury addition regains its place as a focal point of a home.\nWhen and how often stone floors need polishing, however, isn’t easy to predict. A number of factors, but most specifically, the location of the room and the habits and lifestyle of the homeowners, play a role in the wear of a stone floor over time. For example, a stone floor in a high-traffic entryway needs polishing far more often than a stone floor in an out-of-the-way bathroom. Likewise, a home with a “no shoes” policy and a weekly cleaning ritual is more likely to have debris-free floors than one with two kids running in and out in muddy boots with busy parents who only clean floors periodically. It’s all relative.\nCleaning Stone Floors\nUnlike polishing, which is a long, deliberate process done as needed, cleaning stone floors is an important weekly ritual that helps prevent the type of damage that necessitates full polishing. Depending on the location and traffic of your floor, bi-weekly or daily cleaning might be a better option.\nTo clean a natural stone floor, use a soft cotton mop and warm water. For especially dirty surfaces, add a cleaning solution with a neutral pH, such as mild dish soap or a specialized natural stone cleaner.\nMaintaining Stone Floors\nIn addition to regular cleaning, there are a number of additional steps that homeowners can take to maintain their natural stone floors and thus increase the time period length between shining services. This includes:\n- Dust mopping frequently, daily if needed\n- Avoiding abrasive cleaners and any cleaner with an acidic pH, such as lemon juice or vinegar\n- Blotting up and cleaning stains as soon as possible\n- Using non-slip mats and rugs to protect the floor surface\n- Periodically resealing the floor to harden the surface\nNatural stone floors are a major home investment that can last for decades if properly cared for and maintained. For many homeowners, that means using the services of a flooring professional when it comes to polishing and repair.

73	pacific islander bird navigation techniques albatross climate impact	Pacific Island navigators used birds like the White Tern and Brown Tern to detect proximity to islands, with White Terns traveling up to 120 miles and Brown Terns up to 40 miles from land. Today, seabirds like albatrosses are being impacted by warming waters, which forces them to travel longer distances for food, disrupts their breeding patterns, and increases their stress hormones, leading to higher divorce rates and a decline in breeding couples to half their 1980s numbers.	['Traditional wayfinders of Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia relied solely on natural elements such as celestial bodies, the winds, swells, the climate, and birds to navigate their way through the vastness of the Pacific Ocean. Traditional wayfinding is the practice of navigating that encompasses these natural elements to provide guidance on voyages. Pacific Islanders shocked early English sailors with their ability to manage long distance voyages, a practice that dates back to about 3000 BCE. This incredible practice begs the question: how were these people able to navigate without any aid from the kinds of navigational tools that we often use today? One answer that has been argued by cultural scientist Harald Haarmann is that they were able to instrumentalize their “refined perception of natural phenomena.”1\nWayfinding was not always recognized as an established talent of ancient Pacific Islanders. Early-modern Europeans believed that early Polynesians had probably drifted off-course during routine travel and accidentally discovered islands throughout Oceania. It was not until Captain James Cook observed the native people of the Hawaiian Islands that the notion that they had advanced navigation techniques slowly started coming into light.2 The earliest estimated movement of people to Oceania was between 3200 and 2800 BCE.3 After more extensive studies, archaeologists today have been able to determine that ancient Pacific Islanders had settled several islands before they came in contact with European settlers. Evidence shows that between 1290 and 1120 BCE, islands of Melanesia and Micronesia were being settled. In another flow of migration between 1120 to 1025 BCE, a period of heavy migration to islands such as Hawaii, Rapa Nui, and New Zealand took place.4 To understand how these voyages were successfully executed without the use of navigational instruments, we will look at some methods that wayfinders used in order to sail their way across the Pacific.\nMaster navigators began by calibrating their positions according to celestial objects, such as the sun, the moon, and constellations. Stars rise in the East and set in the West. They first chose a primary set of stars and constellations, which they knew would eventually set on specific points on the horizon. When the view of the horizon became obstructed, for example, by clouds, they would need to reference a secondary set of stars in the night sky. When this happened, navigators had to recalibrate themselves “by glancing at any section of the night sky, much as we can by glimpsing any part of a thoroughly familiar room.”5 When faced with challenges regarding the obstruction of their view of the sky, navigators resorted to their observations of other directional indicators to orient themselves. By referencing waves and ocean swells, or by observing certain birds, navigators could find indication of their proximity to land.\nThere are two forms of fluctuations that navigators referenced when observing the ocean itself. The first were ocean waves. Waves are ignited by local winds, which are winds that are confined to small spatial areas that range “from a few miles to 100 miles in width.”6 Waves were increasingly useful directional indicators when embarking on inter-island travels. On the other hand, navigators referenced swells during long distance voyages because they were not easily influenced by abrupt changes in wind patterns. The endurance of swells can last from a week to a month.7 Their consistency is what allow them to be exceptional directional indicators. Navigators also occasionally referenced certain types of birds to determine their location. While it may be unsure what birds ancient navigators used to detect their proximity to islands, we can look at how those that still practice traditional wayfinding use birds as an aid for navigation.8 There are two birds that serve as the most prominent indicators. The White Tern and the Brown Tern both sleep on islands at night and at dawn they embark on fishing trips. The Brown Tern is known to travel about 40 miles out to sea, while the White Tern can travel as far as 120 miles out. When wayfinders detect these birds in the day, they closely keep track of them. When the sun gets low and the birds retreat, they use their flight paths to indicate the direction of the island. “They know the island is close even though they cannot see it.”9\nIt is incredible that ancient voyagers acquired the skills to look and feel their way through the Pacific. Their lack of technical navigational tools did not hinder their travels.10 This craft is still heavily practiced throughout Oceania. Although the practice was under threat of modernization and westernization, the Polynesian Voyaging Society, which is based in Honolulu, Hawaii, has gone to great lengths to lead a revitalization of traditional wayfinding.\n- Haarmann Harald and Claire Brennan, The Hawaiians and other Polynesian Seafarers Developed Navigation Methods Based on Observation of Constellations and Currents, So that They Could Sail Intentionally from Tahiti to Hawaii and Back (California: Santa Barbara, 2011), 262. ↵\n- M.

In recent decades, scientists have observed an unusual phenomenon: Albatrosses, who typically live for about 30-40 years without reproducing or dying of old age, are divorcing at a much greater rate than usual. Scientists believe that this is due to climate change and human activity on the oceans causing their food source to dwindle and less time spent breeding as a result.\nAlbatrosses are seabirds that have a high rate of divorce. The “us divorce rate 2020” is the number of divorces per 1,000 people in the United States.\nDivorce rates have been progressively increasing since the 1970s in numerous nations throughout the globe. However, it is surprising that albatrosses, who are famed for their sexual devotion and monogamy, have seen a continuous increase in divorce rates from 2% to 8% during the 1980s. This is a huge increase. What is the rationale for such a situation?\nAlbatrosses and their steadfastness\nAlbatrosses are big seabirds that may be found mostly in the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific. The fact that the couples remain together until one of them dies is a distinguishing trait of these birds. They are the most devoted lovers among the birds. They are true life partners. When one of the couple mates with a different albatross out of the partnership, they are said to have divorced. This is infidelity, and it corresponds to a divorce in their eyes.\nIn the Falkland Islands, a pair of black-browed albatrosses (Source: Pinterest)\nPreviously, their divorce rate was close to 0 percent. However, according to a recent research published in the Royal Society Journal, the divorce rate in this bird species has increased dramatically.\nThe albatross research that was just released\nIn the Falkland Islands, researchers studied 15500 breeding pairs of albatrosses. They spent 15 years researching them. Albatrosses, like people, usually take a long time to choose a life mate. They go through an uncomfortable developing period in which they attempt and sometimes fail to get into a partnership. They remain with each other for the rest of their lives if they are successful.\nAlbatrosses are a kind of bird that may be found in (Source: Polar latitudes)\nFrancesco Ventura, a co-author of the paper and a researcher at the University of Lisbon, said:\n“Monogamy and long-term relationships are fairly frequent for them,” says the author.\nHowever, their research revealed that these birds, who previously had a divorce rate of less than 1%, are now divorcing at a higher rate. This rate has risen to as high as 8% in recent years. According to 2017 statistics, the number of breeding couples has decreased to about half of what it was in the 1980s.\nThe cause of these schisms\nIn the Falkland Islands, increased divorce rates and declining breeding couple numbers are not a major problem, but they are concerning in other areas where albatross populations are restricted.\nThe increase in divorces among these seabirds is mostly attributed to environmental and climatic change, according to the experts. Water has warmed as a result of global warming. As a result, these birds have begun to divorce. Divorces used to be common after an unsuccessful breeding attempt. However, even when breeding is effective, divorces are increasingly common.\nDivorce rates among albatrosses have increased as a result of climate change (Source: Earth Life)\nThese marine birds are compelled to seek for and fly further into the ocean when the water temperature rises. Some may not be able to make it back in time for breeding season. Their companions then move on to a different albatross.\nFurthermore, stress hormones in these birds rise as a result of global warming. In addition to food shortages, breeding circumstances have become more difficult. Stress builds up, and there may be a ‘failed performance’ that leads to divorce. In conclusion, Francesco says:\n“Temperatures are rising and will continue to rise, perhaps causing further disturbances,” says the author.\nWatch This Video-\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhy do albatross divorce?\nA: Albatrosses sometimes divorce because of the long flight over water, which can cause them to become separated from their partner. They also often divorce when they are old or sick and feel that they have outlived a mate who is not capable of caring for themselves anymore.\nAre albatross monogamous?\nHow does climate change affect albatrosses?\nA: Albatrosses are a type of seabird that lives in the Southern Ocean, which is very sensitive to climate change. They have been observed pushing their nesting grounds further north due to warming ocean temperatures and sea level rise.\n- great albatross\n- average marriage length\n- top reasons for divorce 2020']	['<urn:uuid:cdcbaaa6-a49a-48f5-8248-d9ef546f5b2b>', '<urn:uuid:3db3d480-be48-436b-a158-34bc3c8adfb3>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	8	78	1840
74	How do scientists count and grow viruses in a lab setting, and what makes it particularly challenging to study them compared to other microorganisms?	Scientists count viruses using the plaque assay technique, where they mix virus particles with bacterial cells in a soft agar layer placed on top of a hard agar base. When one virus infects a cell, it replicates and creates a visible circular clearing (plaque) in the bacterial lawn, with each plaque representing one original virus particle. The number of plaques multiplied by the dilution factor determines the concentration of viruses, measured in Plaque Forming Units (PFU). As for growing viruses, this is particularly challenging because viruses cannot multiply outside living host cells, unlike bacteria which can grow on simple chemical media. They require living cells for replication, making them more complex and expensive to maintain, especially for viruses that only grow in higher primates and human hosts.	"['- To demonstrate the ability of bacteriophage to replicate inside a susceptible host cell.\n- To determine the concentration of phage particles in a suspension.\nBacteriophages (phage) are obligate intracellular parasites. They multiply inside a bacterium by making use of some or all of the host (ie., bacteria) biosynthetic machinery (viruses that infect bacteria are known as bacteriophage). They enter the bacterial cell by ‘landing’ on the cell wall and injecting their DNA into the bacterial cytoplasm. After entry, the phage DNA acts as a template for production of phage proteins. These proteins replicate the phage and subjugate the cell, eventually causing lysis and death of the host cell. A bacteriophage particle is even harder to see than a bacterium. Viruses are beyond the limits of resolution of the light microscope and can be seen only with electron microscopes. Fortunately, we can use a technique very similar to the colony-counting technique used to measure the number of bacteria to count phage particles, known as the plaque assay. Lytic phages are enumerated by this method.\nFig:- A typical phage\nThe plaque assay is originally a virological assay employed to count and measure the infectivity level of the bacteriophages. But later, it was applied to measure and count the mammalian viruses as well. This assay is the most widely used technique for the isolation of virus and its purification, and to optimize the viral titers. The basis of plaque assay is to measure the ability of a single infectious virus to form a “plaque” on a concurrent monolayer culture cells. A plaque is developed as a part of infection of one cell by a single virus particle that is followed by the replication of that virus, and finally, the death of the cell. The newly replicated virus particles will later infect and then kill surrounding cells.\nFor this technique, we will be provided with a virulent phage stock and a susceptible host cell culture. 10-fold dilutions of the phage stock are prepared. The procedure requires the use of a Double-Layer Agar (DLA) technique also known as double agar overlay method, in which the hard agar serves as a base layer (to form gel), and a mixture of few phage particles (diluted stock) and a very large number of host cells in a soft agar forms the upper overlay. When the plates are incubated, susceptible Escheria coli cells multiply rapidly and produce a lawn of confluent growth on the medium. When one phage particle adsorbs to a susceptible cell, penetrates the cell, replicates and release new phage particles which infect other bacteria in the vicinity of the initial host cell. The growth or spread of the new viruses is then restricted or limited to the neighbouring cells by the gel. This cycle is repeated until large numbers of bacteria have been destroyed. The destroyed cells produce single circular, non turbid areas called plaques in the bacterial lawn, where there is no growth of bacteria because the phage progeny originating from single virus particles have multiplied sufficiently to kill bacteria over an easily visible area. Eventually the plaque becomes too large to be visible to our naked eye. Each plaque represents the lysis of a phage-infected bacterial culture and can be designated as a plaque-forming unit (PFU) and is used to quantitate the number of infective phage particles in the culture. Dyes that stain the living cells are frequently used to enhance the contrast between the plaques and the living cells. Therefore the dead cells in the plaque will appear as unstained against the colored background. Only viruses that have the ability to cause visible damage of cells can be assayed using this way.\nThe number of phage particles contained in the original stock phage culture is determined by counting the number of plaques formed on the seeded agar plate and multiplying this by the dilution factor. For a valid phage count, the number of plaques per plate should not exceed 300 nor be less than 30. Plates showing greater than 300 PFUs are too numerous to count (TNTC); plates showing fewer than 30 PFUs are too few to count (TFTC).\nThe main difference between Plaque Assay and Colony-Counting is that, to count bacteria, we spread about 100 - 400 bacteria over the surface of the agar and incubate the plate. To count phage, we spread 100 - 400 phage particles mixed with a very large number of host bacterial cells over the surface of the agar and incubate the plate. In colony-counting, we directly observe the accumulation of large numbers of bacteria, each pile being a colony. In plaque formation, we directly observe the absence of bacteria against a background of dense bacterial growth, each zone of destruction being a phage plaque (hole) in the lawn of bacteria. Each hole represents one phage in the sample applied to the plate.', ""The fact that viruses cannot multiply outside a living host cell\ncomplicates their detection, enumeration, and identification.\nViruses must be provided with living cells instead of a fairly simple\nchemical medium. Living plants and animals are difficult and\nexpensive to maintain. and pathogenic viruses that grow only in\nhigher primates and human hosts cause additional complications.\nHowever, viruses that usc bacterial cells as a host (bacteriophages)\nare rather easily grown on bacterial cultures. This is one\nreason so much of our understanding of viral multiplication has\ncome from bacteriophages.\nGrowing Bacteriophages in the Laboratory:\nBacteriophages can be grown either in suspensions of bacteria in\nliquid media or in bacterial cultures on solid media. The use of\nsolid media makes possible the plaque method for detecting and\ncounting viruses. A sample of bacteriophage is mixed with host\nbacteria and melted agar. The agar containing the bacteriophages\nand host bacteria is then poured into a Petri plate containing a\nhardened layer of agar growth medium. The virus-bacteria mixture\nsolidifies into a thin top layer that contains a layer of bacteria\napproximately one cell thick. Each virus infects a bacterium,\nmultiplies, and releases several hundred new viruses. These\nnewly produced viruses infect other bacteria in the immediate\nvicinity, and more new viruses are produced. Following several\nviral multiplication cycles, all the bacteria in the area surrounding\nthe original virus are destroyed. This produces a number of\nclearings, or plaques, visible against a lawn of bacterial growth on the surface of the agar. While the plaques from,\nuninfected bacteria elsewhere in the Petri plate multiply rapidly\nand produce a turbid background.\nEach plaque theoretically corresponds to a single virus in the\ninitial suspension. Therefore, the concentrations of viral suspensions\nmeasured by the number of plaques are usually given in terms of Plaque Forming Unit(PFU).\nGrowing Animal Viruses in the laboratory\nIn the laboratory, three methods are commonly used for culturing\nanimal viruses. These methods involve using living animals,\nembryonated eggs, or cell cultures.\nIn Living Animals:\nSome animal viruses can be cultured only in living animals, such\nas mice, rabbits, and guinea pigs. Most experiments to study the\nimmune system's response to viral infections must also be performed\nin virally infected live animals. Animal inoculation may\nbe used as a diagnostic procedure for identifying and isolating a\nvirus from a clinical specimen. After the animal is inoculated\nwith the specimen, the animal is observed for signs of disease or\nis killed so that infected tissues can be examined for the virus.\nSome human viruses cannot be grown in animals or can be\ngrown but do not cause disease. The lack of natural animal models for AIDS has slowed our understanding of its disease\nprocess and prevented experimentation with drugs that inhibit\ngrowth of the virus in vivo. Chimpanzees can be infected with\none subspecies of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV- l, genus\nLentivirus ), but because they do not show symptoms of the disease,\nthey cannot be used to study the effects of viral growth and\ndisease treatments. AIDS vaccines are presently being tested in\nhumans, but the disease progresses so slowly in humans that it\ncan take years to determine the effectiveness of these vaccines. In\n1986, simian AIDS (an immunodeficiency disease of green monkeys)\nwas reported, followed in 1987 by feline AIDS (an immunodeficiency\ndisease of domestic cats). These diseases are caused by lentiviruses, which are closely related to HIV, and the diseases develop within a few months, thus providing model for studying viral growth in different tissues.\nIn 1990, a way to infect mice\nwith human AIDS was found when immunodeficient mice were\ngrafted to produce human T cells and human gamma globulin.\nThe mice provide a reliable model for studying viral replication,\nalthough they do not provide models for vaccine development.\nIn Embryonated Eggs:\nIf the virus will grow in an embryonated egg, this can be a fairly\nconvenient and inexpensive form of host for many animal viruses.\nA hole is drilled in the shell of the embryonated egg, and a viral\nsuspension or suspected virus-containing tissue is injected into the\nfluid of the egg. There are several membranes in an egg, and the\nvirus is injected near the one most appropriate for its growth. Viral growth is signaled by the death of the embryo, by embryo cell damage, or by the formation of typical pocks or\nlesions on the egg membranes. This method was once the most\nwidely used method of viral isolation and growth, and it is still\nused to grow viruses for some vaccines. For this reason, you may\nbe asked if you are allergic to eggs before receiving a vaccination,\nbecause egg proteins may be present in the viral vaccine preparations.\nIn Cell Cultures:\nCell cultures have replaced embryonated eggs as the preferred\ntype of growth medium for many vi ruses. Cell cultures consist of\ncells grown in culture media in the laboratory. Because these cultures\nare generally rather homogeneous collections of cells and\ncan be propagated and handled much like bacterial cultures, they\nare more convenient to work with than whole animals or embryonated eggs.\nCell culture lines are started by treating a slice\nwith enzymes that separate the individual cells .\nThese cells are suspended in a solution that provides the osmotic\npressure, nutrients, and growth factors needed for the cells to\ngrow. Normal cells tend to adhere to the glass or plastic container\nand reproduce to form a monolayer. Viruses infecting such a\nmonolayer sometimes cause the cells of the monolayer to deteriorate\nas they multiply. This cell deterioration is called cytopathic\neffect (CPE) . CPE can be detected and\ncounted in much the same way as plaques caused by bacteriophages\non a lawn of bacteria and reported as PFU /mL\nViruses may be grown in primary or continuous cell lines.\nPrimary cell lines, derived from tissue slices, tend to die out\nafter only a few generations. Certain cell lines, called diploid cell\nlines, developed from human embryos can be maintained for\nabout 100 generations and are widely used for culturing viruses\nthat require a human host. Cell lines developed from embryonic\nhuman cells are used to culture rabies virus for a rabies vaccine\ncalled human diploid culture vaccine .\nWhen viruses are routinely grown in a laboratory, continuous\ncell lines are used. These are transformed (cancerous) cells that\ncan be maintained through an indefinite number of generations,\nand they are sometimes called immortal cell lines . One of these, the HeLa cell\nline, was isolated from the cancer of a woman (Henrietta Lacks)\nwho died in 1951. After years of laboratory cultivation, many such\ncell lines have lost almost all the original characteristics of the cell,\nbut these changes have not interfered with the use of the cells for\nviral propagation. In spite of the success of cell culture in viral\nisolation and growth, there are still some viruses that have never\nbeen successfully cultivated in cell culture.\nThe idea of cell culture dates back to the end of the nineteenth\ncentury, but it was not a practical laboratory technique.\nCited By Kamal Singh Khadka\nMsc Microbiology, TU""]"	['<urn:uuid:b005e392-9095-4255-b71b-2c2ae8e604c1>', '<urn:uuid:8cf776bb-5ba0-4018-aa7a-020bf14ef1be>']	open-ended	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	24	127	1992
75	What international collaborations exist for environmental standards, and how are they validated?	International collaborations include agreements with China, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Brazil, and US for supporting coherent life cycle data and methods, as well as formal interactions with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development for developing carbon eco-labels. There's also collaboration with UNEP for global interactions on life cycle data and methods, and contribution to the Toolkit for Persistent Organic Pollutants. Validation occurs through established standards - for instance, the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) requires third-party verification and follows UNFCCC requirements and IPCC guidelines, while projects seeking certification must undergo rigorous auditing to comply with leading standards like the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard.	"['The ENSURE Action provides the knowledge-basis for policies and\ncommunity initiatives that target specific issues related to end-of-life\nprocesses, such as reducing risks of dioxin emissions from incineration\nor assessing contaminated sites.

These not only support\nend-of-life policies, but equally the closely related environmental\nassessment needs of eco-design applications in general, of eco-labels\nsuch as carbon footprints, the assessment of indirect environmental\neffects in eco-management and auditing schemes (EMAS), as well as\nidentification of the important attributes in environmental technology verification (ETV).\nRobust foundations for SCP are assured by expertise through the European\nPlatform on LCA, established by DG ENV with the JRC\'s IES. This supports\nthe development of the International Reference Life Cycle Data System\n(ILCD) as well as the European Reference Life Cycle Database (ELCD).\nWith ESTAT, working also closely with the EEA and DG ENV via the\nEnvironmental Data Centres, life cycle based indicators are being\ndeveloped for wastes, products, and natural resources to facilitate SCP\nmonitoring at the EU and Member State levels. These SCP indicators\naccount for the environmental impacts and resources consumed that are\nassociated with goods and services, taking into account their supply,\nuse, as well as end-of-life processes. These equally provide important\nsub-indicators, such as Carbon Footprints as well as the basis to monitor environmental and economic decoupling.\nComplementing these broad assessments, the ENSURE Action provides\ncutting-edge modelling and monitoring for specific end-of-life issues.\nIn supporting specific policy support needs, these research activities\nequally contribute to international initiatives such as the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs).\nBringing together the life cycle, analytical, and modelling expertise,\npilot studies focus on services such as wastewater treatment including\nsewage sludge as well as on end-of-life processes linked to biowaste,\ncomposting, recycling, contaminated sites, managing construction waste and waste-to-energy (biofuels).\nKey International Activities\n- Neighbouring countries, candidate countries, and other Non European\nUnion Nations: Agreements with China, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Brazil,\nand US in relation to supporting internationally coherent and\nquality-assured life cycle data, methods, and studies, as required by\nthe Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) Action Plan.\n- Formal interactions with World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to contribute to developing a robust,\nquality-assured life cycle basis for the Carbon eco-labels (footprints),\nincluding as an input to international standards, private schemes, and activities of DG ENV.\n- United Nations Environment Program (UNEP): 1) Implementation of\nEC/UNEP MoU and JRC/UNEP Collaboration Agreement in relation to global\ninteractions for coherent and quality-assured life cycle data, methods,\nand studies. 2) to contribute to the development of the Toolkit for\nPersistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)/Dioxin emissions in the frame of the Stockholm Convention implementation.', 'Standards for Selling Carbon Offsets\nMCDI is preparing its REDD project to meet the highest of certification standards for both a potential regulated carbon market (adopted under the UNFCCC process) and for the existing voluntary carbon market. The global community has spent years trying to iron out the details of a REDD+ mechanism under the UNFCCC, but negotiations have yet to result in a fully operational mechanism in place (and some believe an agreement won’t be reached until 2020). Therefore, the only REDD credits being sold and traded today are being done through the voluntary carbon market, which has a number of different voluntary offset standards to choose from.\nMCDI is pursuing validation from the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard (CCB Standard), two leading standards which are commonly used in concert to verify combined carbon offsets and co-benefits (social and environmental). We will ensure that the project is successfully audited to comply with these leading standards.\nAbout the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)\nThe Verified Carbon Standard is the most widely used standard on the voluntary market today and is closely aligned with the draft UNFCCC requirements and IPCC guidelines. VCS certifies the greenhouse gas reduction of a carbon project. Upon third-party verification, VCS issues Voluntary Carbon Units (VCUs), which represents emission reductions of one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (C02e). VCS has a carbon registry where carbon credits can be bought, sold and retired.\nProjects must follow approved methodologies to prove that emission reductions are real. In addition, VCS requires that all VCUs represent GHG emission reductions or removals that are real, measurable, additional, permanent, independently verified, conservatively estimated, uniquely numbered and transparently listed.\nDeveloping a Methodology for VCS Validation\nThe VCS accepts any methodology that has been approved under the United Nation’s Clean Development Mechanism. It also has a host of already approved VCS methodologies that project developers can use to quantify their project’s emissions reductions. However, for some projects, such as is the case with MCDI, there is no appropriate methodology that currently exists, and VCS allows project developers to develop their own methodology, which then needs to be assessed and validated by VCS through their methodology approval process.\nMCDI is taking a unique approach to emissions reductions by focusing on generating carbon offsets by reducing fire intensity and frequency in the VLFRs where we work. We’ve adopted this approach after assessing the various drivers of deforestation in the region and identified fire as having the most significant impact on deforestation rates. So far there are no other existing REDD+ projects that focus on fire management in dry forests. Consequently, we are required to develop an innovative methodology and management practices to allow us to proceed with this approach (see assessing carbon stocks to learn more).\nTherefore, working with our partners, MCDI is currently developing a new VCS methodology that will be suitable for the forest type and drivers of deforestation that apply to our project area. We seek to make our methodology as applicable as possible so that it can be widely used by anyone wishing to fund fire management in such ecosystems via the carbon market. We have partnered with an expert on the VCS methodology development process who will assist us in finalizing the methodology and seek approval and validation through VCS. If our methodology is approved it could open up a whole new frontier in REDD+ opportunities given that miombo woodlands stretch across some 2.8 million km2 of southern Africa, one of the largest expanses of fire-affected dryland forests in the world.\nAbout the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard\nThe CCB Standard is a project design standard that provides guidance and a host of regulatory steps for projects to demonstrate the multiple benefits of their land-based carbon projects. CCB Standard does not issue or register carbon credits, but instead validates a project’s socio-economic and environmental co-benefits on top of its ability to deliver robust and credible greenhouse gas reductions. The achievement of CCB Standard is typically used in conjunction with another standard (most commonly VCS) to certify a project’s carbon credits.\nBoth FSC and the CCB standards require biodiversity to be monitored in certified forests.\nWorking with our partner, Ecological Initiatives / Carbon Tanzania, MCDI has identified an appropriate biodiversity monitoring strategy that is designed, so far as it is possible, to track biodiversity responses to early burning and improved fire management. Over time we expect improved fire management practices will lead to a slow habitat shift towards thicker forest, with some wooded savannah transforming into woodland, and some woodland becoming forest. The biomass increases this will represent will be what the project sells in terms of carbon offsets.\nMCDI’s community-based biodiversity monitoring method focuses on three selected indicator bird species, as well as opportunistic recording of large mammals, with data collected by community patrol teams in the REDD project villages. In addition, we intend to add a second strand of expert-led monitoring looking at relative species abundance in birds. As well as looking at broad scale shifts in the commonest birds, we will also use this to look for changes in ground-nesting birds which, we hypothesise, will be the most likely to be impacted by changes to the fire regime amongst those taxonomic groups which are relatively easy to monitor.']"	['<urn:uuid:acafddce-8bcf-4e79-a652-42e4d68330c0>', '<urn:uuid:38d9bc66-ab5f-4e90-ae10-4195e1cf46b0>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	12	103	1453
76	Which environmental benefits do OpenTEAM and urban farming provide?	OpenTEAM helps mitigate climate change through improved soil health management and carbon measurement at the farm level. Urban farming, as practiced by the Michigan Urban Farming Initiative, reduces environmental impact by minimizing transportation distances, recycling waste, rotating crops to maintain soil health, and utilizing vacant land instead of developing new rural farmland.

With OpenTEAM, farmers are not only in control of their own data, but also able to enter data once to access all available tools in the OpenTEAM collaborative.\nOpenTEAM offers field-level carbon measurement, digital management records, remote sensing, predictive analytics and input and economic management decision support in a connected platform that reduces the need for farmer data entry while improving access to a wide array of tools. The platform will support adaptive soil health management for farms of all scales, geographies and production systems. OpenTEAM will also accelerate scientific understanding of soil health by providing more high-quality data to researchers collaborating on the project.\nTo date, more than one dozen organizations have joined to develop, fund, and implement OpenTEAM. These include The Soil Health Partnership; General Mills; Colorado State University/USDA-NRCS Comet Farm; Applied GeoSolutions, LLC; DNDC Applications, Research and Training; Dagan, Inc.; Michigan State University Global Change Learning Lab; Purdue University Open Technology and Systems Center (OATS); University of British Columbia Center for Sustainable Food Systems; Regen Network; Our.Sci; Quick Carbon is a growing academic research initiative and protocol for rapidly assessing soil carbon contents across landscapes.

We believe that challenges unique to the Michigan community (e.g., vacant land, poor diet, nutritional illiteracy, and food insecurity) present a unique opportunity for community-supported agriculture. Using agriculture as a platform to promote education, sustainability, and community—while simultaneously reducing socioeconomic disparity—we hope to empower urban communities.\nOur core values reflect what is truly important to MUFI and its members. They provide the foundation for our motives, strategies, and implementation. The core values of MUFI are as follows\n""Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day; teach him to fish and he will eat for life."" By viewing urban farming and gardening as an educational opportunity we are hoping to provide a long term solution to the problem of food insecurity in urban areas. When people develop new skills they become actively engaged in the learning process. Through a combination of workshops and fieldwork, we hope to educate the citizen farmers and provide hands-on experience necessary for successful food production.\nMost food is currently produced with synthetic fertilizers and pesticides that are derived from fossil fuels. Fields are often planted with monoculture crops that deplete the soil of the same nutrients. This food is then processed and transported far distances by diesel burning semi trucks. The reliance of our nation on the finite resources of fossil fuels is polluting our atmosphere and compromising our security. Growing food locally minimizes environmental impacts on a local and global scale. When waste is recycled and crops are rotated, minimal fertilizer is needed to maintain high yields. Through using abandoned and vacant land, we also lessen the need to develop more farmland in rural areas.\nBy building relationships with the community we are better able to acheive our objective. Far to often organizations identify struggling populations, raise some money, build something, and give themselves a pat on the back as they leave, never to be seen or heard from again. This is not an effective strategy in engendering long term and sustainable change.\nSome challenges we hope to target:\nSome recent additions to the Michigan scenery include abandoned buildings and houses, unkempt land, and other poorly used spaces. Redeveloping these locations into food producing plots would be make them valuable assets to any community.\nWith the current state of Michigan\'s economy, a large community of unemployed people exists. These people are not bound by the constraints of 9-to-5 employment and may have more time available to participate in community service projects. Community farming can support a healthy lifestyle, especially in times of limited income.\nAccess to nutritious food\nUrban areas have particular difficulty providing consistent access to nutritious food and fresh produce. Such circumstances are particularly acute in low-income neighborhoods, where people may not have access to transportation. Local urban gardens and farms provide a source of fresh, affordable produce available to the whole community.\nFood miles and nutrition information\nMany people are disconnected from their food and where it comes from. We intend to provide ongoing educational opportunities for the community concerning the growing and harvesting of produce, in addition to its nutritional value. We want people to develop a certain consciousness about where their food comes from and their role in the process.']"	['<urn:uuid:09557d1a-c813-46b3-86f7-ee1afce9a6ef>', '<urn:uuid:d0f2ab56-9423-4883-8ce7-b0409a87d0f2>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	comparison	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	9	52	1440
77	Which involves more supernatural elements, Kitano-Tenmangu's origin or Hoterasu's logo?	Kitano-Tenmangu's origin has more supernatural elements, involving the ghost of Sugawara no Michizane causing disasters in Kyoto after his death, while Hoterasu's logo is simply an umbrella made of the sun with no supernatural significance.	['It is often said that the Japanese have a unique attitude towards law. Many explanations have been offered for why this is so, and in what circumstances:\n•Japan is a civilization that respects human life more than Europe (former Minister of Justice Kunio Hatoyama explaining why Japan still has the death penalty — yes, you read that right);\n•A unique characteristic of Japanese parents is that they will tolerate anything for the sake of their children (a Japanese family court manual);\n•Japan is a Confucian culture, unlike the incest-ridden, gun-toting West (a well-known commentator on divorce and family issues);\n•Japan has its own corporate culture, and therefore foreign investors should not just be allowed to come in and buy up Japanese companies for cash in order to run them for their own benefit (the Tokyo High Court in a high-profile case of a foreign private equity fund trying to take over a Japanese firm):\n•And, of course, the ever-popular “Japanese people don’t go to court to resolve their problems” (taxi drivers, the man on the street, and just about everyone else).\nForeign legal scholars such as Mark Ramseyer and John Haley are renowned for their efforts to provide competing hypotheses involving economic theory (Japanese people act economically rationally within the context of how their legal system works) or explanations of the institutional constraints imposed on people trying to resolve problems or achieve change through the legal system in Japan.\nSadly, I have little to add to the big picture in this debate, and as a foreigner I am totally unqualified to speak about the “legal consciousness” of the Japanese people on a first-hand basis. I will nonetheless offer my own two cents on one feature of the Japanese legal system that probably is truly unique: cartoon mascots. The country probably has more “image characters” (as they are also called) used in law- and government-related PR than any other country on Earth.\nGiven how the Japanese police make a concerted effort to remind people of their presence on billboards, posters and placards everywhere (including multilingual versions of “A Place Policemen Patrol” signs at banks and other locations, presumably intended to dissuade shifty foreigners from their criminal propensities), Pipo-kun, the vaguely creepy mascot of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, is the character most likely to be recognized by many readers. With big ears (for listening to the people), anime eyes (for looking into every nook and cranny of society) and an antenna (for, uh, more listening, apparently), smiling pictures of Pipo-kun are a common feature in a wide variety of police PR in the capital.\nI once thought that his name came from the sound of a police siren (“pi-po” in Japanese onomatopoeia), but it is actually derived from a contraction of “pipuru” (people) and “police.” At this point some readers may feel that I could have at least included an official graphic of Pipo-kun, but since someone was recently prosecuted for criminal trademark infringement for selling T-shirts showing a stick figure holding a gun to the head of a silhouette of him, I’m not taking any chances.\nAnother character who some visitors to Japan may have noticed at the airports is Kasutamu-kun, the pudgy pooch modeled on a drug-sniffing dog and used by customs authorities to welcome people to Japan while telling them not to bring in drugs or fake Louis Vuitton handbags. Fewer travelers, however, are likely to have seen the Tokyo Immigration Bureau’s mascot bird, Toripu; the only place I have seen it is on a notice from the bureau inviting visa overstayers to avail themselves of the government’s “return order” program. Those who leave Japan under a return order are only prohibited from coming back for a year rather than the five- or 10-year period that would otherwise apply.\nSince police and immigration officials are occasionally implicated in alleged human rights abuses, it might be fun to see their mascots square off against the Ministry of Justice’s human rights champions, Jinken Mamoru-kun and Jinken Ayumi-chan (names which mean “protect” and “advance” human rights). It might not be much of a match, however, since Mamoru and Ayumi mostly appear in PR exhorting Japanese people to be considerate of other people’s feelings and to think more about human rights, rather than anything dealing with, say, prolonged detention, forced confessions or the right to counsel. In Japan it apparently the Japanese people rather than the police or other government actors who are the biggest abusers of human rights.\nAyumi and Mamoru would also be heavily outnumbered since, in addition to Tokyo’s Pipo-kun, prefectural police forces around the country have created a virtual menagerie of law enforcement mascots. Most of these are animal-themed, though the Nagasaki cops have a robot named Catch and the Toyama prefectural police avatar is an anthropomorphic mountain. The law enforcement team would be further bolstered by the mascots developed by regional prosecutors’ offices. The three statute-book-toting ninja representing the district prosecutors’ office in Tsu, Mie Prefecture, look particularly dangerous, the cartoon peanut chosen by the Chiba prosecutors less so, though his name — Rakkaseigi-kun — is a nice pun meaning “Peanut Justice Boy.” Just don’t call the nice man with the badge that when you ask to speak to your lawyer.\nMamoru and Ayumi could seek aid from a host of regional human rights mascots, like Kurashiki’s Kupitto, a white blobby-looking creature clutching an enormous red heart to her chest, or Kumamoto’s Kokkoro, a weedy-looking sprite with a flower hat and wings shaped like a heart. But the human rights mascots tend to all look happy yet frail, unlikely to stand up to the fangs, teeth, throwing stars and walking mountains arrayed against them. But perhaps the police mascots too are mostly interested in badgering the citizenry to behave properly.\nSome bar associations have also joined the struggle by soliciting designs for their own characters. The Okayama Bar Association recently rolled out Tasuppi, a slightly bizarre-looking creature with a peach-shaped head (Okayama being famous for peaches), atop which are perched the scales of justice. Tasuppi’s name effectively means “Help Peach,” derived from the Japanese for “help” and the English for “peach.”\nThe Kyoto Bar Association also just introduced a character devoted to lobbying for greater transparency in the criminal justice system, specifically the full recording of police interrogations. This is perhaps the only mascot I have seen which is neither smiling nor childish-looking. A serious-looking deer holding a camera, its name — Kashikashika — is another play on words, combining the nuance “there must be transparency” (kashikashikanai) with the word for deer (shika). While I personally quite like this mascot and am happy to finally see one that doesn’t appear to have been designed with kindergarten students in mind, some online commentary has noted that Kashikashika looks a bit, well, criminal. Given the number of grumpy-looking perverts who get arrested for doing things with cameras, perhaps it’s a fair comment.\nThis is not the only example where one is left wondering how much thought went into legal system-related graphic design. The logo for Hoterasu, Japan’s government-sponsored legal aid system, is an umbrella made out of the sun. While a perfectly nice, professional-looking image, it suggests either a sun parasol that bathes you in UV radiation or a rain umbrella that you never actually need — oddly mixed messages indeed.\nOne of the stamps the government issued to mark the start of the lay judge system in 2009 seemed to convey a similarly confused message. It features nine birds (presumably representing the three professional judges and six lay judges who compose the panels now used to decide serious criminal trials) sitting on a scale. Easily-startled, bird-brained creatures deciding how the scales of justice will tilt by sitting on them — a far-from-reassuring image!\nNo discussion on the subject of mascots (or lay judges) would be complete without mentioning Saiban-inko, the cartoon parakeet developed by the Fukuoka prosecutors’ office to publicize the lay judge system used in some criminal trials since 2009. With yet another pun name (saibanin = lay judge, inko = parakeet), this image character got some high-profile publicity in 2008 when Justice Minister Hatoyama was shown on television wearing a Saiban-inko costume as part of the PR effort leading up to the system’s introduction.\nPersonally, I think this particular incident illustrates something very important about how government works in Japan — I’m just not sure what it is. Is it a matter of the bureaucrats being so in control of everything that they can just decide “Hey, let’s get our minister to wear a bird costume after his next Cabinet meeting” and actually make it happen? Or is the minister in fact so powerful that he can announce to his underlings, “Today, I shall wear the parakeet costume on national television,” and nobody can do anything to stop him? Neither answer is particularly reassuring.\nTo be fair, Mr. Hatoyama may have just been doing his bit for the kids, since cartoon mascots are frequently used on government websites and other PR for children. This is probably a good thing, given how dull some of the things government does can be. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has Denpa-kun (radio-wave boy), a cartoon superhero with a cape and lightning-bolt hair, to help teach children how to use radio waves in compliance with the Radio Law. Meanwhile, over at the National Personnel Authority, Koh-chan, another blobby white character with a big “K” on her chest is available to bore innocent elementary and junior high school students into submission by helping to explain how the bureaucracy is administered.\nAlthough not directly related to the legal system, it is probably timely to mention some of the cartoon mascots deployed to help explain how, er, safe nuclear power is. There is Puruto-kun, the image character used by nuclear authorities to market plutonium-fueled nuclear power. He even appears in a cartoon explaining how safe plutonium is — safe enough to be swallowed (he explains this while holding hands with a little boy drinking a glass of water presumably laced with plutonium). Just try not to inhale any, he is careful to add. (You used to be able to see the whole video on YouTube, but it has recently been removed, apparently due to Japan Atomic Energy Agency complaints about copyright infringement.).\nThere is also Nato-chan, whose mission is to spread the word about the sodium (natrium) cooling process in fast-breeder reactors such as the Monju plant in Fukui (which, despite being Extremely Safe, suffered a major accident in 1995 followed by an embarrassing attempted coverup).\nThe Fukushima Prefecture Nuclear Power Marketing Association has Uran-chan, a purple-clad pixie with a glowing wand who helps explain nuclear power on the association’s website, though she doesn’t appear to be taking any questions these days. And then there is Gen-chan, the very happy and very radioactive-looking mascot of the Environmental Radioactivity Research Institute of Miyagi Prefecture. Poor Genchan seems to have little to do, though, since the institute’s website was last updated in July 2010 (nothing noteworthy has happened since then, I guess).\nUsing child-friendly media to explain the functioning of government is hardly unique to Japan. In the U.S., even the once super-secret National Security Agency now has a website for children called Crypto-Kids, featuring the Cyber-Twins. The difference is that Japanese cartoon mascots are often used to send messages to children and adults alike. Kasutamu-kun is used on the customs authority website to invite people to report smuggling activities. Pipo-kun (and his family!) appear on the Tokyo Metropolitan Police website in a number of places that children would not normally look — their page telling people not to send money to telephone fraudsters, for example. And Tappy and Mirai, the pair of cute cartoon dogs used as mascots by Osaka Prefecture, probably have nothing to say to children at all, since they are used to encourage adults to pay their taxes (Tappy’s name, by the way, is derived from the seemingly oxymoronic combination of “tax” and “happy”).\nThe integral part that manga and anime play in Japanese culture may go some way toward explaining this, but I suspect two other factors are at work. One is the general tendency of Japan’s nanny state to treat even its adult citizens as children, and its children as idiots. The other is just my own pet theory: Although becoming a public servant may ensure fabulous job security, it is also likely to involve decades of boring administrative tasks. The occasional opportunity to participate in something fun, like the creation of yet another mascot character (possibly at the taxpayer’s expense) may thus function as a type of perk for some public servants, helping to diffuse the vast amount of tedium and frustrated creativity that doubtless accumulate within the bureaucracy.\nWhatever the reason for their existence, the plethora of cartoon mascots that decorate legal and governmental institutions add some much-needed color to an area of life most Japanese people doubtless find soporific. I would, however, venture to point out one glaring omission from this mascot menagerie: the death penalty. For some reason there is still no smiling image character helpfully explaining to children and adults alike why the death penalty still exists and how it is carried out. The need for a child-friendly spokes-mascot is arguably even greater now, since the Supreme Court recently affirmed death sentences for murderers who were legal minors at the time of their crimes. The obvious choice of character would be a cartoon crane named Tsuru-chan or Tsuru-kun, “tsuru” being another pun on the words for “crane” and “hang.” That cranes have long necks would be an added bonus. Sometimes these articles just write, or in this case draw, themselves.\nColin P. A. Jones is a professor at Doshisha Law School in Kyoto.

Send comments and ideas to email@example.com', 'April 16, 2004\nby SHINGU Saori\nAt the beginning of the year, Japanese peoplevisit a shrine or a temple to pray for their happiness in the coming year. This characteristic Japanese custom is called hatsumo(－)de. There are many kinds of shrines and temples in Kyoto, and they each have a divine grace: for health, good-luck, happiness, and peace. They also have special functions which are connected with the new year.\nIn 951 AD, Kuya-shonin, the second son of the Emperor Daigo, opened Rokuhara-Mitsuji Temple in Higashiyama, Kyoto. He travelled around Japan preaching the invocation of Namu Amida Butsu and dispersing evil sprits. In 951 AD, the Emperor Murakami suffered from a serious illness, so Kuya-shonin went around Japan preaching again, visited people who were sick, and let them drink his tea. After that, the Emperor Murakami recovered completely, so the tea became famous. This custom has continued until now, although the style has changed, and people can drink it only during the first three days of the new year.\nThis special tea ceremony, O(－)buku-cha, is held from January 1st to the 3rd at Rokuhara-Mitsuji Temple. People drink it hoping for good health for the whole year. This tea contains Japanese apricot and tangle which is a type of seaweed. You can enjoy the taste which is different from the usual Japanese green tea in the Japanese atmosphere of the temple.\nprogress for calligraphy / success in studies\nFudehajime-sai / Tenma-gaki\nKitano-Tenmangu Shrine is dedicated to Sugawara no Michizane, an ancient politician, poet, and calligrapher. He showed literary talent from his childhood and became active in the government as a public servant when he grew up. During the reign of the Emperor Daigo, Sugawara no Michizane was the second most important minister in the government, and enjoyed the fullest confidence of the Emperor. Someone who was jealous of him made a false charge that Sugawara no Michizane had betrayed the Emperor. The Emperor Daigo didn’t trust Sugawara no Michizane, so he sent him to a distant island, Dazaifu. Sugawara no Michizane was disappointed and passed away 2 years later in exile. After he died, Kyoto, the capital, suffered a series of disasters: epidemics, fires, and other natural calamities. People were afraid, and rumors began that these calamities were caused by the ghost of Sugawara no Michizane. In 987 AD, the Emperor Ichijo gave him a divine title, Kitano-Tenmangu Tenjin, as a token of the Emperor’s gratitude for his efforts and prayed that Sugawara no Michizane would restrain his anger. Since then, this shrine has been visited by not only the general public but also by the Japanese Imperial Family. Also, this shrine houses the god of studies, so many students who are preparing for their examinations visit there every year.\nFudehajime-sai and Tenma-gaki are held from January 2nd to the 4th. On January 2nd, people pray to Sugawara no Michizane for the success of Tenma-gaki is and for calligraphy achievement. After that, from the 2nd to the 4th, people do their first calligraphy of the year, kakizome and pray that they will improve their ability. This is called Tenma-gaki, an event connected to the excellent calligrapher, Sugawara no Michizane.

Ebisu is one of the Seven Deities of Good Fortune, and he presides over wealth.\nToka-Ebisu, which goes by the name of Hatsu-Ebisu, is connected with his grace and is held from January 8th to the 12th annually. During these days, visitors can receive precious things: bamboo grass, a straw bag, a bamboo rake, a charm, an amulet, a gold coin and other special good luck items. Above all, the bamboo grass with a straight, elastic trunk and leaves that don’t wither quickly is a symbol of success in business. Also, kagura which is sacred Shinto music and dance is held all night during Toka Ebisu.\nThese are only a few examples of New Year’s events in Kyoto.

79	I've noticed my cucumbers taste a bit strange near the ends - is there a way I should be cutting them to avoid any bad taste?	Yes, you should cut 1/4 off the ends of the cucumbers to avoid the 'bitter end'. The bitter compound is typically more concentrated in the stem end than in the blossom end of the cucumber. It's also more common in the peel and the light green area just beneath the peel, and less likely to be found in the deeper interior of the fruit. After peeling, remember to rinse your knife.

80	As a racing historian, I wonder how did Lotus and Senna's paths intersect?	Senna raced with Lotus from 1985 to 1987, finishing fourth in driver rankings in 1985 and 1986, and third in 1987. It was during his time at Lotus in 1987 that Senna began his crucial relationship with Honda. After Senna left Lotus, the team struggled, achieving only seven wins in the rest of the decade, six of which were thanks to Senna.	['Ayrton Senna da Silva was born on March 21, 1960, to a wealthy family in Sao Paulo, Brazil. His father, Milton, was a factory owner and landowner and his mother Neide Senna da Silva was the granddaughter of Italian immigrants. The couple already had a daughter, Viviane, and soon after Ayrton’s birth, they welcomed another son, Leonardo.\nSenna took a liking to sports at an early age, excelling in gymnastics and a few other sports. However, he suffered poor coordination and motor function. He took a special liking to cars around the age of 4 and by 7 was driving a Jeep around his family’s farm and changing gears without using a clutch.\nHis first experience in racing came around the age of 13, racing go-karts in his home country of Brazil. He started his first race in pole position and led most of the race before colliding with an opponent. He went on to win the South American Kart Championship in 1977. He competed in the Karting World Championship every year from 1978 to 1982 and finished in second place in 1979 and 1980.\nIn 1981, Senna moved to England to begin sing-seat racing with the Van Diemen team. He won the RAC and the Townsend Thoresen Formula Ford 1600 Championships in his first year in England. Despite his success in racing, Senna felt pressure to join the family business back in Brazil. He announced his retirement and headed home to his family. However, this did not last long. Before he left England, Senna was offered to drive with the Formula Ford 2000 team. Senna took this offer and moved back to England, officially adopting his mother’s surname, as his father’s, da Silva, is one of the most common in Brazil.\nUpon his return to racing, Senna won the 1982 British and European Formula Ford 2000 championships. In 1983, Senna raced in the British Formula Three Championship and won the championship in a closely-contested race. In 1984, Senna began racing with Toleman where he finished ninth in the Drivers’ Championship.\nIn 1985, Senna began his relationship with Lotus, with whom he would race for until 1987. In 1985 he finished fourth in the driver rankings, fourth in 1986, and third in 1987. It was in 1987 that Senna began a relationship with Honda that would change his career.\nIn 1988, he joined the McLaren team due to his relationships established with Honda. Over the next six years, Senna would dominate Formula-1 in McLaren-powered Hondas, beginning with eight wins that year, including his first world title, and 13 pole positions. Both of these stats shattered previous records.\nDuring this six-year domination, Senna recorded 37 of his 41 career wins and 46 of 65 poles. In 1991, he became the youngest ever three-time world champion.\nIn 1994, Senna joined the Williams team under a reported deal that gave him a $20 million salary. This season marked the beginning of sweeping rule changes in racing, most notably the ban of “driver aids” like active suspension and anti-lock brakes.\nThe Final Lap\nThe 1994 San Marno was scheduled for April 28- May 1 in Imola, Italy. It was traditionally considered to be the beginning of the annual competition. At the start of the race, Senna maintained his first place position, and on lap 6, Senna completed the third-fastest lap of the race.\nRounding the corner on lap 7, Senna’s car left the track at around 191 mph, ran a straight line off the track, and hit a retaining wall at approximately 145 mph. Senna was extracted from the car within two minutes, and car-side aid began being administered. However, Senna’s temporal artery had ruptured and he had lost about 90% of his blood volume. He was airlifted to Bologna’s Maggiore Hospital, but it was too late. Senna passed away from his injuries. He was 34.\nSenna’s legacy lives on today-many safety features were enacted following his crash, such as improved crash barriers and redesigned tracks. His sister Viviane established the Instituto Ayrton Senna in his native Brazil. Through partnerships with schools, the institution helps create opportunities for children in underprivileged areas.\nSenna was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2000. His success has been attributed to his obsessive desire to win, his attention to detail, and his analytical mind.', 'If you so much as shared a drink at some point with American engineer and car executive John DeLorean between 1980 and 1982, you were subjected to an investigation by the United States and the British governments, such was his notoriety for unscrupulous business practices. Unfortunately for one Englishman, Colin Chapman, and his Lotus Cars company, the DeLorean DMC-12 sports car was conceived to feature chassis and suspension designs with Chapman’s signature on them.\nChapman, along with sidekick and accountant Fred Bushell, was a bit too close for comfort with DeLorean, and, after all, the British taxpayers put up £10 million (Dh59.6m) for the new DeLorean factory in Northern Ireland. Now the people wanted their money back, and Chapman was caught in the crossfire, undeniably involved in illegality.\nWhen DeLorean was busted for drug dealing to help fund his beleaguered car company, he got off the hook, citing entrapment. Bushell served five years and never squeaked a word, while Chapman was looking at 10 years behind bars, according to a Belfast judge. Instead of the can, he got the coffin – Chapman died on December 16, 1982. Conspiracy theorists still claim he was poisoned with a dose of digitalis, all orchestrated by DeLorean to stop the Englishman from spilling everything to the British government.\nThe night before he died, Chapman dined and tapped to a jazz band with his wife, Hazel, and the Lotus Formula 1 team manager Peter Warr. There was no talk of DeLorean or the British government’s inquiries. In the morning, Chapman and his right-hand man Bushell flew to Paris for an FIA meeting at the famous Place de la Concorde. The following day, they were back home in England, and as soon as Chapman got home, around the corner from the company estate, he retired to bed and simply never woke up. The principal, most pioneering individual in British motorsport had died after a heart attack at the age of 54.\nThe call to the Lotus team came immediately. As Warr made the rounds giving everyone the devastating news, faces dropped; the “Guvnor” was gone, and just about no one said so much as a word for the rest of the day. But everyone wanted to say it; they all knew that it had to be said. How was Lotus to carry on?\nChapman was everything at Lotus, his involvement seeping into each nut and bolt of every race and road car bearing the famous green-and-gold badge. Yet the marque didn’t die with him. The following day, everyone in the team turned up at the factory as usual and just got on with the simple job of getting on. Lotus had cars to build and races to win.\nNext month, they’re going on sale in the UAE, initially in Dubai, where Al Futtaim has set up a dealership that will sell the Evora and Evora S models, before a planned expansion of the range\nIt all began 30 years before, with £25 (Dh149) that Chapman borrowed from his fiancée to found Lotus Cars (he got the name from a bathroom fitting) in 1952, and by 1968 he’d swelled the pot into a million-pound empire. During his youth, Chapman had studied for a civil engineering degree, spent a year in the Royal Air Force and worked in the aluminium industry.\n“There will always be a case for a relatively small, adaptable business to fill in the gap of big car manufacturers,” he once noted. “There’s always going to be a scope for a man who can offer something better.\n“I don’t think you have to be ruthless [in business],” he continued, “But I think you have to be prepared to make some unpalatable decisions at times, because frequently your decision is between two evils, and it’s going to hurt somebody. This is a tragedy of trying to run a business, but there’s no way out.”\nAnd there were plenty of unpalatable decisions. Motor racing historian Mike Lawrence wrote that Chapman habitually abused drugs like barbiturates and amphetamines to keep his restless mind going, while his trademark moustache, piercing blue eyes, and Queen’s English pronunciation added to the oodles of charm radiating from his mere presence.\nThe first global Lotus headquarters was a London lock-up garage belonging to Chapman’s soon-to-be in-laws, churning out modified Austins. Four years after dabbling with road cars, he went into racing, and quickly set about occupying the front rows of most grids, his early success achieved by extracting more power from an engine that everyone used, and lightening everything that he could.\n“To Colin, rules were something to be challenged, circumvented,” said Lotus engineer Tony Rudd. “He spent hours reading [the rule books] just to find loopholes.”\n“Adding power makes you faster on the straights, subtracting weight makes you faster everywhere,” Chapman famously noted. “We actually go racing because I like it. I’ve always been involved in racing, and I also like the technical fallout from it. We learn tremendous amounts from racing. Our engineers from the car company take direct readouts from the racing team, in terms of suspension, handling, safety … We stretch everything to the limit in our racing cars, and we then know what sort of limit we can incorporate in our production cars.”\nHence, the business grew, purely to finance a passion. At the Earls Court Motor Show in 1957, Lotus presented three cars to the public: the Lotus 7 and Lotus Elite road cars, and the Lotus 12, which clearly displayed Chapman’s ambitions of Grand Prix racing.\nThe greatest British driver at the time would go down in history for giving Lotus its debut Formula One victory at Monaco in 1960, racing for the Rob Walker team. “Frankly, the Lotuses were beautiful to drive,” said the winner, Stirling Moss. “Not easy to drive, but very quick, very light and delicate, and very delicate as far as the strength was concerned.”\nMoss had first-hand experience of this fragility, with quite a few wheels coming off his Lotus 18, most alarmingly at the fearsome 15km Spa Francorchamps circuit in Belgium in 1960. At 225kph. Moss spun, hit a bank and broke his back and legs. It was one of the first of many such trackside excursions for a Colin Chapman-designed car and its unlucky driver (at the same race at Spa, the British driver Mike Taylor was paralysed and had his racing career ended when his Lotus 18’s steering failed – he later successfully sued Lotus).\n“Any car which holds together for more than a race is too heavy,” was another chilling definition of Grand Prix racing by Chapman. As was the infamous: “To add speed, add lightness.” You can’t get much lighter than a car with no wheels.\nBesides painstakingly counting chassis rivets and getting rid of any surplus, as well as utilising the thinnest possible gauge aluminium, Chapman brought novelty designs to seemingly every Grand Prix. One year at Rouen in France – after he’d already stunned the Formula One oligarchy with his enormous aerodynamic wings hung off the back of the cars, which the whole field soon copied in a typical follow-the-leader move – his Lotus driver Jackie Oliver had a monumental crash that tore the car to pieces. The cause of the accident was the frail gearbox bell housing that supported the wing, and broke, ridding the car of most of its aerodynamics-induced cornering grip. The first thing that Chapman did was call his other driver, Graham Hill, back in and then walk over to rival Bruce McLaren to warn him of the danger – McLaren’s own car had a similar, copied design, and hence a similar risk. Despite how much Formula One was about winning at all costs, Chapman’s human side showed that it sometimes wasn’t the be all and end all.\nIn 1966, Lotus Cars found its staying home at Hethel in Norfolk, with typical Chapman creativity. To locate a suitable spot not too far from London and his suppliers’ bases, he simply drew a circle with a 160km radius from London, and flew around in his plane until he found the perfect location. By this stage in his life, as well as a private plane, he enjoyed a personal fortune of more than £12 million (Dh71.6million) at today’s rates.\nAs the 1970s loomed, it became apparent that the giants of the automotive industry would suffer in the face of the imminent oil crisis, while low-volume maker Lotus exploited its expertise of lightweight construction and smaller engines in its sports cars. It was a glorious era to be in Hethel, as supercar marques clutched onto straws while Lotus won 35 grands prix and launched successful road-going models such as the second generation Elite, and the groundbreaking Esprit – a sports car that survived five generations into 2004. In 1977, James Bond immortalised the Esprit S1, not only outrunning and outhandling the villains, but also memorably shocking Sardinian beachgoers with its submarine abilities in The Spy Who Loved Me.\nBond was behind the wheel of a new turbocharged Lotus Esprit in 1981’s For Your Eyes Only, living large at an Italian ski resort. But the good life was nearing its end, as Chapman departed us only a year later, and his legacy hit upon the hardest of times.\nAfter Chapman’s death, there was a changing of the guard, and Lotus slumped for four years, achieving only a single Formula One race victory in 1982. For the rest of the decade, the team managed just seven more wins, six of them thanks to Ayrton Senna. In 1994, Team Lotus lined up on a Formula One grid one last time, leaving behind a wondrous heritage of revolutionary innovations, like Chapman struts, monocoque chassis, wedge designs, ground effect and even cars with dual chassis. Today, the name Lotus once again grabs top spots at Formula One races, but only in a somewhat shambolic spiritual return, as the outfit is owned by a Luxembourg-based venture capital group and has nothing to do with Hethel. Instead, it’s merely the former Renault team under a different name.\nThat’s a saga in itself, not unlike the horror-survival story of post-Chapman Lotus. After the 1982 tragedy, Toyota bought into the company, and before there could be any fruits of that labour, General Motors took over the outfit outright. Less than a decade later, troubled marque Bugatti sat into the Hethel throne, and then discarded Lotus to a Malaysian company to focus on its own financial problems. But against the odds, Lotus has survived and is building undoubtedly its finest-ever cars.\nAnthony Colin Bruce Chapman’s initials were bigger than his company’s name on the logo for a reason – Lotus couldn’t survive without its enigmatic founder. If his overwhelmed heart hadn’t given up from Chapman’s frenetic pace of life, who’s to say that he wouldn’t have turned up at that trial, stood up in the court’s dock, waxed his moustache, and charmed his way out of doubt and into a knighthood?\nFollow us @LifeNationalUAE\nFollow us on Facebook for discussions, entertainment, reviews, wellness and news.']	['<urn:uuid:f7d26bc2-8e0b-4674-a2ad-8142d4ca6a9d>', '<urn:uuid:c4e25c7c-1c86-42db-b97f-1e0da83c3c3e>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	three-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	13	62	2561
81	first formula one point detroit history	The first world championship point was achieved in Detroit during the 1988 Grand Prix, where a sixth place finish was secured. This milestone was achieved after being called back to the team for the Detroit grand prix in 1988.	['By virtue of his past, he is the icon of Minardi F1 Team. He led his M185, the first single-seater signed by the team from Faenza, to debut. He achieved the first world point in the US GP of 1988 and raced 104 in 120 Grand Prix, alongside Gian Carlo Minardi. We are speaking of Pierluigi Martini whose prize list also shows his win at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1999. He has continued the couple Minardi-Martini of the 70s when his uncle Giancarlo raced in Formula 2 for Passatore and the Everest stable that belonged to a very young Minardi.\n“I had known Minardi since I was a boy because I attended my uncle’s races in Formula Italia and Formula 2. In 1983, precisely along with Gian Carlo, driving the Minardi-BMW F2, I achieved the second place at Misano after winning also Formula 3 title. He wanted me at his side for his debut to Formula 1 in 1985”, Pierluigi Martini remembers on Minardi.it. “It was an experience as difficult as important because being the sole driver all the responsibilities were on my shoulders. Anyway, that was a positive season because even if I was a novice, we achieved the eight place in Australia. According to today’s score, this result would have gave us the first world points. At the end of season our paths diverged. I came back to F 3000 and I conquered the second place of the Intercontinental World Championship in 1986. Then, with great pleasure, Gian Carlo called me back by his side for the Detroit grand prix in 1988. I repaid his confidence with the first world point thanks to the sixth place. A wonderful relationship started and lasted till my retirement from F1 in 1995, with just a parenthesis in ’92 with the Scuderia Italia. After a break, the vitory arrives at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with BMW in 1999”.\nHow would you describe the “romagnolo” Gian Carlo Minardi?\nHe is a unique person. Thanks to a bit of “temerity”, which is a result of intelligence and passion for this sport, he built something that is really incredible for Romagna. He has been able to launch a lot of drivers, and also top level engineers and mechanics. Nobody is like him.\nDo you have any anecdote related to its figure to tell us?\nNow no special anecdote comes to my mind. Surely, we are talking about a person that was very attentive to observe the group and protect it from external attacks. A great family man.\nWhat teachings have you gained with Minardi Team?\nHaving raced with teams like the Scuderia Italia, Williams and BMW at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Master GP, I have realized and appreciated the organization of Minardi team. When you are in F1 with restricted resources, you learn to optimize your force and synchronize all your sections. Without any doubt, I can affirm that Minardi Team was really a great stable, a perfect one. It lacked only the engine. Contrary to what happens now, in those years an “old” engine was able to pay also 200 hp compared to competition.\nWe know that engineer Chiti used to call you “Little Pheasant”. How does this funny nickname come from?\nHe used thisnickname to gain sympathy and to hide from the “blunders” that he committed. With that nickname he usually tried to defuse a difficult situation.\nAlong with Morbidelli, you have been the very first driver to have a Ferrari Client engine. Which aspect of the engine from Maranello impressed you ?\nUnfortunately, that engine was born to match an automatic transmission, which we lacked at that time and so it created problems with the clutch. The sound was certainly great, but to become protagonists it would have been nicer to have the appropriate reliability.\nSpeaking with you, the incredible accident in Monza in 1993 comes to our mind. What happened and what Minardi told you in the pit?\nAt that moment, I was protecting my seventh place. Up to 10 laps to go I was in fifth position, but the breaking of the fifth gear made me loose some positions. I tried to defend myself from the attack of Christian and I moved on the right, but he followed me. I then heard the hit at the rear. With its wing he touched my rear wheel. Not seeing him anymore in my mirrors, I thought the worst. The returning lap was quite difficult. I was afraid he were finished among the audience. Fortunately, everything went out for the best for him. Even in that circumstance, Gian Carlo has been very good at handling the situation. The telemetry pointed out that I had not committed any impropriety. Therefore, the fact was dismissed as a racing accident.\nWith which driver you founded a special friendship, and who has been the harder competitor?\nI founded a deep friendship with Paolo Barilla. With all the others, I had a great esteem and a healthy rivalry. The harder was JJ Lehto during my period in the Scuderia Italia.\n104 F1 grand prix with Minardi Team. What have been the memorable moments?\nI had lot of good times. From the first world point in Detroit, to the lap ahead of everybody in Portugal, or the fourth place in Estoril in 1991. The times spent to develop the car along with engineers Tredozi and Costa are memorable. In those years, the chronometer was the only thermometer to judge developments. When you found the right direction, it was a great satisfaction.\nThe most difficult times?\nWithout any doubt, the demise of Ayrton Senna that convinced me to end my F1 adventure the following year. I would add some accidents: at Nurburgring, Montecarlo and Imola when I broke my leg.\nYou have mentioned Ayrton Senna.\nHe was the greatest driver that I had the pleasure to meet. He was always able to bring out the best from the team. He gave the 120% and was able to involve the all group urging it to give its 110%.\nDue to your strong relationship with the team from Faenza, and to the fact of belonging to Romagna, were you involved in the choice of your team-mate?\nMinardi made his choices. He was always looking for drivers who could put me in trouble. This made me a bit angry but at the same time, it was a great stimulus.\nDid you use to enter the factory to talk with the engineers and see “the birth” of the machines?\nI lived in the factory. I liked very much to see the engineers’ work on the car. From there you could take off 2-3 tenths of asecond from your lap time. Those have been fantastic years.\nThis year you were back under the wheel of the M186 and the M189 in Austria and in Goodwood. What did you feel in those moments?\nI realized how we were crazy to run at 300 km/h with those cars. However, I feel like the time hadn’t stopped. I immediately felt comfortable. I drove the M186 just during a test and I must say that it is an extraordinary, competitive and well-balanced car. With a Cosworth engine it would have gave a great satisfactions to the team.\nThe M189 was a customized car that gave us two fifth and two sixth places, the first row in America and the head of the race in Portugal. It has been pleasant come back in the cockpit.\nIn the last months you have anticipated us the project of a Minardi-Day. We know that now a great expectation is growing among true enthusiasts. What can you tell us, are preparations going on?\nAlong with Minardi, I am working to prepare the program, also asking advice for costs. The period should be at the end of June, but we will know something more only next months. Our aim is to bring back at Imola all the single-seaters built by Gian Carlo, with other F1 cars. Our intention is to recreate the old amazing and memorable atmosphere.']	['<urn:uuid:38693e50-9257-43de-ab0c-749f54a49736>']	open-ended	direct	short-search-query	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	6	39	1351
82	Why does my packaged food go bad even in the fridge?	Food degradation occurs due to bacterial action present inside food products. These microbes cause food to rot and get spoiled, increasing the risk of food-borne diseases. Traditional methods like airtight packing or nitrogen substitution help somewhat but can alter taste and aroma. However, new antimicrobial packaging technologies are being developed to reduce or inhibit microbial growth while preserving food quality. These include systems where the packaging material itself interacts with the food to enhance shelf life.	['People are increasingly consuming packaged food products. These come in both, cooked and uncooked formats. The shelf life of these products is usually limited by their degradation due to bacterial action present inside them. It is due to these microbes that food rots and get spoiled. It also increases the chances of food borne diseases. If these microbes can be removed or neutralized from the food, it can be stored for very long periods, vastly improving its shelf life. Most of the traditional methods such as air tight packing of food with removal of all air/oxygen or substituting air with nitrogen, achieve the desired effect to some extent, but they alter the taste and aroma of the food. This makes them less desirable.\nAnti microbial packaging on the other hand involves an active packing material that act to reduce or inhibit the growth of micro organisms that may be present in the packed food. For example; silver has long been used to reduce the microbial or fungal content in food. The downside of using silver is that it’s quite expensive and can be prohibitive if used in large scale commercial application. This has led to development of other compounds that can achieve similar effect of reducing or inhibiting the growth of bacterial and fungal microorganism in packaged food products. They represent one of the most promising concepts in future of food safety and quality. Active packing system in one where the packing material itself interacts with the food substance to provide desirable effects and enhance the shelf life of the packaged food.\nAnti microbial packaging can take several forms\n- Sachets filled with antimicrobial agent, which are added to food packages.\n- Antimicrobial coating onto the polymer surface. i.e application of antimicrobial layer onto plastic surface that is in contact with food.\n- Incorporation of antimicrobial compound directing into the packaging material itself.\nOf these the first one, i.e the sachets that are either enclosed loose or attached to the wall of packaging are most successful. They absorb the oxygen, water vapour and also emit ethanol vapour, not making the environment inside the packaging inert for any microorganism growth. This reduces the spoilage of the food, such as off-flavour, discolouration and rotting by changing the initial conditions immediately after packing of the food. It also prevents the formation of toxic substances.\nOn the other hand, the antimicrobial layer on the packaging works by releasing an active substance into the food and headspace which actively renders the microbes inert in the food due their affinity to the food particle. The layer is designed to release the active component in a slow controlled manner throughout the designated shelf life of packed food. This type of packaging is slightly more challenging as it involves choosing the right packaging material that can withstand the application of active layer and choosing the right active compound that will not only not react with ingredients in the food, but act against the right set of microbes which have highest probability of being present in the food being packed.\nThe global market for antimicrobial packaging is over 250 billion USD already and is expected to grow at CAGR of 7% over next 5 years. The growth will be primarily driven by active and controlled release packaging (which will consist of enzymes, organic acids etc) which will in turn be driven by rapid rise of packaged food and beverage industry. Further, the advancements in technology will make it possible to apply more complex antimicrobial layers to packaging, increasing the shelf life even more.\nFollowing are the key trends that will drive the demand for antimicrobial packaging\n- Increased consumption of processed food that is manufactured in factories instead of freshly cooked meals. More processed food will need better packaging for longer storage, especially the out of season food products that need to be stored much longer.\n- Smaller portion sizes requiring large number of individual units in retail market consuming more overall packaging, including antimicrobial packaging.\n- Repackaging of the food (Food not fully consumed once package is opened but stored for consumption at later time) will need antimicrobial packaging that continues to counter the pathogen that enter food once it is opened and exposed to air.\n- Increased awareness about health benefits of food packed in antimicrobial packing, leading to more demand for food packed in such packing, directly by the consumer.\n- Increase in competition, which will lead to cost pressures. Reduction in refrigeration requirement of food will be key attractor to use antimicrobial packaging (especially for organic raw food such as milk, meat etc.)\n- Processing of food across borders requiring longer storage and increasing the risk of foreign contamination. This will require stringent safety measures for the food to reduce the chance of foreign diseases spreading across the border.\n- Increased regulation to maintain health and safety standards of packaged foods by government.\n- Technology advancements, making it possible to use antimicrobial packaging for greater variety of food products, more economically.\nPackaging industry is undergoing a rapid change. New materials are being discovered that are safe and sustainable. Old methods are being rediscovered that are efficient and cost effective. The changing global dynamics are changing the food habits of people globally. Food is being prepared long before it is consumed and far away from where it is being consumed. Retaining the quality and integrity of food in such situation has become essential to stay relevant to the consumer. Antimicrobial packaging serves to enhance the shelf life of food once it is packed and also after the packaging is opened for consumption.']	['<urn:uuid:57a7a1ef-5f96-48f5-b728-88dcb9fcd9cc>']	open-ended	with-premise	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	11	76	936
83	What equipment is used to spy on computers versus protect them from spying?	For spying, devices like field-strength meters, spectrum analyzers, and radio equipment can intercept electromagnetic emanations from computers at distances up to hundreds of meters. For protection, TEMPEST standards require specific countermeasures including shielding (requiring 100 dB insertion loss from 1 KHz to 10 GHz), filtering, maintaining proper distances between equipment, and masking techniques. The investigation process to detect such spying attempts involves using spectrum analyzers, high-frequency current transformers, and specialized antennas to measure both radiated and conducted emissions.	"['TEMPEST is a National Security Agency specification and a NATO certification referring to spying on information systems through leaking emanations, including unintentional radio or electrical signals, sounds, and vibrations. TEMPEST covers both methods to spy upon others and how to shield equipment against such spying. The protection efforts are also known as emission security (EMSEC), which is a subset of communications security (COMSEC).\nThe NSA methods for spying on computer emissions are classified, but some of the protection standards have been released by either the NSA or the Department of Defense. Protecting equipment from spying is done with distance, shielding, filtering, and masking. The TEMPEST standards mandate elements such as equipment distance from walls, amount of shielding in buildings and equipment, and distance separating wires carrying classified vs. unclassified materials, filters on cables, and even distance and shielding between wires or equipment and building pipes. Noise can also protect information by masking the actual data.\nWhile much of TEMPEST is about leaking electromagnetic emanations, it also encompasses sounds and mechanical vibrations. For example, it is possible to log a user\'s keystrokes using the motion sensor inside smartphones. Compromising emissions are defined as unintentional intelligence-bearing signals which, if intercepted and analyzed (side-channel attack), may disclose the information transmitted, received, handled, or otherwise processed by any information-processing equipment.\n- NATO SDIP-27 Level A (formerly AMSG 720B) and USA NSTISSAM Level I\n- ""Compromising Emanations Laboratory Test Standard""\n- This is the strictest standard for devices that will be operated in NATO Zone 0 environments, where it is assumed that an attacker has almost immediate access (e.g. neighbouring room, 1 m distance).\n- NATO SDIP-27 Level B (formerly AMSG 788A) and USA NSTISSAM Level II\n- ""Laboratory Test Standard for Protected Facility Equipment""\n- This is a slightly relaxed standard for devices that are operated in NATO Zone 1 environments, where it is assumed that an attacker cannot get closer than about 20 m (or where building materials ensure an attenuation equivalent to the free-space attenuation of this distance).\n- NATO SDIP-27 Level C (formerly AMSG 784) and USA NSTISSAM Level III\n- ""Laboratory Test Standard for Tactical Mobile Equipment/Systems""\n- An even more relaxed standard for devices operated in NATO Zone 2 environments, where attackers have to deal with the equivalent of 100 m of free-space attenuation (or equivalent attenuation through building materials).\nAdditional standards include:\n- NATO SDIP-29 (formerly AMSG 719G)\n- ""Installation of Electrical Equipment for the Processing of Classified Information""\n- This standard defines installation requirements, for example in respect to grounding and cable distances.\n- AMSG 799B\n- ""NATO Zoning Procedures""\n- Defines an attenuation measurement procedure, according to which individual rooms within a security perimeter can be classified into Zone 0, Zone 1, Zone 2, or Zone 3, which then determines what shielding test standard is required for equipment that processes secret data in these rooms.\nThe NSA and Department of Defense have declassified some TEMPEST elements after Freedom of Information Act requests, but the documents black out many key values and descriptions. The declassified version of the TEMPEST test standard is heavily redacted, with emanation limits and test procedures blacked out. A redacted version of the introductory Tempest handbook NACSIM 5000 was publicly released in December 2000. Additionally, the current NATO standard SDIP-27 (before 2006 known as AMSG 720B, AMSG 788A, and AMSG 784) is still classified.\nDespite this, some declassified documents give information on the shielding required by TEMPEST standards. For example, Military Handbook 1195 includes the chart at the right, showing electromagnetic shielding requirements at different frequencies. A declassified NSA specification for shielded enclosures offers similar shielding values, requiring, ""a minimum of 100 dB insertion loss from 1 KHz to 10 GHz."" Since much of the current requirements are still classified, there are no publicly available correlations between this 100 dB shielding requirement and the newer zone-based shielding standards.\nThe information-security agencies of several NATO countries publish lists of accredited testing labs and of equipment that has passed these tests:\n- In Canada: Canadian Industrial TEMPEST Program\n- In Germany: BSI German Zoned Products List\n- In the UK: UK CESG Directory of Infosec Assured Products, Section 12\n- In the U.S.: NSA TEMPEST Certification Program\nThe United States Army also has a Tempest testing facility, as part of the U.S. Army Information Systems Engineering Command, at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. Similar lists and facilities exist in other NATO countries.\nTempest certification must apply to entire systems, not just to individual components, since connecting a single unshielded component (such as a cable or device) to an otherwise secure system could dramatically alter the system RF characteristics.\nTEMPEST standards require ""RED/BLACK separation"", i.e., maintaining distance or installing shielding between circuits and equipment used to handle plaintext classified or sensitive information that is not encrypted (RED) and secured circuits and equipment (BLACK), the latter including those carrying encrypted signals. Manufacture of TEMPEST-approved equipment must be done under careful quality control to ensure that additional units are built exactly the same as the units that were tested. Changing even a single wire can invalidate the tests.\nOne aspect of Tempest testing that distinguishes it from limits on spurious emissions (e.g., FCC Part 15) is a requirement of absolute minimal correlation between radiated energy or detectable emissions and any plaintext data that are being processed.\nIn 1985, Wim van Eck published the first unclassified technical analysis of the security risks of emanations from computer monitors. This paper caused some consternation in the security community, which had previously believed that such monitoring was a highly sophisticated attack available only to governments; van Eck successfully eavesdropped on a real system, at a range of hundreds of metres, using just $15 worth of equipment plus a television set.\nAs a consequence of this research, such emanations are sometimes called ""van Eck radiation"", and the eavesdropping technique van Eck phreaking, although government researchers were already aware of the danger, as Bell Labs noted this vulnerability to secure teleprinter communications during World War II and was able to produce 75% of the plaintext being processed in a secure facility from a distance of 80 feet. (24 metres) Additionally the NSA published Tempest Fundamentals, NSA-82-89, NACSIM 5000, National Security Agency (Classified) on February 1, 1982. In addition, the van Eck technique was successfully demonstrated to non-TEMPEST personnel in Korea during the Korean War in the 1950s.\nMarkus Kuhn has discovered several low-cost techniques for reducing the chances that emanations from computer displays can be monitored remotely. With CRT displays and analog video cables, filtering out high-frequency components from fonts before rendering them on a computer screen will attenuate the energy at which text characters are broadcast. With modern flat panel displays, the high-speed digital serial interface (DVI) cables from the graphics controller are a main source of compromising emanations. Adding random noise to the least significant bits of pixel values may render the emanations from flat-panel displays unintelligible to eavesdroppers but is not a secure method. Since DVI uses a certain bit code scheme that tries to transport a balanced signal of 0 bits and 1 bits, there may not be much difference between two pixel colors that differ very much in their color or intensity. The emanations can differ drastically even if only the last bit of a pixel\'s color is changed. The signal received by the eavesdropper also depends on the frequency where the emanations are detected. The signal can be received on many frequencies at once and each frequency\'s signal differs in contrast and brightness related to a certain color on the screen. Usually, the technique of smothering the RED signal with noise is not effective unless the power of the noise is sufficient to drive the eavesdropper\'s receiver into saturation thus overwhelming the receiver input.\nLED indicators on computer equipment can be a source of compromising optical emanations. One such technique involves the monitoring of the lights on a dial-up modem. Almost all modems flash an LED to show activity, and it is common for the flashes to be directly taken from the data line. As such, a fast optical system can easily see the changes in the flickers from the data being transmitted down the wire.\nRecent research has shown it is possible to detect the radiation corresponding to a keypress event from not only wireless (radio) keyboards, but also from traditional wired keyboards, and even from laptop keyboards.\nIn 2014, researchers introduced ""AirHopper"", a bifurcated attack pattern showing the feasibility of data exfiltration from an isolated computer to a nearby mobile phone, using FM frequency signals.\nIn 2015, ""BitWhisper"", a Covert Signaling Channel between Air-Gapped Computers using Thermal Manipulations was introduced. ""BitWhisper"" supports bidirectional communication and requires no additional dedicated peripheral hardware.\nLater in 2015, researchers introduced GSMem, a method for exfiltrating data from air-gapped computers over cellular frequencies. The transmission - generated by a standard internal bus - renders the computer into a small cellular transmitter antenna.\nIn February 2018, research was published describing how low frequency magnetic fields can be used to escape sensitive data from Faraday-caged, air-gapped computers with malware code-named ’ODINI’ that can control the low frequency magnetic fields emitted from infected computers by regulating the load of CPU cores \nIn popular culture\n- In the television series Numb3rs, season 1 episode ""Sacrifice"", a wire connected to a high gain antenna was used to ""read"" from a computer monitor.\n- In the television series Spooks, season 4 episode ""The Sting"", a failed attempt to read information from a computer that has no network link is described.\n- In the novel Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson, characters use Van Eck phreaking to likewise read information from a computer monitor in a neighboring room.\n- In the television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., season 1 episode ""Ragtag"", an office is scanned for digital signatures in the UHF spectrum.\n- In the video game Tom Clancy\'s Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, part of the final mission involves spying on a meeting in a Tempest-hardened war room. Throughout the entire Splinter Cell series, a laser microphone is used as well.\n- In the video game Rainbow Six: Siege, the operator Mute has experience in TEMPEST specifications. He designed a Signal Disrupter initially to ensure that hidden microphones in sensitive meetings would not transmit, and adapted them for combat, capable of disrupting remotely activated devices like breaching charges.\n- In real life the BBC, supposedly, has a television van that can ""read"" various things like what channel and show you are watching in real time.\n- Computer and network surveillance\n- Computer security\n- Side-channel attack\n- Van Eck phreaking\n- Product Delivery Order Requirements Package Checklist (PDF), US Air Force, archived from the original (PDF) on 2014-12-29\n- TEMPEST Equipment Selection Process, NATO Information Assurance, 1981\n- ""How Old IsTEMPEST?"".

Boak Lectures, National Security Agency, 1973 (partially redacted)', ""Locating the source of an electromagnetic interference (EMI) problem is often like trying to find a needle in a haystack. But despite the difficulty, it's not impossible. Although a number of different variables make these situations more complicated, you can simplify the process by following a time-tested, methodical investigative plan. By sticking to the steps outlined in this article, you'll save time and money and make it easier to diagnose and resolve these elusive disturbances.\nThe investigative process for solving EMI problems is nearly identical to the approach used for other types of power quality problems. We can break down this approach into seven basic steps. It's important to follow the steps as outlined, without skipping one or changing the sequence.\nGather background information.\nDevelop a plan.\nSelect the proper tools.\nConduct the investigation.\nAnalyze the data and locate the source.\nSelect a solution.\nVerify solution performance.\nThis is the most important step in an EMI investigation. In the beginning, you know little about the operation and characteristics of the affected equipment. Equipping yourself with meaningful information will make the investigation easier.\nA coordinated meeting between all affected parties is usually an appropriate and necessary first step. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) Emerald Book provides a comprehensive description of how to conduct a power quality audit and the importance of obtaining input from everyone involved. Although the book's current version focuses primarily on wiring and grounding audits and general equipment problems caused by voltage sags, interruptions, and other variations, the basic concepts apply equally well to EMI investigations. The table (left) describes some of the information you might obtain during this process.\nOf course, the best background information comes from asking the right questions and taking detailed notes during the meeting. It's common for different representatives to disagree with each other, especially if they've already formed opinions. Establish common ground by maintaining an open mind and urging the other parties to do the same. What may seem like unrelated information could become a major clue in identifying the EMI source. Worksheet A contains a list of important questions that will put you on the right track.\nYou may direct some questions to a specific individual and others to several people. The operator spends more time with the malfunctioning equipment than anyone else, so this person will probably be more familiar with the problem. He will likely provide new information that will help trigger even more information from the others.\nDeveloping a Plan\nUse the information gathered in the meeting to determine whether the investigation will focus on the radiated environment (the space inside and outside the facility) or the conducted environment (the metallic structures inside the facility). If you didn't obtain enough information to determine this, don't panic. Most EMI problems are associated with radiated environments, so odds are you'll need to start there.\nWorksheet B lists the items you should include in your plan. If you need special access to secured areas, make these arrangements in advance. If possible, obtain a layout of the facility. A good one will allow you to connect or locate testing or measurement instruments without interrupting facility operations. Of course, some interruptions may be unavoidable while taking measurements.\nSelecting the Proper Tools\nTo detect radiated emissions, investigators typically start by using a pocket AM radio, followed by radio-frequency field-strength meters, and even spectrum analyzers and specialized antennas. For conducted emissions, you may need to use more complicated and expensive measuring instruments such as spectrum analyzers, high-frequency clamp-on CTs, and in some cases, power-line monitors and oscilloscopes. These may require basic off-site training for proper setup and operation.\nSpectrum analyzers, field-strength meters, oscilloscopes, and some antennas contain components that are sensitive to mechanical shocks and vibrations. Transport and handle these with care. You don't want the equipment to sustain any damage that could require costly repair and recalibration.\nSome devices may be too bulky or heavy to transport, and others require 60 Hz power, which may be unavailable. When possible, use portable instruments to simplify movement.\nIf your instrument requires the use of an antenna, select one carefully. Many antennas are large and may pose problems to facility operations. It's equally important to make sure the antenna's frequency range encompasses the range of the suspected EMI problem. Broadband antennas, which offer frequency ranges from 100 Hz to 3 GHz, are well-suited for EMI investigations.\nMost antennas are designed specifically to measure either radiated electric or magnetic fields. You will most likely measure radiated electric fields because many EMI problems result from radiated emissions occurring in the far field.\nIn the far field, with respect to distance, the electric field is 377 times stronger than the magnetic field. When the emissions occur in the near field (where the field strength is, with respect to distance, comparable), you may need to measure magnetic fields using loop antennas.\nCurrent probes, also called high-frequency current transformers (CTs), measure emissions flowing in power, data, and signal cables. These probes range in frequency from 20 Hz to 2 GHz and may reveal important clues about the EMI problem. You may need a CT to measure conducted emissions flowing in a metallic object such as a single wire, wire bundle, steel member, pipe, or plenum. Insulated and uninsulated CTs are available with various diameter openings. CTs are designed so that they may be coupled around the object without cutting or disconnecting it. Large objects will require CTs with larger openings. Care should be taken when clamping around power conductors, especially if you use uninsulated CTs.\nConducting the Investigation\nTracking down the source of an EMI problem may seem difficult, even to experienced investigators. But a thorough job during the information gathering process (and succeeding steps) will typically reveal the necessary clues to effectively narrow down the possibilities. As the investigation progresses, additional clues will become evident and, in the best cases, lead to several possible causes.\nIn most cases, you should begin at the affected equipment. There are a few simple measurements you can perform to determine if radiated or conducted emissions (or a combination) are causing the problem. For example, insert an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) with a charged battery between the building's power source (receptacle) and the equipment. A UPS on battery backup can power AC-powered end-use equipment affected by EMI. Don't move the affected equipment from the location where it malfunctions. If it continues to malfunction, then it's reacting to radiated emissions. If it doesn't malfunction, then conducted emissions are the cause.\nWhen you determine the primary type of emissions involved, you may take more measurements inside and outside the facility to close in on the EMI source, whether it be a piece of equipment or an arcing component in a nearby power distribution network.\nAnother key factor is how the affected equipment operates. Many types of electronic equipment contain indicators, displays, meters, and readouts that may indicate when and how the EMI source affects the equipment.\nFor example, if you observe these devices and can correlate your observations with noise detected by an AM radio, you may become familiar with the sounds of radiated emissions received by the radio. You can do the same for emissions captured by a spectrum analyzer. However, it may be necessary to spend several hours becoming familiar with the equipment before discovering a correlation. If the occurrences are sporadic, a nearby piece of infrequently used equipment could be the source. If upsets are periodic, a commonly used piece of equipment may be the culprit.\nIn some cases, powered but unused equipment with degraded input filter components have been found to generate upsetting emissions. This type of source may be more difficult to locate and may require powering down a number of facility circuits individually. If the equipment is portable and used regularly, then locating the source may be even more difficult as the level of emissions will vary as the equipment is moved from one area to another.\nFig. 1 shows various types of radiated and conducted emission sources and their approximate corresponding frequency ranges. Intentional radiators, such as broadcast transmitters, generate emissions for a specific purpose. Unintentional radiators generate emissions as a byproduct of their normal or abnormal operations. You also may classify sources as natural or man-made. Most are man-made, such as end-use equipment that generates radiated and conducted emissions.\nLocating the Source\nAfter completing the investigation, assemble the data and look for any patterns. The frequencies of the components measured by an analyzer will provide helpful clues. In addition, knowledge of operating frequencies for broadcast stations in the area and for various end-use devices will help you determine which components result from operating which devices. Even if you determine the source during an investigation, take some time to review the data to learn more about the EMI problem. This will lead you to possible solutions for resolving it.\nSelecting a Solution\nWhen choosing a solution, carefully consider the facility's operations, the electromagnetic environment, and the operation of the affected equipment. You also must evaluate the safety, cost, installation, maintenance, aesthetics, and performance record of the possible solution. Review your choice with all involved individuals before procurement and installation to ensure that any effects on facility operations and equipment performance are known and kept to a minimum.\nThe most common solutions to EMI problems include shields, filters, and enhanced grounding techniques. Filtering is commonly used to solve conducted emissions problems, while shielding may be used to solve radiated problems. Correcting grounding problems may reduce both radiated and conducted emissions depending on the circumstances of the EMI problem.\nBefore applying these solutions, you should make the initial effort to reduce emission levels, beginning at the source. If you can't, try to solve the problem by altering the path of the emissions from the source to the affected equipment. If these efforts don't reduce the emissions sufficiently, then it's time to consider applying shields, filters, or grounding techniques.\nWhen it's possible (and without significant expense), test a proposed solution in the field before purchasing it. You may find that simply relocating the EMI source or affected piece of equipment or operating it from a different branch circuit solves the problem. For large expensive remedies, you may be able to predict their effectiveness by performing mathematical modeling.\nOfficial verification should take place after you've applied the solution and facility operations have returned to normal. Watch the performance of the installed solution and retake emissions measurements at the affected equipment. Include the “after” measurements in a final report. With the final report completed, you can put the matter to rest. Just be sure to save these steps so you can tackle your next EMI encounter with confidence.\nPhilip Keebler is a power quality engineer at EPRI PEAC, where he conducts research and manages a number of tasks for the company's System Compatibility Research Project. Keebler has BS and MS degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.\nKermit Phipps is a senior power quality technician at EPRI PEAC. He is in charge of testing and evaluating equipment performance in accordance with various published standards.

85	tourist activities bangka belitung islands environmental risks marine ecosystem	The Bangka-Belitung Islands offer various tourist activities including beach exploration, snorkeling, diving - particularly around Chinese dynasty wrecks off northeastern Belitung, and visiting conservation centers like the Kepayang Island turtle sanctuary. However, these marine ecosystems face significant threats from destructive fishing practices. These include blast fishing which destroys coral reef ecosystems, cyanide fishing which damages large coral areas, and reef gleaning where fishermen break down corals while searching for marine invertebrates. Additionally, the use of fish traps, gillnets, and hook-and-line fishing are decimating fish populations and indiscriminately killing marine life including turtles, dugong, and cetaceans.	"['Sumatra is fairly well-known internationally as a resource and natural beauty-rich island, but did you know that it also has several smaller and exquisitely beautiful islands not far from its coast?\nSome of the most beautiful of these islands is known as the Bangka-Belitung Islands, cutely abbreviated Babel. This group of islands is composed of Bangka Island, Belitung Island, and a handful of other smaller islands. They’re located in the Java Sea, off the east coast of Sumatra.\nEconomically, this island is known for its pepper and its tin. But for travelers, the Bangka-Belitung islands conjures images of white sand, crystal clear turquoise waters, colorful coral reefs and giant granite rock formations that complete the beauty of its landscape.\nBelitung in particular has some of the most beautiful, most pristine beaches of Southeast Asia. And it’s managed to remain mostly a secret but it won’t be for long – beautiful white sand edging turquoise calm seas complete with a lovely long dry season full of sunny skies will eventually draw crowds. Go now before it’s too late.\nAbout Bangka Island\nBangka is the main part of the Bangka-Belitung province of Sumatra, but it remains mostly overshadowed by its sister island Belitung. That said, the beaches in Bangka are beautiful but because the island is not being promoted as much as Belitung, there is a poorer infrastructure.\nThe island is home to around 1 million inhabitants, most of whom are Malays and Chinese. Most of the beautiful island consists of lower plains, swamps, small hills, pristine beaches, white pepper fields and tin tin mines. As such, the majority of the local population works on the palm and rubber plantations, tin mines, pepper farms, or are fishermen.\nBangka Island has a rich history – the island was originally ceded to Britain by the sultan of Palembang in 1812 but just two years later, the British exchanged Bangka Island for Cochin, India with the Dutch. WWII brough the Japanese, who occupied the island from 1942 to 1945, during which time Bangka became famous for the Bangka Island massacre in which the Japanese massacred Australian nurses as well as British and Australian servicemen and civilians. Bangka only became a part of independent Indonesia in 1949.\nFun facts about Bangka Island:\n- This island is reputedly the setting for the book Lord Jim by Joseph Conrad\n- Bangka is home to a number Indonesian communists who have been under house arrest since the 1960s anti-Communist purge and are still not permitted to leave the island\n- There is another small island that goes by the same name – Palau Bangka – but is located in northern Sulawesi\nAbout Belitung Island\nBelitung is a medium-sized island of around 7,800 km2. Its geography consists of moderately rugged terrain and several hills. Its best known for its calm and shallow turquoise blue seas and its smattering of abstract granite boulders.\nThe island is home to around 200,000 inhabitants. The majority are Malays, but Belitung is also home to large populations of Bugis, Sundanese, and ethnic Chinese as well as smaller populations of Balinese and Maduranese people.\nBelitung recently garnered nationwide attention after the release of a hit movie, Laskar Pelangi, in 2008. As of now, its turquoise blue waters remain so crystal clear you can see fish swimming – head over while you can!\nFun facts about Belitung Island:\n- Belitung’s English name is Billiton and it is this little-known island’s tin mines that gave their name to Australian mining giant BHP Billiton\n- Every December, there is a 300km bike race around the island called Tour d’Belitung\n- Belitung has a stone that can not be found anywhere else. It’s called the satam stone – black meteorite – and locals believe it has the power to block evil forces. Prices start at around $17 USD.\n- Every autumn (around October/November), the island hosts an outrigger sail boat race and a sand statue competition.\nBest Time to Visit the Bangka-Belitung Islands\nThe best time to visit the Bangka-Belitung Islands is during the dry season (April – October) when it is sunny and also windy. The rainy season translates to less wind but it tends to rain on most afternoons. In between rains, there are still beautiful skies.\nIt’s a good idea to avoid the school holiday months of June and July as there’s a hike in local tourism during those months.\nHow to Get to the Bangka-Belitung Islands\nYou can reach both Pangkal Pinang in Bangka and Tanjung Pandan in Belitung pretty easily from the rest of Indonesia. There are frequent flights to and from Jakarta on both Garuda Indonesia and Lion Air. You’ll also find a few flights to and from Palembang with Sriwijaya Air.\nYou can also travel by ferry from Palembang to Bangka as there are high-speed ferries making the route from Boom Baru (just 2 km from Palembang’s city center) to Mentok port in Bangka. Mentok port is conveniently located in the northeastern part of Bangka where the most beautiful beaches also happen to be. From the port, you can jump on a bus that will drop you off outside your hotel.\nIf you want to take another ferry from Bagka to Belitung, you’ll have to get down to Bangka’s capital, Pangalpinang, which takes around 3 to 4 hours from Mentok. Just go another 4km south of Pangalpinang to Pangkal Balam Port and you can board Hydro foils going to Belitung and even Jakarta.\nHow to Get Around the Bangka-Belitung Islands\nBangka has taxis as well as mini-buses that drive all over the island but the public transportation leaves much to be desired. It’s best to rent a car of a motorbike to get around.\nThe situation is the same for Belitung, although it’s small enough that pretty much any point on the island can be reached within two hours’ walking time from the main town of Tanjung Pandan. There are, however, no taxis or public transportation to speak of so if you want to move faster, you’ll have to rent a car or a motorcycle.\nThe rental car will have to come with a driver and both will cost you around 500,000 IDR ($50 USD) per day. A rental motorcycle is only around 50,000 IDR ($5 USD) per day and you can rent one from most resorts and hotels. The beaches are well-marked so you should have no problems exploring the island on your own.\nIf you can’t drive a motorcycle, some locals may be willing to give you a list for short distances for around 15,000 IDR ($1.50 USD).\nThings to See and Do on the Bangka-Belitung Islands\nThe main attraction of these islands are the brilliantly blue, crystal clear waters lining the lovely, long white sand beaches. The waters are calm are surprisingly shallow, making them perfect for swimming, diving, snorkeling and just floating around.\nBut in case paradise gets a little dull, there’s plenty else to do on these islands…\nThings to See and Do on Bangka Island\nVisit the Tanjung Kelian Old Lighthouse\nThe old lighthouse was built in 1826 and is a short trip from Muntok. You’ll find vestiges of WWII in the form of Dutch and British shipwrecks in the surrounding areas. And if you take the time to clim up the 199 steps to reach the top of the lighthouse, you can take in spectacular views of all the beautiful beaches of Muntok.\nSoak in the hot springs\nPemali Hot Springs is a naturally created pool fed by underground hot springs. A whole recreation park has sprung up around these springs and there are hotels to stay in and shops to wander through. You can find the springs in Sungailiat, a laidback town in the northeast region of Bangka. You can also explore the Pemali open pit tin mines nearby.\nThe shores of Bangka Island are popular with shorebirds during the migration period thanks to the island’s lengthy coastline. In the spring and early summer, you’ll have the chance to spot a variety of birds, such as the Javan Plover, Kentish Plover, Bar-tailed Godwit, Pacific Golden-plover, Malaysian Plover, Whimbrel, and Common Sandpiper.\nExplore the beautiful beaches\nBangka Island is lined with gorgeous beaches waiting to be explored, not to mention the surrounding islands with their own bevy of pristine, untouched beaches. Check out our guide to the beaches of the Bangka-Belitung Islands.\nThings to See and Do on Belitung Island\nVisit Kepayang Island’s Conservation Center\nKapayang is the largest island among the handful of exotic islands lining the northwestern coast of Belitung. This beautiful island is a must visit while island hopping Belitung for its Kepayang Island Conservation Center. You’ll find a diving center here, as well as a turtle sanctuary with tiny baby turtles and a coral garden.\nSnorkeling is fantastic Belitung Islands. The waters are clear, calm, relatively shallow, and since the island doesn’t get a huge influx of travelers, the corals right offshore are untouched and in fantastic shape.\nDive, Dive, Dive\nEspecially off the northeastern coast off Belitung. You’ll actually be able to dive numerous Chinese wrecks from different dynasties here. In fact, one of the oldest wrecks in Indonesian waters was recently discovered offshore Belitung Island.\nExplore Downtown Tanjung Pandan\nYou can also check out the traditional Bugis fishing vessels that line the wharf and the fish market and take a gander in the Tanjung Pandan Museum if you’ve got time.\nGo Monkey Spotting\nBelitung Island is home to the endangered Tarsius monkey – you can spot them at the Batu Mentas nature reserve. Sign up with a local tour that’ll guide you on a jungle trek to see the Tarsius monkey, followed by river tubing and even an option of a foot massage.\nGet to Know the Culture\nBelitung’s population may not be large – only around 200,000 inhabitants – but it is diverse. And the influence of the various cultures can be seen across the island. Check out the Malay-style wooden houses or the Bugis traditional houses on stilts near Bukit Berahu.\nMeander through the Balinese community of around 200 families in the Balinese village of Giri Jati, which is guarded at the gates with Hindu architecture.\nAlso check out Kwan Im, a Chinese Buddhist temple dedicated to the sea goddess Vidhara and built in 1747 by the very first Chinese workers who emigrated to work in the tin mines of Belitung.\nAnd of course, the Dutch imprint is still very visible here. Spend a few hours touring the many Dutch colonial buildings, shops, and government buildings in Tanjung Pandan and see where it ends by visiting the old Dutch Lighthouse on Selate Nasik Island, built in 1882, as well as a monument marking the independence movement against Dutch colonialism.\nBeach Exploration & Island Hopping\nBeaches, beaches, beaches – the beautiful beaches of Belitung are its main appeal and you’ll really want to explore every pristine beach on every sunny island while you’re here. Click here for a guide to beach and island hopping in Belitung!\nWhat to Eat and Drink on the Bangka-Belitung Islands\nYou won’t find many stand-alone Western restaurants and your best options for Western food are the holiday resorts. If you like Southeast Asian food, however, your stomach will be quite happy here.\nTake advantage of the islands’ fresh seafood and sample the array of yummy Indonesian seafood dishes like pempek (fish cakes in vinegar sauce), otak-otak (fish cakes), baso ikan (fish balls), and abon ikan (fish floss).\nOh, and you can’t leave Belitung without trying its traditional food – mie belitung (Belitung noodles). The delicious dish consists of Belitung-style noodles with shrimp, sliced potatoes and cucumbers in a thick, sweet sauce.\nIf you’re a coffee lover, stop by the city of Manggar – dubbed the ‘city of one thousand coffee shops’ and try as many as you can!\nBangka-Belitung Island Travel Tips\nIf you haven’t pre-booked your accommodations, prepare to pay in cash unless you’re staying at a more high-end resort. Most of the accommodations here are cash only so make sure you have enough on you.\nKeep in mind that saltwater crocodiles are present in both the rivers of Bangka and Belitung Islands. They’re rarely sighted near popular tourist areas, but exercise caution nonetheless.\nAnd of course – sunscreen and mosquito repellant are a must. The selection is not so vast on these islands so bring plenty of whatever you need.\nLastly – do not be without travel insurance. We highly recommend World Nomads. They cover cover travelers from over 150 countries around the world, offer great rates, and cover a range of travel-related costs from the more commonplace – lost baggage and cancellation costs – to the more severe – emergency medical and evacuation assistance as well as coverage for a wide range of adventure sports and activities. Click here for rates!', 'Back to homepage\nThreats to Biodiversity\nThere are numerous threats to the biodiversity of Komodo National Park including human population pressure, tourism, the introduction of exotic species and poaching. However, the most potent threat lies in the destructive fishing practices that take place in and around the Park. These practices destroy the coastal environment at great economic costs in terms of coastal protection, fisheries and tourism.\nTo learn more about destructive fishing practices and the trade that supports them\nplease click on one of the following topics.\nFish traps (bubu), Hook and Line and Gillnets\nLive Reef Fish Trade\nBLAST FISHING :\nFish bombs are mostly made with artificial (chemical) fertilizers\nsuch as ammonium- and potassium nitrate (NH4NO3; KNO3), which is mixed with kerosene in a bottle. Blast fishers hunt specifically for schooling reef fish, so that only a few bombs will assure a relatively large catch. After the charge explodes, diving fishers enter the water to collect the fish, which have been killed or stunned by the shock-wave from the explosion. The size of the coral area destroyed by a single blast is dependent upon the size of the bomb\nand the position of the explosion relative to the coral reef. A beer bottle bomb will shatter an area of stony corals approximately 5 m in diameter.\nMany blast fishing operations use ""hookah\n"" compressors to collect their catch from the reef. Blast fishing is considered one of the most destructive anthropogenic threats to coral reef ecosystems.\nIt has been estimated that the economic costs of this practice are US$100,000 per km2 on average in terms of coastal protection, fisheries and tourism. Moreover, there has been a loss of around 85,000km2 of coral reefs creating a total loss of US$8.5 billion.\nCYANIDE FISHING :\nCyanide solutions are used extensively to catch live reef fish for consumption and ornamental purposes. The concentrations of dissolved poison are not meant to kill but only to tranquilize the target fish, which facilitates their capture. The live food-fish trade concentrates on the catch of groupers and Napoleon wrasse. The aquarium fish trade concentrates on a much wider variety of species of colorful reef fishes. Live spiny lobsters, are also caught with cyanide\n. Cyanide fishing is done by divers, using ""hookah\n"" compressors and hoses to supply air. A diver on a ""hookah"" compressor-hose descends 10-40 meters until he spots a target fish. He chases the fish into a crevice in the reef and then squirts cyanide from a plastic bottle into the hole. As the fish begins to weaken, the diver breaks away the coral around the hole, reaches in, grabs the fish, and slowly escorts it to the surface. The cyanide fishery for aquarium fish destroys large areas of corals, which are broken down after an area has been sprayed with cyanide and the target fishes have fled in between the corals. The use of hookah compressors is a key factor in cyanide fishing practices.\nREEF GLEANING :\nThe fishery for abalone (mata tuju) has destroyed large areas of coral reefs in recent years. Many fishermen are digging through the reefs, using compressors and steel bar tools (the method is called \'meting\'), in search of abalone and other marine invertebrates. The fishermen break down and turn over the corals (which are also trampled by them in the process) and leave behind them fields of near 100% dead coral rubble. Collecting invertebrates from reef flats is a traditional activity, which used to be focused on sea cucumber\nand carried out during very low tides. The high price for abalone and the availability of dive gear and \'hookah\' compressors changed this into a more serious activity in the early nineties and initiated an increase in the total applied effort.\nFISH TRAPS (BUBU), HOOK & LINE AND GILLNETS :\nThe use of bamboo mesh traps) is widespread in Indonesian reef fisheries. The process of setting and retrieving the trap is responsible for extensive destruction on the reef. To hide the traps in the reef, divers break off live coral to cover them. Traps set by simply lowering the trap from boat side via a buoyed rope are responsible for even more serious reef damage. These traps are often heavily weighted, and can destroy entire stands of corals during their installation.\nThe main yield category from the Park is fish (almost 95%). These fish are mostly caught by gillnets, and by trolling and bottom hook and lines. Demersal trolling lines\nor \'kedo kedo\' are wiping out the coral trout stocks. Bottom hook and lines catch all predators and bottom longlines are decimating the sharks and large groupers. Gillnets kill indiscriminately, including turtles, dugong, cetaceans, and all species of reef fish. The fish stocks of the Park are seriously threatened by the use of gillnets and bottom longlines.\nThe target fish species in the live reef fish trade commonly aggregate at specific sites to spawn. Groupers and Napoleon wrasse migrate many miles each season to these spawning sites. Spawning aggregation sites are extremely vulnerable since experienced fishers are skilled in locating them. Wiping out the fish on one aggregation site equals the elimination of top predators from several square miles of reef. Grouper and Napoleon wrasse spawning aggregation sites\nMangroves, seagrass, lontar palms, and other species have been over harvested in the past. Seagrass is collected for use as a food source and as an ingredient for cosmetics. There is a large external market for these products. Mangrove tress are used for fire wood. The palm trees are used to make furniture and buildings locally. The decrease in the seagrass population may lead to increased coral mortality and decreases in species dependent upon them for shelter and food.\nLIVE REEF FISH TRADE :\nThe live reef fish trade has rapidly expanded from its epicenter in Hong Kong throughout South East Asia and beyond during the 1990s, and the demand for live fish is projected to grow even more in the future. By supplying the market with well over 50% of this volume, Indonesia is the largest supplier of wild-caught live fish food fish. Being an export oriented activity, the live reef fishery intensified because of the Indonesian monetary crisis. The present exploitation rate is much higher than can be sustained by Indonesia\'s coral reefs.\nThe main target fish species of the Hong Kong-based live reef fish trade are groupers and Napoleon wrasse, but at least 30 other species are also regularly found as live food fish at the Hong Kong market. Most of these fish end up in aquariums of expensive restaurants, where they are sold to consumers for up to hundreds of dollars (US$) per serving.\nThe live reef fish trade is the source of three of the major threats to marine biodiversity in Komodo National Park. Namely, cyanide fishing, over fishing of adults and depletion of juveniles. As mentioned before, cyanide fishing causes chemical damage to coral reefs through the use of cyanide solutions to stun and capture target fish species. Moreover, diving fisherman cause physical damage when they break away corals around the hiding places of stunned target fish.\nHigh exploitation rates of wild populations of market-ready fish (adults and sub-adults) render it impossible for the wild stocks to recover. The most important target fish species are extremely vulnerable to over-fishing, because these species tend to aggregate for spawning at certain sites during certain seasons. Once the commercial fishery locates a spawning aggregation site, the fishery can extract a significant portion of the adult stock with little effort.\nHigh exploitation rates of wild populations of fingerlings of target fish is also a large problem. the fingerlings are used to supply the developing grow-out fish culture industry. Wild-caught fingerlings are kept in fish cages until they reach marketable size.']"	['<urn:uuid:312b0ac4-6e3c-497d-b286-f6756c8313c8>', '<urn:uuid:1f587b4e-dddd-46bc-b28e-e4b0a05e1a02>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	9	95	3434
86	depth field focus stacking vs hdr bracketing exposure shooting technique differences	Focus stacking and HDR bracketing are different photography techniques for different challenges. Focus stacking involves taking multiple images with different focus distances to achieve sharp details throughout a macro photo, manually adjusting the focus ring between shots. HDR bracketing captures multiple images at different exposure values (typically 2 stops apart) to capture both highlight and shadow detail in high contrast scenes, usually using automatic exposure bracketing on the camera.	['As anyone who has experimented with macro photography will know, this style of photography, and more specifically the nature of the subjects and lenses used, makes achieving a suitable depth of field very challenging.\nSome photographers may like to produce the style of image where only one small part of the image is in sharp focus, with the rest receding into a smooth, surreal blur.\nThis is well and good, but sometimes one simply wants all of the details in a macro image to be rendered in sharp focus.\nSufficient depth of field is quite difficult to achieve in macro photography for two main reasons.\nFirstly, the subjects often shot are typically small, which means that one needs to get close to the subject, using a lens whose magnification is life-size (or greater); and secondly, a longer focal length is needed, especially if the subject is a critter which will run or fly away if a photographer gets too close.\nLonger focal lengths and very short subject distances both reduce depth of field, and do so more dramatically when combined.\nOne counter-measure available is to stop the lens’s aperture down to a very narrow aperture. This sounds good, but there’s a hidden danger: diffraction.\nWhen a lens’s aperture is stopped down to an extremely narrow aperture, light rays entering the lens at various oblique angles must bend dramatically to enter the narrow aperture, and then find their way towards the focal plane.\nAt very narrow apertures, diffraction causes a loss of fine detail in images, resulting in a softer appearance. In macro photography, where fine detail is often the very subject the photographer wants to capture, diffraction is more problematic than it would be in other forms of photography, such as landscape photography.\nSo, with a combination of a long focal length, short subject distance and a practical limitation to how far down one can set the lens’s aperure without degrading the quality of the image, how does one gain more depth of field?\nIt’s easier than one would think, and doesn’t require any special software if you already have Adobe Photoshop, and even works with Adobe Photoshop CS4.\nThe technique is called focus stacking, and it involves capturing multiple images of the subject shot multiple times with different focus distances, and digitally blending them.\nEach image captured must be framed identically, but what differs is the field of focus. After each image is captured, it is simply a matter of adjusting the lens’s focus ring by a small amount to render another part of the image in focus.\nPerhaps there might be equipment available which can adjust the focus ring in precise increments, but I’ve never looked into it, in my experience of having produced three macro images using this technique, I’ve found that the adjustment of the focus ring can be done manually, and still produce excellent results.\nAt the capture phase, I recommend using a tripod so that precise framing can be achieved throughout the numerous images that will be captured.\nUsing the ‘live view’ mode on the camera allows for a much better view of the lens’s plane of focus, and also reduces any potential bumps resulting from contact with the camera’s optical viewfinder.\nI also recommend the use of a remote shutter release to further avoid needing to make any contact with the camera.\nSome contact with the camera will be required, as without a device to rotate the lens’s focus ring, it will need to be touched. For that reason, care must be taken so that the camera is not bumped out of alingment.\nHow many images need to be captured? That depends on the subject, the subject distance, the lens’s focal length, and how much adjustment of the lens’s focus ring is required to capture a series of images in which the closest subject matter is in focus, right through to the furthest subject matter.\nYesterday I photographed the intricate details of a rose laden with water droplets, and rather than opting for the arty shallow depth of field prevalent in many macro images, I wanted rich details in sharp focus throughout the image.\nFor my macro photography, I use a Canon EF 180mm f/3.5L Macro USM lens, which is challenging to use at the best of times, but I also attached my Canon Extender EF 2x II, which doubles the focal length.\nI was therefore shooting a relatively small subject at a focal length of 360mm, with not a great deal of distance between the lens and the subject. The result is not much depth of field.\nOne might think that I’d need to shoot a dozen or more images to capture the full field of focus, but in fact I only needed seven images.\nTo produce a focus-stacked composite image in Photoshop, the technique is as follows:\n- After raw conversion, load all of the raw files into Photoshop.\n- One at a time, and in sequential order (this is important), copy each image to the clipboard, and then paste it as a new layer into the first image.\n- Rename the layers using a logical naming scheme (eg, IMG_0001, IMG_0002, etc.).\n- In the layers pallette, select all of the layers.\n- Click the Edit menu, and select ‘Auto-Align Layers…’.\n- Set the Projection set to ‘Auto’ and click OK. Photoshop will align the layers.\n- Click the Edit menu and select ‘Auto-Blend Layers…’.\n- Make sure that ‘Stack Images’ is selected, and click OK.\nDepending on the bit depth, dimensions and number of images to be stacked, it could take a while for Photoshop to complete the focus stacking.\nThe result will be a stack of layers with layer masks on each. Photoshop’s focus stacking algorithm selects the in-focus subject material in each image and masks out the out-of-focus areas such that the resulting image is sharp throughout.\nThe next step is to create a new layer for the composite of the stacked images.\nFrom the top layer, press Cmnd-Alt-Shift-E on a Mac, or Ctrl-Alt-Shift-E. This keyboard-only command will produce a new layer of all lower layers without discarding the layers. This is not the same as the ‘flatten image’ command, which I never recommend.\nOnce the composite image has been captured as its own layer, proceed to apply any other post-processing as desired.\nNow, let’s look at my results from yesterday’s rose image.\nFirstly, here is a montage of my seven source images, and the resulting composite image Photoshop produced using the automatic layer blending option.\nAs can be seen in the above screen capture, images 1 to 7 all have different planes of focus. The composite image in the lower right shows the raw result from Photoshop’s focus stacking algorithm.\nOne caveat of which to be aware is that the technique results in a softening around the edges of the frame, so it will be necessary to marginally crop the image. For that reason, I recommend composing so that no critical subject matter is positioned close to the edges of the frame, as it may be damaged by the ‘soft border’.\nNow, here’s the final image after I completed my post-processing, which included cloning distracting spots, detail enhancement using Calvin Hollywood’s ‘Freaky Detail’ technique, cloning out of distracting spots, and contrast and sharpening adjustments.\nHopefully this article has been helpful in illustrating how a macro photographer can overcome the challenge of very limited depth of field by carefully executing the capture of multiple frames of the same subject at different planes of focus, and using one of Photoshop’s in-built functions to digitally composite the in-focus subject matter in the multiple frames to produce a rich, detailed image with everything rendered in sharp focus.', 'HDR Photography: A Beginner’s Guide\nAs a landscape photographer, you’ve no doubt experienced situations where your camera simply wasn’t able to capture the full tonal range within a scene. From the dark shadows in the foreground to the bright white clouds in the sky, the camera simply couldn’t retain full detail, so either the bright highlights or the dark shadows were clipped. The result would be less detail than you had hoped to present in your photo. Fortunately, HDR photography (high dynamic range) provides a solution to this.\nWhat is HDR Photography?\nHDR photography (high dynamic range) is a technique that involves capturing multiple images of the same scene using different exposure values, and then combining those images into a single image that represents the full range of tonal values within the scene you photographed.\nWhenever you experience a situation where the tonal range in a scene before your lens is simply too great to contain within a single photograph, HDR imaging provides a solution. Multiple captures with varying exposure values ensure that you have detail for all tonal values in the scene. You can then use special software to process those images, interpreting the result to create an image that contains far more detail than is possible with a normal photographic image.\nCapturing the Sequence\nAs a landscape photographer you are no doubt already using a tripod, which can be a critical accessory for HDR photography. After finding a composition you like, but that features a tonal range that exceeds what you can capture with a single photo, you can capture a series of images that can later be assembled into an HDR image with full detail from the darkest shadows through the brightest highlights.\nFor an HDR sequence you want to capture a photo that retains full highlight detail, as well as a photo that retains full shadow detail. Of course, in most cases you’ll also need additional photos representing exposures in between those two extremes. As a general rule you should capture a series of photos that are each separated by an exposure value of two stops.\nWith very few exceptions, you will generally want to keep the lens aperture and the ISO setting fixed, changing the shutter speed from one frame to the next. You can start by capturing a photo that retains full detail in the highlights, with no clipping shown on the right side of the histogram when reviewing the photo.\nFurther Reading: Understanding Histograms and How to Use Them\nYou can then adjust the shutter speed for the next photo to achieve an exposure that is two stops brighter. For example, let’s assume that your exposure settings for the first photo in the sequence included a shutter speed of 1/500th of a second. With the lens aperture and ISO setting fixed, you can adjust the shutter speed by two stops to 1/125th of a second.\nYou can then capture an exposure with a shutter speed of 1/30th of a second, and continue with this process until you have captured an image that retains full detail in the darkest shadow areas, reviewing the result on the back of your camera to ensure there is no clipping on the left end of the histogram for that final image.\nUsing Automatic Bracketing for HDR Photography\nWhen you are capturing a series of photos that will later be assembled into a final HDR result, you’re actually capturing what is referred to as a set of bracketed exposures. In addition to capturing those bracketed exposures manually, you can streamline your workflow by making use of the automatic exposure bracketing feature on your camera.\nThe basic process for employing automatic exposure bracketing generally involves first configuring the bracket settings, and then using a well-timed shutter release so that all of the photos in the bracketed sequence will be captured as quickly as possible. Of course, you can consult the manual for your specific camera model to determine how to make use of this feature.\nAs noted above, you can separate the photos included in your HDR sequence by two stops. With most newer camera models you can generally capture five, seven, or even nine exposures as part of an automatic exposure bracketing sequence. Older cameras only enabled you to capture three photos with automatic exposure bracketing, but even that limitation will generally provide enough of an exposure range if you separate each exposure by two stops.\nWith most cameras you will find it best to use a timer to automatically trigger the automatic exposure bracketing sequence. If you use the timer option (most cameras offer a two-second or ten-second timer setting), when you trigger an exposure the timer will start, and then the full sequence of exposures will be captured as quickly as possible.\nThe beauty of automatic exposure bracketing is that you can configure the settings with your camera, and then capture a full range of exposures for an HDR image with a single press of the shutter release button. This approach makes it remarkably easy to incorporate HDR into your landscape photography.\nConsider Including the Sun\nI think it is fair to say that landscape photographers are up for sunrise more than most other photographers, and of course also tend to be out for “golden hour” at the end of the day. These times provide a perfect opportunity to include the sun within the frame of a composition you’ll capture as an HDR image.\nWhen you include the sun in a landscape photo and employ HDR techniques, you can produce a scene that is truly impossible to fully experience with the naked eye. Of course, since the sun is so bright and the surrounding landscape will likely be relatively dark, you may need to capture a relatively large number of exposures to produce an optimal HDR result. In most cases when including the sun in the frame while employing two stops of exposure variation between captures, you’ll still need around seven (or more) photos to render a complete tonal range for the scene in the final image.\nIt is important to pay attention to every detail when including the sun in the frame for an HDR image. For example, be sure that the front lens element is completely free of dust, to help avoid bright artifacts in the image. You’ll also want to take special care with the overall composition, since it can be difficult to review the overall scene with the overwhelmingly bright light of the sun. And needless to say, you’ll want to make sure not to look directly into the sun while setting up your shot.\nProcess with Restraint\nOnce you are back at your computer and ready to process the sequences of images you captured in the field in order to create the final HDR result, there is a workflow you’ll need to employ. In general that workflow involves assembling a sequence of photos into a special image that contains the full range of tonal values represented by that sequence, and then performing a “tone mapping” step that translates that tremendous range of tonal information into a final image.\nOne of the tools I often employ for HDR imaging is Aurora HDR from MacPhun Software, for example. This type of software streamlines the process of creating a final HDR image, by enabling you to perform the full workflow in a single overall process.\nThe initial part of this process is relatively straightforward, in that you will basically select the images you want to process and then initiate that process. At this stage you can choose among a variety of options. You will most certainly want to take advantage of the option to align the individual captures, even if you used a tripod in your photography. You will also generally have the option to reduce the appearance of color fringing (chromatic aberrations), which I recommend taking advantage of. In addition, the option to apply “ghost reduction” will help compensate for any movement within the scene from one capture to the next.\nOnce the initial processing is complete, you can apply a variety of adjustments during the “tone mapping” phase of the workflow for HDR images. Most HDR software applications, including Aurora HDR, enable you to employ adjustment presets as part of this process. This approach can certainly speed up your workflow, but perhaps more importantly the use of presets can also provide you with a degree of creative inspiration for how you want to interpret your photo.\nWhile HDR imaging enables you to present an extreme amount of detail in a scene, and many of the adjustments available for processing your HDR images can produce images with significant impact, a bit of restraint is generally best. I highly recommend that you focus on creating HDR images that don’t immediately jump out as being anything other than a great photograph. In other words, start with a great scene and composition, and then process the result with a certain amount of restraint, presenting a unique view of the world without going overboard.\nGet started: Download Aurora HDR to process your HDR images\nThe use of HDR techniques can open up a whole new world of potential in your landscape photography. To be sure, creating great results can take a bit of practice. By understanding the basics of HDR photography you can then explore the possibilities and experiment with different scenes. Along the way you’ll surely create some great images, have fun, and learn how to truly make the most of all that HDR has to offer.']	['<urn:uuid:70151312-b1ef-45db-8d1d-e2b6feb80917>', '<urn:uuid:720f4a76-be4f-453a-a72b-358a4e68aba5>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	11	69	2876
87	How many different aspects of violin performance are evaluated when students audition for the honors violin class at Harmony Leland Elementary School?	Students are evaluated on eight different aspects of violin performance during their audition for the honors violin class. The top 20 to 25 students who score highest are then invited to join the group.	"[""Teacher resources and professional development across the curriculum\nTeacher professional development and classroom resources across the curriculum\nBarrett Jackson, string specialist, Harmony Leland Elementary School, Mableton, Georgia\nSandra McGary-Ervin, principal, Harmony Leland Elementary School, Mableton, Georgia\nSylvia Bookhardt, music teacher, Smith Renaissance School of the Arts, Denver, Colorado\nQ. What guidance would you suggest for other teachers confronted with a profusion of standards for a particular specialty?\nA. As a first-year teacher in a public school driven by standards, I felt overwhelmed by the number of standards. What I have realized is that I was simply not familiar with them and was meeting more of the standards than I originally realized. Through continual review of the standards and my lessons, I was able to incorporate more standards into each lesson and identify ones I didnt realize I had been meeting.\nQ. Would you describe how you teach music vocabulary words to your students?\nA. Music vocabulary in the violin class is taught through immersion. Students are taught the correct names of parts of the instrument and other music vocabulary through constant use and exposure. They are given many opportunities to use the words during each lesson.\nQ. How do you assess students who are at different proficiency levels?\nA. The violin program is not performance-based. Students are assessed on conduct and participation. Their level of proficiency does not factor into their grades. Concepts and topics are rotated on a quarterly basis, so both a student new to the program and one who has three years of experience can achieve the same success.\nQ. How are students selected for honors violin class?\nA. Students are selected for the honors violin class by audition each spring. Every student is allowed to audition and given a score based on eight aspects of violin performance. The top 20 to 25 students then are invited to join the group. Returning members also must audition each year.\nQ. What makes the honors class different from regular violin class? What kinds of performances do the honors students give?\nA. The honors class is performance-based, unlike a regular violin class, and the standards are rigorous. Honors violin students have participated in school theatrical productions and performed for other schools, community-based events, and private functions, including the African-American Women on Tour, Boys and Girls Club regional meeting, and the Atlanta chapter of the Grammys Holiday event. The students recently recorded and released their first compact disc.\nQ. How does the music program contribute to the mission of the school?\nA. The violin program is a brain-based program that contributes to meeting\nthe schools goal of building literacy. Literacy is incorporated\nin the violin class by the use of word walls, power writing, thinking\nmaps, and note books.\nQ. Why was violin selected for all students at the school to study? Were other instruments considered?\nA. The violin is a very appropriate instrument for study in elementary school due to the number of sizes in which it is produced. It offers students the opportunity to use opposing movements while playing. In addition, the violin is an instrument that requires a considerable amount of discipline. It is an instrument that defines excellence. Therefore, the violin blended well with Harmony Leland's idea of high standards and excellence, which we have made a high priority. To my knowledge, no other instruments were considered.\nQ. Was there already a string specialist at Harmony Leland prior to the violin program? Do the parents have to pay anything for their children to participate in the general violin program?\nA. There was no string specialist at Harmony Leland prior to the beginning of the program. There is no cost involved for parents, except for any major repair needed as a result of damage caused at home under the parents supervision.\nQ. What happens to students who transfer into Harmony Leland in the middle of the year? Similarly, what if a student does not want to study the violin?\nA. Students who transfer into the school in the middle of the year are assigned a violin and placed with a class. Due to the nature of the course objective, newcomers can easily catch up with the rest of the group, because the violin program is not performance-based. We have never had a student refuse to attend violin classes.\nQ. What honors arts classes are offered at Harmony Leland Elementary?\nA. We offer eight honors classes: honors art for grades K2, honors art for grades 35, honors Orff [music] for grade 3, honors violin for grades 12, honors violin for grades 35, honors handbells for grades 35, honors chorus for grades 35, and honors percussion for grades 45. We recently added dance to the after-school program.\nQ. How do honors programs differ from regular classes in those subjects? How often do honors classes meet?\nA. The honors classes are primarily performance-based. During the week, a student will attend each regular arts class once. For the honors classes, most classes meet every day for an extended time, allowing the students to excel in the arts, and to prepare and perform as professional musicians and artists.\nHonors violin for grades 35, Orff for grade 3, honors percussion for grades 45 and honors art for grades 35 meet daily from 7:30 to 8 a.m. before academic instruction. Chorus, art for grades K2, and handbells meet once a week for an hour called Art Hour, which is a schoolwide hour devoted to creating art.\nQ. Is there a group performance for honors students?\nA. We have brought students together to perform as an honors family, bringing all programs together for a performance. All students have the opportunity to view the artwork from honors art and to listen to all honors music programs. It is very exciting to view and listen to our honors students as a family of 130. All programs perform for family and friends at our Holiday Extravaganza and other performance venues throughout the year.\nQ. How are students selected for honors programs?\nA. Students are selected through an audition process. Criteria for classes differ. Posture, presentation, technique, pitch, and tone are examples of what a student must demonstrate.\nQ. Are there additional financial and other commitments associated with being in an honors class?\nA. When a student is accepted into the honors class, the parent and\nstudent sign a contract that commits the student to the program for the\nentire year. The parent or student is responsible for paying a $20 fee\nper honors class. Since there is no music or art budget, this fee covers\nfield trips, uniform rental, uniform cleaning, music, and any necessary\nsupplies for that class. Instruments used in class have been purchased\nor made by Harmony Leland Elementary School.\nQ. Why did you become a music teacher? What has been the most satisfying part of your experience?\nA. I became a music teacher as a result of childhood exposure and experience. Music has always been my first love. It was also my first way of learning. In retrospect, I struggled as a new student. Everything was quite foreign to me in first grade. I persevered as a reader by teaching myself. I developed rhythm schemes, patterns, and devices that involved chants and other musical elements. This is how I practiced reading. It became apparent that I was the best teacher for my own learning.\nI realized then that there was an educational connection with music: Use of my ears was essential! Because my vision was weak, my ears offered support. For me, music and literacy always have been combined. I became a teacher with a specific focus in those two areas, and my training was an alignment of those areas.\nQ. Please describe your role as an arts coordinator at Smith Renaissance. How did this fit in with the rest of your responsibilities?\nA. I ran schoolwide programs that matched the pacing of our curriculum. During my time as arts coordinator, I was determined to build tradition into school celebrations. In other words, I was able to synthesize learning by blending traditional themes into an overall program. A major challenge was involving parents, but that dwindled as mothers and fathers became more interested in becoming part of this success.\nI viewed my major job responsibility as connecting academic pieces to all performances. Students took part in literacy exercises and projects that required parents to take them to the library, museum, and community resources. I became aware that we had to maintain a calendar for the entire school. The dates on the calendar were important, as total school inclusion was essential. These responsibilities fit with my teaching because they all pointed in the direction of learning enrichment.\nQ. Can you give some examples of how the music program has enhanced academic achievement for students?\nA. Building on the music program, opportunities in writing spurred additional research. Students used resources in the school library. Listening exercises added to group participation in project-based activities.\nStudents were invited to present in several district and citywide programs. They often wrote about their field trips and identified concepts in reading. A study of music history added to their involvement in the district Shakespeare Festival. Students shared new vocabulary terms in oral and written presentations. They showed a willingness to take on new responsibilities and risks. Interest escalated as students began to apply to the Denver School of the Arts.\nStudents leaving Smith Renaissance today have gone on to community choirs,\ndance studios, and other arenas for the arts. It has been noted that academic\ngoals in math and reading are reflected in test scores.\n© Annenberg Foundation 2016. All rights reserved.

88	What caused General McClellan to change his supply route from the York and Richmond Railroad to the James River during the Seven Days battles?	McClellan assumed he was heavily outnumbered and feared that Jackson was positioned to march into his rear and cut off his supply lines. This led him to abandon his supply line on the York and Richmond Railroad and switch to a water route up the James River.	['The Battle of Mechanicsville, also known as the battle of Beaver Dam Creek. which opened the Confederate offensive of the Seven Days on June 26, 1862 was a tactical fiasco and defeat for the Army of Northern Virginia and a strategic defeat for the Army of the Potomac.\nLee’s plan to attack Porter’s V Corps, the only corps of the Army of the Potomac north of the Chickahominy, defeat it and turn the right flank of the Army of the Potomac went badly awry in execution. Beginning the poor performance that would plague him throughout the Seven Days, Jackson was four hours late in attacking the north flank of Porter’s corps. Instead, AP Hill attacked with his division in futile and bloody frontal assaults which were easily repulsed by Porter. After Jackson’s arrival, he bivouacked his men, although the sounds of a major attack were clear. AP Hill renewed his attacks, reinforced by DH. Hill’s brigade, although Lee had ordered no more attacks and was again bloodily repulsed. Confederate casualties were 1461 with Union casualties half this number. So a humiliating tactical defeat for the Confederates marked by an inept inability on the part of Lee to put forward a coordinated attack.\nHowever, McClellan turned this day of Confederate defeat into one of victory. Assuming, as he always did, that he was heavily outnumbered, and fearing that Jackson was positioned to march into his rear and cut off his supply lines, McClellan ordered Porter to retreat, and decided to abandon his supply line which relied upon the rail line north of the Chickahominy, the York and Richmond Railroad, and to rely upon a supply line by water up the James River. This decision meant that he was going to have to withdraw from his positions in front of Richmond and retreat down the Peninsula. Few defeats have reaped such rich rewards as Mechanicsville did for the Confederacy. Here is General Lee’s report on the battle of Mechanicsville which was written on March 6, 1863:\nBATTLE OF MECHANICSVILLE.\nAccording to the general order of battle, a copy of which is annexed, General Jackson was to march from Ashland on the 25th in the direction of Slash Church, encamping for the night west of the Central Railroad, and to advance at 3 a.m. on the 26th and turn Beaver Dam. A. P. Hill was to cross the Chickahominy at Meadow Bridge when Jackson’s advance beyond that point should be known and move directly upon Mechanicsville. As soon as the Mechanicsville Bridge should be uncovered Longstreet and D. H. Hill were to cross, the latter to proceed to the support of Jackson and the former to that of A. P. Hill. The four commands were directed to sweep down the north side of the Chickahominy toward the York River Railroad, Jackson on the left and in advance, Longstreet nearest the river and in the rear. Huger and Magruder were ordered to hold their positions against any assault of the enemy, to observe his movements, and follow him closely should he retreat. General Stuart, with the cavalry, was thrown out on Jackson’s left to guard his flank and give notice of the enemy’s movements. Brigadier-General Pendleton was directed to employ the Reserve Artillery, so as to resist any approach of the enemy toward Richmond, to superintend that portion of it posted to aid in the operations of the north bank, and hold the remainder ready for use when it might be required.\nIn consequence of unavoidable delays the whole of General Jackson’s command did not arrive at Ashland in time to enable him to reach the point designated on the 25th. His march on the 26th was consequently longer than had been anticipated, and his progress being also retarded by the enemy, A. P. Hill did not begin his movement until 3 p.m., when he crossed the river and advanced upon Mechanicsville. After a sharp conflict he drove the enemy from his intrenchments, and forced him to take refuge in his works on the left bank of Beaver Dam, about 1 mile distant. This position was a strong one, the banks of the creek in front being high and almost perpendicular, and the approach to it over open fields, commanded by the fire of artillery and infantry intrenched on the opposite side. The difficulty of crossing the stream had been increased by fellling the woods on its banks and destroying the bridges. Jackson being expected to pass Beaver Dam above and turn the enemy’s right, a direct attack was not made by General Hill. One of his regiments on the left of his line crossed the creek to communicate with Jackson and remained until after dark, when it was withdrawn. Longstreet and D. H. Hill crossed the Mechanicsville Bridge as soon as it was uncovered and could be repaired, but it was late before they reached the north bank of the Chickahominy. D. H. Hill’s leading brigade, under Ripley, advanced to the support of the troops engaged, and at a late hour united with Pender’s brigade, of A. P. Hill’s division, in an effort to turn the enemy’s left; but the troops were unable in the growing darkness to overcome the obstructions, and after sustaining a destructive fire of musketry and artillery at short range were withdrawn. The fire was continued until about 9 p.m., when the engagement ceased. Our troops retained the ground on the right bank, from which the enemy had been driven. Ripley was relieved at 3 a.m. on the 27th by two of Longstreet’s brigades, which were subsequently re-enforced. In expectation of Jackson’s arrival on the enemy’s right the battle was renewed at dawn, and continued with animation for about two hours, during which the passage of the creek was attempted and our troops forced their way to its banks, where their progress was arrested by the nature of the stream. They maintained their position while preparations Were being made to cross at another point nearer the Chickahominy, Before they were completed Jackson crossed Beaver Dam above, and the enemy abandoned his intrenchments and retired rapidly down the river, destroying a great deal of property, but leaving much in his deserted camps.']	['<urn:uuid:1cb10ca0-094e-4493-ac08-f631ea21e0c6>']	factoid	direct	verbose-and-natural	distant-from-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	24	47	1032
89	how recognize early warning signs language brain damage	Early recognition involves checking for sudden-onset face weakness, arm drift, and abnormal speech (FAST system). For language specifically, signs include difficulty producing or understanding spoken and written language (aphasia). While stroke symptoms generally start suddenly and don't progress further, aphasia can present as either fluent aphasia (difficulty understanding but speaking fluently) or non-fluent aphasia (good comprehension but difficulty speaking). Early recognition is crucial for expediting diagnostic tests and treatments.	"[""Stroke symptoms typically start suddenly, over seconds to minutes, and in most cases do not progress further. The symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected. The more extensive the area of brain affected, the more functions that are likely to be lost. Some forms of stroke can cause additional symptoms: in intracranial hemorrhage, the affected area may compress other structures. Most forms of stroke are not associated with headache, apart from subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral venous thrombosis and occasionally intracerebral hemorrhage.\nVarious systems have been proposed to increase recognition of stroke by patients, relatives and emergency first responders. A systematic review, updating a previous systematic review from 1994, looked at a number of trials to evaluate how well different physical examination findings are able to predict the presence or absence of stroke. It was found that sudden-onset face weakness, arm drift,(ask the person to raise both arms. If one arm drifts down, that could indicate a stroke.) , and abnormal speech are the findings most likely to lead to the correct identification of a case of stroke (+ likelihood ratio of 5.5 when at least one of these is present). Similarly, when all three of these are absent, the likelihood of stroke is significantly decreased (– likelihood ratio of 0.39). While these findings are not perfect for diagnosing stroke, the fact that they can be evaluated relatively rapidly and easily make them very valuable in the acute setting.\nProposed systems include FAST (face, arm, speech, and time), as advocated by the Department of Health and The Stroke Association, the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS) and the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS). Use of these scales is recommended by professional guidelines.\nFor people referred to the emergency room, early recognition of stroke is deemed important as this can expedite diagnostic tests and treatments. A scoring system called ROSIER (recognition of stroke in the emergency room) is recommended for this purpose; it is based on features from the medical history and physical examination.\nIf the area of the brain affected contains one of the three prominent Central nervous system pathways—the spinothalamic tract, corticospinal tract, and dorsal column (medial lemniscus), symptoms may include:\n- hemiplegia and muscle weakness of the face\n- reduction in sensory or vibratory sensation\nIn most cases, the symptoms affect only one side of the body (unilateral). The defect in the brain is ''usually'' on the opposite side of the body (depending on which part of the brain is affected). However, the presence of any one of these symptoms does not necessarily suggest a stroke, since these pathways also travel in the spinal cord and any lesion there can also produce these symptoms.\nIn addition to the above CNS pathways, the ''brainstem'' also consists of the 12 cranial nerves. A stroke affecting the brain stem therefore can produce symptoms relating to deficits in these cranial nerves:\n- altered smell, taste, hearing, or vision (total or partial)\n- drooping of eyelid (ptosis) and weakness of ocular muscles\n- decreased reflexes: gag, swallow, pupil reactivity to light\n- decreased sensation and muscle weakness of the face\n- balance problems and nystagmus\n- altered breathing and heart rate\n- weakness in sternocleidomastoid muscle with inability to turn head to one side\n- weakness in tongue (inability to protrude and/or move from side to side)\nIf the ''cerebral cortex'' is involved, the CNS pathways can again be affected, but also can produce the following symptoms:\n- aphasia (inability to speak or understand language from involvement of Broca's or Wernicke's area)\n- apraxia (altered voluntary movements)\n- visual field defect\n- memory deficits (involvement of temporal lobe)\n- hemineglect (involvement of parietal lobe)\n- disorganized thinking, confusion, hypersexual gestures (with involvement of frontal lobe)\n- anosognosia (persistent denial of the existence of a, usually stroke-related, deficit)\nIf the ''cerebellum'' is involved, the patient may have the following:\n- trouble walking\n- altered movement coordination\n- vertigo and or disequilibrium\nLoss of consciousness, headache, and vomiting usually occurs more often in hemorrhagic stroke than in thrombosis because of the increased intracranial pressure from the leaking blood compressing on the brain.\nIf symptoms are maximal at onset, the cause is more likely to be a subarachnoid hemorrhage or an embolic stroke.\nThis article is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.\nIt uses material from the Wikipedia article on\nAll material adapted used from Wikipedia is available under the terms of the\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.\nWikipedia® itself is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation, Inc."", ""About one million people in the US currently have aphasia, an acquired language disorder, causing total impairment of language ability. Aphasia includes not just difficulty in producing but also comprehending both spoken and written language. A victim of aphasia may exhibit impairment depending upon the extent of brain damage - he may be able to sing but not speak. There are chances of aphasia co-occurring with other disorders like apraxia which also result from damage of the brain.\nAphasia can be diagnosed either by quick clinical screening or tests conducted for hours together examining the key components of language communication. However, the prognosis depends upon several factors including the age of the patient, the location and size of the lesion and the type of aphasia he is suffering from. Learn more about fluent aphasia, semantic aphasia and receptive aphasia.\nWhat is aphasia?\nAphasia is a disorder that is caused by certain portions of the brain that are responsible for language being damaged. In most cases, these areas are located on the left hemisphere of the brain. The onset of aphasia is almost sudden, as a result of a stroke or head injury or brain tumor, an infection or dementia. Due to the disorder, the expression and understanding are impaired as well as reading and writing.\nWho does aphasia affect?\nAnyone can suffer aphasia. This includes children, but most of the people with aphasia are either middle aged or even older. Aphasia affects men and women alike. The National Aphasia Association estimates that approximately 80,000 individuals acquire aphasia each year through strokes in the US.\nCauses of aphasia\nAphasia is caused by damage of one or more language areas in the brain. Most of the times, the cause is construed as a stroke. And a stroke occurs when blood is unable to reach a particular part of the brain. When normal supply of blood which carries oxygen and important nutrients fail, the brain cells die. Other than this, severe blows to the head, tumors, infections and other conditions affect the brain.\nSigns and symptoms of aphasia\nWhile some have difficulty using words or sentences revealing 'expressive aphasia', some others have trouble in understanding others 'receptive aphasia'. Those with global aphasia struggle with both words and understanding.\nThe victims suffer problems with spoken language, in both talking and understanding and in written language in reading and writing. Aphasia can be mild or severe depending on the location of the damage to the brain.\nTypes of aphasia\nBy and large, aphasia falls under three distinct categories namely, fluent, non-fluent and pure aphasia.\nFluent aphasia is also known as receptive aphasia. This is an impairment that is mostly related to difficulty in auditory verbal comprehension. There would be repetition in the use of words, phrases and sentences during conversation with others. Although speech may be easy and fluent, there could be difficulties related to the output of language as well. Fluent aphasia is characteristic of long and winded sentences that have no meaning, verbosity.\nFluent aphasia is also called Wernicke's aphasia and is caused due to damage to the temporal lobe of the brain. In many, the damage occurs in the left temporal lobe although it can occur to the right lobe as well.\nVictims of fluent aphasia are often unaware of their mistakes. These individuals have no bodily weakness as the brain injury is not located near the parts of the brain that control movement.\nThese patients suffer a rare phenomena where they do not understand speech but have no trouble speaking. They ramble quite fluently which may lack meaning. They tend to ignore sounds for a moment, and hearing for another moment. This can cause them to get tough deaf at times. There is a marked discrepancy between their intelligence and their ability to communicate.\nReceptive aphasia reveals certain distinct characteristics. Some of them are:\nNon fluent aphasia\nNon fluent aphasia is called expressive aphasia. This deals with difficulties in articulation, although the victim can exhibit good auditory verbal comprehension. Broca's aphasia refers to a type of non-fluent aphasia. Victims of Broca's aphasia exhibit damage to the frontal lobe of the brain. These patients often have right side weakness or paralysis of the arm and leg as the frontal lobe is essential for motor movements.\nThey speak in short phrases most of the times that can make sense but these are produced with great effort. Grammatical coherence may miss as they often omit small words such as 'is' 'and' and 'the.' For instance, a victim of non fluent aphasia may simply say 'walk dog' and not 'I will not take the dog for a walk.' For 'there are two books on the table,' she may say 'book book two table.' Patients of Broca's aphasia understand the speech of others fairly well. Hence, unlike fluent aphasia victims, non fluent aphasia victims become easily frustrated understanding their limitations.\nGlobal aphasia which is yet another type of non fluent aphasia results from damage to extensive portions of the language areas of the brain. These individuals suffer severe communication difficulties and express an extremely limited ability to speak or comprehend language.\nPure aphasia is selective impairment in reading, writing or in recognizing words. For instance, a person may be able to read but not write or write but not read.\nAphasia - primary and secondary aphasia\nWhile primary aphasia is caused by problems with language processing mechanisms, secondary aphasia can result in memory loss and attention disorders. Acquired childhood aphasia - ACA is clearly language impairment, a result of some sort of brain damage. It could be due to head trauma, tumors and cerebrovascular accident or seizure disorders. While ACA is normally preceded by a normal language development, age of onset is usually defined as from infancy.\nACA is different from developmental aphasia in that there is no apparent neurological basis for language deficit in the latter. ACA is a primary failure in language acquisition but it occurs in very few children. There is a marked use of expressive language is such special children with ACA. These children can just stop talking for period of weeks of months or even years, and when they try to start talking again, they need a lot of encouragement. The problems with language comprehension does not last this long.\nThis results in loss of specific information to the patient. He can no longer connect a word meaning to the word. However, objects can be correctly named and there is little or no disturbance in articulation of words. While individual words are understood, broader meaning of what is heard cannot be gasped.\nThere are instances when a patient can completely recover from aphasia without treatment. This is especially true in case of 'transient ischemic attack' when the blood flow to the brain is only temporarily interrupted and is quickly restored after a stroke. Language abilities are restored within few hours or days.\nHowever, in most cases, language recovery is not so quick or complete in aphasia. There could be painful and partial spontaneous recovery in which the language abilities return a few days to a month after the brain injury. But some amount of aphasia typically remains. Speech therapy is often helpful in such instances. Recovery continues to over a two year period.\nHealth professionals opine that by far the most effective treatment for aphasia begins early in the recovery process. Certain essential factors that contribute and influence improvement in the patient include the cause of the brain damage, the area of the brain what was damaged, extent of brain injury, age and health of the individual. Motivation, handedness and level of education are additional factors that contribute to patient recovery.\nIn most cases, the focus of aphasia therapy is to improve the patient's ability to communicate by helping him/her use the remaining language abilities as much as possible. Compensating for language problems, learning other methods of communicating and restoring language abilities are allied aims of the therapy.\nIndividual therapies focus on specific needs of the victim while group therapies offer the opportunity to use new methods of communication.\nIn most major cities in the US, there are stroke clubs and regional support groups formed by people who had suffered stroke. These clubs and groups afford opportunity for patients with aphasia to try new communication skills. They also help persons and his/her family to adjust to the changing unpredictable phases in the life of a person affected by stroke and aphasia.\nFamily involvement is often crucial in the treatment of aphasia. Family members should lend a helping hand by learning the best way to communicate with their loved ones. Most doctors encourage family members to:\nNowadays there are other treatment approaches that involve use of computers to improve language abilities of people with aphasia. Computer assisted therapies can help people with aphasia relieve certain parts of speech. Computers also help people with problems in perceiving the different phonemes or the sound forms from which words are formed by providing auditory discrimination exercises.\nResearch studies are on to underlie how injury to a particular part of the brain impairs a person's ability to convey and understand language. These results could certainly provide a useful solution to treat various types of aphasia.""]"	['<urn:uuid:8e1d17f9-be4a-46ee-9cd7-b7b99812c080>', '<urn:uuid:dcbecd1f-bef9-4675-9791-e79f8a8e68ee>']	factoid	direct	long-search-query	distant-from-document	multi-aspect	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	8	69	2293
90	empty chemical containers disposal recycling process agrecovery steps requirements	The recycling process for empty agrichemical containers through Agrecovery involves several specific steps: First, containers must be triple-rinsed with water and left to drain and dry. All residue must be removed from both inside and outside the container. Containers must be clearly marked as 'Rinsed x 3'. Users need to locate the nearest Agrecovery site through their website. Containers should be brought to the site with lids removed, and this service is free for products from participating brands. Before acceptance, containers are inspected and a recycling receipt is issued.	"[""What the Hazardous Substances Regulations mean for you\nHazardous substances are widely used across New Zealand workplaces, so it’s important to know the risks and how to protect people from harm. All businesses must manage their hazardous substances risks. This brochure explains ten key things you need to know and do.\n- About 1 in 3 businesses in New Zealand manufacture, use, handle or store hazardous substances.\n- Hazardous substances a major contributor to the estimated 600-900 deaths and 30,000 cases of serious ill health from work-related disease each year in New Zealand. They can also cause immediate harm such as from fires and explosions\n- The Health and Safety at Work (Hazardous Substances) Regulations 2017 set out the rules for work-related activities involving hazardous substances.\n- All empty chemical containers pose a risk to people and environment. It is easy and safe to recycle these through AgRecovery.\n- Unused chemicals pose a risk to people and environment. You can arrange for these to be collected from your farm through AgRecovery.\nKnow what you've got\nYou need to know what hazardous substances you have, and how much, in order to safely manage the risks to people.\n1. Create an inventory\nThere are three main things you need to do:\n- make an inventory of all the hazardous substances manufactured, used, handled or stored at your workplace including hazardous waste\n- keep your inventory up-to-date and accurate\n- make sure your inventory is readily accessible to emergency services workers.\nThe simplest way to prepare an inventory is to use the Hazardous Substances Calculator(external link).\nTIP: Before creating your full inventory, make a list of all your hazardous substances and work out which ones you can eliminate, substitute or minimise (see Assess the risk). This could reduce the number or quantities of substances you need to include on your inventory and the controls you need to put in place.\n2. Make sure you have a safety data sheet from your supplier for each hazardous substance in your workplace\nSafety data sheets provide comprehensive information about the properties of a hazardous substance, how it affects health and safety in the workplace and how to manage these risks.\nWhat’s a hazardous substance?\nA hazardous substance is any product or chemical that has explosive, flammable, oxidising, toxic, corrosive or ecotoxic properties.\n- Explosive: explodes or causes explosion.\n- Flammable: ignites easily and burns rapidly.\n- Oxidising: could be gaseous, solid or liquid and can cause or intensify fire and explosion.\n- Toxic: can harm people if it enters the body through contact, being inhaled or ingested. The effects can range from mild to life threatening, and can be immediate or long term.\n- Corrosive: can cause severe skin burns and eye damage.\n- Ecotoxic: is toxic to the environment.\nAssess the risk\n3. Know the risks associated with hazardous substances in your workplace, take appropriate measures to manage the risks and review these regularly\nYour inventory and safety data sheets will give you a good picture of the risks that exist in your workplace and the controls you need to have in place to protect people from harm.\nIf you have created your inventory in the Hazardous Substances Calculator(external link), the Calculator will have provided a list of the majority of the controls you need to put in place to manage the risks.\nOnce you have put the required controls in place, you will need to review your operation to identify any remaining risks and determine the most effective control measures to minimise those risks.\nIdeally you should eliminate any substances you don’t need. If you can’t, consider (in this order):\n- Substitution: Whether the substance could be replaced by one posing less risk, such as substituting solvent based inks with inks made from vegetable oil.\n- Isolation: Isolating the hazard can prevent people coming into contact with it (eg spray painting in a fully automated booth).\n- Engineering control measures: Apply physical control measures to minimise risk, such as ventilation.\n- Administrative controls: Apply processes to make your workplace safer (eg job rotation to reduce the time someone is exposed to a hazardous substance).\n- Personal protective equipment (PPE): If the risk remains after all other measures have been applied, you must supply and ensure the use of personal protective equipment. For example, respirators can protect staff from inhaling hazardous substances. Note that PPE is not always fully effective. See the WorkSafe website for information on health monitoring.\n‘Controls’ are measures that help you manage the risks posed by a hazardous substance. Here are some of the key things to do:\n4. Inform and train your workers\nEveryone who works with and around hazardous substances must have the knowledge and practical experience to do so safely. You need to make sure workers know of the hazardous substances in their work area, along with the dangers they pose, and get the training and supervision necessary to work safely with and around them. You must also keep a record of the training and instruction provided to each worker.\n5. Label your containers\nCheck that your containers of hazardous substances are clearly and correctly labelled so people know what’s inside. Labels must be maintained and readable. You have labelling responsibilities for:\n- substances that have come from a supplier and are therefore already labelled\n- substances that you decant or transfer into a smaller container at your workplace\n- stationary tanks, process containers and transportable containers\n- hazardous waste.\n6. Install signs\nSigns provide clear, concise information and are often the first warnings people will have about your hazardous substances. Place signs at key points such as entranceways, and on buildings, or in outdoor areas, where substances are used or stored. They should be clearly visible and let people know that hazardous substances are present, the general type of hazard and what to do in an emergency.\nCheck the regulations for signage requirements specific to your industry.\n7. Store your hazardous substances safely\nWhere and how you store hazardous substances will depend on the type of substance and the amount you have. The Regulations prescribe requirements for different situations, and types, classes and quantities of hazardous substances.\nA safety data sheet includes handling and storage information about the substance.\nTIP: Keep the amount of hazardous substances you store to a minimum. This will make it easier to manage what you have and may reduce your compliance needs and costs.\n8. Highly hazardous substances\nSome substances (eg class 1, class 6.1A and 6.1B substances), or larger quantities of substances, may need extra measures, such as a certified handler, controlled substance licence, compliance certificate or tracking requirements. Use the Hazardous Substances Calculator(external link) to help you find out what you need to do.\n9. Plan for an emergency\nYou, your workers, and emergency service workers need to know what to do – and who is responsible for what – if an emergency occurs. Preparing for an emergency depends on the types and quantities of hazardous substances you use and store. Things you must do include:\n- training your workers about what to do in an emergency\n- keeping your inventory of hazardous substances readily accessible to emergency services workers\n- labelling all hazardous substances and ensuring the label is readable and stays on the container\n- having a safety data sheet for each hazardous substance at your workplace; and making them readily accessible to workers and emergency services\n- being prepared to deal with a spill or leak of hazardous substances.\n10. Dispose of your unwanted substances safely\nHazardous substances also need to be disposed of appropriately. You will find information about disposing of products by reading their safety data sheets and contacting your local council for disposal advice. Agrecovery provides a service for the disposal of agrichemicals: www.agrecovery.co.nz(external link)\nRecycling of empty agrichemical containers\n- Triple-rinse with water and leave to drain and dry.\n- Ensure no residue remains inside or out.\n- Clearly mark as ‘Rinsed x 3’.\n- Find site locations on the Agrecovery website.\n- Bring to the nearest Agrecovery site with lid removed (free for products from participating brands).\n- Containers are inspected before acceptance and a recycling receipt issued.\nSafe disposal of unwanted chemicals\n- Make an inventory, noting chemical name and manufacturer, original size, remaining volume and condition of the container.\n- Book via the Agrecovery website or call them for a form (most chemical recovery is free, but some incur a charge).\n- Mark as ‘not to be used’ and store safely.\n- Agrecovery will pick them up next time they are in your area (this may take up to 24 months).\nWhere to find help\nTools and resources are available to help you. Go to:\n- the WorkSafe New Zealand website for information and guidance about the Regulations and your responsibilities\n- the Hazardous Substances Toolbox(external link) for more guidance and tools. This includes:\n- your practical guide to working safely with hazardous substances(external link)\n- the Hazardous Substances Calculator(external link) for help with creating an inventory and seeing the controls you need to put in place\n- the Health and Safety at Work (Hazardous Substances) Regulations 2017(external link)\nThe EPA and WorkSafe – who does what?\nThe Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) regulates hazardous substances under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms (HSNO) Act. This role includes:\n- setting approvals for hazardous substances for use in New Zealand\n- setting the rules for labels, safety data sheets, packaging and disposal of hazardous substances\n- enforcement responsibilities to make sure importers and manufacturers of hazardous substances have HSNO approvals for their substances and the right labelling, packaging and safety data sheets\n- setting the rules to protect the environment, and people in non-workplaces from hazardous substances.\nFor more about the EPA’s responsibilities go to: www.epa.govt.nz(external link)\nWorkSafe regulates workplace health and safety under the Health and Safety at Work Act (HSWA) which encompasses the Health and Safety at Work (Hazardous Substances) Regulations. This role includes:\n- providing guidance, information and tools to help organisations understand their obligations\n- enforcing the rules for the work-related manufacture, use, handling and storage of hazardous substances\n- managing the compliance certification regime\n- developing safe work instruments to set more detailed and technical rules for hazardous substances.\nRequirements relating to disposal and protecting the environment in workplaces are enforced by WorkSafe under HSNO.""]"	['<urn:uuid:c3092968-96a6-4034-8a20-3e01f8db4cb9>']	open-ended	direct	long-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	9	89	1728
91	What color are the monorail carriers at Siemens warehouse?	The monorail carriers at Siemens warehouse are yellow, chosen because the color lifts worker's spirits and creates a pleasant working atmosphere.	"['Warehouse Automation: Siemens Sorts It Out\nSiemens sees labor cost and floor space savings, significant improvements in employee ergonomics and morale, and a fast return on investment from its new materials handling system.\nA s a leading supplier of postal and parcel solutions, Arlington, Texas-based Siemens operates one of the largest postal sortation equipment manufacturing plants in the world. The Infrastructure Logistics manufacturing site in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, handles postal sortation equipment parts, pieces, and installation kits, and holds the finished goods for shipment.\nWhen Siemens decided to improve receiving, quality assurance inspection, put-away, and picking at the plant\'s warehouse facility, it looked for third-party help. After a detailed selection process, it chose materials handling systems integrator Diamond Phoenix, Lewiston, Maine, and Richards-Wilcox, a manufacturer of overhead power and free conveyor systems based in Aurora, Ill., to handle the automation upgrade. Together, the companies analyzed the facility and designed an automation system that would increase overall efficiency and inventory control.\nThe system includes horizontal carousels, an overhead monorail conveyor, a roller conveyor, pallet rack, flowrack, and vacuum fluorescent display controller. It handles three types of Siemens warehouse products: small items in totes, regular 48-inch by 48-inch pallets, and oversized pallets.\nImplementing an automated tote conveyor and carousel system boosted productivity in handling small parts at the warehouse. Previously, warehouse workers picked parts using a paper-based method and placed the parts into totes that they often had to push across the floor to their destinations.\nSiemens wanted to keep these totes, but the model had been discontinued and the design mold had been sold off from the original vendor. Diamond Phoenix was able to research and track down the tote pan mold from an archive and had 1,000 new totes made for Siemens, keeping the operation uniform and consistent.\n""We identify the old totes by the wear they sustained being pushed across the floor,"" says Michael Savoldi, manufacturing engineering manager for Siemens.\nItems are received through induction and placed into totes for quality assurance (QA). Once items are checked for quality, they are set on conveyors for the monorail to pick up and deliver to the appropriate warehouse area. Items can be moved to one of four places: horizontal carousel pods, kitting stations, shipping stations, or directly to manufacturing. Most of the items are sent to one of the three pods of horizontal carousels where they are stored until needed to fill production orders.\nOrders come into the warehouse from the manufacturing plant, located one-quarter mile from the warehouse, via SAP order. From there, orders move directly to the pick queue manager, who distributes them based on priority. An operator picks the material, places it in a tote, then marries the tote to the item when the SAP paperwork is scanned before it is placed on the conveyor. Diamond Phoenix software tracks the tote\'s location and the last place it was scanned on the overhead conveyor system.\nSiemens chose yellow monorail carriers and horizontal carousel totes because the color lifts worker\'s spirits and creates a pleasant working atmosphere.\nThe Richards-Wilcox overhead conveyor acts as a delivery device for totes. The conveyor maximizes floor space, using several elevation changes to clear equipment and machinery. Carriers have a 50-pound capacity and are spaced on eight-foot centers. Totes are loaded automatically onto the first available empty carrier at the four load points—QA plus each of the three carousel pods—and unloaded automatically based on the tote ID destination entered by Siemens.\nThere is no need to stop the overhead conveyor while totes are being picked up. If the loaded tote is unable to divert at the assigned destination, or fails for any reason to unload, it is conveyed to receiving and automatically unloaded. An operator then determines whether to assign a new destination or handle the tote manually.\nThe unload stations are designed to automatically take the tote off the moving overhead conveyor carrier. For the carousel area, once the tote clears the carrier, a transfer moves the tote to the accumulation roller conveyor leading to the work station. For the kitting diverts, a short section of powered roller moves the active tote on to a gravity-run out section of conveyor where the totes are accumulated. Pickup stations have a transfer to place the tote in front of an empty carrier on the overhead conveyor and a stop to hold it in place as the carrier picks it up on the fly.\nTotes inbound from receiving to the carousel area are scanned upstream of the first pod and diverted to the required pod for replenishment. The totes are automatically diverted and accumulated by the end of the carousel workstation.\nWhen operators are ready to replenish parts, they pick the six queued totes off the inbound accumulation conveyor and place them on the work station. Three pods of three carousels each hold the parts until called for.\nOperators place parts from the carousels destined for the kitting operation into totes. When the totes are complete, operators scan the tote ID, the SAP-generated paperwork, and a destination card. This information is written to an electronic file in the receiving area and the destination of the totes is sent to the Diamond Phoenix programmable logic controller. The tote is pushed onto the takeaway conveyor and transported to the overhead conveyor pickup station. The station transfers the tote for pickup on the first empty carrier.\nYOU\'VE GOT TO BE KITTING\nAfter picking, operators place the totes on the outbound conveyor pickup transfer using the Diamond Phoenix material handling controller and scanner to capture the tote ID. Then they enter the destination. The tote is automatically transferred to the overhead conveyor system and delivered to the kitting areas.\nNext, the tote bar code is scanned as it enters each kitting area. If the tote needs to be diverted in that area, it is tracked until it reaches the proper point, where a stop actuates the overhead conveyor carrier to unload the tote. The overhead conveyor never stops moving. Once the tote is clear of the carrier, it is conveyed and accumulated for processing.\nAt receiving, pallets are unloaded and those containing parts that require QA inspection are placed on the pallet accumulation conveyor, which feeds six spurs in the QA area. Operators take the parts requiring inspection to workstations for testing. When a SKU completes testing, the pallet is transferred back to the accumulation conveyor and moved to the receiving dock. An operator then places the pallet on a pickup-and-deposit stand to be put away in the pallet rack.\nThrough the use of horizontal carousels, a monorail, and a conveyor, materials now flow through the Siemens warehouse with ease.']"	['<urn:uuid:2a6644f9-483c-40f9-91f3-d4a7f28bb6c7>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	9	21	1109
92	How are collaborative approaches being used in contemporary sound art installations to bridge the gap between deaf and hearing audiences while challenging traditional notions of music perception?	Contemporary sound art installations use various collaborative approaches to bridge deaf and hearing audiences. This includes the development of special instruments and platforms like Vibrik, which combines signed musical work with vibratory tracks, making the experience accessible to both communities. Artists work together with deaf performers, technologists, and engineers to create inclusive experiences, as seen in Our Vibrating Hands project where deaf artists of various origins come together to deconstruct audism in music. These collaborations aim to move beyond simple accessibility to create new forms of musical expression that can be appreciated by both deaf and hearing audiences through visual, tactile, and sonic elements.	"[""Performance view: Tarek Atoui, I/E Elefsina, Aisxylia Festival, Elefsina (2015). Courtesy the artist and Galerie Chantal Crousel, Paris.\nIn Tarek Atoui's totalising sonic environments, space, architectures, bodies, and instruments can be both conductors and receptors of sound. The innovative Beirut-born, Paris-based sound artist and composer builds and instrumentalises sonorous objects, materials, and physicality, which resonate in collective compositions and generate different acoustic landscapes.\nAt the moment, Cycles in 11 at the Sharjah Art Foundation (SAF) (26 September 2020–10 April 2021) spans 11 years of his practice and collaborations in Sharjah, especially his work around deaf culture, which originated with the project WITHIN (2013). Growing out of a 2008 SAF residency, WITHIN became foundational to the ways in which Atoui studies the perception of sound by the hard of hearing and nuanced perspectives towards listening.\nHis corresponding examinations of how sound performs in space has led to a transdisciplinary network of musicians, researchers, and instrument-makers who have built musical devices that are accessible to all degrees of hearing.\nSharjah is also where Atoui's gallerist Chantal Crousel first encountered his work in 2011, during Visiting Tarab, a Performa 11 commission with SAF, which drew from the world's largest repository of classical Arabic music by Lebanese collector Kamal Kassar.\nMoving from one archive to another, Atoui is in the process of building another sonic library, recording and sampling sounds at harbours and inside military bases, fish markets, and oil tanks around the world in the I/E project (2013–ongoing), a new iteration of which is in Kassel for his first solo exhibition in Germany at the Fridericianum, Waters' Witness (3 October 2020–28 March 2021). The recordings, stored in the form of 'sound boxes', reflect changing audio palettes that echo their underwater and industrial contexts, and translate into distinct material and spatial considerations.\nIn his sonic ecologies and propositions, Atoui abstracts, embeds, and embodies sound in transitory forms, shifting roles between researcher, programmer, composer, performer, and collaborator, often inviting others to intervene. His oeuvre sits at the cusp of redefining the language of visual and performing arts and challenging contemporary sound production. The aural becomes a catalyst in situating our relationship to time, presence, and space as he investigates and experiments with the thresholds of audibility, amplification, and accessibility.\nAtoui's output contests traditional hierarchies of perception and modes of listening, positing an all-encompassing, fluid vision that connects instrumentation to bodies and gestures toward hearing movement. His accomplishments, which have taken him from the Sharjah Biennial (2009, 2013) to documenta in Kassel (2012), the Berlin Biennale (2014), and Venice Biennale (2019), have earned him the 2022 Suzanne Deal Booth / FLAG Art Foundation Prize, with USD $200,000 and production expenses covered for an upcoming solo exhibition at The Contemporary Austin's Jones Center in Texas and the FLAG Art Foundation in New York.\nUpcoming projects include his participation in the 13th Gwangju Biennale (1 April–9 May 2021), the 50th edition of the Darmstadt Summer Course (31 July–14 August 2021), and Struer Tracks, a sound art festival taking place between 20 August and 5 September 2021 in Denmark.\nIn this conversation, Atoui discusses his experimental practice in sound.\nNKFirst of all, congratulations for the FLAG Art Foundation Prize. Do you know what you will do for it?\nTAI have an idea. I'm looking at the different audiences and people I've worked with in the past as components of the work, reaching out to music students, associations for the deaf, and a whole array of people with varying degrees of expertise.\nThe challenge is to have them work together in interesting ways. What I want to do, especially given the current circumstances, is create a collective work that stems from both studio and performance processes. I want to first open a laboratory for researching sound practices that can be activated as a residency or workshop space. An exhibition will be born from this laboratory, as well as an on-site performance programme.\nNKDo you think virtual practices are something artists have to do more and more these days?\nTAWhile I'm trying to initiate these remote studios to which I send instruments, sound objects, and ideas, and work with people there, I'm still advocating for the opportunity to meet in a space and work together.\nEven a small plastic cup is a space you can play and record sound in. You can broadcast a whole installation in it. I feel at ease in architectural space, because sound has this ability to travel and occupy it.\nNKYou often talk about bridging the worlds of music and art. What was the definitive moment that launched you into the field of contemporary art? Did it start with your relationship with the Sharjah Art Foundation?\nTAIt's not something that just suddenly happened. It occurred progressively, in that I always had an interest in the art world and its practices. There were several encounters with artists like Lamia Joreige, who I was a software developer for. But I think Sharjah represented the moment when I received a substantial art residency, invited by Jack Persekian after our encounter in Amsterdam in 2008.\nNKI remember seeing you play in Beirut's underground venues in the late 1990s. Did you ever think you would become an artist?\nTAI knew that my studies in economics and cultural management was not the path I was going to follow, but it took me some time to find out what this would be. Even though I realised it would be linked to music and sound, I wasn't sure what aspect of the field it would be in. Was it going to be composition for dance? Theatre? Film? Touring with bands?\nAfter one album release, I realised I wasn't interested in the latter. And little by little, I transitioned into making sound, which I found I cherished the most.\nNKWhen did you first get into sound performance?\nTAI started in France around the year 2000. I was DJing in techno music at the time.\nNKA lot of your performances are improvisational, where you co-create with others. Although you incorporate technological tools, you often activate handmade instruments in performance. How fundamental is programming to your language, allowing this interaction to occur?\nTAIt's a great tool, and one that I still use both conceptually and practically. When it comes to activating my compositions, programming is a tool that I'm in control of and can employ like a meta-instrument, in how it can structure a research process and bring something mathematical in.\nNKEven your instruments are open work, disassembled and reassembled in sound. What led you to handmade apparatuses?\nTAThe idea of the material took me to craft. Thinking about the sound of ceramics led me to work with ceramicists.\nNKYour work looks at the body as a vessel of resonance, but also considers the machine as a body, such as with the 'Un-drum' series (2009–2010). How would you formulate this relationship between the body and the machine?\nTAUn-drum / strategies for surviving noise (2009) was the first time I built this machine. It set up the cornerstone of my relationship to instruments, as well as to gesture in performance in ways that still echo today—all that changes is the medium and the ways in which things are built.\nI moved from work that was digital in nature and that could be done by myself to compositions that call upon the craft or know-how of specialists. Yet the logic of putting things together, like building an instrument's software, is still the way I create a score with several improvisers.\nThe 'Un-drum' series included ideas like blowing up the surface of a small digital controller, the MIDI, and magnifying certain gestures to make them absurd or impossible to execute in relation to notions of virtuosity in the classical form. These are still present in my work, and you can see inversions and distortions of these notions in acoustic instruments that are no longer computer-based or digital.\nNKDo you think you would have been this subversive in sound if you were trained in classical music?\nTAThere are people who are trained classically who are similarly disruptive but still have a significant technical mastery, to which a conceptual layer is added. In my case, I don't have this virtuosity.\nFrom an early stage, I didn't propose rhythms or structures when I interacted with musicians, who came from jazz or classical music backgrounds, for example. I only had concepts or abstract ideas to put on the table.\nI like the idea of releasing the potentiality of a space by not erecting walls. In many of my works, the spaces are totally open, connecting with the outside as much as possible.\nNKThere still seems to be an urge for you to break a boundary, whether it's sonic or perceptual. Where does this drive come from?\nTAIt's really coming from an awareness of what was established before me, of understanding the history behind sound practices, and growing up in an artistic environment that was very rigorous and therefore not easily satisfied. There's always an attempt to push things further and ask yourself the question of what lies beyond this point, or how it can be done differently.\nNKGoing back to 'Un-drum', tell us about the second one in the series: the Chinese connection (2009), and how it compared the cultural shift during the Maoist Communist revolution to the pan-Arab movements in the ways it created a new mythology of modern art forms and social change.\nTAIt was a specific commission from Jack Persekian for an exhibition called Disorientation II: The Rise and Fall of Arab Cities (21 November 2009–20 February 2010), which was about the fall of the Pan-Arab movement and my contribution to this was to kind of skip that debate and instead, look at how it compared with the Chinese Cultural Revolution.\nNKIs it true that you have lost some of your hearing due to a detainment in Lebanon? And do you think that's what led you to working with deaf people?\nTAI think that's a simplification, although I have read it in the press. 'Un-drum' functioned as a process of healing in order to move away from that, and it's honestly not that intense. I feel the difference between my ears sometimes when I'm tired or stressed, but otherwise, I'm not suffering from it.\nNKDo you distinguish the act of listening from hearing? In much of your work, these are simultaneous processes and listening becomes active.\nTABoth can be part of the same world. Hearing is a form of listening. There's this exercise of returning to an unconscious state of listening, which is something similar to naïve listening—when you listen to music and you don't know who's doing what within the piece. You don't distinguish the instruments from each other, you just listen to the ensemble as a whole.\nNKNow that you're back at the Sharjah Art Foundation with Cycles in 11, much of this show relates to durational facets marking over a decade of collaborative work. Can you say more about the work Pulses in 11 (2020)?\nTAPulses in 11 forms part of the introduction to the show. It's this idea of the metronome that punctuates the space when you enter it, where there's a corridor on the right with all these stones that are acting more like mega-frenetic metronomes.\nNKThey look like contraptions driven by water. Why did you incorporate water?\nTABecause of the organic quality of the water drop, like sand in the hourglass. There's an inexactitude to water, which takes time to fall, and is affected by its environment.\nDifferent notions of metronomes were combined together, such as the strict, digital metronome of the computer. Then you had a disc in ceramic that was rotating to the rhythm of 11.\nNKWhy is 11 significant?\nTAIt's a time signature or rhythmic cycle in Arabic music.\nNKSo time becomes abstract if there's no linearity to it.\nTAThe rhythm is not regular at all. There's a structure that propels the water to drop, but then the drop happens in a very irregular way. Sometimes it drops in one second and sometimes in ten, so yes, there's an abstraction to it.\nNKSound is then both elemental, as part of nature, and psychoacoustic or manipulable. You seem to blur the lines between instrumentation and materiality, using the material as an instrument by permuting an electric current through it. Can the body also be seen as a responsive conductor or machine?\nTAMaybe it's an augmented body—an organism that is heightened by technology—but I wouldn't say that it becomes mechanic or machinic through this augmentation. The machine is not a substitute to the body you see, or at least this doesn't form my relationship to technology.\nSilence is complex; it's more a state of mind or an inner disposition than an absence.\nNKYou have a very intuitive way of working with space in your installations. How significant is the space around the sound, through which sound migrates?\nTAEven a small plastic cup is a space you can play and record sound in. You can broadcast a whole installation in it. I feel at ease in architectural space, because sound has this ability to travel and occupy it.\nI like the idea of releasing the potentiality of a space by not erecting walls. In many of my works, the spaces are totally open, connecting with the outside as much as possible. I'm not saying that the space is always an instrument necessarily. There are cases when spaces are and others when they aren't. Prehistorical caves, for example, were set up according to resonance, and where people felt comfortable in terms of sound.\nNKDo you think we have enough words to describe sound?\nTANot really, especially not in sign language.\nNKDo you see with your ears?\nNKYou've often said that the human voice occupies a very narrow range of frequency, which you've learned from those who cannot hear it. The monumental bass synthesiser, Zero Point Nine, which you developed at a residency with the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, works with subsonic sounds that produce ultra-low-frequency electronic sounds that are felt before they are heard.\nTAYes, it is an instrument that was made during my research with deaf communities, in collaboration with Meyer Sound, which manufactures subwoofers. The idea was to come up with a language similar to sign language—a system that would translate finger movements into bass frequencies. These are gestures that are familiar to deaf people who are very skilled at using their fingers.\nNKAs a mode of communicating?\nTAYes, the movements and the bass frequencies become a system of communication combined. Although it's a very technical instrument, it's also very intuitive, in that anyone moving their hands or fingers would immediately get a result. So you can bypass the technicality by just standing on it and moving your hands.\nNKAre sound and silence binary? And what is silence in sonic terms?\nTAThey aren't, but this is a tough question. Silence is complex; it's more a state of mind or an inner disposition than an absence.\nNKThe Reverse Collection (2016) is intriguing from an anthropological point of view. You began with ancient instruments you were given permission to record, which were played to instrument-makers who engineered new objects that produced the same sounds according to their interpretations.\nTAI was concerned with how objects, shapes, and functions could change with oral transmission. The experiment was conducted with about a dozen instrument-makers from all over the world, to see what they would imagine without an awareness of the actual instruments behind the recordings I was sharing with them, from Berlin's Ethnological Museum.\nNKYour other site-specific work has been quite different, such as your field research in China's Pearl River Delta for The Ground (2018), first presented at Mirrored Gardens in Guangzhou. Why did you decide to focus on elements of agriculture and architecture for these instruments, also made in collaboration with craftsmen and electronic engineers?\nTAIt came from observing a very unique urban topology around 2010, when Guangzhou was progressively expanding and agricultural practices were starting to get entrapped between building blocks and rapidly growing urbanscapes. From there, I started looking closer into how people were producing in this context.\nNKYour work I/E (2013–ongoing), on the other hand, takes different ports—Abu Dhabi, Athens, Singapore, Porto, Beirut—as points of departure. It functions as an aggregation or assemblage—some people have called it a sound library. It's the first time you seem to be collecting and trapping sound inside material, instead of diffusing or disseminating it. What are you going to do with all of these sounds?\nTAI'm still in the process of collecting. The question of what happens to this library of sounds becomes more important when you consider that I recorded in Beirut a few months before the explosion. Hopefully I will have the answers after a few more cities. Now I'm aiming for the big harbours in Europe, like Antwerp or Hamburg.\nNKHow significant are field recordings, and the need to be inside environments, especially in terms of electronic music?\nTAField recordings and electronic sound were all part of the same education and vocabulary for me. Electroacoustic music is very much interested in this idea of a sonic object—as seen in Pierre Schaeffer's objets sonores—which in the early stages was a field recording.\nNKWhat is the residue of sound? What is left behind?\nTAIt's something very personal, but also totally unpredictable in terms of its impact and interpretation. It could be that you visit my pieces and you're left with a memory of falling off your bike for the first time, for example. Sound can bring you back to something that is very intimate. —[O]"", 'Artists: Véro Leduc, Pamela Witcher, Daz Saunders, and Hodan Youssouf\nDeaf Music explorations\nMultimedia installation, 8min27\nVisual description: This image is composed of 3 still, juxtaposed horizontally, from music videos interpreted with sign language.

93	How is milk used in traditional Kazakh drinks, and what are the proper temperature requirements for storing dairy products safely?	In Kazakh tradition, milk is used to make fermented drinks like kumiss (from mare's milk) and shubat (from camel's milk), which are believed to have health benefits. The drinks have a fizzy quality and sour flavor. Regarding safe storage, dairy products must be refrigerated promptly at temperatures below 5 degrees Celsius to prevent dangerous microorganisms from growing. It's important to choose safely processed dairy products, such as pasteurized milk, and not store food too long even in the refrigerator.	"[""Vast, barren and enigmatic: deserts are among some of our planet's most spectacular landscapes.Read more...\nKazakhstan - Eating and sleeping\nKazakh cuisine is heavily based on the nomadic past of the Kazakh people. It is dominated by meat (especially mutton and horse) and various milk products, many of which have no direct English translation. The techniques of preparation emerged out of the importance of ensuring food preservation: thus, there are many dishes based around smoked meat and soured milk. Meat is an important part of the Kazakh diet, and there are numerous jokes about the legendary capacity of Kazakhs for consuming huge quantities of the stuff (the punch lines tend to be of a ‘right, where’s the main course?’ nature). An invitation to a Kazakh feast provides a great opportunity to try many of the classic dishes of Kazakh cuisine together with the rituals that accompany their apportionment, though most dishes are also available in Kazakh or generic central Asian restaurants.\nA Kazakh feast tends to be referred to as a dastarkhan, actually the name of the low table around which Kazakhs traditionally sat, on the floor or propped up against cushions, to eat their meals. In rural areas, this form of dining is still common; in larger towns, chairs and tables have taken over, at least among wealthier Kazakh families. On arrival, you will find the table already laden with things to eat, typically fruits, nuts and a range of salad dishes. Tea is served into handle-less cups called pialas, and will be constantly refilled throughout the meal, even as vodka toasts are called for, and other drinks, such as kumiss, a drink of fermented mare’s milk, are also passed round. Appetisers are brought out, focused heavily on sliced meats. Pride of place here goes to various sliced sausages made from horsemeat of varying degrees of fattiness: among the most important varieties are kazy, karta and shuzhuk. Th ere may also be a range of pastries on offer, such as a meat-filled variety, samsa, found throughout the region. Kurt, little balls of dried curd, is a salty snack which has the effect of draining all moisture from your mouth. At some point during the meal a dish of kuirdak will be served. This is made from the internal organs of a sheep or other freshly slaughtered animal: these are cut into small pieces, together with lumps of fat from the animal, cooked in oil, and served with onion and pepper.\nBeshbarmak is a traditional nomad dish of finely chopped boiled meat © Nykonchuk Oleksii, Shutterstock\nThe focus of the meal, and the signature dish of Kazakh cuisine, is beshbarmak. The name means, literally, ‘five fingers’, a reference to the traditional way of eating the stuff and not, fortunately, to its ingredients. It is generally served in a large dish, placed in the centre of the table. It involves large lumps of horsemeat or mutton, boiled on the bone, which are scattered across a bed of flat layers of pasta that have been boiled up in broth. Onion cut into rings, garlic and a scattering of parsley and fennel, completes the dish. The broth, sorpa, is served up separately, in pialas.\nBefore the beshbarmak is doled out, one tradition that is often incorporated into such a feast, particularly if there is a distinguished guest to be honoured, is the presentation to that guest of a boiled sheep’s head, or koy bas. Since a foreign visitor may well count as the ‘distinguished guest’, be aware that this could be coming your way. The ritual here is that the guest is given a knife, and cuts off pieces from the head, apportioning them to the others around the table. This is traditionally done by identifying pieces appropriate to individual recipients: thus young people often receive a piece of ear, so they may listen well to their elders. You needn’t worry too much about getting this symbolism right; if you can cut small pieces of meat from the head and apportion them, starting with the eldest person around the table and continuing in approximate age order, you will be considered to have discharged your distinguished guest function well. The lumps of meat on the beshbarmak itself are also distributed on the basis of various traditional customs. Thus, elderly or honoured guests tend to be given meat from around the hip, while it is never done to offer brains to children, for fear that they may become weak-willed, or a knee bone to an unmarried woman, lest she be left on the shelf (given the elbow?). Ak nan, a type of bread flavoured with onion, is often eaten with beshbarmak.\nSweet dishes served after the beshbarmak (though they may have been sitting on the table throughout the meal) include irimshik, which is not actually itself particularly sweet: it’s a dry yellowish/orange dish, made of soured cow’s or sheep’s milk that has been boiled and dried. It is, however, an ingredient of the classic Kazakh sweet, zhent, which also contains millet, sugar, raisins and butter and has a rather powdery consistency. Baursaki, small, spherical, fried doughnuts, have an important place in Kazakhstani culture, and feature in many forms of commemorative and celebratory meals. Fruit will also be served at this time. Do expect the unexpected in a Kazakh feast: the kuirdak is, for example, occasionally served right at the end of the meal, after the sweets.\nThe multi-ethnic character of Kazakhstan and the centuries of trading and interactions along the Silk Routes mean that the cuisine of modern Kazakhstan incorporates a large number of influences alongside those drawn from the nomadic Kazakhs. You will find here some of the dishes popular throughout the region, such as plov, a rice-based dish served with lumps of meat, and pieces of carrot and onion. In Kazakhstan, it is sometimes made in a sweet form, with the addition of dried raisins and apricots. Manty are also popular. These are dumplings, filled with spiced lamb or beef, sometimes with chopped carrot added, and cooked on a steamer. A range of noodle dishes, in particular lagman, are brought from Uyghur cuisine, while shashlik, skewered lumps of various barbecued meats, cooked over hot coals and served with raw onion, is a south Caucasus speciality popular across the region. Korean-style spicy vegetable salads are also found on many menus. Kazakhstan’s large ethnic Russian community has ensured the presence of numerous classic Russian dishes, including salads such as the chopped vegetable in mayonnaise confection described on menus here as olivye but known in western Europe as Russian salad, the ravioli-like pelmeni, sweet and savoury pancakes, or blini, and soups, such as okroshka, a Russian cold soup based on kvass, a fermented beverage made of rye bread, or the traditional Ukrainian and Russian-favourite borscht. In the regions bordering China, traditional Chinese dishes such as noodles and stir fries are also common.\nFuelled by the increasing wealth and aspirations of many Kazakhstanis, a whole range of newer arrivals from around the globe has supplemented these longer-established dishes. Thus, as the Where to eat and drink sections under individual towns make clear, it is possible in the larger cities to find Italian, Mexican, French or Japanese restaurants. Note that in Kazakhstani restaurants side dishes such as vegetables do not usually come automatically with your main dish, and have to be ordered separately. A 10% service charge is typically added. In some top-range restaurants and bars this may be set at 15%. Tipping beyond this is not expected. Many restaurants in Kazakhstan offer a business lunch: this will usually be a set meal or a buffet. These tend to be good value, and are usually served promptly, though they are often fairly unexciting. Restaurants are usually open every day, typically from noon until the last diner has finished up in the evening, though some close for an hour or two mid afternoon. Stolovayas, or canteens, often stay open 24 hours and offer a buffet with a good choice of local dishes for a budget traveller.\nThe drink most closely associated with the traditional Kazakh diet is kumiss, prepared from fermented mare’s milk, and believed by Kazakhs to have numerous health-giving properties, from the stabilisation of the nervous system to the treatment of tuberculosis. In parts of the south and west of the country, including Kyzylorda and Mangistau regions, it is supplanted by shubat, prepared from fermented camel’s milk, whose advocates ascribe it an equally impressive range of curative properties, recommending it for the treatment of tuberculosis, diabetes and stomach ulcers. Both kumiss and shubat have a slight fizzy quality and a sour flavour, and are definitely acquired tastes. A foreign delegation greeted on arrival into Kazakhstan by their Kazakh hosts may well be confronted with a girl in traditional dress holding out bowls of kumiss and shubat, accompanied by baursaki. Less frequently encountered, but rather more palatable for most western visitors, is kazhe, which is essentially shubat mixed with grains, which soften the flavour and texture of the drink.\nAnother important drink for Kazakhs is tea. Green tea is popular, especially in the south of the country, but ‘black’ tea, in other words the standard tea of the English-speaking world, is more prevalent. Ethnic Russians drink this black, sometimes with lemon, but, unusually for the region, Kazakhs traditionally drink their tea with milk. Do not be surprised if your host fills your tea cup only half full: it is an invitation for you to continue speaking. Once your cup is filled, you know it is time to leave. Coffee tends to be hit-and-miss, though there is an increasing range of coffee places offering the cappuccinos and lattes you get back home.\nAlthough some Kazakhstanis refrain from alcohol on religious grounds, the legacy of Tsarist and then Soviet rule has brought with it a tradition of vodka drinking. There are numerous local brands, from expensive varieties such as Snow Queen, which boasts that it has been distilled five times, to cheap and rather unpleasant products. You should avoid the cheapest offerings, particularly from outlets such as kiosks. Kazakhstan also produces a broad range of drinkable if rather sweet brandy, known locally as konyak. There are plenty of Kazakhstani beers: brands to look out for include Beliy Medved, Shymkent and Karaganda. However, in swankier bars and restaurants in Nur-Sultan and Almaty, local beers and spirits do not always feature on the menu, as they have been elbowed out by imported products. Viticulture has also been gaining momentum. Arba Wine have been producing quality wines since 2010 that have regularly won prizes at international fairs. Menus in swankier restaurants in Almaty and Nur-Sultan feature Arba Wine.\nRapid economic growth in Kazakhstan in the early 2000s and increasing interest from foreign investors have transformed the situation with accommodation across the country. In Almaty, Nur-Sultan and the oil-boom towns of the west, smart four- and five-star hotels run by international chains cater to the upper end of the business travel market. Elsewhere, once-shoddy Soviet hotels have been modestly refurbished, and new mid-range ones built, though often in rather bland buildings (frequently faced with silver-coloured metallic-look tiles, for some reason). Middle-class and wealthier Kazakhstanis have also shown interest in smarter accommodation in resort areas, from lakeside hotels around Borovoye to chaletstyle mountain retreats in the Zailysky Alatau. Less fashionable, but equally popular family resort areas, such as Lake Alakol, offer family-run and very reasonably priced bed and breakfasts, while greater numbers of young people and backpackers visiting Kazakhstan, mean that both Almaty and Nur-Sultan now have a good selection of hostels for budget travellers to choose from.\nWhat more authentic Kazakh experience could you have than staying in a yurt? © Maria Oleynik\nAnother budget option are the very basic dorms or private rooms with shared bathrooms, the so-called ‘retiring rooms’ at most of the major railway stations, though it would simply get too depressing to use these for more than the occasional night. Overnight train journeys themselves offer a good deal for the budget traveller, as you get a night’s ‘accommodation’ thrown in with your transport. And at the time of writing there was still to be found in most regional capitals at least one survivor from the hotel styles of the Soviet Union, with a dizhurnaya (a lady in charge of distributing keys and assisting guests) on every floor, clunking lifts and stucco-covered lobbies. The great merit of these places is that they invariably offer a wide range of prices, with at least some budget-end rooms with worn-out parquet floors and tiny wooden beds. Some have now been surprisingly well renovated and maintained without too much of an upward effect on the prices.\nCamping in the wild, including those national parks that do not have strict restrictions in place, is usually allowed, though as ever choose your site with care, taking local advice. There are also some well-organised camping sites, in particular in the Altai area. Otherwise, homestays are a good option, and locals often rent rooms out in rural areas. The range of NGOs providing such homestays has unfortunately declined, but asking around usually works. It is of course important to inspect the room on offer before agreeing to stay. Alternatively, Eco Centre in Almaty can help in finding a suitable homestay accommodation option."", 'This article will discuss:\n- The importance of using a food safety checklist;\n- Factors that affect food safety;\n- The five keys to safer food;\n- Technology to help improve food safety an#d\n- Free and downloadable food safety templates\nAccording to the World Health Organization, there are 1.8 million cases of deaths every year that can be attributed to food and water contamination. Although policies and regulations were implemented among food businesses and supplies, incidents involving foodborne diseases and food poisoning are still rampant and remain a global health issue. Conducting regular and thorough safety inspections can help prevent more serious health problems.\nA food safety checklist is a simple yet powerful tool that helps food safety and quality personnel to ensure that food quality standards are being met and complied with. Doing so will also be beneficial to identify food safety threats and risks, and set needed actions to mitigate them. Scheduling food safety inspections is also important to promote and improve the safety culture. Risks associated with poor food safety are caused by the following factors:\n- Improper food handling and preparation practices – this could happen when food is stored inappropriately, stale and low-quality food are purchased, a large amount of food is prepared and cooked even if the preparation area is not sufficient, raw food is stored together with the cooked ones, and food is cooked using the wrong methods.\n- Poor personal hygiene of food handlers – this involves not restricting food handlers who have illnesses and did not go any medical checks. Also when food handlers have poor personal hygiene and do not adhere to wearing the proper clothing during the food preparation.\n- Unsanitized kitchen and equipment facilities – this entails using equipment such as dirty chopping boards, rusty knives, unwashed containers, and the like that are in regular contact with the entire food-making process.\nFood safety can be culture. WHO recommended a food safety manual for trainers that can help promote safety in the most simplest ways. This manual is divided into two sections: background material and the 5 keys to safer food. Trainers, safety managers and other competent individuals can use this manual as a guide when evaluating food safety practices in their organization. With iAuditor this manual can be digitally repurposed and divided into smaller checklists, especially when the trainer wants to ensure that his audience understands the lessons or when an inspector or safety manager gathers information when assessing how food safety practices are being applied. Here are the five keys to safer food:\n#1 Keep Clean\nCleanliness before and during handling food is critically important as harmful microorganisms are usually found in animals, soil, water and even in people. With the slightest exposure to these microorganisms through hands, utensils, chopping boards and other preparation equipment, there are also higher tendencies of acquiring foodborne illnesses. Here are some of the core information for maintaining cleanliness during food preparation:\n- Ensure to wash hands before handling food and more often during food preparation\n- Don’t forget to wash hands after going to the toilet.\n- Always wash and disinfect all surfaces, equipment, and tools used in food handling and preparation.\n- Ensure the kitchen area and food are free from pests, insects, and other animals.\n#2 Separate Raw and Cooked\nSame as mentioned above, dangerous microorganisms can also be found in raw meat, poultry, seafood, and their juices. It is important to separate them from the cooked ones to also prevent them from getting foodborne diseases. Here are some of the core information for maintaining separating raw and cooked food:\n- Separate the raw meat, poultry, and seafood from other foods.\n- Use different and separate equipment and utensils such as knives and cutting boards for handling raw foods.\n- Store food in clean containers to prevent possible contact between raw and cooked foods.\n#3 Cook Thoroughly\nAll dangerous microorganisms can be eliminated if food is cooked properly. According to studies, food must be cooked at a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius in order for it to be safe for consumption. Foods like minced meats rolled roasts, large joints of meat and whole poultry require special handling and attention. Here are some of the core information for thoroughly cooking food:\n- Cook food thoroughly, especially meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood.\n- Bring foods like soups and stews to boiling to make sure they have reached 70 degrees Celsius. For meat and poultry, make sure that their juices are clear, not pink. Ideally use a thermometer.\n- Reheat cooked food thoroughly.\n#4 Keep Food at Safe Temperatures\nAccording to research, food that is stored at room temperature can easily and quickly multiply. Temperatures should be held below 5 degrees Celsius or above 60 degrees Celsius to slow down or stop these dangerous microorganisms from growing.

94	proper roof tile attachment building codes collapse coverage	The International Building Code requires a complete load path from point of origin to load-resisting elements, starting with roof tiles to roof decking attachment. Section 1609.5.3 provides specific methods for determining wind loads on rigid tiles and minimum design requirements. While windstorm damage is typically covered by homeowners insurance, coverage for roof collapse is more complex and depends on the cause. Insurance companies have varying definitions of what constitutes a collapse - some require the roof to cave in completely, while others consider a home being rendered uninhabitable. Additionally, damage resulting from poor maintenance or improper installation is typically not covered.	"['This week, I’d like to introduce Sam Hensen as the first guest blogger for the Structural Engineering Blog. Sam is the engineering manager for Simpson Strong-Tie in the Southeastern United States. Sam will be posting occasionally on topics that are relevant to our work. We will continue to post on a regular weekly schedule (usually Wednesdays) to the blog. In the future, we hope to expand the voices on the blog to include more Simpson Strong-Tie engineers, along with other industry colleagues and associates.\nI tend to think of designers as dealing with either wind or seismic design, yet the Southeast region contains everything that Mother Nature can throw at a building. This includes high seismic areas along the New Madrid and Charleston faults, hurricanes along the Gulf and Eastern coast, and tornado prone areas throughout the South and Midwest. Sam participated in the investigation and was a co-author of the Damage Study and Future Direction for Structural Design Following the Tuscaloosa Tornado of 2011, which gives him some very recent experience with tornado damage. This week, Sam will be discussing a topic not often thought about by structural engineers – the importance of proper roof tile attachments. Here is Sam’s post:\nAccording to recent studies by the Insurance Institute for Business Home and Safety (IBHS), roof coverings are a major problem area in wind-related events and account for 95% plus of home claims after the event.\nPreventing roof tiles from becoming wind-borne debris in high wind regions is essential for several reasons, and may also have an effect on insurance premiums. In this post, I’d like to discuss two reasons that roof tiles can pose a significant threat to life safety:\n- Many designers rely on the weight of roof tiles to reduce the overall wind uplift effects on the structure. If the roof tiles do not remain in place during the wind event, then an under-designed wind uplift restraint system can exist.\n- Roof tiles can essentially become missiles in a wind event, damaging nearby property and creating a significant and direct risk to public safety.\nA Complete Load Path\nSection 1604.4 in the International Building Code (IBC) requires a complete load path from point of origin to the load-resisting elements. For wind conditions, where does the wind uplift load path begin?\nThe roof tiles to roof decking attachment!\nDesigners often rely on the benefit of the weight of the roof tile to reduce uplift loads on the structure, but rarely (if ever) design or specify these connections. The code allows a portion of the roof dead load to be used to reduce uplift loads on the structure (60% of the typical 25 psf of dead load for tile roofs), so keeping it in place during a wind event is critical. Consequently, the attachment of the tile should also be included in the design by the project designer of record, or it should not be used to reduce uplift loads. This consideration is clarified in section 1605.3.2, “…only two-thirds of the dead load likely to be in place during a wind event shall be used…”.\nThe design and construction of roof systems is addressed in section 1609.5 of the 2012 IBC. Section 1609.5.3 provides a method for determining wind loads on rigid tiles, as well as the minimum detailing and design requirements. In this section, equation 16-33 provides a means for calculating the minimum aerodynamic uplift moment, Ma (ft-lbf), acting to raise the tail of the tile.\nMa = qhCLbLLa[1.0 – GCp]\nThe use of this challenging equation should only be performed by a qualified designer and it should not just be left to the installer of a roof system to ensure the roof tiles are properly attached to the roof deck. Fortunately, the Florida Roofing, Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors Association (FRSA) teamed up with the Tile Roofing Institute to create the Concrete and Clay Roof Tile Installation Manual. The appendix of this document includes simple tables that assist the designer in determining the proper attachment of clay or concrete roof tiles to resist the aerodynamic uplift moment.\nImproper attachment of roof tile can also create powerful missiles in wind events. These missiles can pose a significant risk to life safety as they become wind-borne, either directly to the public, or through damage to nearby occupied structures, thereby reducing the ability of that structure to remain in place during the event. Both of these reasons make it essential for proper design and detailing of the connection of roof tiles to be incorporated into the design of the building by the project designer of record.\nWhat are your thoughts? Let us know in the comments.\nWhat are your thoughts? Visit the blog and leave a comment!', ""If a windstorm blows a few shingles off your roof, the cost of repairs is usually not too bad. Hailstorms can significantly harm your roof, causing thousands of dollars in damages. If your roof collapses, the cost of repairs goes up exponentially. Windstorms and hail are covered events in all types of homeowners insurance policies, but a roof collapse is a bit more complex. Whether you're covered depends on what caused the collapse.\nYour definition of a collapsed roof is not always the same as your insurance company's definition. As with many terms, you must wade through a certain amount of legalese, and in some cases there's no clear-cut definition. Some courts have held that a collapse must involve the roof caving in or falling down, while others have required that the home must be rendered unfit for habitation. When in doubt, it's best to consult with your insurance agent to determine exactly what your policy considers a collapse to be.\nCollapse From Ice and Snow\nAll types of homeowners insurance policies, except HO-1 and HO-8 policies, specifically cover loss caused by the weight of ice and snow. This is important in determining the type of policy to buy, particularly if you live in a region that gets significant accumulations of ice or snow. Damage from winter storms is the No. 3 cause of catastrophe claims across the country, according to Insure.com.\nYou are responsible for taking reasonable precautions for the upkeep of your home. Your homeowners policy does not protect you against loss due to poor maintenance. For example, if termites infest your home and chew away at the rafters, resulting in a roof collapse, you're out of luck. Termite damage, and any subsequent damage resulting from such an infestation, isn't covered by any type of homeowners policy.\nMost types of homeowners policies protect you against all perils except specifically named events, such as earthquakes, floods, sinkholes and acts of war. For example, if your roof collapses as the result of an earthquake, your standard homeowners policy won't help you. If you live in a region that is prone to earthquakes or floods, you might be able to buy separate coverag for those specific events. Such coverage might be available from private insurance companies or from national or state programs such as the National Flood Insurance Program or the California Earthquake Authority.\n- Insure.com: If the Roof of My House Caves in Due to the Weight of Snow, Is That Covered by Home Insurance?\n- Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi LLP: What Constitutes a Collapse under a Property Insurance Policy\n- National Insurance Law Forum: Do's and Don'ts of Adjusting Roofing Collapse Claims\n- Insurance Information Institute: What Coverage Is Included in a Standard Homeowners Insurance Policy?\n- Insurance Information Institute: What types of Disasters Are Covered by My Homeowners Insurance?\n- Hemera Technologies/Photos.com/Getty Images\n- Homeowners Policy Vs.

95	Which moves faster: Venus' clouds or incoming cosmic dust?	Cosmic dust moves much faster than Venus' clouds. Cosmic dust particles enter Earth's atmosphere at speeds between 38,000 to 248,000 km/hour, while Venus' uppermost cloud layer moves at approximately 224 mph (360 kph).	"['Does Earth have a dust build-up problem?\nEstimates vary of how much cosmic dust and meteorites enter Earth’s atmosphere each day, but range anywhere from 5 to 300 metric tons, with estimates made from satellite data and extrapolations of meteorite falls. Thing is, no one really knows for sure and so far there hasn’t been any real coordinated efforts to find out. But a new project proposal called Cosmic Dust in the Terrestrial Atmosphere (CODITA) would provide more accurate estimates of how much material hits Earth, as well as how it might affect the atmosphere.\n###“We have a conundrum – estimates of how much dust comes in vary by a factor of a hundred,” said John Plane from University of Leeds in the UK. “The aim of CODITA is to resolve this huge discrepancy.”\nEven though we consider space to be empty, if all the material between the Sun and Jupiter were compressed together it would form a moon 25 km across.\nSo how much of this stuff – leftovers from the formation of the planets, debris from comets and asteroid collisions, etc. — encounters Earth? Satellite observations suggest that 100-300 metric tons of cosmic dust enter the atmosphere each day. This figure comes from the rate of accumulation in polar ice cores and deep-sea sediments of rare elements linked to cosmic dust, such as iridium and osmium.\nBut other measurements – which includes meteor radar observations, laser observations and measurements by high altitude aircraft — indicate that the input could be as low as 5 metric ton per day.\nKnowing the difference could have a big influence on our understanding of things like climate change and, noctilucent clouds, as well as ozone and ocean chemistry.\n###“If the dust input is around 200 tons per day, then the particles are being transported down through the middle atmosphere considerably faster than generally believed,” said Plane. “If the 5-tonne figure is correct, we will need to revise substantially our understanding of how dust evolves in the Solar System and is transported from the middle atmosphere to the surface.”\nWhen dust particles approach the Earth they enter the atmosphere at very high speeds, anything from 38,000 to 248,000 km/hour, depending on whether they are orbiting in the same direction or the opposite to the Earth’s motion around the Sun. The particles undergo very rapid heating through collisions with air molecules, reaching temperatures well in excess of 1,600 degrees Celsius. Particles with diameters greater than about 2 millimeters produce visible “shooting stars,” but most of the mass of dust particles entering the atmosphere is estimated to be much smaller than this, so can be detected only using specialized meteor radars.\nThe metals injected into the atmosphere from evaporating dust particles are involved in a diverse range of phenomena linked to climate change.\n###“Cosmic dust is associated with the formation of ‘noctilucent’ clouds – the highest clouds in the Earth’s atmosphere. The dust particles provide a surface for the cloud’s ice crystals to form. These clouds develop during summer in the polar regions and they appear to be an indicator of climate change,’ said Plane. “The metals from the dust also affect ozone chemistry in the stratosphere. The amount of dust present will be important for any geo-engineering initiatives to increase sulphate aerosol to offset global warming. Cosmic dust also fertilises the ocean with iron, which has potential climate feedbacks because marine phytoplankton emit climate-related gases.”\nThe CODITA team will also use laboratory facilities to tackle some of the least well-understood aspects of the problem\n###“In the lab, we’ll be looking at the nature of cosmic dust evaporation, as well as the formation of meteoric smoke particles, which play a role in ice nucleation and the freezing of polar stratospheric clouds,” said Plane. “The results will be incorporated into a chemistry-climate model of the whole atmosphere. This will make it possible, for the first time, to model the effects of cosmic dust consistently from the outer Solar System to the Earth’s surface.”\nCODITA has received a EUR 2.5 million grant from the European Research Council to investigate the dust input over the next 5 years. The international team, led by Plane, is made up of over 20 scientists in the UK, the US and Germany. Plane presented information about the project at the National Astronomy meeting in the UK this week.\n*Also see http://youtu.be/DKFXcaR5UaM\n*Also see http://youtu.be/5bDAAxCIPJM\n*Also see http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=470\n*Also see http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/2864/earths-cosmic-dust\n*Also see http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/meetings/nam2012/pressreleases/nam24.html\nLearn more here http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2013/08/08/While-shooting-stars-get-noticed-cosmic-dust-hitting-us-all-the-time/UPI-45801376006760/', 'Venus, the second planet from the sun, is named for the Roman goddess of love and beauty. The planet — the only planet named after a female — may have been named for the most beautiful deity of her pantheon because it shone the brightest of the five planets known to ancient astronomers.\nIn ancient times, Venus was often thought to be two different stars, the evening star and the morning star — that is, the ones that first appeared at sunset and sunrise. In Latin, they were respectively known as Vesper and Lucifer. In Christian times, Lucifer, or ""light-bringer,"" became known as the name of Satan before his fall.\nVenus is the hottest world in the solar system. Although Venus is not the planet closest to the sun, its dense atmosphere traps heat in a runaway version of the greenhouse effect that warms Earth. As a result, temperatures on Venus reach 870 degrees Fahrenheit (465 degrees Celsius), more than hot enough to melt lead. Probes that scientists have landed there have survived only a few hours before being destroyed.\nVenus has a hellish atmosphere as well, consisting mainly of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid, and scientists have only detected trace amounts of water in the atmosphere. The atmosphere is heavier than that of any other planet, leading to a surface pressure 90 times that of Earth.\nThe surface of Venus is extremely dry. During its evolution, ultraviolet rays from the sun evaporated water quickly, keeping it in a prolonged molten state. There is no liquid water on its surface today because the scorching heat created by its ozone-filled atmosphere would cause any to boil away. Roughly two-thirds of the Venusian surface is covered by flat, smooth plains that are marred by thousands of volcanoes, some which are still active today, ranging from about 0.5 to 150 miles (0.8 to 240 kilometers) wide, with lava flows carving long, winding canals up to more than 3,000 miles (5,000 km) in length, longer than on any other planet.\nSix mountainous regions make up about one-third of the Venusian surface. One mountain range, called Maxwell, is about 540 miles (870 km) long and reaches up to some 7 miles (11.3 km) high, making it the highest feature on the planet.\nVenus also possesses a number of surface features unlike anything on Earth. For example, Venus has coronae, or crowns — ringlike structures that range from roughly 95 to 360 miles (155 to 580 km) wide. Scientists believe these formed when hot material beneath the crust rises up, warping the planet’s surface. Venus also has tesserae, or tiles — raised areas in which many ridges and valleys have formed in different directions.\nWith conditions on Venus that could be described as infernal, the ancient name for Venus — Lucifer — seems to fit. However, this name did not carry any fiendish connotations; Lucifer means ""light-bringer,"" and when seen from Earth, Venus is brighter than any other planet or even any star in the night sky because of its highly reflective clouds and its closeness to our planet.\nVenus takes 243 Earth days to rotate on its axis, by far the slowest of any of the major planets, and because of this sluggish spin, its metal core cannot generate a magnetic field similar to Earth\'s.\nIf viewed from above, Venus rotates on its axis the opposite way that most planets rotate. That means on Venus, the sun would appear to rise in the west and set in the east. On Earth, the sun appears to rise in the east and set in the west.\nThe Venusian year — the time it takes to orbit the sun — is about 225 Earth days long. Normally, that would mean that days on Venus would be longer than years. However, because of Venus\' curious retrograde rotation, the time from one sunrise to the next is only about 117 Earth days long. [Gallery: Transit of Venus from June 5, 2012, when the planet transited in front of the sun for the last time until the year 2117.\nComposition & structure\nAtmospheric composition (by volume): 96.5 percent carbon dioxide, 3.5 percent nitrogen, with minor amounts of sulfur dioxide, argon, water, carbon monoxide, helium and neon.\nMagnetic field: 0.000015 times that of Earth\'s field.\nInternal structure: Venus\' metallic iron core is roughly 2,400 miles (6,000 km) wide. Venus\' molten rocky mantle is roughly 1,200 miles (3,000 km) thick. Venus\' crust is mostly basalt, and is estimated to be six to 12 miles (10 to 20 km) thick on average.\nOrbit & rotation\nAverage distance from the sun: 67,237,910 miles (108,208,930 km). By comparison: 0.723 times that of Earth\nPerihelion (closest approach to sun): 66,782,000 miles (107,476,000 km).

By comparison: 0.716 times that of Earth\nThe very top layer of Venus\' clouds zip around the planet every four Earth days, propelled by hurricane-force winds traveling roughly 224 mph (360 kph). This super-rotation of the planet\'s atmosphere, some 60 times faster than Venus itself rotates, may be one of Venus\' biggest mysteries. The winds at the planet\'s surface are much slower, estimated to be just a few miles per hour.\nThe Venus Express spacecraft, which the European Space Agency launched in 2005, intriguingly found evidence of lightning on the planet. This lightning is unique from that found on the other planets in the solar system, in that it is not associated with water clouds. Instead, on Venus, the lightning is associated with clouds of sulfuric acid. Scientists are excited by these electrical discharges, because they can break molecules into fragments that can then combine with other fragments in unexpected ways.\nA long-lived cyclone on Venus, first observed in 2006, remains in constant flux, with elements constantly breaking apart and reforming. The clouds also carry signs of meteorological events known as gravity waves, caused when winds blow over geological features, causing rises and falls in the layers of air.\nUnusual stripes in the upper clouds of Venus are dubbed ""blue absorbers"" or ""ultraviolet absorbers"" because they strongly absorb light in the blue and ultraviolet wavelengths. These are soaking up a huge amount of energy — nearly half of the total solar energy the planet absorbs. As such, they seem to play a major role in keeping Venus as hellish as it is. Their exact composition remains uncertain.\nResearch & exploration\nThe United States, Soviet Union and European Space Agency have deployed many spacecraft to Venus, more than 20 in all so far. NASA\'s Mariner 2 came within 21,600 miles (34,760 km) of Venus in 1962, making it the first planet to be observed by a passing spacecraft. The Soviet Union\'s Venera 7 was the first spacecraft to land on another planet, and Venera 9 returned the first photographs of the Venusian surface. The first Venusian orbiter, NASA\'s Magellan, generated maps of 98 percent of the planet\'s surface using radar, showing details of features as small as 330 feet (100 meters) across.\nThe European Space Agency\'s Venus Express spent eight years in orbit around Venus with a large variety of instruments, and has confirmed the presence of lightning there. In August 2014, as the satellite began wrapping up its mission, controllers engaged in a month-long maneuver that plunged it into the outer layers of the planet’s atmosphere. Venus Express survived the daring journey, then moved into a higher orbit, where it will spend several months until it runs out of fuel. By December 2014, controllers expect to send the craft plunging to its death through the planet’s atmosphere.\nThe next mission to Venus, Japan\'s Akatsuki, was launched in 2010, but its main engine died during a pivotal orbit-insertion burn, sending the craft hurling into space. Using smaller thrusters, the Japanese team successfully performed a burn to correct the spacecraft’s course. In November 2015, the team hopes to once again use the thrusters to put it back in orbit around Venus, with planets to probe the hot planet’s cloud layers.\nWith additional reporting by Nola Taylor Redd, Space.com contributor.\n- Learn more about Venus at NASA\'s Solar System Exploration website.\n- Read about and see pictures of more than 40 past missions to Venus.\n- Get the latest news about Venus Express from the European Space Agency.\n- How Big is Venus?\n- How Far Away is Venus?\n- Does Venus Have an Atmosphere?\n- How Hot is Venus?\n- What is Venus Made Of?\n- How Was Venus Formed?\nLearn more about each of the primary planets:']"	['<urn:uuid:f406552e-885b-4966-bca2-343f5c939b23>', '<urn:uuid:dac90b2d-a022-471a-9dd4-4281c4fa6ad7>']	factoid	direct	concise-and-natural	distant-from-document	comparison	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	9	33	2175
96	As someone studying rare feline species, I'd love to know what's significant about the recent Pallas's cat sighting in Nepal's Limi Valley. What makes this observation special compared to previous records?	The recent Pallas's cat sighting in Nepal's Limi Valley is significant because it captured a family group, showing two adults with a cub. This is different from the first records of Pallas's cats in Nepal, which were individual sightings made in 2012 in the Annapurna Conservation Area.	['- Scientists recently recorded images of the steppe polecat (Mustela eversmanii), Pallas’s cat (Otocolobus manul) and Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in the country’s Trans-Himalayan region.\n- This was the first time these species had been spotted outside the country’s protected areas, and the first confirmation that they occurred in the little-explored Trans-Himalayan region.\n- The findings were released in a press statement from Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation and Department of Forests and Soil Conservation; researchers say academic publications are forthcoming.\nKATHMANDU — Scientists in Nepal have recorded three carnivore species outside the country’s protected area network for the first time, highlighting the potential for more discoveries in the little-explored Trans-Himalayan region.\nThe steppe polecat (Mustela eversmanii), Pallas’s cat (Otocolobus manul) and the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) were documented between July and September 2021 in Limi Valley, Humla district, close to the border with China, Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation and the Department of Forests and Soil Conservation said in a joint statement.\nResearch into the flora and fauna of Nepal’s Trans-Himalayan region, home to iconic species such as snow leopards and wild yaks, has been limited compared to the hills and the plains where better-known species such as greater one-horned rhinos and Bengal tigers are found.\n“The number one reason is that Humla was the last district in Nepal to be connected to the road network,” said Naresh Kusi, who photographed the polecat. “The other reason is that it’s pretty expensive to camp in the wilderness for months and physically demanding as well. That’s why many researchers, even those who have worked in the region for some time are reluctant to continue.”\nThe climate in this part of Nepal is different from the rest of the country as it lies north of the Himalayan range. The world’s highest peaks cast what’s known as a rain shadow over the region, meaning it misses out on the monsoon rains that drench the rest of the country between July and September.\n“The present findings call for more dedicated conservation actions to protect the unique biodiversity of Upper Humla,” the departments said.\nAccording to the department of wildlife, the last record of the steppe polecat in Nepal was made in 2014, when it was discovered for the first time in the Annapurna Conservation Area in 2014. “The current record represents the first live observation of the species in Nepal,” said Ramchandra Kandel, director-general of the DNPWC.\nThe findings were made during fieldwork for a joint project by the Himalayan Wolves Project and Resources Himalaya Foundation in collaboration with various government agencies.\nIndividual Pallas’s cats were first recorded in Nepal in 2012 in the Annapurna Conservation Area. “But this time, we have a family photo of the species showing two adults with a cub,” Kandel said.\nThe Eurasian lynx, meanwhile, assessed as vulnerable in Nepal, had previously only been recorded in conservation areas such as Annapurna, Shey-Phoksundo, and Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve. Although residents had reported sightings of the protected species in Humla district in 2013, the current record provides the first conclusive evidence for the species in the area, says the release.\nKusi said he’s always been fascinated by the rich biodiversity of the region. “We hope to continue our work in the future and discover more species in Nepal’s Trans-Himalayan region, especially Humla,” he told Mongabay. “We are also working on some journal articles to convey our findings.”\nBanner Image: A steppe polecat photographed in Nepal’s Limi Valley.

97	How do telltales and crescent-shaped daggerboards affect boat performance?	Telltales near the sail's luff help optimize trim performance - normally the leeward telltale should stream aft while the windward one lifts 30-45° above horizontal. The crescent-shaped daggerboard design, while allowing space in the cockpit for sleeping, maintains ideal balance and delivers remarkably light, responsive handling even in heavy winds, with the board's position carefully calculated relative to the sail's center of effort.	['Simon ‘Stir’ Fry is a world-class trimmer with wins in a huge range of classes. He shares headsail trimming and set-up tips with Andy Rice\nThe challenge of headsail trimming, according to Stir Fry, is understanding at any given moment what the team is aiming to achieve. On a busy race course, those aims are ever-changing.\nWhether you’re going for VMG speed in open water, footing through some bad chop or sheeting in hard to live in a thin lane, the trimmer needs to be in sync with the helmsman and the mainsheet trimmer for the ‘speed loop’ as well as knowing what the tactician and strategist are thinking.\nOne of the big differences, Fry believes, between a fully pro team and typical amateur race crew is the level and quality of the conversation – and headsail trimming is a key part of this communication loop.\n“Let’s say you’ve just started and you’re two minutes into the race. Five boats have popped out while three boats tacked onto port, but it looks like we need to sail on for another two minutes to open up a lane in the middle of the course,” Fry explains.\n“The tactician will say: ‘I need to live in this lane for another 45 seconds.’ Then the driver will say: ‘Okay, trimmers, just give me a little bit more sheet tension, and I’ll be happy to sail 1/10th under target speed.’ So it will be then a very, very small change in mainsheet trim and jib trim. The trimmers then respond by sheeting in and asking if that feels okay to the helmsman, and so on. It’s a constant conversation.”\nEven if it’s a very specialised role with a lot of the time looking up at the telltales, the best trimmers have a global understanding of the race course at any given moment.\n“A beautiful looking jib is not necessarily what you’re looking for at all times,” Fry points out. To understand why, read his five best tips on headsail trimming.\nCreate a comms loop\nA strong team has a strong comms loop and the trimmer plays an important role in listening and also communicating what’s needed at any given moment on the race course. There’s always an element of compromise to what the boat needs, what the mainsheet trim is doing and how the boat is being steered.\nA perfect-looking jib is not necessarily what you’re looking for, other than when you’re in perfect conditions. You’ve nearly always got other boats to think about, where tactical situations might dictate a different setup in the sails and how the helmsman is steering. This is why the comms loop is critical.\nBalance over beauty\nThe most important speed goal is for the helmsman to have a balanced rudder. Sometimes you have to contort the sail to give the boat what it needs. In very light airs sometimes you’ve got to go to extremes to make the boat go well. That might be inducing massive headstay sag and making the leech very round in the back. Then in very strong conditions it’s all about the boat being balanced and wanting to go in a straight line with minimal helm movements.\nAs [multiple world champion] Vince Brun taught us when we were kids: if a gust hits and the boat doesn’t go faster, your trim is not correct. Something needs to change to make the boat want to accelerate without the helmsman needing to do much.\nKnow your modes\nGood calibration will help you get into the right mode for the right situation. It’s about knowing how to change gears quickly and doing it in sync with the rest of the team.\nSay you want to go to a fast-forward mode, you’ll probably move the jib car outboard slightly. You might make the entry slightly blunter. On a TP52 that might mean easing the sheet 10mm – which doesn’t sound very much, but when you’re dealing with high aspect, very flat-backed jibs, it’s enough to have the boatspeed pop from 9.2 to 9.6. That’s a dramatic change.\nAlthough you won’t see such a big jump in lower performance boats, the same principles still apply.\nIf in doubt, go large\nGood headsail trimming comes from a sailor who knows what headsails they have on board and knows what the crossovers are between those sails.\nTactical considerations come into play when deciding what size of sail to use in crossover conditions. If you’re going to sail in slop, or big waves, you might need to generate a little more power through the waves, so sail with more twist and more depth. But a general rule of thumb is to set up for the lulls.\nFor example, racing on a typical day in Palma, it’s nearly always lighter at the bottom of the course than at the windward mark. So when we’re going downwind we have a discussion about what jib to choose for the next beat and, more often than not, we’ll choose the bigger option to help us get through the lulls as we come out of the leeward mark. It’s easier to depower a big sail than make a small sail bigger. So if in doubt, go large.\nMake sure you have a row of telltales near the luff to give you a clear signal about the trim of the headsail. The placement of these telltales can vary depending on the kind of the boat you’re sailing.\nSome boats you sail soft on the luff, and by using a lot of runner you can make the entry a lot finer, so the helmsman sails with the luff of the headsail lifting slightly most of the time. In this case you should have a row of telltales around 300-400mm back from the luff.\nOn most boats, your normal upwind trim will be to have the leeward telltale streaming aft, with the windward telltale lifting to somewhere between 30-45° above horizontal. If you’re going for speed and footing slightly, then telltales on both sides of the jib will be streaming aft.\nYachting World is the world’s leading magazine for bluewater cruisers and offshore sailors.

Above is the original Chappelle plan drawing shown in black lines. A couple of things are striking about the original. First is the unusual crescent shape. It’s unusual enough that I had never seen one done like that before, and the reason for this shape is both interesting and ingenious.\nThese boats were designed around the needs of a single hunter, working alone, without a motor. He needed a dry place to sleep when the wind died miles from home, and when a single hunting trip might take several days. The optimal location for the daggerboard, if it were straight, would require it to be located back in the cockpit area. But by making the board crescent shaped, the case could be moved forward out of the cockpit while still maintaining ideal balance of the boat. This gave just enough room in the cockpit for an average sized man to lay down flat for a good night’s sleep. In fact, Nathanial Bishop, in his Centennial Republic sneakbox, slept almost every night in the boat for three months, comforably. Pretty smart, those old boat builders.\nThe other interesting thing is that the boat handles so well, is so wonderfully balanced, with this configuration. Every Melonseed I’ve ever sailed using the daggerboard design is light and responsive, even in a heavy blow. It’s remarkable how well they handle, so much so that this characteristic alone may account for why these boats are still being built today. Last summer when I met Tony Thatcher for a sail in the boat he built, for instance, we sailed along in 15 mph gusts as comfortably as if it were a summer zephyr. Here’s a brief video clip from that trip:\nSo, a real challenge is to try to “improve” on this design, by adding the convenience of a centerboard, without destroying the unique handling qualities.\nIn the picture below, the red vertical line is the Center of Effort of both the original sail plan and the Crawford sail (they’re almost identical though Crawford’s sail is quite a bit larger). The blue vertical line is the CoE of the Barto sail plan, which is even larger than the Crawford rig. The red star is the Center of Lateral Resistance (CLR) of the original daggerboard. Barto’s daggerboard shape is the same, but he moves it’s location back a few inches to maintain the same relative distance between the line and the star. The CoE and CLR are just fancy terms for those two bulls pushing on a sailboat from opposite directions (see previous post).\nIn theory, a boat will sail fastest when the star and the line are lined up perfectly. Any deviation requires corrective action from the rudder to keep the boat going in a straight line, and using a rudder is like dragging your foot to steer a bicycle – it slows you down. However, in practice, having the star and the line perfectly aligned doesn’t work out so well. Having the star slightly ahead of the line turns out to work better, mostly for safety reasons. For one, if you happen to fall overboard, the wind will make the boat turn to face it like a weather vane, bringing the boat to a stop so you can climb back in. But it goes beyond that. Having a little pressure on the tiller helps the person steering feel what’s happening with the boat. But even with a little pressure on the tiller, there’s a lag between what the helmsman feels and his (and the boat’s) reaction to it. That lag can be a surprisingly critical half second.\nWhen a boat is hit by a sudden gust of wind a lot of things can go wrong – enough things that it’s the most likely moment that a boat will capsize. If the line is behind the star, as it is above, then, when a gust hits, the boat will automatically turn up into the wind slightly, reducing the force of the gust before the helmsman can even react. This effect is called Weather Helm, and it’s a good thing. If, however, the star is behind the line, that’s called Lee Helm, and that’s generally a bad thing. For one, if you fall overboard the boat will turn downwind and sail all the way to China without you. For another, when a gust hits, instead of turning into the wind and so taking some of the force out of the sail, it turns downwind, opening up even more sail to the full power of the gust. In unstable air, Lee Helm can be very hard to control – a moment of inattention can be disastrous. So, most boat designers and builders over the centuries have learned to purposely set their boats slightly out of balance to build in a little Weather Helm.\nToo much of a good thing isn’t necessarily a good thing, however. If the amount of Weather Helm is too strong, it puts a lot of stress on both the boat and the person steering it, as he or she has to use more and more pressure on the rudder to keep the boat going in a straight line. The shape of the hull adds to the effect; more so if the boat has a very broad, beamy shape. The harder the wind blows, and the farther a boat heels over, the more pressure is required to keep it in line. In an odd inverse equation, the harder the wind blows, the less speed the boat makes for the amount of effort involved. This is one reason racing boats keep a crew of moveable human ballast on board – to use weight to keep the boat from heeling over where more rudder is required to stay on course. Cape Cod Catboats, for instance, sail very badly when heeled over, and in that situation, like many boats, actually sail faster by reducing sail area so they tip back upright. (I’m simplifying a lot of things here, to keep this from getting too technical.)\nAnyway, if you’re still with me at this point, these are the concepts I’ve been dealing with while trying to design a centerboard for this boat. Generally speaking, any centerboard design will have to maintain something close to the original proportions – the size of the board and the distance between the star and the line – if it can be expected to handle as well.\nNext comes how other people have approached the same problems, and the slightly different solutions they came up with.\nmelonseed skiff, mellonseed skiff, melon seed, mellon seed']	['<urn:uuid:0b327d84-3ddb-419d-97bc-dc8515daffca>', '<urn:uuid:44cb3893-d0d5-4d21-bf1b-76e29e4d4d83>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	multi-aspect	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	9	63	2174
98	radiation balance formula glacier surface	The net radiation at a glacier surface (Q*) is calculated as: Q* = Sin – Sout + Lin – Lout, where Sin and Sout are incoming and outgoing shortwave radiation, and Lin and Lout are incoming and outgoing longwave radiation.	['[Joe is a Senior Glacier Hydrologist at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development in Kathmandu, Nepal]\nTrue fact: there have been not one but two workshops dedicated specifically to the installation of automatic weather stations (AWS) on glaciers.\nOne of the biggest unknowns in how glaciers will respond to climate change are the meteorological conditions and melt rates at the glacier surface, and how these conditions relate to data from standard observation networks and/or climate reanalysis products. But setting up precise sensors on a surface that can move, melt, and be buried by snow – sometimes all of these in the same day – is a big challenge. Unfortunately, for all challenges (including drinking milk upside down through a straw) you either learn by experience (AKA “mistakes”), or you learn from the experiences of others. For some reason I’ve tended to go with the former.\nOur recent AWS installation at Yala Glacier is another attempt to obtain a year-long record of meteorological conditions at 5350 m in the Himalayas. At this altitude, temperatures are rarely above zero and the melt of snow or ice is basically controlled by the radiation balance at the surface (see below for a more technical discussion). So our station will record radiation received and emitted or reflected by the surface, air temperature and relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and surface height changes from melt and snowfall.\nExperience tells us that ‘floating’ weather stations, such as tripods that simply sit on the top of the surface, don’t work so well on glaciers. The surface melts down unevenly, the station can be buried and damaged by heavy snowfall, and there is no way to get a record of surface lowering: the surface height sensor needs to be mounted at a fixed height in order to get information that makes any sense.\nFor the new station, we used a slick tower design that can be built up in the field (full credit to Alex Jarosch and Faron Anslow; tower recipe below or see P. 52-55 here). Essentially, we connect three 2.0 m aluminum pipes vertically to make a 6.0 m tall triangular structure. Horizontal supports brace the top 2.0 m of the tower, and the bottom 4.0 m of each leg is drilled in to the ice. If you’re going to try this at home, don’t forget to stick small plastic caps on the bottom of the pipes that go in the ice. Without these, the weight of the tower would be supported on a very small surface area and it would melt into the ice – probably due to heat conduction through the aluminum. If the tower sinks into the ice during the experiment, the surface height measurements are meaningless. (Thanks, experience!)\nOnce the base and the tower are installed and leveled, the waterproof enclosure (which contains the battery, solar charge controller, and the datalogger) and all sensors were mounted to the tower. In the time-lapse animation shown below, you can see the clouds rolling up and down over us as we mount the sensors. In response, we shed layers and then put them back on, because the thickness of the cloud layer really affects the ‘felt’ temperature at the surface (you should really read the technical explanation below). Air temperatures during the setup hovered around 0C.\nThe full installation took only half a day, and we were back drinking tea in camp by mid-afternoon (though thankfully not upside down and with straws). But getting the equipment and the tower components up there literally took a small army. We have nothing but huge gratitude and respect for Dawa Sherpa and Ngawang Sherpa who helped haul everything up the glacier, and to all the trekking agency staff who carried everything up from the trailhead at 1600 m to the basecamp at 5000 m.\n[Thanks to Maxime Litt and Desiree Treichler for their help in the field, but also for the pre-field testing and programming. This is a critical step in the recipe.]\nGlacier Station Recipe\n- 9 x 2.0 m aluminum pipe (48.25 mm OD)\n- 9 x 0.50 m aluminum pipe (48.25 mm OD)\n- 3 internal pipe connectors\n- 3 external pipe connectors\n- 3 plastic cap ends (large corks also approved)\n- 18 x 90 degree joints (48.25 mm OD)\n- Ice auger (4-5 m)\n- Plumber’s level\n- AWS components and all mounting hardware (!)\n- Reasonably good weather\n- Preparation, preparation, preparation\nRadiation Balance Details\nThe net radiation at the surface (Q*) can be calculated from incoming and outgoing shortwave and longwave radiation:\nQ* = Sin – Sout + Lin – Lout\nShortwave radiation comes from the sun: its highest at solar noon, and zero at night. But the amount of radiation reaching the surface depends on clouds and the atmospheric conditions, and the amount of shortwave radiation absorbed at the surface depends on the reflectivity (or albedo) of the surface. Brighter surfaces reflect more radiation, and have a higher albedo, which means less energy available for melt.\nLongwave radiation is a mainly function of temperature: incoming longwave radiation is emitted by the atmosphere, and the earth’s surface emits longwave radiation upwards. Temperatures near the surface will be warmer on cloudy nights because the clouds both (a) emit greater longwave radiation towards the surface than a clear sky and (b) trap some of the longwave radiation emitted by the ground. Incoming longwave radiation is also a function of water vapour in the atmosphere, which affects the temperature profile.']	['<urn:uuid:04295dd7-e290-4749-a70e-f73c0ef00610>']	factoid	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	5	40	917
99	What specific information must I include when notifying neighbors about spraying?	You must notify neighbors about the chemical to be sprayed, method of application (ground or air), pest being controlled, name of application service if using a custom applicator, and any specific concerns that may be important, like bee safety.	['| ||Notification guidelines | Rights and responsibilities\nThis information is intended for producers that are hiring custom pesticide applicators or performing their own pesticide applications.\nAny pesticide drift onto adjacent areas is not only a waste of money but can be a potential hazard to neighbours’ crops, houses, dugouts, pastures and gardens. Some hazards may not be visible until spray equipment is too close to prevent damage or exposure.\nNotification that pesticides, such as insecticides, fungicides or herbicides are to be applied creates the opportunity to identify and resolve problems prior to spraying. Notification is not seeking permission to spray. Farmers have the legal right to apply pesticides on their property. Notification is simply a good neighbour policy that helps eliminate potential risks.\nAdjacent landowners can adjust their practices and schedules to accommodate spraying. For example, livestock and beehives might possibly be moved or otherwise protected. Residents can plan to be away from the area if they choose, or ensure that they remain inside houses with their windows closed while spraying is in progress. If there are additional concerns, farmers or their custom applicators can adjust application practices to prevent problems.\nRights and Responsibilities\n- Contact any landowners immediately adjacent to a field that is to be sprayed. Priority should be given to land parcels with residences but other land parcels should not be ignored in case they have sensitive crops, beehives, new shelterbelt plantings, or other hazards that may not be immediately obvious.\n- Provide notification 48 to 72 hours in advance (if possible). Persons receiving notification should be advised that, due to weather or drift management considerations, spraying might be delayed. For sensitive situations, arrangements can be made for notification after a delay has occurred.\n- Notify neighbours of the chemical that will be sprayed, the method of application (ground or air), the pest being controlled, the name of the application service if a custom applicator has been hired, and any specific concerns that may be important, e.g. bee safety.\n- Try to have neighbours identify any potential hazards that you or your custom applicator will need to factor into spraying decisions. For a high hazard situation on one side of a field, you may want to spray when a light breeze is blowing away from this area.\n- For additional information to help address concerns prior to spraying, consult the pesticide manufacturer. Most pesticide labels will identify toll-free information lines provided by pesticide manufacturers. If you are using a custom applicator, the applicator can provide required telephone numbers or discuss precautions with your neighbour.\nProducers have the legal right to apply pesticides on their property provided that the pesticide application does not contravene any by-laws, regulations, or generally accepted practices. Producers have the legal responsibility to ensure that any pesticide application performed on their property does not cause harm to adjacent properties or people. When using custom applicators, ensuring that applications are conducted by a qualified service that is legally registered to perform pesticide application is the first step in meeting producer responsibility. The second step is ensuring that the applicator is aware of potential hazards in advance of an application. Producers may be held accountable for compensation to adjacent landowners if pesticide damage occurs.\nNotification is about cooperation and mutual respect. If a neighbour has concerns, the neighbour should be willing to work with the producer to a mutually satisfactory solution. Most people are cooperative and will have reasonable suggestions. Neighbours who are less cooperative and see notification as “permissioning” can be reminded of the producer’s legal right to spray.\nThis information has been developed and supported by:\nThe article Pesticide Notification may also be of assistance.\nFor more information, contact Jock McIntosh']	['<urn:uuid:b9d077c7-dc90-49b7-bc3e-8e0094790099>']	factoid	with-premise	concise-and-natural	similar-to-document	single-doc	expert	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	11	39	617

Users can access information by geography, state, and even county levels, with data available for recent crop years through 2017 and 2018. The database has an intuitive interface that allows users to select specific data fields, and the information can be easily downloaded in spreadsheet form for further analysis.	['For many Ag-&-Food entrepreneurs, telling a compelling story about the magnitude of their innovation, and the size of the value chain segments they can transform, is essential to their ability to recruit investment, talent, and partners or collaborators in pursuing their innovation. In a data-driven world, there is no substitute for doing the homework to help paint a comprehensive picture.\nFortunately, there is a wealth of free data sources available on our global Ag-&-Food ecosystem that entrepreneurs and innovators can use to help quantify the magnitude of their innovation. This article summarizes a few of these sources that entrepreneurs can utilize to build a comprehensive picture of the value chain segments relevant to their unique business ambitions.\nThe Global Food Value Chain\nOur world’s food system represents one of the most extensive global value chains, feeding nearly 8 billion people on a daily basis. Within this value chain, many existing suppliers, retailers, growers, producers, processors and service providers participate and contribute value at multiple points, representing multiple trillions of dollars of annual production, processing, and consumption.\nInnovation in agriculture and food technologies offers the promise of transforming the productivity, efficiency, nutritional value and sustainability of individual segments of this value chain. Countless opportunities exist throughout this complex value chain where innovators and entrepreneurs can offer unique solutions. For an entrepreneur to tell a compelling story about their specific innovation, it’s important to be able to relate how their innovation fits in a larger value chain - who are their customers, who are their suppliers, and what existing providers would they be assisting or displacing as a result of their innovation? Putting magnitudes on the size of these value chain segments is a first step, but also important considerations are developing trends, over what timeframes, geographies and other segmentation.\nGlobal Ag-&-Food Data\nThe comprehensive source for globally-comparable data across countries or regions is the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO). The UN FAO offers an ‘FAO STAT’ interface on their FAOSTAT website (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data) that offers comprehensive searchable data and statistics on animal and crop production (quantity), value of agricultural production, volume of inputs (fertilizer and pesticide use), land area, commodity pricing, imports and exports by country, etc. over a range of timelines. The data sets are updated annually with the most-recent comprehensive data available through 2016. Anyone can access the information and select from a range of factors to customize the domain and range of data, geographies, and timeline to align with the specific question of interest, and the information can easily be downloaded from the site in spreadsheet form for further analysis and presentation. Examples of the types of UN FAO information that can be extracted are shown below:\nEU Ag-&-Food Data\nAt a more-regional level, crop production information can be extracted from regional governmental organizations such as EuroStat (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database), with data on production and trade by crop, geography, with values in production quantity, value, area, and yield), and with data from as recent as the 2019 crop year. The extensive EuroStat database can be navigated through a unique click-through navigation tree to identify the specific domain of interest (e.g., ‘Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries’), and then the user can open a Data Explorer to select the specific data values, geographies, and timescales of interest. Extensive data on organic production and other themes is also available.\nUS Ag-&-Food Data\nFor United States data, a comprehensive picture can be extracted from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Quickstats database (https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/), with data available on animal and crop production quantity, value, acreage, chemical and fertilizer use, and a variety of other data values, by geography, state, and even county levels, for crop years as current as 2017 and 2018. The QuickStats data-selection interface is relatively intuitive, allowing the user to select the specific data fields, and showing additional data fields as relevant to what the user has already selected. (For example, some data is only available on a periodic ‘sampled’ basis. For comprehensive data, select ‘Census’ rather than ‘Survey’). For example, sometimes county-level data is available for specific data values, and for other selected data fields, it is not. Data values can be as recent as the 2019 crop year for some selected data values, while for others, data is available only through 2018 or 2017. When selecting data by state or county, the user can select the specific state, states, or counties of interest, or simply let QuickStats return all of the available data for that specific selection to identify which states/geographies are relevant. QuickStats data can easily be downloaded from the web interface in spreadsheet form for further refinement or analysis.\nExamples of the kinds of data that are available through QuickStats include the following:\nOften, more-specific information on individual states or commodities, including export and trade values, can be found on individual state agriculture department websites, such as the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) website (https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/statistics/). The CDFA site includes comprehensive reports by crop year with extensive information by crop and county-level data going back many decades, but the information is published in a static form that often requires manual effort to tabulate and correlate into time series. Fortunately, much of this state and county-level data is available from the USDA QuickStats site in a more searchable form.\nTrade Association Data\nInformation on specific food-industry topics can also often be found by looking at websites of specific commodity or industry-associations, that provide public information and advocate for their particular agricultural commodity or industry segment. For example, the Plant-Based Foods Association (https://plantbasedfoods.org/) has a wealth of information on consumers (https://plantbasedfoods.org/marketplace/consumer-insights/), and industry sales trends (https://plantbasedfoods.org/marketplace/retail-sales-data/) that can be leveraged to educate audiences and investors about trends relevant to entrepreneurs in those industry segments.\nCommodity Board Data\nMany individual crop commodities in the country and in California have a state-chartered commodity board advocating on behalf of that commodity, and making public information available on their crop as part of their advocacy. For example, an excellent example of this is the California Almond Board, which publishes a wealth of statistical information on their website (https://www.almonds.com/growers/resources/almond-almanac-industry-stats), covering production, farms, acreage, inventories, exports and trade, as well as sustainability topics and industry marketing efforts globally. Annual almanacs going back several years are available, for constructing time-series data.\nWith such a wealth of data available, innovators and entrepreneurs should take advantage of these resources. A few hours spent to capture and represent the most up-to-date information on their industry or value-chain segment, and how their innovation might save costs, improve efficiency, reduce inputs or improve sustainability, would be well-spent to enable entrepreneurs to present their businesses as knowledgeably and professionally as they can to prospective customers, partners, employees, and investors.\nAbout the Author: John Selep is the Co-Founder and President of the AgTech Innovation Alliance, the 501(c)3 non-profit behind AgStart.']	['<urn:uuid:e23b897b-15db-4f23-a169-2accc10aa85e>']	open-ended	with-premise	short-search-query	similar-to-document	single-doc	novice	2025-05-13T00:07:03.799074	6	73	1138
